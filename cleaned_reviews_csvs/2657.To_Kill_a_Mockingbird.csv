0,61365731,06/28/2009,5,"To Kill a Mockingbird, Harper LeeTo Kill a Mockingbird one of the best-loved stories of all time, is a novel by Harper Lee published in 1960. It was immediately successful, winning the Pulitzer Prize, and has become a classic of modern American literature. The plot and characters are loosely based on Lee's observations of her family, her neighbors and an event that occurred near her hometown of Monroeville, Alabama, in 1936, when she was 10 years old. The story is told by the six-year-old Jean Louise Finch.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز بیست و هشتم از ماه آوریل سال1994میلادیعنوان: کشتن مرغ مینا؛ نویسنده: هارپر لی؛ مترجم: فخرالدین میررمضانی، تهران، توس، سال1370، در378ص؛ چاپ دیگر تهران، امیرکبیر، سال1390، در414ص؛ شابک9789640013816؛ چاپ دیگر: تهران، علمی فرهنگی، سال1393، در378ص؛ شابک978600121573؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده20ممترجم دیگر: بابک تیموریان، تهران، ناس، سال1390، در504ص، شابک9789649917733؛مترجم دیگر: روشنک ضرابی، تهران، انتشارات میلکان، سال1394، در360ص، شابک9786007845196؛باور کردنی نیست، تا روز بیست و هشتم ماه دسامبر سال2015میلادی یا همان روز هشتم دیماه سال1395هجری خورشیدی، تنها در گودریدز بیش از سه میلیون کاربر همین کتاب را ستاره باران کرده اند؛ در تاریخ ششم ماه فوریه سال2020میلادی برابر با روز هفدهم ماه بهمن سال1398هجری خورشیدی این تعداد به4,184,604؛ مورد رسیده است؛ «مرغ مینا» پرنده‌ ای کوچک است، که توان تقلید صدا دارد، «مرغ مقلد» هم، صدای پرندگان دیگر را تقلید میکند؛ کتاب «کشتن مرغ مقلد»، نوشته ی بانوی روانشاد «هارپر لی»، که با عنوان: «کشتن مرغ مینا» در «ایران» منتشر شده، نخستین بار در جهان در سال1960میلادی، به نشر سپرده شد، یکسال بعد، جایزه ی پولیتزر را برد؛ در سال1962میلادی نیز، «رابرت مولیگان»، فیلمی با اقتباس از متن همین کتاب ساختند، و در همان سال، ایشان هم توانستند، سه جایزه اسکار را، از آن خود کنند؛ فیلم جایزه ی بهترین بازیگر مرد را برای «گریگوری پک»، و جایزه های بهترین کارگردان هنری، و بهترین فیلمنامه ی اقتباس شده را، از آن خود کرد؛ بد نیست بیفزایم، خانم «هارپر لی»، تا یک دو سال مانده به پایان عمر پرفروغ خویش، تنها همین رمان را نوشته بودند، براساس واگویه ای از ایشان، بنوشته اند (در عصری که همه ی مردمان «لپ ‌تاپ»، «موبایل»، و «آی پاد» دارند، اما ذهنهاشان، همچون یک اتاق، خالیه؛ ترجیح میدهم، وقتم را با کتابهایم سپری کنم.) پایان نقلایشان در سال2007میلادی نیز، نشان آزادی را، از دست «رئیس جمهور آمریکا»، دریافت کردند؛ نقل از متن کتاب: (حواستون باشه کشتن مرغ مقلد گناهه؛ این را برای نخستین بار از «اتیکاس» شنیدم، که انجام کاری گناه داره، واسه همین هم به خانوم «مودی» گفتم؛ اون هم جواب داد پدرت درست گفته، مرغ مقلد، هیچکار نمیکنه، تنها برایمان میخونه، تا لذت ببریم؛ با تمام وجودش هم برامون میخونه؛ واسه همین هم کشتنش گناه داره) پایان نقل هشدار: اگر کتاب را میخواهید بخوانید، از خوانش چکیده، پرهیز کنید چکیده: «اسکات» و «جیم»، خواهر و برادر کوچکی هستند، که مادرشان سالها پیش از درب این سرای فانی بگذشته است، آن دو با پدرشان «اتیکاش»، در شهر کوچکی زندگی میکنند؛ پدر وکیل شهر هستند، و برای انسانیت، و باورهای مردمان احترام میگذارند؛ ایشان هماره کوشش میکند تا فرزندانش را انسان بار آورد؛ داستان از زبان کودک، و به زیبایی روایت میشود، قرار است یک سیاهپوست به نام: «تام»، به جرم تجاوز به دختری سفیدپوست، محاکمه شود، در حالیکه معلوم است، «تام» آن کار را نکرده است، و «آتیکوس» میخواهد، از ایشان دفاع کند، مردمان شهر، بر علیه «آتیکوس» هستند، و ایشان به عنوان یک پدر، میخواهند فرزندانش، در شرایط دشوار درست رفتار کنند؛تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 18/05/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 19/09/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی",707,0.34,0.016,0.961,0.022,0.4484330484330484,POSITIVE,0.9995

I smell the smoke of fireplaces and think about hot cider and the wind catches and my breath is taken from me and I bundle my coat tighter against me and lift my head to the sky, no clouds, just a stunning blue that hurts my eyes, another deep breath and I have this feeling that all is okay. Why? Why this memory? I mean, this takes place in Alabama and mostly in the summer, well there is that one climatic scene on Halloween, but I bet it’s still hot enough to melt the balls off a brass monkey. It must be the school thing, my daughter just finished reading it, prompting me to give it another go, to fall back into Scout’s world and pretend to be eight and let life simply be. How is that? How can life for Scout be simple? I mean, she lives in the south, during the depression, she has to deal with ignorant schoolteachers and town folk, her ideas of what is right, what is what it should be are laughed at by her schoolmates… man, and I thought my childhood was rough. Still, she lives in this idyllic town, I mean, except for the racism and the creepy neighbors and the whole fact that it’s, you know, the south…(forgive me… I’m not immune to the downfalls of the north, I mean, we had witches and well, Ted Bundy was born here…) But, there’s this sense of childlike innocence to this book that makes me believe in humanity… even in the throes of evil. What am I saying here? I guess, that this is a good pick me up. What I also get from this book is that I have severe Daddy issues. I consume Atticus Finch in unnatural ways. He is the ultimate father; he has the perfect response for every situation. He is the transcendent character. My heart melts at each sentence devoted to him and I just about crumble during the courtroom scene. Am I gushing? I sure am. I was raised by a man who thought that Budweiser can artwork was the epitome of culture. That drinking a 6-pack was the breakfast of champions. That college was for sissies. He could throw out a racial slur without a single thought, care or worry to who was around. I won't even get into the debates/rantings of a 16 yr old me vs a 42 yr old him... What a role model. So, I thank Harper Lee for giving me Atticus. I can cuddle up with my cider and pretend that I’m basking in his light. I can write this blurb that makes sense to maybe a handful but that is okay, I am approved of and all is good. ",1277,0.9019,0.082,0.812,0.107,0.5536315536315536,POSITIVE,0.6261

3,1599404223,04/03/2016,5,"With endless books and infinitely more to be written in the future, it is rare occasion that I take the time to reread a novel. As women’s history month is upon us (2019), I have kept revising my monthly lineup to feature books by remarkable women across the spectrum. Yet, none of these nonfiction books pay homage to the writers of the books themselves. Even with memoirs, the prose focuses on the author’s achievements in her chosen field. Last week a goodreads friend and I paid tribute to women authors in a daily literary journal. In one of my friend’s posts, she pointed out that as recently as 1960, the author of the most endearing of American novels had to use a masculinized version of her name in fear of not being published. Nelle Harper Lee of Monroeville, Alabama published To Kill a Mockingbird under her middle name, so only those well read readers are aware of the author’s full name. It is in this regard, that I included Pulitzer and Presidential Medal of Freedom winner Nelle Harper Lee in my Women’s History month lineup. It is as auspicious of a time as any to reread one of America’s greatest novels. When I was in ninth grade English class, I read Harper Lee’s novel for the first time. At age fourteen I was hardly a polished writer and struggled with many of the assignments. Yet, I do remember that the top essay in the class focused on the overarching theme of courage and how Harper Lee showed how each of the characters, major and minor, embodied this trait in the trying times associated with the novel. It was courageous of a southern woman to write a novel with this subject matter prior to the passage of the civil rights act. It is of little wonder to me looking back now that she chose to publish under a gender neutral name. Perhaps, she feared a lynch mob or being outcast in her home town. It was a trying time as the federal government asserted itself against states still grieving from the war between the states and holding out as the last bulwarks of white superiority. Harper Lee exhibited as much courage as the characters in her novel, and rightfully was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for her work. As such, being courageous starts from the top and works its way down to each and every character of this timeless work. In 1930s rural Maycomb, Alabama people were pretty much set in their way of life. Town folk had received an education and worked as lawyers, doctors, bankers, and businessmen. The country folk may or may not have received an education because they had to work the fields and many were illiterate. Even the majority of those educated white folk still saw themselves as superior to blacks, and few, if any, had the audacity to take a black’s word over a white’s even if it were the correct moral thing to do. Yet, the crux of Lee’s novel is a court case threatening to disrupt this way of life, having the town divide along both racial and moral lines, and having each character step into others’ shoes and view the world from another’s perspective. Maycomb at the time embodied many rural American cities, isolated from progress as town set in its ways with few people who were willing to see the world from another perspective. One man was, however, a lawyer named Atticus Finch who is among the most revered fictional characters ever created. Even though this court case should not have been his, his superiors selected Atticus to counsel a black defendant because they realized that he was the one man in Maycomb who had both the ability to empathize and the courage to do so. His neighbor Mrs Maudie Atkinson noted that Atticus was the same man in the court house as he was at home and had nothing to fear. A widower, he instilled these values to his children Jeremy Atticus (Jem) and Jean Louise (Scout) from a young age, passing a strong moral compass onto his children. In addition to critiquing southern race relations, Lee’s novel has endeared itself to children with the legend of Boo Radley. From the time they were young, Jem, Scout, and their summer friend Dill had courage to go to the Radley house trying to get Boo to come out even though all the other kids said the house was spooked. Atticus told them to put a halt to these childish games and explained Boo Radley’s background to them. The town claimed that Boo Radley was a ghost, but perhaps the reason he did not leave the house is because he did not want to. As the children grew older, Atticus warned them that there would be darker times ahead and they would have to be courageous in the face of what people said to them behind their backs. From the time Scout began school in first grade, she inhibited Atticus’ ability to stand up for what was right. Her teacher Miss Robinson was new to Maycomb and did not understand people’s ways. Scout explained about the Cunninghams, the Ewells, as well as other families at a personal cost to herself. As Scout grew older and was able to step into other people’s’ shoes more, she grew to understand differences between folks; however, she and Jem realized that differences did not make the world distinctly black and white or right and wrong. During an era when children were looked upon as unintelligent, Scout and Jem were wise beyond their years and following in their father’s footsteps. Harper Lee created strong archetypal characters and had each embody their own courage. Each’s courage allowed Atticus to teach his children a life lesson that would endure for the rest of their lives. The family’s neighbor Mrs. Henry Lafayette DuBose demonstrates courage as she battles a final illness. Third grade teacher Mrs. Gates exhibits courage as she teaches Scout’s class about the rise of Nazism in Germany and th encourages her students to think for themselves about the differences between prejudices at home and abroad. The African American characters all demonstrate strong courage as well. The Finch’s housekeeper Calpurnia is a bridge between the white and black communities of Maycomb and does not hesitate to teach Scout and Jem life lessons as they arise. The Reverend Sykes welcomes Jem and Scout into his congregation as though they were his own and invites them to sit in the colored balcony at time when segregation was still the law. He risked a lynching and knew that the Finch family could possibly be labeled as negro lovers, yet Reverend Sykes played a small role in proving that one’s skin color should not determine whether someone is right or wrong. Of course, as part of the overarching story line, Boo Radley can be viewed as the most courageous character of them all. It is through the courage of an author to create characters who will stand up for what is morally right at a large cost to themselves that she created an award winning novel that was ahead of its time for its era. It is little wonder that the courage of these fictional characters has made the novel as beloved as it is today. I believe that the courage exhibited by all these characters has made the town of Maycomb, Alabama stand the test of time and remain the timeless classic that it is. Most people can relate to those who have the courage to stand up for what they think is right or to fight against those tougher than them. This character trait has endeared the Finch family to millions of readers and will continue to do so for generations to come. Whenever a person asks what book would you give as a gift or what is the perfect book, To Kill a Mockingbird is my first choice. I find that it is perfect for any time but most appropriate in spring as in addition to courage there is an underlying theme of hope. Harper Lee won the Pulitzer for this timeless classic, and it also won first place in the Great American Read as America’s best novel. Thus I can think of no better way to honor women’s history month than with a timeless book that has and will continue to capture the hearts and minds of all of its readers. 5+ stars/ all-time favorites shelf",528,0.9995,0.043,0.803,0.154,0.4210919756571928,POSITIVE,0.9819
4,445965832,10/31/2012,5,"In the course of 5 years, I’ve read this book nearly 17 times. That adds up to reading it once at least every 4 months, on an average. And I still return to this book like a bark seeking a lighthouse in the dark. When I first finished it, I was so overwhelmed by how much I related to it, I read it nearly 8 times before the year ended. By now I’ve memorized almost every scene and I still can’t shake off the feeling that I still have to learn a lot from it. Over the years, I realize that without knowing it, it has become my personal Bible – a beacon to keep me from straying from the path of kindness and compassion, no matter what.With its baseless cruelty and what Coleridge poetically referred to as motiveless malignity, the world is in need of much motiveless kindness – a rugged determination to keep the world a quiet haven and not the callous, cruel place it constantly aspires to be.To Kill A Mockingbird is one of those rare books that doesn’t give in to the belief that ”deep down, everybody’s actually good.” Not everybody is. And we must still persevere to see things from their perspective, and though we may not justify their ways, we must strive to understand them – though we might not follow them, we must try to be as kind to them as possible. And yet, there comes a time when some people need to be put down – we must follow the call of our conscience then, and yet be kind to them in the process, as much as we can.Striving to follow this dictum, I have realized how difficult it is to be kind to others when I find I’m right. It is so easy to put down others bluntly, it is so easy to be critical and fair, but so difficult to consider for a moment what the other might be going through. How convenient it is to dismiss the hardships of others and say, “They had it coming!” and unburden our conscience of the probable guilt that perhaps we’ve been a bit too harsh.How simple it is to stereotype people, classify them neatly into convenient square boxes and systematically deal with them based on those black-or-white prejudices! Robe a prejudice in the opaque, oppressive garment called Common Sense and display boldly the seal of Social Approval and you’ve solved the biggest difficulty of life – knowing how to treat people.And yet, nothing could be farther than the truth. Rarely are people so simple as they seem. In Wilde’s words, “The pure and simple truth is rarely pure and never simple.” For you never know when a grumpy, rude, racist Mrs. Dubose might be fighting her own monsters or Ewell be, in fact trying to protect the last vestiges of honor he has, or Aunt Alexandra only trying to advocate the least painful way of life. And though we might not agree with any of them, like Atticus, we must see them for their peculiar situations and grant them a little leeway, make a little corner for them too, and yet, stand up for what is right in defiance of them.It is this tricky rope-walking balance between prejudice and common sense, kindness and firmness, and justice and leeway that spurs me to revisit this little book every time I seem to falter. While I find it difficult to keep my cool in the midst of flagrant injustices and ensuing pain, I strive to strike a balance between giving in to despair and becoming too optimistic; between becoming indifferent, unkind, righteous and being compassionate, considerate. It is what keeps me from becoming paranoid or cynical with the unceasing drone of passivity, callousness, overwhelming prejudice and unyielding customs while still being alive to the pain of those very people I do not necessarily agree with.In a country like India with its bizarre, incomprehensible equations and sequestrations of religion, class, caste, region, language, race, gender, sexuality and education, it takes a whole load of effort not to blow up one’s mind – people will kill each other over anything and everything. They’ll hate each other, isolate each other and cook up stories amongst themselves and leave it floating in the air. It takes every ounce of my energy not to hate my land and its majority people viciously. Yes, viciously.But you see, I’ve got so much to learn to survive here – I have to stand up for myself when there will be hordes banging upon my door telling me to shut the hell up. And I’ll have to muster all the courage I have to tell them to go f*** themselves if they think I musn’t transcend the limits set for me. But I also have to learn not to hate them. Even if it sounds silly.I know for one, Lee – I don’t care if you never wrote another work. I don’t care if Capote helped you write it, as many say. I’m glad somebody wrote this book, and somebody assigned this book as syllabus when I needed it the most. Five years ago, I hadn’t even heard of it. I read it in a single sitting. And then I read it several times over, taking my time, pondering over every page. I still do so. It is my favorite book ever.",476,-0.8198,0.127,0.746,0.127,0.5903540903540903,POSITIVE,0.9895
5,2018298597,06/03/2017,1,"/// gentle reminder that this is not the time to read this book ///This is my first re-read of 2017, and I don't regret it one bit. When I first read this book three years ago, I really liked it. Sadly, I didn't write my thoughts down in an elaborate way back in the day, but I know for sure, that I didn't read critically then. Upon my re-read of this book, I honestly don't have good things to say. I am aware that some of my criticism is not a critique of the book itself, but about its perception, and how it is, up to this day, held up as the one true book about race relations in the United States of America.And that really infiruates me. This book was written by a white woman, from a white perspective, about white characters, for a white audience. This book is a pat on the back for the white middle class. This book gives comfort to the white middle class. Comfort that they, especially back in the 1960s, didn't need, and allow me to be so bold, didn't deserve. Harper Lee's focus is purely white. While the white characters in this book are the subjects, who take action into their own hands, who suffer and make sacrifices, the black characters in this book are objects. They have little to no agency. Things happen to them. They are harmless, defenseless, and just there – waiting for the white knight hero, Atticus Finch, to save them. This book is a disgrace in the face of the black liberation movements that existed back in the day, and the solidarity within black communities. Black people stood up for themselves and fought for their rights, and only due to their voices, their protests, their sit-ins, their marches, their demonstrations, their conferences, was racial segregation made unconstitutional in the United States.Black people, back then and now, know that Atticus Finch doesn't exist. And because no one put in better words than the one and only James Baldwin, I will quote a passage from one of his amazing interviews on the Dick Cavett Show in 1968. One could say that this is Baldwin's response to the cry of ""not all white people"": James Baldwin: I don't know what most white people in this country feel. But I can only conclude what they feel from the state of their institutions. I don't know if white Christians hate Negroes or not, but I know we have a Christian church which is white and a Christian church which is black. That says a great deal for me about a Christian nation. [...] I don't know whether the labor unions and their bosses really hate me - that doesn't matter - but I know I'm not [allowed] in their union. I don't know whether the real estate lobby has anything against black people, but I know the real estate lobby is keeping me in the ghetto. I don't know if the board of education hates black people, but I know the textbooks they give my children to read and the schools we have to go to. Now, this is the evidence. You want me to make an act of faith, risking myself, my wife, my woman, my sister, my children on some idealism which you assure me exists in America, which I have never seen.This right here is what I'm talking about. To Kill A Mockingbird plays into this idealism. Although the book touches on the horrors of racism in the Deep South, it’s a strangely comforting read. A terrible injustice is done, but at the end the status quo is reassuringly restored. The final message is that most (white) people are nice when you get to know them. As a reader you are never allowed to feel with Tom Robinson, the black man who is innocently convicted for raping a white woman, because all the black characters in this tale are sidelined. This story should be about them, because how else would you be able to convince the white moderate (in the 1960s) that black people are actually people. The closest insight we get to a black character is the family's cook Calpurnia. Calpurnia is in the fictional tradition of the ""happy black"", the contented slave – the descendent of the ever-loyal Mammy in Gone With the Wind. And the rest of the black community is depicted as a group of simple, respectful folk – passive and helpless and all touchingly grateful to Atticus Finch – the white saviour. We never see any of them angry or upset. We never see the effect of Tom Robinson’s death on his family up close – we don't witness Helen, Tom's wife, grieving and Scout never wonders about his children. Their distress is kept at safe distance from the reader.I was very angry after finishing this book, and I'm still angry up to this day. Not necessarily at Harper Lee, but at our society as a whole, and at our educational system. Why do we constantly uplift white narratives, whilst brushing over marginalized ones? Why aren't our kids reading If Beale Street Could Talk by James Baldwin – a book dealing with the exact same topic (a black man getting falsely accused of raping a woman)? Why isn't Lorraine Hansberry required reading? Why are we still relying on white narratives, when talking about black people and their struggles?Since finishing this book, I started reading The History of Legal Education in the United States and I wanted to share some interesting facts, because I couldn't believe how absurd To Kill A Mockingbird was. This story is, supposedly, set in the Deep South in the 1930s, where Atticus Finch, our white saviour, takes it upon himself to defend a black man at court. By the end of Lee's novel we are led to believe that Atticus had a great chance of actually getting Tom Robinson acquitted, if the latter had just been a ""good nigger"" and didn't try to escape on his own. (Yes, I'm a little petty. I swear, I'm not turning bitter over this.) So, I just wanted to know how realistic that scenario is. All of the information is related to the 1930s Southern setting. Here's what I've learned:Most Southern lawyers readily accepted black clients for routine economic cases – property, tort, contract, dept, insurance – and minor criminal cases that did not threaten the South's system of racial hierarchy. It was virtually impossible, however, to find a Southern white lawyer who would accept a major criminal case involving a white victim or a politically charged case that in any way challenged segregation. Only the combination of direct action, community organizing and legal strategy with the help of black lawyers, made the defense of black men and women at court possible. In the Lockett-case, the black community in Tulsa survived largely because black lawyers were able to defend the community's interests. In 1934, black lawyers represented George Crawford, a black man accused of brutally murdering a wealthy white woman – no white lawyer would take Crawford's case. In the end, Crawford got a sentence of life imprisonment instead of a death sentence. And this verdict had to be seen as an accomplishment by the black lawyers and the black community as a whole, because life imprisonment was as good as it was going to get. Oftentimes, black lawyers took serious criminal cases without a fee or at a very reduced rate. This was well appreciated by their communities, but also a given. It is admirable how well black communities were organized. None of that got translated on the pages of Lee's novel. The black characters do absolutely nothing, except sending Atticus food, because they're so grateful. [*insert snort here*]This book appears to uphold the standard of racial equality; de facto it is about the white middle class patting themselves on the back for not thinking racist thoughts. I'm sorry to break it to you, Miss Maudie, but you won't get a sugar cookie for that. I am not saying that this is not a realistic portrayal of the white middle class, it is, it totally is. If you do just a little research on the Civil Rights movement, the moral apathy of the white middle class becomes crystal clear. However, we shouldn't portray these characters in a positive light, there is nothing admirable about them. After all... He who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it. He who accepts evil without protesting against is really cooperating with it.- Martin Luther King, Jr.",455,-0.7865,0.134,0.725,0.141,0.4111740420073752,POSITIVE,0.9766

7,9045520,11/13/2007,5,"“Until I feared I would lose it, I never loved to read. One does not love breathing.”(p. 20)I love this book and this idea of reading being like breathing. As Scout did, I read early too, and often. Every night before bed I would read and still do. I saw a Twilight Zone Episode once where the main character loved to read and only wanted to be left alone to do so. After falling asleep in the vault of the bank where he worked, he awoke to a post-disaster world where only he was left. He busily gathered together all the books he wanted to read, all organized and stacked up. Just as he chose one to start with, his glasses fell and he stepped on them trying to find them. It was terrible and I remember feeling horrified that this man would never get to read again! Such a thought had never occurred to me. This semester I had to get glasses myself after suffering migraines from reading. I was so nervous at the eye doctor because the thought of not being able to read was too much for me. Of course, I only needed readers, but when I ran across this quote, I thought about how much like breathing reading is for me. “Simply because we were licked a hundred years before we started is no reason for us not to try to win.” (p. 87)Never say die! Fight the good fight no matter what! I love the anti-defeatist message in this quote. Even though Atticus knows the deck is stacked against him, he tries anyway. He understands that sometimes you have to fight the un-winnable fight just for the chance that you might win. It makes me think that what he’s trying to teach his children is never to give up just because things look dim. “...before I can live with other folks I've got to live with myself. The one thing that doesn't abide by majority rule is a person's conscience.” (p. 120)As Shakespeare said, “To thine own self be true.” That’s really all that matters. At the end of the day, when you lay down, you have to know that you did the right things, acted the right way and stayed true to yourself. Again, Atticus understands that the town is talking; he has to explain to his kids why he continues against the tide of popular thought. He sums it up so well here.“We never put back into the tree what we took out of it: we had given him nothing, and it made me sad.”(p. 320) I love the sad way this quote sounds. It is clearly the thoughts of a child, for hadn’t Scout just given Boo his dignity as they were walking home? Hadn’t she and Jem given him children to care for and watch over? But she knows too, even from her child’s perspective, that they could never give him anything close to what he had given them—their lives. It just sounds so beautifully sad.Works Cited Lee, Harper.

He lost, but he'd done his best.That last paragraph is a lie. Atticus belonged to the KKK, thought that Blacks were a distinctly lower form of human life and that separate development (ie. apartheid) was the best way to go for these childlike people who didn't have the reasoning power to rule, he said in Go Set a Watchman.That last paragraph is mostly a lie. Atticus did belong to the KKK but he did not really think Blacks were a lower form of human life at all. That was just what he said for the benefit of others. He really thought their intellectual power and ability to organise was greatly to be feared. He was frightened that Whites would have to give up having a life of ease and wealth structured around the cheap labour Black people had no alternative but to provide. He didn't even want to have to consider them at all.Atticus represented the accused Black rapist only because if a White lawyer didn't then he was sure the NAACP would send in a very clever Black lawyer and not only that but insist, since these times were officially 'free', that Black people sit on the jury. Then he would not be sure of a conviction. The Blacks then feeling their oats would move in to the town and start demanding rights and power much to the detriment of the extremely exploitative and racist Whites.When Harper Lee wrote all this, in Go Set a Watchman her publishers were apparently horrified and got her to rewrite the book from the point of view of a decent man who felt racism was a great evil, we were all equal. Is this why Harper Lee never wrote another book? Did she feel that her views were unacceptable and she wasn't going to kow-tow to some liberal publishers up North who didn't understand the ways of the South? Is that why she didn't give interviews too? She'd followed the advice of her publishers, been lauded and rewarded but humiliated as an artist. Schools still teaching this book as a moral lesson should incorporate their understanding of the first draft, Go Set a Watchman. Otherwise they are doing the children a disservice in their moral education and furthering the ideas of paternalism is better than self-determination, racism had its softer side and that ignoring the truth (Watchman) to tell a good story is a perfectly fine concept for educationalists to embrace. It's not. Five stars because it is a very well-written and enjoyable book and hangs together with Go Set a Watchman perfectly.Read years ago, probably about 1 Jan 2000",287,0.4984,0.134,0.729,0.136,0.460300925925926,NEGATIVE,0.9999
9,2372257137,04/27/2018,4,"A short, important, and powerful classic that deserved all its fame.This will be a short review, there’s nothing else I can talk about here that hasn’t been discussed for the past 50 years and more.Racism, prejudice, rape, false accusation of rape, all of these are abhorrent and really should have never existed in the first place within our world and society. However, it does. I find it insanely sad that even though this book was published more than 50 years ago, has also been used as an educational book for countless young students and even with countless histories to learn from, it seems that some human will never ever learn from hem and the main problems depicted in this book is still very evident in our time.

“You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view... Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it.”

I’ll be honest, I didn’t understand how important the message this book tried to give when I was a kid; it bored the crap out of me and I didn’t make it to the exceptional court scene. Maybe same as the main character in this book, I didn’t truly understand the gravity of the situation yet when I was young. Now though? Let’s just say I realized why this book became one of the most highly famous and well-received classics.One last thing, Atticus Finch is truly a role model to aspire to, as a father, a lawyer, and most of all, a human being; truly a well-written protagonist. 

“They're certainly entitled to think that, and they're entitled to full respect for their opinions... but before I can live with other folks I've got to live with myself. The one thing that doesn't abide by majority rule is a person's conscience.”

If it wasn’t for some part in the first half that bored me, this would’ve received a 5 stars. But if we’re speaking about the message to be taken from this book? this was without a doubt an important and wonderful short read.

“Until I feared I would lose it, I never loved to read. One does not love breathing.”

11,101057673,05/02/2010,5,"Life gives you a few things that you can count on. Death (for all), taxes (for most), and the unwavering moral character of Atticus Finch (for me). ""What would Atticus do?"" is not just a meme; for eleven-year-old me it became a real consideration after I feigned an illness to cut school and stay home to finish To Kill a Mockingbird — while a decidedly non-Atticus-like move, choosing Harper Lee's book over sixth grade math was probably a wiser life choice.For my thoughts on the shameless money grab by the money-greedy publishers recently published first draft of the novel inexplicably (or read: cash grab) marketed as a sequel... Well, I think I just said it all.I cannot be objective about this book - I don't think you can ever be about the things you love. I've read it many times as a child and a few times as an adult, and it never lost that special something that captivated me as a kid of Jem Finch's age.
“[...] Before I can live with other folks I've got to live with myself. The one thing that doesn't abide by majority rule is a person's conscience.”
To me, this book is as close to perfect as one can get.It found a place in school curriculum because of its message, undoubtedly - but it's not what makes it so powerful. After all, if you have even a speck of brains you will understand that racism is wrong and you should treat people right and that “You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view... Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it.” No, what makes it wonderful is the perfect narrative voice combining adult perspective while maintaining a child's voice, through which we glimpse both the grown-up woman looking back through the lessons of years while still seeing the unmistakable innocence and incorruptible feistiness of young Scout Finch. And then there is the magic of the slow measured narration painting the most vivid picture of the sleepy Southern town where there's enough darkness lurking inside the people's souls to be picked up even by very young, albeit quite perceptive children.
""If there's just one kind of folks, why can't they get along with each other? If they're all alike, why do they go out of their way to despise each other? Scout, I think I'm beginning to understand something. I think I'm beginning to understand why Boo Radley's stayed shut up in the house all this time. It's because he wants to stay inside.”
And then there's Atticus Finch. Yes, there may be countless articles all fueled by Lee's first draft about his 'transformation' into a bigot - but I refuse to jump on that bandwagon. I stand behind him the way Lee developed him in the book she *did* publish. Because I sleep better knowing that there are people out there who are good and principled and kind and compassionate, who will do everything they can with the utmost patience to teach their children to be decent human beings. 
“I wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand. It's when you know you're licked before you begin, but you begin anyway and see it through no matter what.""
What shines in this book the most for me is the amazing relationship between parent and child. It's the amazing guidance that the Finch children get in becoming good human beings that many of us would give up a lot for. I know I would. Because to me it will never be a story of a white man saving the world (and some, especially with the publication of that ridiculous first draft, would dismiss it as such). To me, it's the story of a child growing up and learning to see the world with the best possible guidance. It's a story of learning to understand and respect kindness and forgiveness and that sometimes you do right things not just because you're told to but because they are right things to do.I see enough stupidity and nonsense and injustice in this world. And after all of it, what I often do need is Atticus Finch and reassurance that things can be right, and that with the few exceptions, even if I struggle to see it, ""[...] there's just one kind of folks. Folks."" and that, disillusioned as we become as we go on in life, ""Most people are [nice], Scout, when you finally see them.”Five stars from both child and adult me.",265,0.9909,0.075,0.807,0.118,0.5346020874103066,POSITIVE,0.9552

With it's irrevocable integration into the American (and Canadian) public school curricula, I think this novel has probably done more to perpetuate racial stereotypes than any other single force.

16,10003983,12/05/2007,5,"I looked up Harper Lee online this is her only published book. However, she did write a few articles that one can find and read online:Love in other Words - VogueChristmas to me - McCallsWhen Children Discover AmericaRomance and High AdventureHer full name is Nellie Harper Lee - I bet she dropped the Nellie part so publishers would mistakenly think she was a man and read her material. She is also still alive and living in Monroeville, Alabama. And once you read about her and her family, you will know that she is not the only amazing person in that family (guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree).I was able to tell in the beginning that the book started in the 30's once Dill mentioned that he saw Dracula in the theaters. Dracula was in theaters in 1931-32 (don't ask how I know that), and they mentioned that they were in the Depression which started in 1929 (1927-28 for the farmers) and went on through out the 30's. Since they were openly drinking, Prohibition must have ended (1933). And, towards the end of the book, they were mentioning Hitler and what he was doing in Germany which took place in the late 30's. My history teachers would be so impressed that I retained all of that information. Too bad my head is so full of that information, I have to look up my own phone number.I loved Scout. In fact, I get dibs on that name for a little girl- or did Bruce Willis and Demi Moore beat me to it? I loved that she wanted to be a person first and then a girl. And she supports the fact that little kids know the meaning of life and forget it as they get older. She had a great relationship with her brother and father and they encouraged her to be true to herself and not follow the stereotypes of ladies of that time. I loved her way of thinking especially how she drew the conclusion that if she starting swearing her dad would assume she picked up the bad habits from school and pull her out. And when she wanted to write a letter to Dill in invisible ink just to drive him crazy, I almost ruined the book because I was drinking a Diet Pepsi at the time.I have a feeling that Harper Lee was just like Scout and have you noticed that all early 1900 female authors are tomboys? Louisa Mae Alcott was Jo in Little Women, Laura Wilder wrote about herself. It just goes to show you that the truly creative women were those that went against the stereotypes of the time.I'm not sure I like the fact that Atticus allowed them to call him by his first name and not Dad, but aside from that he was the perfect role model. He talked to them, not at them, and he always listened. He firmly believed that it was important for his children to respect him and by NOT following the creed ""Do as I say, not as I do"", Scout and Jem would be able to look up to him. He wanted his children to look beyond the color of one's skin, therefore he did. He treated everyone as equal despite their race, family background, age or education and if more people did that, there wouldn't be as many problems today. His teaching methods worked. You can tell how much the children loved and looked up to him. Nothing hurt them more then having their father be ashamed of them. They didn't keep things from him because they thought he wouldn't understand. They kept things from him because they didn't want him to get hurt. And they always listened, because to disobey would hurt Atticus.Atticus's brother was another one of my favorite characters even though he wasn't mentioned a lot. When he realized his error after punishing Scout for beating up her cousin and tried to make it right, it showed that he also strived to earn their respect just like Atticus. Nothing irates me more then when someone tells me I have to respect them because they are older than me. Whatever. Does that mean I have to respect Bob Ewall because he is older?It's easy to see with all of the problems in the world why Boo Radley feels safer hiding from away from it. It takes a special person to admit defeat to the cliché ""if you can't beat them join them"" and turn his back on things he doesn't understand. I think everyone has a little bit of Boo in us, when we shut out the problems of the outside. Of course, we all have a little of Scout in us to especially when I come out fighting if anyone tries to hurt my family.The court case. Wow, the sad thing is, is I can see that happening even today (i.e. the Rodney King trial). When I moved here the first time, just before the LA riots, there was a huge ordeal about a Korean, store-owner who shot and killed a 17-19 black, teenager girl, she claimed was stealing and attacking her. The security camera shows the tiff and it shows the teen putting down the item and walking towards the exit. The store owner shot her in the back and was found not-guilty, by reason of self-defense. When the book was published in 1960, discrimination was still a big problem. I did like how Harper Lee brought up Hitler's actions against the Jews. It was obvious that what was going on in America with African Americans was no different in her eyes than what Hitler was doing. I agree, we were just more discreet about it. Perhaps because deep inside, Americans knew it was wrong to treat African Americans as third class citizens so we tried to hide it more. Hitler was right out in the open with his actions.I listed a few links that I discovered about To Kill A Mocking Bird:http://www.lausd.k12.ca.us/Belmont_HS...

17,556208398,03/08/2013,5,"What begins as, apparently, just an affectionate and humorous episodic tale of life in an Alabama town in the 1930s, and the personalities and quirks of the people who live there, gradually evolves into an amazing and powerful read, as a young girl called Scout becomes aware of her lawyer father's representation of Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping a white woman, and the town's general attitude about that, which spills over into their treatment of Scout and her brother. From an attorney's point of view, the trial of Tom was fascinating: the differences in how courts handled trials in a small town 80 years ago, the speed and informality of the trial, the African American people relegated to the balconies. I have no idea how accurate Harper Lee's description of the trial actually was to real life, but it seems extremely plausible to me. Mayella Ewell and her father were so appallingly real to me. I loved old Judge Taylor, and Atticus is a hero. Boo Radley flits like a ghost throughout the book, a vivid symbol of vulnerable innocence that's echoed in Tom's trial.I've read a lot of reviews of Go Set a Watchman, discussing the differences in Atticus' views on race and his personal prejudices between that book and this one, so I was keeping a particular eye out for anything in Mockingbird that would indicate he's prejudiced but nevertheless committed to doing his job. It's just not there, and frankly I'm glad about that. There's enough prejudice in that town that I didn't feel like I needed to see need Atticus struggling with that issue on a personal level.Harper Lee explores our values and prejudices that we sometimes don't examine closely enough in ourselves, and the vital importance of courage and integrity. This book is a truly timeless classic. It made me smile but broke my heart a little bit at the same time - like many of the best books do.Bonus material: In the comments thread below we got into a discussion about Harper Lee using the real-life Scottsboro Boys trial(s) in the early 1930's as inspiration for Tom Robinson's trial. It's a somewhat loose connection; there are some substantial differences between the facts of the cases, but some definite similarities as well. In both trials, innocent black men were accused of rape based solely on the unsubstantiated word of a white woman. In the Scottsboro trials, there were nine African-American men accused of rape while riding the rails in the company of two white woman, apparently in the prostitution business, who were trying to avoid prosecution themselves. The evidence did not support the women's claims, but juries convicted the defendants anyway. A Judge Horton tried to enforce a fair trial, but was replaced on retrial. One of the inmates later tried to escape prison and was shot by a guard, though he was not killed. All in all, the Scottboro events are vivid, awful proof that Tom Robinson's trial was realistic.See http://www.enotes.com/homework-help/w... and http://civilrightstokillamockingbird....

(Throwback Review) This is one of the most widely read books in the twentieth century. As most of us might have read this novel in high school, many emotions, including nostalgia, will come to our mind when we hear about the story of Maycomb and its denizens. This novel, set during the Great Depression, discusses a lot of vital topics like racism and sexual assault.

 Atticus Finch is not just a hero for Scout, Jem, and the lawyers, but he is considered the hero of a whole generation. If you are someone who loves books, you might have already read this book. If you belong to the minority who haven't read it yet, I request you to try to include it in your reading list. This is one of the very few books about which I can confidently say that everyone should read.

But I can try my best to at least write a few words to let you know what things I enjoyed (spoiler: I enjoyed every single word).This story deals with the very important and sensitive topic of racism and is told from the point of five of a little girl. I had my doubts if this combination would work out. But somehow, Harper Lee was able to create an incredibly compelling character, who understands and misunderstands just the right amounts to be realistic, and to get all the major points the novel is trying to make across. It would have been easy to write from the perspective of Atticus, the 'hero' of the story. But I think this wouldn't have been the right thing to do; it would have seemed far too self-indulgent and conceited.The characters themselves are all incredibly lovely. They just warmed up my heart. I'd love to give those three little kids, Scout and Jem and Dill, a giant hug. I'd like to shake the hand of Atticus and pay him my respects. I would go to Church with Calpurnia and find out more about her life. I would smile at Boo, to let him know that I accept him just the way he is, and while a simple smile might seem like a typical interaction to others, I'm sure it would mean a lot to Boo. So yeah, all of those characters have found a place in my heart, and I know that they will definitely stay in my mind for a long time to come as well.It surprised me how easy to read I found the writing style. It's hard to believe this was written in the 60's! I think the fact the topic is (unfortunately) a timeless one plays a part in that. I'm currently still in a bit of a reading slump, but this book grabbed my attention from the first page and kept me smiling and laughing and crying. No wonder it's such a well-loved classic!

The novel spawned the unforgettable award winning film starring Gregory Peck playing the unforgettable role of the most iconic lawyer of all time, the compassionate Atticus Finch. I think there cannot be many who are unaware of this timeless, emotionally compelling story and its characters, it is embedded so deeply in our cultural history, life and memories. Set amidst the harsh realities of 1930s Alabama in the small town of Maycomb, it touches on the most universal of themes of race, class, gender, inequality, injustice, hypocrisy, cruelty, hate, courage, the power of kindness, family and innocence, seen through the eyes of the young Scout (Jean Louise) and her brother, Jem, the children of Atticus.This novel still inspires wonder, with its message of it being a sin to kill a mockingbird, it was a joy to re-encounter Boo Radley, Calpurnia and Tom Robinson et al, my love for it remains strong and undiminished, it is still one of my all time favourites, and I can see future generations loving it as much as me.

So I will only say that for me the beauty of this book lies in how Lee has so perfectly captured the time in the 1930's and the place Maycomb and the life in this small town and what it meant to be black then and there and how a young girl tries to make sense of what is happening around her . It's a portrait of a place that comes alive because of the richness of the characters . Yes, it's about racism in the south in the 1930's , and about family and how life in a small town can shape people or not if you are Atticus Finch but my heart belongs to Scout . I decided to reread it in preparation for reading Go Set a Watchman because my first reading had been so long ago . I wish I had done what my GR friends Diane S. and Diane B. did in not rereading TKAM but choosing to read Go Set a Watchman and judging it on its own for what it is .

Some trivia about the book and movie...Finch was writer Harper Lee's mother's maiden name.Despite the novel winning the Pulitzer Prize, the studios were not interested in buying up the film rights as they deemed it lacking in action, there was no love story and the villain doesn't get a big comeuppance. Producer Alan J. Pakula disagreed however and persuaded director Robert Mulligan that it would make a good film. Together they were able to convince Gregory Peck who readily agreed.Truman Capote, who grew up with Harper Lee, also knew the inspiration for ""Boo"" Radley, and had planned to base a character on him in one of his short stories. After seeing how well the character was realized in Lee's novel, however, he decided against it.Some images..Harper Lee on the right.http://more2read.com/?review=to-kill-a-mockingbird-by-harper-lee",150,0.9692,0.093,0.753,0.154,0.4988351254480286,POSITIVE,0.9997

Surely it stands on an even shelf with the Harry Potter series (take in mind: its a Millennial writing this review); it's ripe with conventions that can be cracked open in the classroom, where the love for literature begins for most American children. The emblematic character of Atticus Finch is a great figure--mysterious, righteous, progressive...completely just and good. Intelligent. As is Scout, the precocious girl who filters all the goings on in her sleepy Alabama town.It is a pity I did not read this in middle school, when foundations are forged with human values and the artistic possibilities of storytelling. That being said, I cannot but smile at finally, at 28, having plowed through this-- a complicated and personal classic. It depicts a gone-with-the-wind America, it has a strong point-of-view, which is restricted and accurate (the character is alive & becomes an avatar of the impressed young reader him/herself), it is a history lesson, a lesson in civics and law, a segue toward laws and government, and, most importantly, it includes a lovable naivete which borders on the poetic; the coming-of-age strangeness, including body changes and adolescent yearnings, all of these are staples of THE YA novel.

29,1932723003,03/24/2017,5,"What can I say about this amazing book that hasn’t already been said? I think The Guardian said it best– 'To Kill a Mockingbird will never stop being a good book, and it will never stop inspiring good people'The story is told from the point of view of Scout (Jean-Louise Finch), a six year old girl, through various events that happen in the town of Maycomb and in particular, the court case of Tom Robinson as her father Atticus Finch acts as Tom’s defence lawyer. Tom, a black man who has been accused of raping a young white woman, has to endure multiple racial attacks. Atticus, widely described as the “most enduring fictional image of racial heroism”, describes the events to Scout so that she sees that all people should be treated equally. ThemesThe book mainly deals with the themes of racial equality and rape but there are themes of morality, class and gender also. To Kill a Mockingbird had been deemed so important that in 2006, British librarians ranked the book ahead of the Bible as one ""every adult should read before they die"".Above pointing the finger at racial and class issues, it’s a gripping story with great characters. What impacted me most when reading this was just how applicable all of the issues still are today, even though the book was published 57 years ago. We have indeed made good progress, but we still have a long way to go in my view. CharactersScout is such an awesome character, probably one of my favourites. Having the story told through Scout’s innocent point of view was a perfect choice, it creates a very unique atmosphere. Atticus is nothing short of a hero. Not in today’s comic book / action-hero standard, but as a moral pillar of the family who is setting a great example for his family to follow. He sticks up for what he believes in. This probably sums him up perfectly - ""It was times like these when I thought my father, who hated guns and had never been to any wars, was the bravest man who ever lived.""WritingThe writing was a joy to read. You really get to know and care for the characters. This story is really subtle in places and it’s not a fast-paced thrill ride. Had Lee’s writing been sub-par it could have become boring very quickly. Instead, Lee draws you in through her fantastic writing, which is both charming and astonishing in places. ""They're certainly entitled to think that, and they're entitled to full respect for their opinions... but before I can live with other folks I've got to live with myself. The one thing that doesn't abide by majority rule is a person's conscience.""""I wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand. It's when you know you're licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what. You rarely win, but sometimes you do.""""So it took an eight-year-old child to bring 'em to their senses.... That proves something - that a gang of wild animals can be stopped, simply because they're still human. Hmp, maybe we need a police force of children.""""I think there's just one kind of folks. Folks.""“You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view … until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.””Shoot all the blue jays you want, if you can hit 'em, but remember it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.""If we followed our feelings all the time, we’d be like cats chasing their tails.Final thoughtI wholeheartedly agree that this is one of the most important books ever written, beautifully created. Don’t be put off by all the themes and the millions of critical, in-depth analysis’s. Underneath all of that, it’s simply a great read. Highly recommended, and the audiobook version with Sissy Spacek is wonderful. I’ll leave you with yet another quote from The Guardian “Let it not be forgotten that a true piece of literature, like To Kill a Mockingbird, is meaningful in every period and that today, Atticus Finch's message should be heard in the midst of all the global conflicts that we hear of on the news every night.”Check out all my book blogs at http://constantreaderpauloneill.blogspot.co.uk/",143,0.9963,0.099,0.732,0.169,0.5351995798319327,POSITIVE,0.9997
30,6878452,09/27/2007,5,"The concept of the one hit wonder is well known in pop music – who can forget such timeless classics as ""Sugar Sugar"" by The Archies, or ""99 Balloons"" by Nena, ""Who Let the Dogs Out"" by the Baha Men or, indeed, ""Kung Fu Fighting"" by Carl Douglas. (""They were chopping them up/They were chopping them down!"") But you can believe that all these people released a bunch of other singles. It’s just that the public didn’t buy them so they only got one large hit and nothing else ever.The one hit wonder in literature is a much purer concept than that though. It’s when an author writes an acknowledged timeless classic novel beloved by millions and then writes no other novel at all. No follow up. Nothing.Looking at all my favourite novels I found ten which could be described as one hit wonders. But the definition is a little tricky.For instance, I include The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath, Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte and A Death in the Family by James Agee. But I’m not happy with those because the authors died before they could even get to think about a follow up. In fact James Agee died before his novel was published. Then, I have Love me Back by Merritt Tierce, Problems by Jade Sharma and Fourth of July Creek by Smith Henderson. Okay, they are not yet timeless classics beloved by millions, but they should be soon. Give them another 50 years or so. They’re already beloved by me! But they can’t be included either because they’re these authors’ first novels, so even as I type, they’re all probably working on their second one. So delete those. That leaves four. Caleb Williams by William Godwin-	An example of a guy who had so many irons in the fire, he just never got round to writing another novel. I do admit this one is probably not beloved by millions, but it is a timeless classic. A very early thriller (1794)Diary of a Nobody by George and Weedon Grossmith-	You might have thought they would try a second novel because this was as big a hit as ""Who Let the Dogs Out"" easily. The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde-	He was a vastly successful playwright and then he got into a spot of bother & probably didn’t have the time or inclination after that& so finally for me the greatest literary one hit wonder (no surprise) is To Kill a Mockingbird. It irritated me to death when Go Set a Watchman was issued in 2015 in a blatant and successful attempt to cash in while Harper Lee herself was not in a position to object. If she’d thought it should have been published she had 55 years to make that decision and didn’t. Anyway, Wikipedia says Go Set a Watchman is “widely accepted as being a first draft” of To Kill a Mockingbird so therefore I say it doesn’t count. If your own favourite one hit wonder does not appear in this list, say for instance A Confederacy of Dunces or Catcher in the Rye that's because I hate those ones.

31,1134902070,12/18/2014,2,"To Kill a Mockingbird has become such a potent cultural symbol in the Western world, especially in the United States, that you risk being seen as an insensitive cynic (view spoiler)[or a heartless bastard (hide spoiler)] if you sound a dissenting note. From a moral standpoint it attacks institutionalised racism against the black people in the United States back in the day when it was common to treat them as subhumans. This is a noble goal, but judged on criteria of literary merit, I contend that there's not much in the book.Flannery O'Connor called it a ""children's novel."" She did not intend it as a compliment. The novel suffers from a saccharine dose of sentiment, and it is fair to label it as a black-and-white cliché, literally. I found the characters two-dimensional, singly pursuing their idea without meaningful conflict that could have lent them some humanity. Atticus Finch, a morally upright man and gentle father, is the author's moralising mouthpiece who, supine and misty in the early stages of the story, is catapulted into action when he takes upon himself to defend the black man. If there's more to Atticus, I'm sure to have missed it completely. There is an oft-quoted famous line that goes like this:
You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view. Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it.
A bit of Captain Obvious wouldn't you say? It would have been illuminating if Ms Lee could make the reader climb inside the skin for a walk.You can split the book into two separate novellas, neatly, like a cake; so big is the disconnect between the first half which reads like an interesting ghost story and the second half which is no more than a reportage on the proceedings of a criminal case in a court of law where a black man is facing (false) charges of rape. Through these court proceedings Ms Lee tries to paint a dismal picture of the times when hapless black people didn't stand a chance once a white man accused them of wrongdoing.If one is to judge a work of fiction, one is to judge it for the style of its narrative method and what the writer has attempted to do in it; but there's a common fallacy, as I'd call it, of judging art's worth based entirely on the subjective moral urgency of its social content. This is not to say that I do not understand the need to incorporate minority voices that had been suppressed into mute existence for many centuries (But this story, unlike Toni Morrison's novels, is written from the white man's perspective). Quite a few famous post-colonial novels fall in this category: thin on literary craft but still appreciated for their social or political import. So I can understand why an average novel like this one spoke so strongly to the changing zeitgeist and struck a chord with millions of readers.December 2014",137,0.7154,0.11,0.772,0.119,0.3956752757600216,NEGATIVE,0.999
32,214471525,09/24/2011,4,"‘You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view... Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it.’Harper Lee’s To Kill A Mockingbird is an undisputed classic that few will avoid having read in their lifetime, and those few are to be pitied. As I habe presentation of the novel coming up this weekend, a discussion group that I am lucky enough to be allowed to lead as part of the The Big Read here in Holland, Michigan, I felt it necessary to revisit this timeless classic (and I figured I’d review it to help collect my thoughts on the subject). The experience was like returning to a childhood home and finding it warm and welcoming and undisturbed from the passage of time, like walking the streets of my old neighborhood and hearing the calls of friends as they rode out with their bikes to greet me, of knowing the mailman by name and knowing where all the best places for hide-and-seek were, the best trees to climb, and feeling safe and secure in a place that is forever a part of yourself. Though some of the mechanics of the novel seemed less astonishing than my first visit more than a decade ago, the power and glory was still there, and I found a renewed love and respect for characters like Atticus, whom I’ve always kept close to heart when wrestling with my own position as a father. Harper Lee created a wonderful work that incorporated a wide range of potent themes, wrapping class systems, gender roles, Southern manners and taboos, and an important moral message of kindness, love and conviction all within a whimsical bildungsroman that no reader who has been graced by its pages will ever forget.‘The one thing that doesn't abide by majority rule is a person's conscience.’Before dipping into the novel itself, I’d like to take a moment to speak about Atticus Finch, one of my favorite characters in all of Literature. Atticus is a pillar of morality, a man of honor, integrity, and most importantly, conviction. He is humble and honest, even admitting to his children that yes, indeed they are poor. In a novel about society, with its tumultuous mess of morals and class, Atticus is like an authorial deus ex machina, being Lee’s method of inserting moralizing and an example of what constitutes a ‘good man’ into the book through character and not authorial asides. I’ve always idolized Atticus and tried to think ‘what would Atticus do?’ when it come to being a father and undertaking difficult moral conundrums (I even named my second cat Catticus Finch). Atticus takes the unpopular position of defending a black man in a rape case when assigned to him despite the town nearly ostracizing him. Atticus does his duty, and does it well, as a man of conviction that believes in doing what is right and honorable regardless of the consequences, living up to his statement that ‘Real courage is when you know you're licked before you begin, but you begin anyway and see it through no matter what’. In fact, Lee originally intended to name the novel Atticus before deciding it would stifle the broad perspective of Macomb by drawing too much attention to one character. Atticus remains steadfast throughout the novel, sure of himself and fully developed, whereas those around him undergo more a sense of change and development. This is a novel about personal growth and a broader understanding of those around you, and Atticus is the anchor to integrity and morality keeping his children centered in the violent storm of emotions and violence that befalls Macomb.‘When a child asks you something, answer him, for goodness sake. But don't make a production of it. Children are children, but they can spot an evasion faster than adults, and evasion simply muddles 'em.’There is a childlike innocence spun through a novel of such weight and seriousness, executed brilliantly by Lee’s choice of Scout as the narrator. We are forever seeing a larger world through the eyes of a young girl still trying to find her place in it while making sense of all the hustle and bustle around her, and this creates an incredible ironic effect where there are large events going on that the reader understands but are delivered nearly through defamiliarization because the narrator cannot fully grasp them¹. The narration allows Lee to balance the coming-of-age hallmarks with the weightier themes, allowing the reader to maintain an innocence from the rape and racism while still able to make sense of the society functioning at large, and retreating from the darker themes into the fun of the children’s comings and goings. What is most impressive is how everything blends together, and the lessons learned in each aspect of their life are applied to all the other elements they come in contact with. The fates of Tom and Boo Radley are emotionally and morally linked in the readers mind, heart and soul.All the standard bildungsroman motifs that make people love the genre are present in To Kill a Mockingbird, from schoolyard quarrels, to learning your place in society. We see Scout, Jem, and even Dill, gain a greater understanding of the world and their place in it, watch the children come to respect their father for more than just being a good father, see them make dares, terrorize the neighbors in good fun, and even stop a mob before it turns violent. With Scout, particularly, there is an element of gender identity at play that leads into a larger discussion about class and society. Children learn from those around them, and Scout spends much of the novel assessing those around her, perhaps subconsciously looking for a role model for herself. The ideas of what a good southern woman is and should be are imposed upon her throughout the town, such as Ms Dubose who criticizes her manner of dress, or Aunt Alexandra and her attempts to eradicate Scout’s tomboyish behavior, and she learns to dislike Miss Stephanie and her gossipy behavior. Miss Maudie, however, curbs gossip and insults, and puts on the face of a southern lady, but still gets down into the dirt in the garden and behaves in other, more boyish, ways that Scout identifies with. The gender identification becomes a cog in the gear of Southern tradition in manners and class. While the court case is unquestionably controversial due to the racial implications, it is also because it forces people to discuss rape and involves questioning the Word of a woman. It forces up a lot of taboo that the community is uncomfortable in being forced to deal with it, and many inevitably turn a squeamish blind eye when forced to confront the ugly truths at hand. Macomb is a society where everything and everyone has their place, a set identification, and they do not like it being disturbed. Most important to note is the correlation that the characters who are most inclined to uphold societal traditions through self-righteous brow-beatings often exhibit the most rampant racism throughout the novel.‘Mockingbirds don’t do one thing except make music for us to enjoy. They don’t eat up people’s gardens, don’t nest in corn cribs, they don’t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That’s why it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.’There are many ‘mockingbird’ characters in this novel, such as Tom and Boo, but the real mockingbird is, to me at least, the innocence that is lost. The town is forced to see each other for who they really are, to question their beliefs, to grow up with all the racism and bigotry going on around them. Atticus teaches Scout that we cannot know someone until ‘you consider things from his point of view’, and through the novel we see many misjudgements of character based on misunderstanding or characters refusing to see beyond their closed opinions, or even something as simple as Scout and Jem believing the rumors of Boo Radley as a bloodthirsty maniac. ‘People generally see what they look for, and hear what they listen for.’ This applies to many obdurate aspects of society, such as Miss Maudie stating ‘sometimes the Bible in hand of one man is worse than a whiskey bottle in the hand of-oh, your father,’ emphasizing the ways that a closed mind is just as dangerous as a violent hand and that even religion can be misused. There is a message of love, of looking into the hearts of others and not just judging them, a message of compassion and open-mindedness working through To Kill a Mockingbird, and it is a message that we all must be reminded of from time to time.There are a few issues that arose on a re-reading of the novel, having grown myself as a reader since I first encountered this lovely book. While the moral lessons are important and timeless, there is a sense of heavy-handedness to their delivery. Particularly at the end when Sheriff Tate points out the dangers of making a hero of Boo Radley.
taking the one man who’s done you and this town a great service an’ draggin’ him with his shy ways into the limelight—to me, that’s a sin. It’s a sin and I’m not about to have it on my head.
This statement is quickly followed by Scout mentioning to Atticus that ‘Well, it’d be sort of like shootin’ a mockingbird, wouldn’t it?’. It seems a bit unnecessary to reiterate the point, especially when Tate’s double use of sin was enough to draw a parallel to the message earlier in the novel that it is a sin to kill a mockingbird. This, I admit, is overly nitpicky but brings up a conversation about teaching this novel in schools. This book is, ideally, read at a time of the readers own coming-of-age and the connections they are sure to draw with the characters reinforce the love for the novel. It is also a time in life when you are just beginning to understand the greater worlds of literature, and overtly pointing out themes is more necessary for readers when they haven’t yet learned how to look for them properly. It is books such as this that teach us about books, and usher us into a world of reading between the lines that we hadn’t known was there before. Another quiet complaint I have with the novel that, despite the themes of racism, Calpurnia seems to be a bit of an Uncle Tom character. However, who wouldn’t want to be in service for as great of a man as Atticus, so this too can be overlooked.To Kill a Mockingbird is a novel surely deserving of it’s classic status. Though it is not without its flaws, there is a timeless message of love that permeates through the novel. It is also of great importance as a book that young readers can use as a ladder towards higher literature than they had been previously exposed to. Lee has such a fluid prose that makes for excellent storytelling, especially through the coming-of-age narrative of Scout, and has a knack for creating exquisite characters that have left their immortal mark in the halls of Literature as well as the hearts of her readers.4.5/5‘...when they finally saw him, why he hadn’t done any of those things...Atticus, he was real nice.Most people are, Scout, when you finally see them.’¹This style is reminiscent of William Faulkner, such as the court scene in Barn Burning from the detached perspective of a child. In fact, much of this novel feels indebted to Faulkner and the works of Southern Gothic authors before her, and the Tom incident and case feels familiar to those familiar with Faulkner’s Dry September or Intruder in the Dust. The way the most self-righteous and self-professed 'holy' also tend to be the basest of character morals is reminiscent of Flannery O'Connor as well. Lee’s story is fully her own, but it is always interesting to see the travels and growth of literary tradition.",131,0.9935,0.103,0.759,0.137,0.5080274927650619,POSITIVE,1.0
33,2393153408,05/24/2018,5,"“You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view.”This is a novel that I have read countless times over the years and it never fails to connect with me on some level with every reading. That is no small feat for a book to accomplish. To speak to people the world over, for over 50 years, means that there is something universal in this text.We are all the mockingbirds of the title, and anyone who has reached the age of majority knows the feelings that the loss of innocence, and the harsh light of reality can create in a person. Harper Lee wrote a novel that captured the essence of that most universal of experiences, and I for one am moved by it every time.I won't rehash plot points, but I will give you some reasons why you should read, and then reread, this text.The first reason is for the beautiful depiction of imaginative childhood. The narrator, her brother Jem, and their friend Dill embody most of the traits of childhood, and their creative games, and thought processes are a joy to behold. The voice of Scout (the narrator) is a pitch perfect recreation of childhood and childish impulses. Part I (chapters 1-11) of this book are possibly the best recreation of childhood that I have come across in literature.Another reason is a pretty simple one actually. The character of Atticus Finch is one of the noblest literary creations ever written. I want to be like him, and there are not many characters in literature I can, or would, say that about. The fact that being like Atticus is possible makes him even more endearing to me. He is someone who is noble in every sense of the word, and serves as an inspiration for so many reasons. He is a good father, a decent and empathetic man, and a person who tries to see the good in almost anything. The fact that there are so few Atticus Finches in real life makes him seem all the more desirable to me. It is obvious as you read this text that Ms. Lee loves this character. Atticus’ emphatic desire to see all people as humans and worthy of respect (even when those people are undesirable) is a lesson for our (and all) time. It is a trait that many people preach, but few actually practice. Let someone vote for someone you do not like, or have a leader you can’t stand, and then watch the ugly flow forth. Atticus resists those impulses at every turn in this novel, and I am inspired by that.There are numerous other reasons why this is a stellar work of genius, not least of which is the wonderful plotting of the novel, the excellent and fleshed out supporting characters (these people are real to me) and the message that Lee finds numerous ways to reiterate throughout the book.When you get to the beautiful and brilliant chapter 9, the thematic heart of the novel begins to unfold. And every time I visit Maycomb County I find myself tearing up a little at such beautifully human moments. The text’s final chapter never fails to move me emotionally because it is so understated and powerful.Ms. Lee has created a pastoral version of the Depression era south, and even though there is vicious bigotry and hatred depicted in the novel, Ms. Lee (through her characters) does not give up on them, or us. The world, and we, can be better. We just need to remind ourselves to walk in other people's shoes once in a while.",131,0.9991,0.038,0.743,0.219,0.5227678571428573,POSITIVE,0.9997

39,80405589,12/09/2009,5,"To Kill a Mockingbird: Harper Lee's Novel of Integrity and Duty in the Face of Intolerance and Injustice“I wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand. It's when you know you're licked before you begin, but you begin anyway and see it through no matter what.-- Atticus Finch” 

Harper Lee, born 1926, 86When Harper Lee published To Kill a Mockingbird in 1960 a few well known Southern authors had a few tart things to say about it. Carson McCullers, whose Franky was compared to Scout said Harper Lee had been ""poaching on her literary preserves."" Flannery O'Connor said the novel was fine, as far as it went if people realized they were reading a book for children.But Harper Lee's only known novel was an immediate phenomenon. Today it is read by more people around the world than the Bible. That's saying something.I am hesitant to attempt a review of this book. How much more can be said of it than has already been said. In all humility I can only say that I have loved this book for years. A goodreads friend asked me how many times I had read it. I replied in my Grandmother's words, ""Eleventy-Seven."" Loosely translated that means a lot--even more than a month of Sunday's.I will not attempt to present a plot summary. There are few who don't know the story. It's only necessary to remind each other that it still remains a sin to kill a mockingbird. Atticus said so. And Miss Maudie reminds us that all mockingbirds do is sing their hearts out for us all the day long. They do us no harm. They are the innocents among us. They are due to be protected. As long as Tom Robinsons and Boo Radleys exist in this world there will always be a niche necessarily filled by To Kill a Mockingbird.

 *""Shoot all the blue jays you want, if you can hit 'em. But remember, it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.To Kill a Mockingbird is especially dear to lawyers. Atticus Finch is the epitome of integrity in a profession often maligned by the public, sometimes rightly so on the basis of notorious incidents of failure to follow the rules of professional conduct. Over the years I was actively engaged in the practice of law, I returned time after time to this perfect novel as a reminder that it was my job to do the right thing and not just go for the win. It has seen me through difficult cases more than once.

Atticus defends Tom RobinsonTruthfully, I do not know the exact number of times I have read this perfect book. I know I have now passed a dozen times. Doubtless, in the years I have remaining, I will return to it again.Why does To Kill a Mockingbird continue to sell so well? Why has it never been out of print? I can only hope that there are far more Jems and Scouts aspiring to become Atticus Finch. And we will always have a need for him and those who strive to follow his philosophy. It is not easy following in the footsteps of such a man. It takes a sense of duty, sacrifice, and responsibility for the innocents of this world. It takes courage. None of those characteristics ever go out of style.“They're certainly entitled to think that, and they're entitled to full respect for their opinions... but before I can live with other folks I've got to live with myself. The one thing that doesn't abide by majority rule is a person's conscience.” --Atticus Finch*Note--no copyright infringement is intended as this photograph is used for educational purposes only.November 30, 2014Tonight finds us in Augusta, Georgia, breaking our trip home to Tuscaloosa, Alabama, from our Thanksgiving holiday with my wife's family.

40,4028822625,05/29/2021,5,"After watching Friends Reunion, I felt like going back my high school times to revisit my reading list and picked up my one of the all time favorite reads!  I am rereading this book at different timelines of my life and I always find something different to like, getting attracted by different details, changing my mind about which character is my favorite. Nope actually last thing is a total lie. I love Jean Louise Scout Finch. Her narration, her growing up, her innocent and curious mind made her reserve a special place on my heart. She’s the daughter of charismatic, righteous Atticus Finch who is one of the remarkable characters in the literature history, a prominent lawyer defending black man who is accused of raping a white woman which results with townies’ growing hatred against the entire family. It’s a bold, well developed story takes place in Monroeville, Alabama on 1936! A quiet fascinating lesson of civics, lesson of history and lesson of ethics.  My fifth time reading goes smoothly and reminding me of how much I loved the story of small town, a country, townies, neighbors, brave criticism of racism.  If you prefer audibook option, Sissy Spacek did a hell of a great job! Here are my favorite quotes :“Best way to clear the air is to have it all out in the open”“You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view.

41,4560474,08/14/2007,5,"OK, everyone needs to stop what they're doing and go find a copy of Sissy Spacek reading this book. I am not exaggerating when I say it is the best audiobook performance I have ever heard. I have read To Kill a Mockingbird perhaps 10 or 12 times in my life, and it is one of my favorite books, but this was the first time I listened to it. Sissy was the perfect narrator for Scout, and she also did a fantastic job at all of the other voices. If you like audiobooks, this is a must-listen. (And if any publishers are reading this, please hire Sissy to narrate more Southern literature. Her voice is so soothing she could charm a cat out of a tree.)What struck me about the story this time is how sadly relevant the issue of racial prejudice and inequality still is, even though the book was first published in 1960. At the heart of the novel is the trial of Tom Robinson, a black man who is accused of raping a white woman, Mayella Ewell. What quickly becomes apparent is that Tom is innocent, and Mayella was actually beaten by her father, Bob Ewell, when he caught her trying to kiss a negro. Atticus Finch, the hero of the novel, does his best to defend Tom, but the jury (and most of the town) convicts him anyway, and Tom is condemned to death. Atticus' two children, Jem and Scout, are deeply upset by the case, especially when Bob Ewell continues to threaten them.This book reminded me of the police shooting and riots in Ferguson, Missouri, and of innumerable other stories in the news of African-Americans not being treated fairly by officers or the courts. I would like to find hope in what Atticus said when he's trying to explain the Tom Robinson case to Scout: ""Simply because we were licked a hundred years before we started is no reason for us not to try to win.""There is so much to love in this book. Scout, whose real name is Jean Louise, is a tomboy and she is our narrator. The story occurs over several years, and we watch her grow up. Harper Lee has a terrific sense of humor, and Scout's antics always make me laugh. One of Scout's best friends is a boy named Dill (a character reportedly inspired by Harper Lee's real-life friendship with Truman Capote) and at the start of the book, the kids are obsessed with a reclusive neighbor named Boo Radley. Boo is a mystery throughout the story, and when he finally appears, well, I usually have to wipe a few tears from my eyes.This novel is a gem, a true American classic. It has been a favorite of mine since I first read it in 8th-grade English, and I think it has had an impact on every generation who reads it. And based on the news, it sounds like it is still needed.Favorite Quotes“You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view ...

Book Review

4+ of 5 stars for To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee, published in 1960 and winner of a Pulitzer prize. Almost every teenager is told to read this during high school, or at least they were when I attend about 25 years ago... I thought about doing a normal book review for this one, but ultimately I wouldn't be able to do it justice. Two key things I'd really like to say:1. I couldn't give this a 5 because there were a few parts that I thought needed some clean-up, could have added additional emotions and might have been an even more stellar jump off the page. But it's a 4.4999999999999 and some days, I want to re-read it to see if I can absolutely push it up to that mighty 5 I've only given out about 15 times... less than 3% of my reads...2. Forget what time period this was written in or written about. Ignore the color of a person's skin. Don't give any consideration to the parent / child relationship. Avoid focusing on it as a tale of an attorney with a case. This is a book about every single human being. About every decision we make in life. About all that matters when you are alive.Each of us feels like someone in the book... Atticus Finch, Scout, Boo Radley, Jem, Aunt Alexandra, Calpurnia, Tom Robinson.... I could go on forever. Probably more than just 1 of them. And maybe different ones at different points in our lives. You cannot help but feel your mind moving all over the place in trying to decide where you heart falls in this story.It's a collection of lessons we all need to learn and be careful to understand to the fullest extent. People don't raise themselves. They are raised by the influences around them. And then they make their own choices from all they've seen and heard.We all have a choice. We may not know it. But we do. It doesn't mean you like the outcome. But there is always a choice.The very basics of your character are laid out on the table in this book.Honor and Respect are earned, not given.Family is important. But so is trust and an open-mind.In the beginning, I noted we all see ourselves in some number of these characters. What I really should have said, although that is true, is that we also -- every single one of us -- without a doubt in my mind -- IDENTIFIES with Scout. Everything she's been thru (to varying degrees, excluding the obvious big item that happens/almost happens to her) is something every one of us faces during the course of our life. Identifying with someone is at our core. And I can think of no better way to read this book than to choose who you are as a person and how you want to identify yourself to the rest of the world.

44,1328975411,07/08/2015,3,"Well, I never read this as a teen. The reason being that my middle school didn’t think it was appropriate to put in our reading curriculum, probably due to rape (view spoiler)[ and the fact that our district taught abstinence in lieu of any practical sex ed (hide spoiler)]. So with the sequel about to come out, I decided to finally read this one. I wanted to go to Barnes and Noble and get their special leather-bound edition of it, but was told that it was no longer available. I bought it on Amazon instead.What we have here is part coming of age school novel, part courtroom drama, and part small town mythos. While Scout recounts her early years at school (which seem to blend together without regard for timing), it’s a learning process for all. Her earliest teacher makes bureaucratic, though well-meaning, mistakes by shaming Scout for already knowing how to read and doesn’t know the faux pas of the town social nuances.What surprised me most about the court case was how swift it was decided. I don’t know how fast these things went in the old days (to see if the book was an accurate portrayal for the time), but a one-day trial for rape seems too quick. Really, even small claims civil cases can take days with all the pomp and circumstance of a courtroom (at least in larger cities). Atticus really makes this an open and shut case with a few facts, but that doesn’t seem to sway the juror’s predisposed prejudice against the defendant on the basis of color.Then there’s this weirdness with a Halloween pageant where Scout has to dress like cured pork. Which leads up to a very real confrontation where she gets shanked in the ham.Then Boo ghosts out of his place and just kills Scout’s assailant abruptly, says about 2 lines and leaves to star in The Godfather.All in all, it was an okay novel. I can’t say I was blown away by it, but that might have been because my expectations were too high to begin with.",102,-0.9217,0.083,0.853,0.064,0.449158163265306,NEGATIVE,1.0

What convinced me was when a young interracial couple I know had their 1st child and she insisted on naming him Atticus. At first her husband hated the name, that is until he read the book... Then his enthusiasm was so infectious it got to me, that and curiosity. Why does it continue to strikes a chord with so many? Now that I’ve joined the ranks of the besotted (5 stars – personal top 10) I understand…It’s really entertaining, a great story that hooks and pushes all the emotional buttons. The characters are memorable; Scout as the sassy little scrapper is hilarious, Atticus as a decent man trying to do the right thing unforgettable. Having heard it quoted so often I expected great dialog, what surprised me was her mastery at evoking time and place, I stepped back to childhood in a small circa 30’s Southern town.Packed with wisdom Harper’s choice in telling it through the guileless eyes of a child stop it from coming across preachy. With anti-racism at its core it’s also about being decent & respectful to ‘all folks’, be they poor, elderly or mentally ill. Mostly it’s about having the courage to stand by your convictions “It's when you know you're licked before you begin, but you begin anyway and see it through no matter what.” I loved its honesty. (view spoiler)[her choice not to pander the reader with a happy-ever-after not-guilty verdict  (hide spoiler)] Despairing the state of the legal system (“first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers” a personal favorite) I was jaded enough to have had a hard time buying into Atticus. But I did, it felt good to actually like a lawyer, to believe that idealistic people can evoke change. Cons: It ended, I wanted more. Side notes: I’ve got a thing for reading debuts, this one’s the best I’ve read and I was floored that it was written by a young southern woman in the early 60’s. Wonder if Kathryn Stockett based the character Skeeter on Harper Lee when she wrote The Help…As to the movie, highly recommended but the book is a completely different animal, unfair to compare.

46,651440312,06/26/2013,5,"A blackbird used to sing outside my window. He put a smile on my face when I woke every morning, and he was there when I went to sleep. His song was the first thing I heard when I walked up my path after having been away from home for a while. He would sing all day and even some of the evening and night, proudly chorusing his own short refrains, the songs he had taught himself. He had three songs, all of just five notes each, and one of these was his especial favourite which he would repeat over and over again. Not for him were the complicated warbles and song structures of his fellow birds. Occasionally he would experiment; a twitter here, a different note there, but then he would confidently return to his favourites, and sing them loudly, his heart fit to burst. He gloried in his song, and I delighted in it. Then last week nothing. There is a hole in my life now; something is missing - something of beauty has gone. I feel bereft, as if someone close to me has died. And sometimes, reading this book I would fleetingly experience a similar sense of loss.""Mockingbirds don't do one thing but make music for us to enjoy... sing their hearts out for us. That's why it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.""Mockingbirds are a recurring theme in Harper Lee's only novel. To Kill a Mockingbird, first published in 1960, is justly a classic. It won the Pulitzer Prize, and is studied by almost every schoolchild in the USA. In the UK it has been on the National Curriculum on and off for a few decades. The first half of the book deals entirely with a small town in the Southern United States, a fictitious small town of Maycomb, Alabama. It describes the events there, during three years of the Great Depression 1933-35. The events are described as if they are seen by a young girl, six-year-old Scout Finch. She talks of the special places she loves, the townspeople who live there and their daily lives. For an English reader it is very reminiscent of ""Cider with Rosie,"" in that it conveys a particular place and time, which has now been lost. Also like ""Cider with Rosie"" the child's point of view evokes feelings of nostalgia, but without sentimentality.Scout is caught up in her own world, involving her older brother, Jem, and her father, whom she calls by his name of ""Atticus"". The children befriend a boy named Dill, who stays nearby with his aunt each summer. They invent their own games, and fantasies, one of which involves a neighbour ""Boo"" Radley, the son of a reclusive family. This is fine fodder for the children, who are in turn terrified of, and fascinated by, Boo Radley, although few people have ever seen him. The narrator explains the history of the Radley family, and what has led to the present situation. The first part of the book thus deals entirely with this childhood, and the reader learns through Scout's eyes, the habits and attitudes of the Maycomb residents, in preparation for what is to follow. Scout is beginning to develop both her attitudes and her moral compass. She has an aversion to all things girlish, and because this is a story reported in flashback, Harper Lee shows that Scout is to become a feminist, for the narrator Jean Louise (""Scout"") still has an ambivalence about being a Southern lady. The child Scout also has burgeoning feelings of her sense of fair play, constantly challenging instances in her life, both great and small, which seem wrong to her. One of the most humorous early parts of the novel is the description of the hapless teacher, unused to these Maycomb children, trying to instigate her modern city ways and educational methods. The indignation Scout feels at being disbelieved when she tells her teacher that she can already read, is very entertaining. Scout is told that she must undo the damage Atticus has done, and forbid Atticus from teaching her further. Scout's first day in school is of course a satirical treatment of education; Harper Lee is mocking it. This part of the novel only refers obliquely to what will be the main theme of the second part.(view spoiler)[ The reader learns that their father has been asked by Judge Taylor to defend Tom Robinson, a black man who has been accused of raping a young white woman, Mayella Ewell. (hide spoiler)] The children become very involved with events, and these teach them about the endemic prejudice in this small town, enabling them to form ideas about those who maintain an unjust system, and those who are fighting against it, in varying degrees. The story is exceptionally moving, involving mob mentality, courage, murder, rape, class and gender issues and conflicts, courage and compassion.Harper Lee has said that she thinks an author, ""should write about what he knows and write truthfully"". She has denied that this novel is an autobiography, and yet there are many parallels with people and events from her own childhood. For instance, Harper Lee's father was an attorney, similar to Atticus Finch,(view spoiler)[ and in 1919, he defended two black men accused of murder. (It was his final criminal case; they were convicted, hanged and reportedly mutilated.) (hide spoiler)] Her father was also the editor and publisher of the Monroeville newspaper. In To Kill a Mockingbird Scout's mother died when she was a baby, so is absent in the novel. Although Harper Lee was 25 when her mother, (whose maiden name was ""Finch"") died, she did have a nervous condition which made her mentally and emotionally absent. The author also had a brother who was four years older than her, just as Jem was four years older than Scout. And the family had a black housekeeper, who came daily, just as Calpurnia does in To Kill a Mockingbird.Harper Lee once said, in a 1964 interview, that her aspiration was, ""to be the Jane Austen of South Alabama."" On a superficial level, anyone less like Jane Austen would be hard to imagine! Yet they both have the same underlying sentiment. They both challenged the social status quo and valued individual worth over social standing. For instance, in one episode Calpurnia chastises and punishes Scout, because she embarrasses her poorer white classmate, Walter Cunningham. Atticus respects and endorses Calpurnia's judgment, even later in the book standing up to his formidable sister, Alexandra, when she wants to fire Calpurnia. As Scout herself grows and develops through the book, she begins to view the women of the town, the ""Missionary Ladies"" with a satirical eye, thus alienating herself from their influence.The character of Tom Robinson seems to have been inspired by several events, rather than one actual person.(view spoiler)[ When Harper Lee was 10 years old, there was a story and local trial covered by her father's newspaper. A white woman near Monroeville had accused a black man of raping her. Another case at the time was of a black teenager, who was murdered for flirting with a white woman in Mississippi in 1955. Others have claimed that the book might have been partly inspired by a notorious case in which nine black men were convicted of raping two white women on negligible evidence. (hide spoiler)] However, in 2005, Harper Lee denied any one influence, although she said that several of them served ""the same purpose"" - that of displaying Southern prejudices. It is now thought that this novel, in particular the Tom Robinson character, acted as a catalyst for the Civil Rights Movement. (view spoiler)[The jury at Tom Robinson's trial were poor white farmers, who convicted him despite overwhelming evidence of his innocence. In the background many more educated and moderate white townspeople hid behind the law and supported the jury's decision. Atticus Finch speaks here, as reported by Scout,""""Why reasonable people go stark raving mad when anything involving a Negro comes up is something I don't pretend to understand...I just hope that Jem and Scout come to me for their answers instead of listening to the town""... I never figured out how Atticus knew I was listening, and it was not until many years later that I realized he wanted me to hear every word he said."" (hide spoiler)]This second part of the novel tells unpalatable truths. It reflects a whole spectrum of views, many nuances of prejudice. But it is very tough to read. Harper Lee had a piercing eye, and she did not flinch from telling the truth about people, ugly as it is. Significant social change was inevitable, but also was the fact that it would be conflict-ridden.The parallels in To Kill a Mockingbird with Harper Lee's own life continue. Down the street from them lived a family whose house was always boarded up, and when the son got into some trouble the family's father kept him hidden at home for 24 years out of shame. This family seem uncannily like the Radleys.But perhaps the most striking resemblance to her life is the character of Dill, whom Harper Lee based on her childhood friend, Truman Capote. As a child, Truman Capote lived next door to Harper Lee, with his aunts, while his mother visited New York City. The author has built Capote's imaginative talent for fantasising and story-telling into the character of Dill. Just as the two children were both boyish (the author was a tomboy) but also loved to read, so were Scout and Dill. Both felt alienated from their peers. Because of these strong connections, and the reticence of Harper Lee to be interviewed about To Kill a Mockingbird a sort of mythology seems to have grown up around the author. It is claimed that she is reclusive, and there are even rumours that Truman Capote, with his greater acknowledged body of work, was the true author of this novel too. But in a 2011 interview, Harper Lee finally said why she never wrote again, ""Two reasons; one, I wouldn't go through the pressure and publicity I went through with ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" for any amount of money. Second, I have said what I wanted to say and I will not say it again.""Additionally a letter written by Truman Capote has been donated to Monroeville's Museum. (Monroeville was the town where she grew up, which is represented in the novel as Maycomb.) The letter dates from 1959, and in it Truman Capote wrote to a neighbour in Monroeville that Harper Lee was writing a book soon to be published. Shortly after the publication of To Kill a Mockingbird, in 1960, Capote and Lee both travelled to Kansas. They were to investigate the multiple murders which would provide the basis for the first ever ""factual novel"", a nonfiction novel by Truman Capote. (Here is a link to my review of ""In cold blood"".) The authors thought, lived and worked so closely together, that perhaps it is unsurprising that there are some stylistic similarities and approaches.The narrative throughout is straight to the point and direct, despite the fact that it deals with such serious issues. It is the sort of book which, when read, is deceptively simple, yet has a way of metaphorically reaching into your chest and tugging at your heartstrings. The matter-of-fact descriptions work well, because they are conveyed from the point of view of a young girl, Scout, yet this is part of the novel's greatness. Because Scout with her child's eyes can see the simple truth, there is no posturing and no pretence. The writing is very engaging, although to a modern reader the attitudes displayed by some characters are ignorant and insulting. It may be a shock to come across the word ""nigger"" used so casually in the novel. It soon becomes obvious that this is characteristic of the time, especially when used by the white folk. Scout is mildly reprimanded for using the word by her father Atticus Finch, as it was ""common"". To a modern reader of course it seems far worse, but this was a separatist society. Even in the UK, the description ""nigger brown"" was in common parlance - on clothes, in paintboxes and so on - for the first half of the 20th Century. ""Coloured people"" is also a description now avoided in the UK, having had patronising overtones since the late 1960's. Yet in other countries ""people of colour"" is a perfectly acceptable term. There are worldwide far fewer pejorative words for white folk, perhaps because they historically hold the power.In the Southern States, slavery was a more recent phenomenon than elsewhere in the USA or the UK. And by using such racial epithets Harper Lee portrayed the reality of the time at which it was set, the mid-1930s. It is additionally complicated for the modern reader, since Harper Lee wrote the novel to be told retrospectively. This means that the story is told from the perspective of the 1950s, and actually reflects the conflicts, tensions, and fears of that later time. Nevertheless, it is still extremely unusual for a white person from the South to write such a book in the late 1950s. The accelerating racial tensions clearly bubble under the surface. We can see that this book, by its very existence and popularity, must have had a profound influence on the growing civil rights movement of the 1960's. It was an act of protest showing the possibility of people rising above their prejudices.Yet even this is almost a travesty of the range of views displayed in the novel. Harper Lee's approach to class and race is far more complex than rich versus poor, or black versus white. She does not even take the predictable stereoptype ascribing racial prejudice primarily to ""poor white trash"", although she shows that issues of gender and class may intensify prejudice, and not allow the existing order to be challenged. The complexity of perceptions of racism and segregation is shown in the novel. We gradually become aware of a silent revolution among Americans. Not many are willing to stick their necks out and tell the truth, as Atticus Finch will, but there are those who will support him in secret; there is a growing feeling that racial inequality is both undesirable and unfair.Oddly, there appears to be a kind of caste system in place within the Southern States, which explains almost every character's behaviour in the novel. Scout's Aunt Alexandra attributes Maycomb's inhabitants' faults and advantages to their genealogy. Some families apparently have gambling streaks and drinking streaks. Towards the start the reader learns a detailed background of both the Finch family history and the history of Maycomb. (view spoiler)[Mayella Ewell, being from the no-good Ewell clan, is to be pitied for this, because inevitably she is unable to admit the truth about making advances toward Tom Robinson. (hide spoiler)] The traditions and taboos within this small part of the USA, seems almost to drive the plot, and the characters are powerless puppets. Scout thinks that ""fine folks"" are people with good sense who do the best they can with what they have.The ""fine folks"" shine out of this novel, Atticus Finch being very much the hero. In fact it had originally been named ""Atticus"", but was apparently renamed, when the author realised her story was going beyond being a character portrait. It is also said that at one point she became so frustrated by the novel that she tossed the manuscript out of the window into the snow, but her agent made her retrieve it. Atticus comes across as such a fair-minded individual, with very independent thoughts from the rest of the community, even though he is seen through a very young girl's eyes. He is especially unusual as he treats his children's views with respect - giving them equal consideration as if they are adult. His direct statements, although said to his children, are simple truths for us all, ""You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view... Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it.""""before I can live with other folks I've got to live with myself. The one thing that doesn't abide by majority rule is a person's conscience.""""I want you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand. It's when you know you're licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what.""Frequently the character makes you gasp and stop in your tracks, just by the brevity and accurate simplicity of his words. At other times there is a wry irony which might make you smile,""When a child asks you something, answer him for goodness' sake. But don't make a production of it. Children are children but they can spot an evasion quicker than adults."" Or even, ""Atticus told me to delete the adjectives and I'd have the facts.""Now that child-like view could almost be a maxim for life!This review has not attempted to tell the story, or even add a new analysis of a much-loved and revered book. It is a personal reaction, by a non-American, whose reading of this book has been long overdue. So I was left wondering, what does the title mean? Who actually represents the mockingbird in this novel? There are references to a mockingbird when Tom Robinson appears, and also Boo Radley. Harper Lee herself could also, at a stretch, be thought of as the mockingbird. But personally I think it is more abstract. For surely the mockingbird is innocence. Innocence will fade. In a way this is good, because it is replaced with knowledge. But then knowledge itself can be very dark. The skill of this novel is that all human nature is here, in microcosm. Individual events represent great truths, great rights and great wrongs. There are parts a reader will hate to read, and it could be argued that there should have been more from the black point of view. Yet Calpurnia is a wonderfully drawn character, and we get a sense of Reverend Sykes's strength and dignity too. The scenes in his church are beautifully described with flair and expertise; they are a joy to read. Those in the gallery of the courtroom have a different focus, and in a way seem to have lost the sense of the individual. But this is perhaps inevitable with a story told from a white child's point of view. It does not prevent To Kill a Mockingbird from being a great and perceptive book.Children for the most part grow up. They do not feel the trauma so keenly, but use it to develop and grow. There are signs that one of these children may never become desensitised. Would that be such a bad thing? This is part of the book's honesty and rawness. Yet most of us hope that children will manage to grow, and to varying degrees make the world a better place, without losing their ""song"".My blackbird has gone. Yes, the majestic chorus is there in the background as I wake. And I can hear an individual working out his song even now, with its little tunes and curlicues. But the simple notes of my innocent friend, sung out with such confidence, clarity and truth are no more. They are lost for ever. I know it was inevitable. But I hope he wasn't killed.",96,0.9735,0.109,0.77,0.121,0.4561491237462968,POSITIVE,0.6662
47,1420283623,10/02/2016,5,"As I finished Harper Lee's remarkable classic To Kill a Mockingbird I saluted myself for not having read this before. Nothing like the first time for us to fully appreciate a story. 
I could not remember when the lines above Atticus's moving fingers separated into words, but I had stared at them all the evenings in my memory, listening to the news of the day, Bills to be Enacted into Law, the diaries of Lorenzo Dow--anything Atticus happened to be reading when I crawled into his lap every night. Until I feared I would lose it, I never loved to read. One does not love breathing.
I have never walked in an Alabama small town, much less in the thirties when I wasn't even born, but reading it I felt like I was marching along with Scout and Jem as a child; or sharing with Atticus the need to do whatever it takes to be able to hold my head high. 
""Scout,"" said Atticus, ""when summer comes you'll have to keep your head about far worse things...it's not fair for you and Jem, but sometimes we have to make the best of things, and the way we conduct ourselves when the chips are down--well, all I can say is, when you and Jem are grown up, maybe you'll look back on this with some compassion and some feeling that I didn't let you down.""
I saw the leaves scattered on the ground, felt the wind on my face, the heat and the cold and smelled the smoke of fireplaces. I felt also for Tim Robinson and despised Mr. Ewell. And was enthralled to recognize Boo Radley along with Scout. 
""...I wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand. It's when you know you're licked before you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what. You rarely win, but sometimes you do. Mrs. Dubose won, all ninety-eight pounds of her. According to her view, she died beholden to nobody. She was the bravest person I ever knew.""
After a deep breath I realize that in the end everything was as well as it could be.
Atticus sat looking at the floor for a long time. Finally he raised his head.""Scout,"" he said, ""Mr. Ewell fell on his knife. Can you possibly understand?""Atticus looked liked he needed chearing up. I ran up to him and hugged him him and kissed with all my might. ""Yes sir, I understand,"" I reassured him. ""Mr. Tate was right.""Atticus disengaged himself and looked at me. ""What do you mean?""""Well, it'd be sort of like shooting a mockingbird, wouldn't it?""
And the innocence of the children was still intact, despite all the adults's effort to do away with it. 
The streets lights were fuzzy from the fine rain that was falling. As I made my way home, I felt very old, but when I looked at the tip of my nose I could see fine misty beads, but looking cross-eyed made me dizzy so I quit. As I made my way home, I thought what a thing to tell Jem tomorrow. He'd be so mad he missed it he wouldn't speak to me for days. As I made my way home, I thought Jem and I would get grown but there wasn't much left for us to learn, except possibly algebra.
A masterpiece and an absolute joy to read. A must read without a doubt. Other quotes:
""Do you defend niggers, Atticus?"" I asked him that evening.""Of course I do. Don't say nigger, Scout. That's common.""""'s what everybody at school says.""""From now on it'll be everybody less one-""""Well if you don't want me to grow up talkin' that way, why do you send me to school?""---Atticus was right. One night he said you never really know a man until you stand in his shoes and walk around in them. Just standing on the Radly porch was enough.---""Atticus--"" said Jem bleakly.He turned in the doorway. ""What, son?""""How could they do it, how could they?""""I don't know, but they did it. They've done it before and they did it tonight and they'll do it again and when they do it--seems that only children weep.""

51,1263446589,04/24/2015,5,"I first read this book my freshman year of high school, at the age of 14 or 15. And now, here I am, at 22 and graduating from college reading it for the second time. It's incredible how much difference those 8 years of school have on one's perspective. Though I remembered a lot of the plot from this book, as it's quite memorable and I have seen the film a time or two, there were also a lot of elements, especially characterization, that I see in a totally different light.To me, upon a second reading, this book is really about Jem. The book starts and ends talking about Jem. He undergoes so much change in this story, and while Scout is a great narrator and Atticus is an amazing father figure, Jem is the one that seems to be at the center of what Lee is getting at in this novel. Jem, to me, is the greatest character of them all. On the other hand, Atticus Finch has always been a character that I've idealized and even slightly idolized. I remember him being so full of wisdom and such an amazing father, which he is. But upon re-reading this book, I have come to realize Atticus is very one-note. Yes, he is absolutely brilliant and kind, and if we had more people like him in the world it would be a better place. But in terms of a character, he is quite flat. I don't mean that negatively, but only to point out that his main function in the novel, for me, is to be a paragon of a wise person. He opposes racism tactfully and spiritedly. And he stands up for his beliefs. But other than that, his role as a character seems more as a function to serve Jem and Scout's growth as humans. It doesn't mean I love him any less; I just found it interesting to note how I see him differently now than I did when I was younger.I also forgot how few pages the whole trial takes up of the book. For obvious reason, that is always what I think of when I hear To Kill a Mockingbird. But in reality, it's only maybe 10% of the story. So much of TKAM is about Scout and Jem's antics and life in Maycomb. I loved revisiting their lives and the lives of all their neighbors.I can't give this less than 5 stars because of how amazing it is in so many ways: characters, writing, storyline, and themes.

Harper Lee, who assisted her friend Truman Capote with his epic IIn Cold Blood, was from the south and found a way to contribute to the rising cause of Civil Rights by exposing the moral bankruptcy of racism through the eyes of her young protagonist Scout. besides the difficulties for being a woman writer at this time, she also managed to write this short masterpiece which is in parts utterly terrifying and totally endearing and absolutely unforgettable. One of my favorite characters was, of course, Boo Radley, for whom it was Robert Duvall's first on-screen performance (the same actor from the epic helicopter scene with Wagner blaring from the helicopters over the jungle in 'Nam.) It has lost neither its power nor its relevance even over 60 years after it was first published.

It is an epic novel by Harper Lee who was a close friend of Truman Capote and helped him during his work on In Cold Blood. There are truly few books that pack such a lucid and powerful punch as Mockingbird.

I loved it then for it's fine writing and character studies and it has remained in my memory over the years.It was indeed a joy to revisit and appreciate Lee's wonderful storytelling and ability to create a fully formed character in a few lines. In the cadence of her writing and the way she has captured the Southern speech patterns I almost felt that I could hear her voice relating the story.

I am speechless, honestly!Anybody who is about to read this review, I promise you, you will derive more wisdom about life from this novel than you may have ever been taught you entire life so don’t let the superfluous, flowery praises for the book appear as mere mention of a genius’ creation. No! This book makes you look inside yourself and ask if you have quite learnt to deal with life as nobly as you will come to appreciate it amongst certain characters in the book!Once in a while a book comes along as a paintbrush and you are the canvas it had been seeking for quite sometime….in this event, as the artist and the platform collide, it is perfection happening. This perfection begins to materialise and exist in space from then on and is an eternal entity thereafter….So, Harper Lee’s creation selected me as its perfect canvas and in this mental space of me, it denied the presence of the other canvases it had selected before. The perfection of the art it sketched over my berth has strengthened to immortality and there is literally no other way to describe it! Even “masterpiece” is too disqualified a description here and this is no masterpiece—this is a painting :) over a headspace of a quiet Indian!But this paintbrush took the liberty of coming into my canvas for a bigger reason I believe—it was seeking to offer me a light to travel through the darkness of the world! Because that is the ultimate residual whisper the brush left me with—“I came to show you the way in through this worldly mess!”Lessons and little statements of pure wisdom that will live with me till I cease to exist:1.  People in their right minds never take pride in their talents. 2.  At the beginning of chapter 25, Scout is playing with a roly-poly bug on the porch, and Jem intervenes before she can squash the harmless bug. When Scout asks why she cannot smash the bug, Jem replies, ""Because they don't bother you.” I gave it a lot of thought and realised insects don’t mean to hurt us. They merely exist and only mosquitoes and cockroaches bother us because of what they do. However, I find it verrrrry challenging to go by this line when it comes to certain insects! But it definitely holds so much wisdom for our ways in the world.3.  “Closed doors meant illness and cold weather only” 4.  ”You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view - until you climb into his skin and walk around in it."" 5.  Atticus said that it was a polite thing to talk to talk to people about what they were interested in, not about what you were interested in. 6. Atticus once hung around a conversation with Uncle Jack, stating his concerns around the townsfolk behaviour his kids would inavariably invite as a result of his law duty towards Tom Robinson. That night Uncle Jack stated these words to Uncle Jack when nobody was inside the room: “Right. But do you think I could face my children otherwise? You know what’s going to happen as well as I do, Jack, and I hope and pray I can get Jem and Scout through it without bitterness, and most of all, without catching Maycomb’s usual disease. Why reasonable people go stark raving mad when anything involving a Negro comes up, is something I don’t pretend to understand…..I just hope that Jem and Scout come to me for their answers instead of listening to the town. I hope they trust me enough…..” This helped remind me of a time when my own father scolded me very bad for wanting to learn figure skating against medicine (it was something I badly wanted to do in this lifetime but the time, resources and availability for the same were scarce). So my pursuit of something so far-fetched had infuriated father. Years later, one day, I discovered out of a relative that my father had secretly been asking her about ways to access figure skating grounds abroad (in colder countries I mean). This made me acutely aware of the fact that parents always want your best, only wish for your best and nothing else. So, thank you to the writer of this book! 7.  Atticus taught me the importance of not going around defending myself simply because people failed to notice my contribution anywhere. He says, “…..you just hold your head high and see those fists down.”  My own father said something very similar recently——“When you boss yells at you for an honest, unintended mistake, you just hold your head high and swallow the words like taking one of the most bitter medicines available around—Quinine, for Malaria, responding (not reacting), “I will be learn madam.” I became aware of similar things father had often told me in the past that I hadn’t followed back then as a child. He said that just because somebody tried offending you, it doesn’t mean you alter your ways and hurt them back. Atticus and my father have such similar traits! 8.  One mesmerising lesson I learnt in page 251—> This is where Jem and Scout, Atticus’ children discover in absolute clarity the truth—that even when the people in their kith and kin fought around who was superior in literacy and who wasn’t, even if they rejoiced in their veritable, prideful airs of being a Flinch tribe, they really were all just mere folks in the world. Just people. As in all are equal. So, if they were all real the same——that is merely people—why couldn’t they just get along with each other?  9.  It is not okay to hate anybody.  According to Atticus—“you never really understand people until you consider things from his point of view…..until you climb into his skin, and walk around it.” So both ultimately mean the same almost!(These are only some of all)This part of the novel caused me to pause and stare at the page for a full minute. I have NEVER EVER READ any fiction novel touch upon eternal truths of this kind! Never!So the book came to be a surprise teacher in my journey of life. There is so much I learnt from the novel and incorporate everyday in my life now every moment.Another take….So many times... so many times I found myself laughing I can barely count by now. Two kids plodding into their father, Atticus’ business over and over again, not once, not twice, but 100s of times, mostly for reasons well-meaning from the point of view of a child but  bunching, in the process, entire loads of chaos or order (yes! Order!) into the adult gatherings, or solitary adult lives (Boo Radley’s) they were trespassing in. Along every bump that they stumbled across, they gradually discover traits of gold within Atticus, their father, and quietly discovered, despite the reproaches and commands, a genuinely honourable human who relentlessly taught his children the importance of living in quiet dignity, of nodding past venomous comments from townsfolk over a man’s undying support and humanism for black-coloured people.I couldnot contain myself in many places of humour throughout the novel:---> Sending blood-hounds to locate furniture—-> damn-ham ——>a name synonymous with ‘Jackass’ —->….ear trumpet so enormous that Jem declared it was a loudspeaker from one of those dog Victrolas——> There was a part about Scout dressing up as a “Pork”….I just read that part and I started laughing in the middle of so much work!There are some which are soooo good in inducing laughter that I fear I will be giving too much away if I post them. I laughed so much in the recollection of them yesterday that my parents thought I had lost it! I Suddenly became acutely aware then that in life, nothing really needs to be right, you can just laugh through and through! Laugh at the mayhem! (That is a irrelevant to the story but it just struck me) There was one lady in the book whom I wanted to punch really hard for her nasty remarks. She was by the name Mrs. Dubose. Ohh! Reading her part made all hell break lose in me, I so would have punched her straight through the pages. But the discovery of her underlying mental illness robbed me of this craze and made me aware of the volumes of odd pleasure I derived in the await of justice when the storms heralded her nastiness.  The reason I mentioned the last paragraph was to provide a peep into one of the finest character-creation I have ever come by from any author around.  I repeat I would have absolutely punched this woman if I were Jem. A glimpse into the mastery of English literature that is nowhere discontinuous: “Buzzed with talk, none of which was complementary”  “But her death caused hardly a ripple”   “…..contributing to the aberrations of nature.”  “Felt extremely noble for having remembered and remained noble for 3 weeks”   “Mr. Tate blinked again, as if something had suddenly been made plain to him.”  “Nothing is more deadly than a deserted waiting street.”  Mrs. Merriweather states: ‘Maudie, I am sure I don’t know what you mean. ,’ said Mrs. Merryweather.‘I’m sure you do,’ Miss Maudie said shortly. She said no more. When Mrs. Maudie was angry, her brevity was icy.  Its windows were merely open spaces in the walls, which in the summertime were covered with greasy strips of cheese cloth to keep out the varmints that feasted on Maycomb’s refuse. The varmints had a lean time of it, for the Ewells gave the dump a thorough gleaning everyday, and the fruits of their industry (those that were not eaten) made the plot of ground around the cabin look like the playhouse of an insane child: what passed for a fence was bits of treelimbs, broomsticks, and tool shafts, all tipped with rusty hammer-heads, snuggle-toothed rake heads, shovels, axes and grubbing hoes, held on with pieces of barbed wire.   At a point in my reading of the novel, I very interestingly aligned with Scout, the 6-year old girl of Atticus, who was peeping into Atticus’ business. Let me frame it well…..At about ten o'clock, Jem, accompanied by Scout and Dill, sneaks out of the house and follows his father to the town center. From a distance, they see Atticus sitting in front of the Maycomb jail, reading a newspaper. Jem suggests that they not disturb Atticus and return home…I recall myself sneaking into my father’s clinic, peeping into his business through the door adjacent to his main work-room at precisely the same time I was at this page of the book. I had come to read the novel next to him in his clinic! I see so many traits of Atticus in my own father. Harper helped me recognise so much more about my own father. I am so proud of him honestly! Also, the paintbrush splashed colours, many many many layers in order to depict one undeniable truth—the truth of irrationality and human stupidity. Humans in this painting spoke things like this—> “around here, once you have a drop of Negro blood, that makes you all black!”For the first time ever, I began glimpsing for real the sad plight of black discrimination that existed in parts of the western world, the true colours of this irrationality hitting me with the force of an anvil. It has been something I read about, discuss with my father sometimes but to sink to its bottom, to live a portion of their lives, makes me acutely aware of how foolish the world is! Einstein’s words——“Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe”——is breaking past all doorways of doubt this time.Honestly, I am appalled not merely by the writing but by the throes of human prejudice and its ever-escalating degrees in the world as revealed in the book! No wonder some people choose to become sages!So you will learn about what happened to Tom Robinson and when you do, if you are deeply contemplative, you might want to question if this person ever existed. This is what Google provides—> The origin of Tom Robinson is less clear, although many have speculated that his character was inspired by several models. When Lee was 10 years old, a white woman near Monroeville accused a black man named Walter Lett of raping her.However, maybe the case, the truth remains unshakable.The more I reflect on how their world judged/judges black people and mouthed the plight of Tom Robinson, the more I realise it is only delusion that we are living with. All of it! Delusions multiple-layered, deca-layered covering what nobody knew by direct experience with a human…. I considered how slander works in the community. It does the exact same way!And even if I hold the whole story back, I will allow you to glean into a fractal of this delusion in law from this story of someone I know:Someone very dear to me who stays in Arizona was stripped off his hard-earned designation as a doctor simply because some infamous pictures had found their way into his computer. He once told me in an exchange where I had stated that I was a writer at heart, “For me it has always been to be a doctor.” But by then, his degree had been severed for good. All law efforts had failed to restore it back in place.You know what, this cousin of mine is one the most innocent persons I have ever come by. I know for certain he never carried infamous things, that it was mere bad luck of internet or someone else’s ploy, or a virus or something. And look at what happened!You will be appalled by the messiness of law in Maycomb, very similar to what you read above. Sadly this is precisely how law functions in most of the world.When you believe in a slander, even if it is from a dear person, you have leapt into a delusion of your own (This I learnt overarchingly from this novel)….....………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..If only I could meet Harper Lee once to tell her how much she changed my life….If there is one person in any book who resembles my father completely, it has to be Atticus! I can’t believe a writer I never met did that!!Humbled, that’s what I am—about someone’s creation, about what I learnt about someone I deeply honour, and love from my own life—my father, about life, about black people’s pain, and mostly about not knowing so much about the world! Mostly, I understood the importance of family while also making use of your own brains to question things in a family that don’t stand as healthy. As I shut this book and recollect the streams of images it created in me, I smile at the memory! It’s so beautiful a keepsake!I will remember this book for good! I was crying very hard at the last page-not because it was sad but because it was ending!………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..",79,0.9988,0.075,0.806,0.119,0.4994471121782046,NEGATIVE,0.9973
