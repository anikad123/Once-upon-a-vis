1,1237783050,08/06/2020,1.0,"It’s always Team Edward this and Team Jacob that, but there’s only one real team when it comes to reading the Twilight series. And that’s Team Suffering.Honorable mention to Team Alice.The only character I respect.Everyone else is a nightmare gremlin demon, and also somehow the plot isn’t even fun, and also this book is no joke like 1,200 pages long. I’m pretty sure. Don’t fact check me.You really have to wonder why we all stanned these books so hard in middle school. Were we depraved? What was wrong? Did we just need a juice box and a firm hug?I don’t know, but it’s upsetting. These books really do surprise you with their sheer ability to find new ways to be terrible. If in 50 years a CIA report is declassified outlining the use of this series as a torture mechanism for feminist women who would one day be forced to confront the ways their middle school favorite series traumatized them I wouldn’t be surprised. In fact, that’s a more likely explanation than everyone spontaneously being horrible.Like, Jacob kisses Bella without her consent and tries to manipulate her continuously. Charlie cheers him on for a taking-what’s-his mentality even though it’s HIS OWN KID. Edward kidnaps her when she doesn’t do what he tells her to do.This sh*t is exhausting. WHY IS EVERYONE THE WORST.But Bella is boring as hell so I don’t feel that bad for her. Honestly she needed some excitement forcibly injected into her life.But there isn’t actually any excitement because HOWISTHISSOBORING. The plot doesn’t start until 55% and even then the action is nowhere close to arriving. The whole action sequence is probably about 0.43% of the page count. And for what, you might ask?Easy. To make more time to talk about how important it is to wait until marriage before you get it on.I mean, vampires who kill for pleasure, that’s all well and good, but personally I draw the line at premarital f*cking. Edward literally looks Bella in the eyes and goes “your virtue :) I have to protect it :) everyone knows if you f*ck outside the bounds of holy matrimony you get locked out of heaven :)” and Bella’s just like no yeah sound logic that tracks goodnight!!!It’s fun foreshadowing for how hard this poor girl has to work to get her husband to give it to her in the next book. I cannot emphasize enough the extent to which I would burn everything to the ground in her shoes. One cool thing about this book is that if you were worried about the weird comparing-the-adult-you-love-to-a-child motif being over since Bella and Edward are firmly in <3 now...you don’t have to be!We get everything we need in Rosalie’s tragic backstory, during which she tells us that she’s sexually and romantically interested in Emmett because he reminds her of her friend’s baby. This series really stays giving us everything.Including basic errors and overdramatic writing techniques all in one, like when on one page Jacob says “what’s it like having a werewolf for a best friend?” and on the next page there’s a big dramatic moment where he can’t say the word werewolf…Basically what I’m trying to tell you is that this book sucks.Bottom line: See above.---------------pre-reviewthis book is 629 pages long, and i felt every single one of them.review to come / 1 star?---------------amazing that stephenie meyer wrote a romance about murderous vampires and moral priority #1 is No Sex Before Marriage---------------edward: bella is so hot :) she's a child, but in a hot way :)rosalie: wow look at that guy getting eaten by a bear :) he looks like my best friend's baby :) and that's sexy to me :)me: ---------------only one love triangle in literary history deserves rights",353,0.998,0.112,0.675,0.213,0.596247511279157,NEGATIVE,0.9999

This is a series of events where Bella wants to do something and so she asks Edward, and Edward refuses so she doesn't do the thing. Like she needs permission from him to do what she wants. Honey, he's a senior citizen, I don't think he and you should be in a relationship in the first place. Second of all, I believe you are a human of your own, and he doesn't own you. But I guess Bella is too entranced with his marble skin and golden eyes and sharp cheekbones to care. Every time Edward walks into the room, we have to go over all of this again. Over and over and over again. I get it. I understand that he has skin. And a face. And hair. Apparently only one person understands this, and that's Charlie Swan.

4,322665665,05/02/2012,2.0,"snif. my link is worthless now.this is the virgin daiquiri version of wuthering heights, all watered down, plopped in a blender, and sitting at the folding card table with the kiddies.and they are all gulping it down without knowing that the real deal is way more fun.elizabeth has probably written the best review this book could ever get, with much wittier analogies, so go read that, then come back here for some less-articulate complaints.i messed up. i thought i would have a nice vacation, where i would have plenty of time and concentration to lounge over our mutual friend. instead, there was drinking, and some self-pity, and vacation-langour, and i just couldn't give dickens the attention he deserves. you know who really doesn't deserve my complete attention? stephenie meyer.and why is that? because she has grievously misinterpreted one of my favorite books and has created this sort of chimera byproduct that you can see some of the source material in if you squint, but it's mostly just wrong.i mean, at this point in everyone's lives, the world doesn't need another eclipse review, right? so i am mostly going to just bitch about why this book misrepresents wuthering heights and why that makes me cranky.i suppose it is ambitious of her to have attempted to pepper her vampire romance novels with elements of better works of literature like, say, shakespeare and jane austen. she made the decision to try to shoehorn these characters into the mold of another book, and just didn't bother trying to fix the parts that overflowed or got stuck together.but you can't get mad at a puppy for pissing on the rug.and i knew what i was getting into. before i started reading this, i was aware that this was the wuthering heights installment of the series, so i was obligated to read it on those grounds alone, as i will read any retelling of w.h., for better or for worse. usually worse.and elizabeth had warned me and warned me that meyer got w.h. all wrong and had reversed the roles of heathcliff and linton in a most embarrassing way, but at first, i saw no problems. bella was obviously catherine, edward was heathcliff the true love and jacob was linton,the more ""appropriate"" choice, right? done and done. i kept reading, shocked, thinking, ""but elizabeth is never wrong! what gives??""is she only basing this on appearance? on the superficial? edward is fair and wealthy and very understanding of bella's other ties - like linton (maybe not ""understanding"" in linton's case, but ""ineffectual"") and jacob is definitely darker-complected, like heathcliff, and tied to nature and the earth. but that shouldn't change the basic differences.because obviously edward is the sun to bella's flower face. she cannot be without him - even an afternoon spent apart is unendurable and the intensity of their love is undeniable and unbreakable and blah and blah. jacob is her father's choice for her, which makes him linton, who is technically a better choice because there is less self-destructive passion, and choosing him allows her to remain, you know, alive.but let's back up.because wuthering heights was never a choice between two suitable men. it was a choice between passion and security. head and heart. and linton was never an alternative to heathcliff, catherine always just wanted it all. it was never about love, not with linton.he was simply the path of least resistance, and a means to an end. securing him meant securing a place for heathcliff, whom she could never marry. but who needs marriage when your husband is much weaker than your lover?so, in a more modern version of the story,it makes sense to do away with the financial angle, especially with characters this young. the conflict here is between soul and body. all bella has to do is choose humanity or immortality.easy-peasy. so the reversal of edward and jacob's fortunes didn't cause me too much grief, and still maintains the distinction between edward/heathcliff and jacob/linton. the root of the conflict is the same: to go with an all-consuming passion that ""eclipses"" one's own self and is potentially dangerous (for so so many reasons here) or to go with the one who feels more like ""family,"" who has the paternal approval, who will allow her to remain a living breathing human and retain her entire life...except her passion.fine. this still parallels w.h. and the more specific details: heathcliff goes away while catherine recovers at the linton's. and then he goes on that much longer absence, plunging her into despair. so far, so good. edward leaves bella in new moon and jacob steps in to be there for her and heals her and manages to stick a little bit of him in the space edward's leaving left.but then it gets messy and too many of heathcliff's characteristics start leaking into jacob. because jacob is kind of a dick. forcing kisses, always smirking and pushing his boundaries.he takes much more delight in troublemaking and hurting his rival, and occasionally hurts bella,too. jacob is warm and furious and tied to the forest the way heathcliff is tied to the moors.it is jacob who is the earthbound heathcliff she can remain a grubby child with. meyer rightly recognizes edward as the other half of bella's soul, but extracts all the physical, earthly passion from that role and gives it to jacob.edward protects her like a fine crystal object while his sister dresses her like a doll. what does this sound like?? linton linton linton! bella as catherine is obviously the weakest here. she is nothing like catherine. she moans about not being good enough for edward. catherine was never ""good"" enough for linton, but did that stop her? she barreled in and took what she wanted and refused to leave. bella fusses over everyone and just wants everyone to be happy and self-sacrifices all over the place. i understand that bella's character has already been established in other books, but how can she compare herself to catherine with a straight face?? catherine is a goddamn honey badger. bella is a mother hen.her relationship with edward certainly has elements that are unappealing - who wants to be watched and protected that closely all the time?, but at least i believed in their feelings because they are always reminding me and shoving my face in it.jacob forces himself on her, laughs at her human weakness when she fights back, and tries to separate her from her happiness at every turn. it is both arrogant and insecure, but this is still somehow, but the one who is most ""like family"" who bella's dad wants her to be with. (do NOT get me started on ""parental roles in the twilight saga."")(but quickly: our girl walks through the door from her vacation and already is making dinner for her father who supports some shirtless douchebag's forced kisses, but hates the rich boy who really wants to marry his daughter and preserve her virginity.) but this is another reversal to w.h., too since heathcliff was at least raised as family, even if you don't interpret heathcliff as mr. earnshaw's bastad son. which is not a belief i personally subscribe to, but it is out there. edward is patient and forgiving and gentle and willing to give bella the space she needs before making her decision before she is even aware there is a decision to make.come on - that can't be right!heathcliff doesn't share. he can tolerate linton because he is weak and catherine would not have him harmed, but this vampire zen shit has no place in a heathcliff character, and isn't even a linton quality. that element is pure meyer.in wuthering heights, everyone behaves poorly.in this one, it is really just jacob as linton, i mean heathcliff, i mean jacob.nonsense.apart from any messing-with-the-heights stumbles, this also maintains all the lazy writing and comical details meyer interprets as passion: all the tooth grinding and clenching and chuckling and things said under the breath.oh, and snorting. why does everyone snort? and borrowing lines from wuthering heights to help bolster your characters is like posing next to the chubby girl in photographs to look slimmer. we see your borrowed finery.and the love triangle thing is pretty forced. bella herself doesn't even realize until the end that she is even in a love triangle, so how are we supposed to? honestly, i am aware that there is such a thing as ""team jacob"" because i am a citizen of the world, but god - what's the appeal in some pushy dude who won't take ""no"" for an answer??and why do i excuse heathcliff all his sins? is it because the writing is better? is it because i believe in his love in a way i do not believe in bella? because when i think of heathcliff i feel a physical reaction in my heart. when i think of jacob, i roll my eyes.i actually liked twilight, despite its flaws. new moon was boring and repetitive. this one was irritating because of how much i looove w.h.there is no evil in this book - no revenge. the stakes are too low in the triangle.i picture the three of them at a bar:oh, i made sure jacob would overhear my conversation with bella about our upcoming nuptials. snort chuckle. eeeevil! oh, i knew edward could read my mind so i thought about how sad bella was when he went away. clenched teeth, snort,eeeevil! oh, i married her husband's sister, alternately beating and ignoring her, raised my enemy's son to be an illiterate brute, and ruined everyone's lives while i mourned my one true love. (crickets... the sound of edward and jacob pissing themselves)here is some exciting eclipse information for this year:http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse....and get on that venus one, because you're not gonna get another chance unless you are team edward.and because this still makes me laugh:http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/f03d...i think i have probably made a point or two in that rant somewhere. i wasn't enraged, overall, not really, but it was a pretty bloated book and i really don't get all the love for this series...oh, and a gross dedication:to my husband pancho for your patience, love, friendship, humor, and willingness to eat out.TMI, stephenie meyer, TMI ...come to my blog!",186,0.9979,0.114,0.736,0.15,0.4867920561391898,NEGATIVE,1.0
5,7745588,10/15/2007,2.0,"I had expectations for this book, but I found it to be a terrible disappointment. Where to begin with? First of all, I have lost most of the respect I had for Bella as a character. Her obsession for Edward has really gone overboard, to the point of becoming downright annoying, even unhealthy. She worships the ground he walks on, and is all too ready to dump her parents and friends just so she can spend more time with him without growing old. She doesn't seem to have any serious problem with the idea of making her parents worry, or the thought of never see them again... she's willing to stomp over anything that isn't Edward, even things that can enrich her life. She's like a satellite, her boring life revolving solely around him. She has no self-worth, and spends a good deal of the book whining, complaining and sighing, I really wanted to shake her hard at times and tell her to GET A LIFE. I also find it deeply disturbing that Bella is not more repulsed by the idea of blood lust. How could she accept the thought that she will want to kill people (even her family) so easily, just because of him? Second, Edward has gone from charming to BORING. There is such a thing as being too perfect (read: dull), and Edward fits the mold perfectly. His character is so flat, and how many times can we hear Bella and Edward exchange their love for one another before becoming bored? I mean honestly, how perfect can he be before it simply becomes ridiculous? Most of the book is spent on the two of them fawning over each other and Bella saying over and over and over again how sexy and good-looking he is. Writing tip for the author: You don't need to tell us countless times that your character is wonderful. Actions speak for themselves. Jane Austen didn't need to remind us several times that Mr. Darcy was perfect... he simply was.Third... Jacob. He's the reason I gave this book 2 stars. He was the most compelling character in the book. He wasn't perfect, but he was fun, honest, and very human, making big mistakes, but always trying to do his best... he was impossible not to love. He was real, not a perfect pretty doll with no flaws. Sadly, he was mostly wasted.I also the think the magic Twilight had dissapeared. I liked the books because the author made the whole vampire/werewolf thing so credible, but now, with armies of vampires raging through Washington, credibility has gone out the window. Also the whole book was focused on on a love triangle that everybody knew how it would end, and it made everything very predictable. And how come nobody saw that Victoria was behind the killings, when it was so darn obvious even to the casual reader? Were they stupid? Overall, a great disappointment, I'm not sure if I'll read the next book in the series. Why bother? ",183,0.9738,0.169,0.642,0.189,0.6123377085877086,NEGATIVE,1.0

8,7648327,10/12/2007,1.0,"Eclipse took what magic was in Twilight and survived the boring but interesting New Moon and killed it off with it's length, lack of imagery, inconsistencies, and lifeless characters.The high school romance theme is COMPLETELY abandoned- we have the occasional, random scene since we need some build up to Bella's very boring graduation where she doesn't care. I think the high school theme is one of the reasons Twilight was such a success, the reader was really in Bella's shoes as she solved Edward while attending school to provide a normal break. We sometimes read Bella studying for tests but that is only to pass the time until something supernatural happens, we never see the test nor does she feel ANY concern for her dismal grades. Heck, Bella doesn't even care about a paid stay at Dartmouth even if it's just a cover.The writing dropped dead, like the book itself, and lost its magic- it was by no means great prose but it was descriptive and nice to read. Now we read: ""It was amazing the amount of detail involved in the little figurine- the miniature wolf was utterly realistic"". Well gee, thanks for that- couldn't Meyer have at least told us the wolf's pose?Bella lost the traits that made her relatable and enjoyable- that made us feel that she was Edward's equal. She cares nothing for her parents or human friends, only visiting Angela- the first time we've seen one on one interaction between them- to avoid Edward and to appease Charlie, just so she meets her end of their deal and can be with her boyfriend. Though Bella was the only one to figure out that the intruder and the Seattle newborns were related which is meant to be a sign of her observance, it was so freaking obvious that I knew who was responsible for the newborns the day of the Eclipse Prom when I read the excerpt and knew who made the newborns, but Bella- by accident- only figures this out two days before the newborn attack. Bella whines about everything, referring to Edward leaving the house because of Jacob visiting as being childish and immature despite that we at least know how much they dislike each other and would gladly fight given the chance. She never thinks about how much she is hurting Jacob by keeping him around unless he tells that to her face. For some reason, every good character loves her, even Paul who tried to attack Bella before welcomes her (only joking about the bloodsucker stench). Then she becomes the housewife to Charlie, cooking his meals, cleaning the house as a pastime since Charlie didn't learn these skills in his 18 years of living alone nor when he had to care for his ailing parents after high school. ""And you've given me you. That's already more than I deserve, and anything else you gives me just throws us more out of balance"". The most distressing change is that Bella continues to mope about how unworthy she is of Edward, despite that she had an epiphany at the end of New Moon which finally made her understand that Edward loved her. Then there's marriage- though I understand the argument, I don't understand it coming from Bella. Hey stupid, your true love wants to MARRY YOU and yet all you can think of is the town gossip even though you will leave Forks and possibly only keep contact with your father while abandoning everyone else- so why does their gossip matter!? Bella only agrees to marriage so she can have human sex with Edward before he makes her a vampire; Bella wants sex with Edward while a human (offering to accept his proposal, let him pay for college AND a car, the floozy) but Edward only promises to try if Bella marries him, she agrees... but for the sake of sex because she is till disgusted by marriage. She is still Grumpy about parties, only complaining despite all the effort the Cullens have done for her. Edward lost his suave, flirtatious, and mysterious charm that enchanted so many in Twilight. He's so devoted like a lovesick puppy, that it's not charming. Edward either manipulates Bella to do what he wants (for her sake) or he lets her get her way- only when it concerns Jacob (after they fight of course), but Edward seemingly overcomes his very character and being to give Bella what she wants (which is a selfish and harmful want on Bella's part). I.e. He kept pressuring Bella to go to Florida (to avoid a werewolf/vampire fight for no good reason) and then tricked Bella into wanting to go by setting up an argument with her dad- that made me so mad. But despite how pathetic he was, the fact that he loves Bella so much that he won't even be mad with her despite the second kiss still won my pity- revoking all will and opinions for the sake of Bella just made me sick.What used to be a cute, loyal friend with a crush is now an obnoxious, arrogant, sick boy. Jake forces himself on Bella and she breaks her hand when trying to punch the @$$ yet he still has the gall to put his arm around her and only say that Bella enjoyed it. When Bella gives him the cold shoulder later he merely acts exasperated. Then he does a hurt puppy act- actually pouting- when Bella is too distracted to pay mind to him when all he wants to do is give her a present. He later pretends that he plans to sacrifice himself to allow Edward to be with Bella- I actually bought this, thinking Jake's new tough attitude led to this moment- but as it turns out, it was all a plot to get Bella to kiss him. Between the two, I may actually want Jake for life since he has flaws and hobbies that a couple could work to overcome in their lifetime, but not now; he brought this on himself. Jake never acted like he truly loved Bella but rather that Bella was a trophy to prove Jake bested perfect Edward.Their lovable traits have gone missing, leaving very dislikable characters behind whose flaws are either ignored or always forgiven.On the few good sides we finally learn Jasper and Rosalie's past. Rosalie's was much more interesting to me since she was much more involved in the plot both in her bitterness and actions in New Moon; also because she told Bella her story in a selfless effort to not only amend for her past behavior but try to convince Bella to stay human. I actually felt sorry for her- how she will never sit on a porch with Emmet watching their grandchildren play- it made my throat ache. Yet all Bella takes from the story is how Tanya was interested in Edward.Jasper's wasn't very interesting- maybe it's because I wish I knew what he looked like beyond ""tall, lanky, and blonde"" or because as I read his flat story I kept wondering why Bella never noted a Texan accent- that certainly would have made him more interesting. Jasper's story just lacked any good descriptions or life, it was like reading Interview with the Vampire but without the wonderful imagery or morale lessons- just imagine how dull that would be. But I am happy we learned about him as well as how he and Alice met the Cullens- it sounds so dang interesting; I wish Meyer will write a spin off about Alice meeting Jasper.We also learn the werewolves past... it certainly wasn't as epic as I suspected. So much for natural enemies, werewolves and vampires only became enemies by accident.Speaking of the werewolves- imprinting? Yeah, poor guys, being subjected to such a lame plot device. Meyer, in case you didn't know, imprinting is when a baby animal (most commonly BIRDS) label the first thing they see as their mentor and follow the thing (be it alive or not) as an example of how to survive. Even without being scientifically incorrect it is a bad idea and I felt no romance in there. I feel ill when I recall Bella seeing her relationship with Edward just like werewolf imprinting... that completely degraded their relationship and stripped it of love.Seriously now, why can't the beloved, wonderful, and selfless Bella feel any sympathy towards Victoria who lost her beloved James because of Edward and Bella? Isn't Victoria's situation just like Bella's? Victoria isn't even treated as a villain, we never even see the newborns besides one who isn't at all the threat we wish we saw nor is she even acknowledged until about two days before the attack- she only speaks once and yells once, not even being remotely threatening.Then there's the women, all besides Alice are pathetically devoted to their man. Let's count them: Bella, Renee, Esme with her first husband (she was abused but Meyer didn't have to do that), Leah, Victoria, Jessica, and even Lauren; which leaves Alice and Rosalie the only women to not be crazy without their men and leaves Alice to be the only strong female in the entire series (Rosalie wasn't as strong but better than the others). Look at Leah, her love couldn't resist being with Emily and now Leah is part of the pack and has to share thoughts with Sam, rather than make a strong woman who overcomes her pain and moves on we get a bitter harpy who can't even be nice to Jake for saving her life when she was being cocky, she instead seeks him out to complain how Jake's lovesick dreams of Bella annoy her and then reminds him of how Edward will most likely kill Bella- while smirking.Every one of the books had a mystery- Twilight had Edward, New Moon had Jake, so Meyer tried to spin a mystery with who was making newborns and who is the intruder in Bella's room. With the intruder, Meyer did a good job confusing the characters with the Volturi option, making a decent argument to their possible involvement. The newborns receive the same treatment but nowhere as convincing. She constantly weaves through the two, trying to confuse us while making the characters so dim, none consider Victoria as an option until two days before the attack, and even then it was accident by rephrasing.

9,1842310228,12/17/2016,1.0,"Last year for the 10th anniversary of Twilight, I decided to read and recap (with the help of some wonderful people) that first Twilight book. This was something that I had already done with the ENTIRE Fifty Shades series, so I was expecting Twilight to honestly present us a chance to laugh more and Hulksmash less. I was quickly proved wrong by Twilight and New Moon. Eclipse was, if you can believe it, even worse. It's almost impressive how authors of terribly written abuse porn seem to up their own trash as the series goes along. Every time I asked myself how it could possibly get worse, Stephenie Meyer showed me how. I'll spare you what has already been said a thousand times over about how badly written this book is. It's objectively low quality. Bella is a terrible narrator. She goes from being incredibly obtuse and not noticing #basic things like, I don't know, how her life is constantly in danger to noticing too much, like hearing entire conversations WHILE SHE'S SLEEPING. Cheatery narration litters the prose, but it's clear that the prose doesn't truly matter. Everyone, including the author, is here for Edward and Bella. So, let's instead focus on three things here:1- Bella and Edward's relationship is disgusting. Edward controls every single aspect of the relationship, including how and when Bella expresses her sexuality. He manipulates the crap out of her, keeping her from seeing who she wants to see or going where she wants to go. He plans cross-country travel to keep her from a party. He bribes her into a marriage by withholding sex and conversion, HE TAKES HER CAR APART TO KEEP HER AT HOME, Bella constantly makes comments about how she doesn't even know if she'll survive upcoming meetings with the supposed love of her life, Edward assigns members of his family to baby-sit (read: stalk) his girlfriend. There is literally no reason these two people should like each other and yet, here we are.2- This is SO RACIST OH MY GOD. Meyer appropriates Native stories and legends only to call them GENETICALLY INFERIOR to the white vampires. There is a scene where she has Jacob telling one of the Quileute ""legends"" and it involves the Quileute LITERALLY BOWING DOWN TO A WHITE WOMAN. What's the purpose of that whole, 17 pages portion of the story? So that Bella, a white girl, can see her #firstworldproblems reflected in the story. Even just reliving that for a second makes me livid.3- Jacob is also disgusting. His behavior is reprehensible in this story. He forces himself on Bella multiple times all leading to a kiss he gets by threatening suicide unless it happens. And that's when Bella realizes she also loves Jacob. What kind of message is that???? It hurts my heart that this is the YA that shaped a generation and that generation stills stands up for this. Rape-kisses do not a romantic love triangle make, dear friends. Jacob using his physicality to force Bella into situations she doesn't want to be in is not okay. Jacob emotionally manipulating Bella is not okay. Jacob being the worst is not an excuse for Edward to also be the worst. It's very clear that Meyer is totally about this idea of not being able to help yourself or your love or your actions-- this is the book where the godforsaken concept of imprinting is introduced. No matter how much she tries to explain it as not totally effing creepy that a grown man follows an unwitting baby around until she's basically like Stockholmed into falling in love with him, Meyer will never make this concept okay with me. It's a giant representation for her entire series, though. The boy picks the girl and the girl sits there and takes his love, no matter what.I don't know what else to say. It's book 3 and the plot IS STILL that Victoria is gonna come get and eat Bella, or whatever. They drag it out the entire book and every time something bad happens, it takes them multiple chapters to be like, ""...could it be Victoria?"" YES. IT'S ALWAYS VICTORIA. WHY ARE YOU SO DUMB? There's an awful chapter in here where we get backstory about Rosalie and it's basically that she was gang raped. It has a TERRIBLE message that basically puts the blame of her rape on her beauty. And then Carlisle turns her because she's too beautiful to waste. None of this is addressed or refuted. It just happens and we wander quickly away to talk some more about Edward and Bella's stupid love.Full recaps here.",87,-0.9906,0.159,0.73,0.111,0.5372036759536759,NEGATIVE,1.0

Meyer is a guilty pleasure, and the 629 pages read like 250. Bella, as usual, straddles the line between vampires and werewolves. But Stephanie Meyer has broadened her scope. She adds the complication of additional players and increased the battle forces a bit, adding some new recruits to the forces of real darkness and throwing in some preparatory and fun back stories to bolster the coming action. She offers us a little literary meat and potatoes this time, with frequent references to Wuthering Heights. But whiny Bella still cleaves to Edward while keeping the panting Jacob at something less than paw’s length. There is emotional (and some literal) bodice ripping aplenty.

2020 re-read Continuing my re-read of the Twilight Saga before Midnight Sun. For some reason, Eclipse seems to have really low ratings among a lot of my friends. It's my favorite of the series(still) and I love it so much. I have so much nostalgia for these books, it's hard for me to look at this series objectively. They all hold such a special place in my life. After nursing school, this reignited my flame for loving reading. I've always been a reader, and I did read in school, but while in nursing school I slowed down to a book or two a month. Then once I graduated (in 2008) I picked up this series. I read all 4 books in less than a week and it made me crave reading again and I've not stopped since! Once again, the audio was okay. I'm looking forward to seeing how the audio of Breaking Dawn goes because it has dual narration. Also, less than 3 weeks until Midnight Sun! Eek!

I found myself laughing pretty often and that's a big plus for me. I liked the story, the conflicts, the character development and I even enjoyed the love triangle. At first I thought it will annoy me, but nope (I normally hate love triangles). It was all good.

17,5593491,09/03/2007,3.0,"I succumbed and read Eclipse. I swear this is the last time I will ever write about Stephenie Meyer. I really am sick and tired of her books. Fortunately, the next won’t be released for a year, so I can put the series behind me for at least that long.After offending several people with my dislike for the series, I am starting to feel vindicated. Something about the third installment has pushed some Meyer loyalists over the edge. I have heard students at work complaining about how repetitive the books can be, how little occurs in 600+ pages, how weak Bella is, and how repulsive some of the love scenes are. It feels good to be right.This post isn’t intended to be a ripfest on Meyer, though. I really am feeling over her and her books. But here are a few reasons why: * Throughout Eclipse, Bella compares herself and her relationship with Edward to Cathy and Heathcliff. That is a very brazen—and unwarranted—comparison to make. How big must Meyer’s ego be—how warped her sense of importance—to compare her book to Emily Brontë’s classic? I mean, seriously? * Meyer beats the reader over the head with how much Bella and Edward love each other. Their love is unearthly (like Catherine and Heathcliff’s?); it surmounts all restraints and barriers. There never was such a love as theirs. Yet, for the life of me, after reading the three books I just don’t feel that love. I don’t even understand why the characters are attracted to each other. I’ve been told ad nauseum that Edward is attractive. But is physical attraction a solid basis for love? And what in the world can Edward (or Jacob, for that matter) find attractive about Bella? She whines and complains and trips and faints. Despite reading over 1500 pages about their love, I still don’t buy it. I feel no attachment to or investment in the characters or their relationship. * The physicality in this book really has gone too far. One scene, in particular, is straight out of any romance novel. I’m not criticizing romance novels. They are what they are and don’t pretend to be anything else. This book, though, is masquerading as a young adult classic: “His hand curved around my elbow, moving slowly down my arm, across my ribs and over my waist, tracing along my hip and down my leg, around my knee. He paused there, his hand curling around my calf. He pulled my leg up suddenly, hitching it around his hip” (186). I blush even typing the words. Oh my.Okay, I guess this is a Stephenie Meyer ripfest. I’m not sure why I feel so venomous (wink wink) about these novels. Maybe I’m just jealous that Meyer can write absolute filth and be a bestselling novelist. If nothing else, this should inspire me to write more and write better.",68,0.994,0.068,0.776,0.155,0.4455833333333331,NEGATIVE,0.9995

“He's like a drug for you, Bella.” 
When Bella is torn between Edward and Jacob, while Edward is her world, Jacob is likewise her savior. So who will she choose ?Eclipse made my stomach flutter when I read it first time even if it was quite melodramatic as Jacob tries to hold on Bella and never wants to let her go. My heart was broken by that scene and I did want to die alone. I cried a lot for Jacob, by the way. 
“Look after my heart - I've left it with you.” 
Meyer didn't disappoint me with her third book in the series I love most. Although I've read many books with the love triangles like this one, Eclipse is truly original and classic for me. Plus, she also put some magic in this book and made my childhood full of joy. Thanks so much :))

21,74898670,10/18/2009,2.0,"Looking at other reviews of Eclipse, I'm a little surprised by the comments. Yes, of course it's badly written. Yes, of course Bella and Edward are horrible people, and they have a sick, co-dependent relationship. But that doesn't get any closer to explaining why these books are so popular.I would say that what they have going for them is that the psychology is not unrealistic, and in fact describes uncompromisingly how destructive love can be. It could hardly be plainer that Bella has made an appalling mistake in falling for Edward. Let's see: he's not even human; he's 80 years older than she is; he's a murderer; he's an amoral, controlling, manipulative type, who alternates between anal attention to detail and psychotic lack of impulse control. She knows all this, and she knows that Jacob is a kind, decent person who truly loves her, but she can't get Edward out of her head. Her obsession with Edward leads to her hurting Jacob over and over again, and still she can't overcome her compulsion to use him in increasingly humiliating and cruel ways.What's powerful about the story is that we see it all through Bella's eyes, and watch her swinging back and forward between alternate phases of self-delusion and clarity. She's constantly telling us how good, kind, noble and wonderful Edward is, but her unconscious is also noting all the dreadful things he does, and we get to hear about them too. I thought the recurrent motif with the motorcycles was one of the clearest instances. In New Moon, Edward callously leaves Bella, and Jacob does his damnedest to rescue her from a nervous breakdown. He salvages two old motorcycles for them, and teaches her to ride. Bella loves the feeling of freedom and speed this gives her, and particularly relishes the sense of danger; this is how she also fantasizes that she is close to Edward. After Edward returns, he sees that this is the place where Bella is nearest to escaping his grip. He acquires a much better motorcycle of his own to take the glamor away, and he also gives her a helmet and riding jacket, ostensibly to show that he cares about her safety; but she was only riding dangerously in the first place because he had left her. Finally, when Jacob has almost died defending Bella, his life-threatening injuries are blamed on a motorcycle accident. Edward cleverly exploits this to win over Bella's father, who is smart enough to have been suspicious of him; Charlie remarks that Edward hasn't been putting Bella's life at risk. Jacob can see how adroitly Edward manipulates everyone's feelings, but only comes across as jealous when he points it out. Well, of course he's outmaneuvered. He's a teenager competing against a centenarian; under the circumstances, he puts up a good fight.What I approve of is that Bella is led to understand, through observing her own actions, just what kind of person she is: she's repayed her best friend's selfless kindness towards her by ruining his life. I was reminded of L'Âge de Raison, where Mathieu has a similar epiphany, and is forced to realize that he's not really a good guy; he's someone who's stolen a sizable amount of money to pay for his mistress's abortion. I can't help pointing out in passing that, even though Sartre is less popular than Meyer on Goodreads, he is a noticeably more competent prose stylist. If you liked the plot in Eclipse but were annoyed by the writing, you might want to check him out. Which brings us to the downside of this book. As I've argued, it has worthwhile things to say, but it's just too sloppy and repetitious. Most of the good ideas were already there in New Moon, where they were interestingly underplayed. I'm guessing Meyer got a ton of fanmail after the second volume, and felt that she had clarify things; some of the time, I feel she's more answering a reader's letter than telling a story. Come on Stephenie, you're better than this. Do your own thing, and remember that ambiguity usually improves a novel. And if everyone in the world who believes in sparkly vampires claps their hands, maybe you'll even learn how to write.",59,0.9946,0.117,0.712,0.171,0.6162937062937061,NEGATIVE,0.5337
22,15560746,02/16/2008,4.0,"Sparked by a recent conversation with my friend Hillary, I have decided I need to post my thoughts about a certain series of novels written by Stephenie Meyer. Particularly the relationship between one, Bella, and the object of her affection. The supposedly uber hot vampire, Edward.Believe me when I say Edward has been well cast in the movie which is scheduled for release in December of this year. I thought Robert Pattinson was exceedingly good looking when I first saw him in Harry Potter (as Cedric Diggory) and I eagerly await his debut in a role that will likely earn him unending fame amongst giddy teenage girls for years to come.But enough about young hot guys whose posters would have hung on my wall as a teenager.Besides having a knack for catching spelling and punctuation errors I think a lot about how a certain book might influence it’s audience, and what I think the author should have done differently in writing it based on that.Can you see why I haven’t written a novel yet? I’m too busy thinking about subtle messages I want to convey instead of the actual story. But I digress.The main audience in the case of the Twilight series, are a bunch of giggly teenage girls with egregious romantic notions that play out in their daydreams over and over, or which they speak to each other in hushed tones during sleepovers. Oh, and grown women who are often silly school girls at heart. Ahem….***Warning - Spoilers Ahead!***I devoured all three of Stephanie’s books, each within a day of borrowing them. I didn’t think much about them initially. I was caught up in the intense romance, the stunningly accurate view through a teenage girls mind. I identified immensely with Bella and her feelings of being so very ordinary. I also understood her intense attraction to Edward. I always crushed on the mysterious guys. The dangerous guys.But the more I’ve mulled over this vehement love story, the more concerned I’ve become in what I anticipate will be its ending. Especially when thinking about the thousands of teenage girls who worship this series. So I say….Bella really needs to break things off with Edward.Let me offer up my reasons for this before any of you kick me:1. Holy Co-Dependent Relationship Batman!Co-Dependant relationships are never healthy and Bella and Edward have got a doozie of one going on. It may not have started that way but it’s turned into that. Grieving for those we’ve loved and lost is certainly natural but Bella took it well beyond that point, ceasing to be anything but a drone doing only what she had to in order to survive after Edward left. Then of course Edward has sworn to kill himself shortly after the time Bella has died.Sweet? Romantic? Not on your life.Other problems with their relationship that hinge on co-dependency:* Lack of interaction with other friends and acquaintances* Bella’s mental attention focusing solely on relieving Edward’s pain i.e. If she’s a vampire, he won’t struggle with wanting to kill her anymore. If she’s a vampire, she’ll finally be worthy of him.* Feeling her life is meaningless without him.2. Bella is being smotheredEdward and his family are controlling Bella. They may not be doing it on purpose but that doesn’t make it any better. Bella seems to attract danger and Edward feels the need to protect her. He watches her all night, she gets driven by them everywhere. She rarely does anything of her own accord or by herself and when she does she know she’ll face Edwards disapproval afterwards. Their relationship has become more and more like a naughty little child disobeying their master. *shudder*3. They don’t really love each otherThey lust each other. The only basis for Bella’s devotion and supposed love that I can find are descriptions of Edwards danger and his beauty. And do you think for one moment that Edward would have taken a second glance at Bella (other than to eat her) if he had been able to read her thoughts? He was bound to be obsessed with the first girl who had the power to block him out. They are enchanted by the mystery of each other. Is this love? No. Could it turn into love? Certainly. But book three definitely had their relationship getting more and more icky.4. My belief in number 3 was only reaffirmed by the part Jacob has played.I won’t tell you that I think Bella should end up with Jacob instead. But it would be healthier than being with Edward. Being around his cheerful and friendly self brought some vigor back into her life. It was good that she didn’t perceive him as a possible love interest or she may have latched on to him in rebound as she had to Edward in the first place, becoming more needy and dependent on his feeding her constant reassurances than she had been with Edward. Slowly and without force, Jacob’s friendship brought her back to life, and though she still grieved for Edward she was finally living again.I also agree with Jacob that eventually she would have been happy without Edward. She would have maybe even realized that her love for Jacob was real and something deeper than the one she had with Edward. Alas that Edward has to go off and try to kill himself!As an adult I’ve looked back on some relationships I had as a teen in which I was sure I really loved the person. I did care deeply about them. It was love of a sort. But not the kind that would have withstood the fizzling of passion and the inevitable changing of beliefs and shifts in personality we make until we die.So Stephenie Meyer, if you’re reading this, do you really want to send a message that co-dependent relationships are romantic? That ceasing to live for yourself is romantic? That being willing to kill yourself over the one you love is romantic? That love is based on mystery, danger and good looks alone?I don’t care who she ends up with ultimately (though I do hope that if it’s Edward their relationship improves) but please do us all a favor and have Bella learn to think and live for herself and grow out of this sickening neediness and willingness to be controlled.",58,0.999,0.084,0.729,0.187,0.5590313208616781,POSITIVE,0.8456

Either you hate it or love it and there’s barely anyone in between. I decided not to take anything too seriously while reading this series and it’s helped me love every book in this series so far. There’ll be scenes where people will call it “cringe” and I’ll just be sitting there laughing and enjoying the “cringe” scene. I’ll never join in on defending or attacking this series because for me it’s purely fun escapism that I know is cringeworthy but I can’t help enjoying it.This book had the best blend of my two favorite characters so far. Twilight was lacking on the Jacob scenes and New Moon was lacking on the Alice scenes, but this one was fantastic. I still don’t hate Jacob as much as everyone else does. He definitely did some things in this book that disgusted me and were unacceptable but I feel like that was somewhat of a forced angsty “love triangle.” The series would’ve been better leaving him as only a friend who doesn’t try to move past the friend zone. I’m not going to defend Jacob’s actions, but I will say that Edward isn’t great either. He’s way too possessive of Bella and he was very rude to Bella when he first met her. I sort of feel like this aggressive only team Edward or only team Jacob thing that exists in the fandom isn’t healthy because they both aren’t perfect.I don’t really have too much else to say for this book except for a few spoilers, which I’ll of course use spoiler tags to talk about, but Eclipse was a great third book in the series. The pacing was full steam ahead and I liked how the side characters got more of a backstory in this one. I can’t wait to read the rest of the books in this series.(view spoiler)[Five things I need to comment on because I think it’s important that no matter how much you like a book, you need to call out any problematic scenes:-Imprinting: I knew it was coming and it did gross me out. I won’t dock points for it, but in case I haven’t mentioned it enough on Goodreads, Stephenie Meyer’s books have issues with pedophilia and questionable age gaps. Imprinting is just taking that issue further. It’s grooming to the max to have Quil find his soulmate in a two year old and then wait until she turns 18 before he gets together with her romantically. I’ve seen spoilers for Breaking Dawn, so I know what’s coming, but yuck. Why must Stephenie Meyer include pedophilia and inappropriate age gaps in all of her books?-Jasper being a Confederate soldier… I literally laughed out loud. It’s so stupid and unnecessary, considering what the Confederates stand for, but I wasn’t expecting anything else from an author who only wants white vampires.-The first super explicit bad representation of Jacob’s tribe was in here: “my money’s on the big Indian.” Uh really? It was bad enough that the side character werewolves (who all aren’t white) aren’t very likable but that line was unnecessary.-And Jacob’s POV in the epilogue using the r-slur to refer to his sling. There was no need for it but yet there it was.-OH, I almost forgot to mention this! This isn’t problematic but it sure as hell would make family gatherings awkward for Stephenie’s family: a lot of Stephenie’s sibling’s names were used in this series. Most notably was Jacob and I know most people hate Jacob so imagine what the family reunions look like for Stephenie’s family… (hide spoiler)]",59,0.9399,0.138,0.711,0.151,0.5423458948458948,POSITIVE,0.9973

25,838236839,01/29/2014,1.0,"I just don't understand how a book that is so long could literally feel like there's nothing going on. Instead of a formal review (which I lowkey can't even bring myself to write) I'm going to be discussing, in a list, a few issues that I had with this book. At this point, I'm sure everyone realizes that I'm hate reading these books. I have nothing to gain (knowledge or enjoyment) at this point. *Charlie and Renee both see something wrong with Bella's relationship with Edward. They feel like she's isolated from her friends, they feel like Edward is constantly around never giving Bella space. HOWEVER, neither do anything to change the situation. I, as a parent, understand the fragile experience that comes with teenage dating and trying not to ruin the relationship that you have with your child; however, I feel like all of that goes out the door when there are signs of your child being in an abusive relationship. Charlie is a piece of shit in this book because he laughs at the idea of Jacob forcing himself on Bella and never really addresses it until later. The instant he found out that someone forced themselves on his daughter he should have been ready to light a fire under their ass. *Once again, the Native representation is horrible from her lack of addressing domestic violence to placing Jacob in situations where he is intentionally made into a villain/bad guy especially the scene where Jacob forces himself on Bella which, in my opinion, was extremely out of character for him. Then there is this whole concept of imprinting which makes a lot of the Native community come off as individuals that participate in grooming and pedophilia. *Jasper IS IN THE FUCKING CONFEDERATE ARMY and that shit is romanticized. Like, I just can't get past that part. She never really addresses the fact that he fought for a group of individuals that wanted the right to maintain slavery. *In Chapter 13, a Mexican girl is described as being pretty in spite of being Mexican. It was almost like that phrase ""you're pretty for a ____________"" (fill in the blank with any POC). *Bella was forced to bargain her virginity in order to become a vampire. Honestly, this made no sense to me. She doesn't feel comfortable marrying Edward and explains that they aren't mutually exclusive, but instead of Edward listening he chastises her and calls her emotional. That's misogyny in it's best form. *A lot of the novel was dedicated to the battle between Edward and Jacob and it got boring quickly. Edward was cruel and disgusting the entire time and honestly wanted to prove that Bella was ""his property."" Clearly I didn't like this book. If I could give it half a star I would, but that isn't an option here on Goodreads. I know that these books changed the world of YA, but honestly they ARE NOT good. They are problematic and push some really bad narratives.",53,-0.8362,0.126,0.768,0.106,0.5601363008971705,NEGATIVE,1.0
26,27846975,07/21/2008,2.0,"Stephenie Meyer should be sending handwritten thank-you notes to every sorry teenager (and masochistic adult) who continues to slog through her Harlequin romp of a series. Were it not for what I will generously term my ‘anthropological interest’ in this ever-popularizing series, I for one would certainly be leading a caravan out to the old country to demand that she return the four and half hours that I lost reading 
New Moon
. Even skimming, I felt robbed. So why continue, you ask? Well, primarily, I’m invested in the phenomenon. Meyers was recently reviewed in The New York Times. I’ve seen no less than six people reading Twilight on the subway lately, and half of these folks were adults (including one businessman, briefcase and all). My Netflix envelopes all have ads for the upcoming flick. Barnes and Noble, The Strand, Amazon, and probably every bookstore owner who knows how to turn a buck are pumping who knows how much ad capital into publicizing the imminent release of the last installment. This is a thing now, a real thing, and it’s interesting to know what the kids are reading these days.But honestly, the real reason I keep reading? Because I want to know if--after three epically long novels, an abyss of teenage drama and male dependency, a vampire war, and an impending marriage, Bella finally gets to have sex. Yeah, I know. I sound like a dirty old man. But what do you want to bet that half the Meyers acolytes out there really want to see their heroine lose it, too. Meyers can congratulate herself—half the reading world under the age of 30 is suffering from a major case of vampire-lover-blue-balls right now. Just let Bella get some already.Bella’s persistent, unabashed, and fanatical insistence on having sex is perhaps the most redeeming thing about this series. So much of Bella’s character is lamentable—she’s selfish and dependent and obsessive and melodramatic and can’t seem to grasp the basic consequences of any of her actions. But when it comes to hormones, Bella is remarkably uninhibited. She verbalizes what she wants—sex—and acts on it (at least tries to) without the least bit of embarrassment or abashedness. She is frank about her desires and ever-so-thankfully, has not once been punished for having them. (She’s also, it bears noting, pretty stringently opposed to the idea of marriage. As she tells Edward when he’s proposing to her, yet again, she never wanted to be That Girl. The girl who runs off and marries her boyfriend after graduating from high school in a small town.)Bella’s rampant horniness and anti-marriage sentiments seem out of place within the sphere that Meyers has created. After all, Edward doesn’t want to have sex with Bella until they are married and claims that in his 90+ years he hasn’t had sex yet (he was waiting for the right lady, it seems). And eventually, Bella does cave. She agrees to get married, and randomly decides that she wants to wait until after the ceremony to have sex with Edward—even after he finally gives in to whatever hormonal impulses vampires have and tries to seduce her. But kudos to Meyers for allowing her characters to openly discuss sex—and even have Bella’s father urge her to ‘be safe’ when she has sex—without punishing them for doing so.Bella’s sexuality is the only really interesting thing about her character. Other than that attribute, it appears that she exists solely as a plot device. The ultimate catalyst, she gives—inexplicably—all other characters in the book a purpose. She’s got two magical beings actively ‘fighting for her.’ Whole vampire armies are created solely to destroy her. Why does anyone care so much about this girl? I couldn’t tell you. But I suppose we should be glad that they all do though, because they are all so much more interesting. Even stalkeresque, one-track mind Edward. Eclipse is far more interesting than the previous two installments precisely because so much of the plot has little to do with Bella. We hear about the origins of the Quileute werewolves. Find out about Rosalie and Jasper’s lives before they became vampires. Subplots with minor characters abound. The way I figure, Meyers has two options when it comes to completing her series—either go for gold and spend half of the book on super-sexy softcorn teen porn, or find someway to deflect the narrative away from Bella. But chances are, with Bella’s impending vampire transition, we’ll be isolated with her for another 500 pages. Oh, for this to just be over already.",51,0.9675,0.051,0.864,0.085,0.458562361062361,NEGATIVE,0.9957
27,1166171374,01/12/2015,2.0,"The good:1. Meyer's writing has improved. The dialogue flows better, and some of the humor is actually funny:""Do you have a medical degree that you never told me about?""""Just give me the chance to decide whether or not I'm going to throw a fit over taking you to the hospital.""He made a face of mock horror. ""Please, not a fit!""""If you don't let me see your hand, a fit is guaranteed.""2. Bella's emotions seem much more authentic than they have in past Twilight books:""It's the fourth? Of June? Are you sure? It can't be! How did that happen?""I felt like someone had kicked my legs out from under me. The weeks of stress, of worry...somehow in the middle of all my obsessing over the time, my time had disappeared. My space for sorting through it all, for making plans, had vanished. I was out of time.And I wasn't ready.I didn't know how to do this. How to say goodbye to Charelie and Renée...to Jacob...to being human.I knew exactly what I wanted, but I was suddenly terrified of getting it.She starts to think much more practically about what life will be like as a vampire, and she's (finally!) a little afraid:I'd always known that I would be different. I hoped that I would be as strong as Edward said I would be. Strong and fast and, most of all, beautiful. ...I'd been trying not to think too much about the other things that I would be. Wild. Bloodthirsty. Maybe I would not be able to stop myself from killing people. Strangers, people who had never harmed me. ...People who'd had lives. And I could be the monster who took that away from them....If I really were somehow like that...could I possibly be me? And if all I wanted was to kill people, what would happen to the things I wanted now?She loves Edward, but she doesn't want to marry him right away – maybe not ever, certainly not the second she graduates:""I'm not that girl, Edward. The one who gets married right out of high school like some small-town hick who got knocked up by her boyfriend! Do you know what people would think? Do you realize what century this is? People don't just get married at eighteen! Not smart people, not responsible, mature people! I wasn't going to be that girl! That's not who I am.""I love the fact that she sees no contradiction between feeling like this about marriage and being perfectly ready to commit to an eternity of vampiredom with Edward. People are like that. Maybe not with those exact issues, but this scene rings true nonetheless. 3. Speaking of fun stuff, we learn that a vampire history book would be way more interesting than the textbooks most of us snored through in high school:""All hell broke loose – and I mean that more literally than you can possibly imagine. We immortals have our histories, too, and this particular war will never be forgotten.""I liked the flashbacks to vampire history. I wish there had been more of that.The bad:1. Vampires still purr.""You can always run later,"" Edward purred.2. Edward's still totally condescending toward Bella.And then his fingers were on mine, holding them still.""Are we a little impatient today?"" he murmured.""Bella."" He rolled his eyes. ""You aren't exactly the best judge of what is or isn't dangerous.""3. Bella still adores Edward beyond anything anyone could possibly deserve. He's the whole point to her life. Without him, she's nothing. When he's out of the room she just wanders aimlessly, not knowing what to do with herself. Everything and everyone else in her life comes a very distant second to him. On seeing them together, Bella's mother tells Bella: ""I wish you could see how you move around him. ...You orient yourself around him without even thinking about it. When he moves, even a little bit, you adjust your position at the same time. Like magnets...or gravity. You're like a...satellite, or something.""Bella's mom, who's been presented as flighty and rather air-headed, is smart enough to be concerned about this. Bella, who claims to be the practical, sensible one, sees nothing wrong with this at all.4. Stephenie Meyer is still abusing punctuation. See ellipses in above quote, which show us that Bella's mom talks just like Captain Kirk. So, apparently, does Jacob:""Well...I was wondering...do you...y'know, kiss him?""""You said a few weeks....When, exactly...?""Whoops – so does Alice, and she's my favorite character in the series:""The timing of it was too perfect....This visitor was so careful to make no contact. Almost like he or she knew that I would see....""Oh, and let's not forget my old favorite: ellipses with commas at the end!""Jake...,"" I started to whine.""Dad...,"" I moanedAnd speaking of forcing punctuation into unnatural positions, dashes are shoved behind commas:""What --,"" I started to ask.Question marks are forced to make out with exclamation points:I took another deep breath. ""Don't worry?! You sliced your hand open!""And I know this doesn't have anything to do with punctuation, but Stephenie Meyer is still having trouble with the same verb she abused in the first Twilight novel:My heart, racing already, spluttered frantically.(It totally didn't.)The ugly:1. In the name of ""protecting"" her, Edward doesn't tell Bella about threats to her own life. He insists that he and his family are able to save her from any harm, so there's no need for her to worry her little head about anything:""You don't think Bella has a right to know?"" Jacob challenged. ""It's her life.""""Why should she be frightened when she was never in danger?""""Better frightened than lied to.""As always, Edward doesn't seem to realize how patronizing he's being. Would he put up with someone ""protecting"" him by keeping him in the dark? Of course not. He'd hate it. Anyone would. But he refuses to put himself in her shoes. Instead, he grants himself unlimited power to make decisions on her behalf and for her own good.2. Edward controls Bella, again in the name of protecting her. He acts like a textbook abuser: isolating her from her friends, making her afraid of him when she breaks the rules he's laid down for her. He sabotages her car to keep her from going to see Jacob, whom he insists is dangerous. Sure. Except Jacob spent the whole last book taking care of Bella, saving her life at least once if I recall correctly – and he was a werewolf back then, too, and in even less control of his powers than he is now. 3. Edward enlists his family to help keep Bella prisoner when he has to go hunting. She grinned, and turned the volume down until it was just background. Then she hit the locks and the gas in the same second.""What's going on?"" I asked, starting to feel uneasy.What's going on is that it doesn't matter what Bella already had planned for the next few days (and she does have plans); Edward's sister Alice is keeping her under lock and key until Edward gets back to take over the job.I guess I shouldn't be so enraged. Bella shouldn't, either:""I know you're frustrated that he's keeping you locked up like this, but don't give him too bad a time when he gets back. He loves you more than you know. It terrifies him to be away from you.""This is from Rosalie, Edward's other sister. Stalking: a game the whole family can play!4. Edward makes Bella think she's crazy – yet again in the name of ""protecting"" her:My imagination was sadly out of control. I'd taken a perfectly normal afternoon and twisted it until it looked like Edward was going out of his way to keep things from me. I needed therapy.You do. Specifically, you need a therapist to help you get away from this guy, because he is going out of his way to keep things from you and he wants you to think you're just imagining it. This is called gaslighting, and it's not something you do to someone you care about. It's something you do to someone you want to destroy from the inside out.5. Bella hands Edward all possible power by making it clear that however much his behavior may upset her, she won't do anything about it. She won't break up with him. She won't tell Charlie how he's treating her. She won't bring it up with Carlisle and Esme and ask them to please tell their son to stop being an abusive, manipulative jerk. She will endlessly forgive in the name of keeping the peace. (The phrase ""I didn't want to fight with Edward"" appears with sickening frequency, and is always followed with her deciding that sighing and giving in is the only way to avoid a fight – and of course a fight must be avoided at all costs. Why?)6. After two and a half books of seeming like the good guy, Jacob pulls some serious jerk moves. He knows that Bella loves Edward, but he wants to convince her to give him a chance. Especially since Edward can't give her a normal life, while being with Jacob would mean she'd be able to see her mother and father and have kids of her own. Fine. What does he do to try to win Bella over? He forces a long kiss on her:His lips forced mine open, and I could feel his hot breath in my mouth.He doesn't care that she's skeeved out and furious afterward:""Just let me drive you home,"" Jacob insisted. Unbelievably, he had the nerve to wrap his arm around my waist.She jerks away from his touch – and then lets him drive her home. Even though she has perfectly good alternatives and is by no means stranded or in danger without Jacob's help. She just gives in.""Fine!"" I growled.Her dad cheers Jacob on when he hears about what happened:""Good for you, kid,"" Charlie congratulated him.When she shows him how badly she hurt her hand when she attempted to punch Jacob in the face for kissing her against her will, his response is:""Maybe you should pick on people your own size.""What a great dad!Later on, Bella uses kissing as currency, and in the process finds out that – aw! – she's loved Jacob all along. Whee.7. How about that ""imprinting"" the werewolves do. I know it's supposed to be romantic, and I do understand the appeal of the idea of a man becoming utterly, devotedly besotted with his soul mate in a single glance. I really do. But it gets creepy when it can happen to a man who's already in a relationship with a woman he loves:""Sam did love Leah. But when he saw Emily, that didn't matter anymore.""It gets really creepy when the Emily in question ends up returning his love because he feels so bad after mauling her. Yes. He goes werewolf and scars her for life. He feels bad. She feels bad that he feels bad. And they live happily ever after. And it gets beyond creepy when, well:""Try not to be judgmental, okay?""I nodded cautiously.""Claire is two.""And Quil, who just imprinted on her, is a grown-arse man.""You're making judgments. I can see it on your face.""Yep!""It's not like that; you've got it all wrong. There's nothing romantic about it at all, not for Quil, not now. ...Quil will be the best, kindest big brother any kid ever had. There isn't a toddler on the planet that will be more carefully looked after than that little girl will be.""Um...""And then, when she's older and needs a friend, he'll be more understanding, trustworthy, and reliable than anyone else she knows.""But...ew...""And then, when she's grown up, they'll be as happy as Emily and Sam.""Right up until she tells him she's in love with someone else, and then he mauls her like Sam mauled Emily?""But why wouldn't she choose him, in the end? He'll be her perfect match. Like he was designed for her alone.""In the words of the immortal bard, GROSS.ConclusionI think Meyer's writing improves a bit with every book, and I do think she has some innovative ideas in this series. It's pretty hard to think of anything new to do with vampires or werewolves. I give her full credit for succeeding with both. But these books just aren't my happy place. I want more plot and less romance. I spend too much time too angry at how Bella is treated by the alleged good guys. She speaks up more for herself in this book than she has in the past, but it's just not enough.Not sure I'm up to reading the next one.

28,794904826,12/20/2013,3.0,"Can't help feeling slightly disappointed by this. Having seen the movie, I expected tons of action. Instead I got none. I also got lots of Bella whining. I can't seem to make up my mind on whether I like or her this character. I always seem to change my mind when I'm about to make a decision. We all can agree that Meyer isn't the best of writers, but she's not bad either. I just wish that the book was a little more involved in action and be less about Bella's indecisiveness on whether or not she is in love with Jacob. The love triangle has me cussing. I am not overly fond of Jacob, not because he's trying to steal Bella from Edward, not even close. I don't like him that much because he's pretty immature. I even think that maybe, just maybe if he'd just let Bella make up her mind on her own, maybe she'd even choose him. But forcing himself on her, either directly or backstab-bishly. I really believe that if Meyer would be less hell-bent on describing all the ways Bella loves Edward or how she's in love with two people at the same time, and instead created some action sequences, it would have been a really good book and an excellent series overall. If I were her, I'd probably have written the book in a multiple pov manner (more Bella and Edward of course, but why not some of the wolf pack or the other Cullens?) and in that way we'd see many more things.I will, of course, read the next book. I had liked both parts of the movie so why shouldn't I like the book, especially if it's more condensed. I like the drama but I want some action and variety, too.

29,22744435,05/22/2008,5.0,"I'm not sure I can write a very cohesive review for this, so I'm just going to mention some of my major thoughts and go from there.Some of my favorite parts:The title. It makes such beautiful, perfect sense now, that any worries I had about the final result of the Edward/Jacob question seem so silly! Way to come up with a perfectly suitable title with perfect imagery. :DAsshattery. Good grief, but there was a lot of jerky behavior in this one, and most of it was coming from Jacob. He ticked me off so badly in this one that while I felt sympathy for his situation, and understanding of his position, he lost a lot of respect from me by the way he treated Bella. From practically assaulting her with unwanted kisses, to barely even seeming to CARE that she BROKE HER HAND on his thick skull (jaw) trying to fend him off, to his constant immature belittlement of Edward/the Cullens even though he knew how much it bothered Bella... ARRRGH. Edward is SO MUCH MORE MATURE. Edward was willing to put forth the tiny bit of effort it took to start calling Jacob by his name, and TRY to treat him with greater courtesy for Bella's sake, whereas it took Jake forever to do so. I DO understand where Jake is coming from - what he is trying to make Bella see, so that she realizes she has another option for a loving, happy, mortal life - but I just think he is going about it in a very wrong way. (Even though he DID get through to her in the end.)The scene in the tent. LOVVVVED this scene. It was kind of amusing that Bella had to be drifting off through it, or we wouldn't have gotten the scene at all (i.e. if Bella isn't awake for it, we can't know about it since the book is from her POV). This scene was GENIUS. I was so happy to see Edward and Jacob finally open up to each other and give some real answers, really communicate; also it was fascinating hearing Edward wax poetic on the exquisite torture he felt watching Jacob keep Bella warm, something he physically isn't capable of doing - or in fact, the torture he felt anytime Bella was with Jacob, even though he refused to show it in order to spare Bella pain. I loved that by the end, they really did understand each other a little better. Edward realizes that Jacob really isn't that bad of a guy, and Jacob does realize that Edward truly loves Bella. What really cemented my love for Edward over the ""pushy, obnoxious dog"" was the close to this scene (I'm paraphrasing here):Edward: ""You know, if we weren't natural enemies, and you weren't trying to steal the core of my existence, I might actually like you.""Jacob: ""Yeah... if you weren't a disgusting vampire, and weren't trying to suck the life out of the girl I love... nahh, not even then.""AUUUUGH. It's so much nobler that Edward is willing to give Jake SOME credit, really try and look for some redeeming qualities, for Bella's sake. Immature, arrogant obnoxious dog. :p I love the line somewhere in there about ""May the best MAN win."" ""That's exactly right, pup."" Hahaha.All in all I do think it's really important that Jacob does finally make his point - Bella IS in love with him. And she SHOULD have all the information so she can make an informed decision about her mortality. I'm just darn glad she knows IMMEDIATELY that although she is in love with Jacob, she is still deeper in love with Edward. *whew*The whole scene after that, with Bella laying on the sleeping bag in the tent waiting for the avalanche to relieve her guilt over her feelings for Jacob, and then Edward's complete forgiveness (he even describes it as a consequence he has to accept for having left Bella earlier)... that whole section broke my heart and then sewed it back together again. I was so worried about how Bella's revelation about Jacob would be received by Edward that I actually cried in relief a little when he said ""I'm not mad at you, love."" *swoooooooooooon* That is one noble, completely mature and smitten vampire. *lol*...I think these are probably some of the most angst-filled books I've ever read, and I don't even care!Anyway, this book definitely tears things up emotionally but the resolution is sooooo worth it. Rosalie's and Jasper's stories are intriguing and sad, and I loved seeing them (especially Rosalie) make the effort to open up to Bella. She is most definitely part of the family already, vampire or not.Other tidbits... I think Bella's request is perfectly legit, but I'm all proud of Edward for protecting his virtue. Hahahaha. What a great twist on the whole thing. Book four should certainly be interesting. *smirk* And... and... Edward giving Bella his mother's ring and finding out that it fits her perfectly... and his glorious, glowing joy... so great!Oh, one more bit of asshattery, mostly redeemed: Charlie was being a jerkface for a lot of this book. I know he is incredibly furious at Edward for nearly destroying Bella by leaving - but then again, Edward did it because he actually thought it would be better for her, and tried to give her the option of not being with him. It's an option she just absolutely doesn't want. I couldn't believe how downright rude Charlie was being, though. Still, he mostly redeemed himself to me by being perceptive enough to realize that Bella is probably going to ""leave,"" and by not standing in her way because he knows it is her choice. I'm glad he's being nicer to Edward now.Aaaaaand... the whole imprinting thing is interesting. I really, REALLY hope Jacob imprints on someone, because I hate to think of him not having ANYONE since Bella has chosen Edward. The whole thing about Quil imprinting on a two-year-old was kind of hilarious. Oh, and Leah? Kinda snotty. But a good twist, to have a female werewolf.Finally, jeez - in the end Bella saved her own life by insisting that Edward stay with her. Whee! The fight scenes were great, especially Edward just SIGHing at Bella in exasperation when he sees she's about to off herself to try and save him and Seth, and Jasper trying to ""make sure Alice didn't have anything to do."" Heh. Noble vampire boys.I am soooooo looking forward to book 4. Please don't let me down, Stephenie Meyer! I am trusting you to get Bella properly wedded, bedded and bitten in this next book.

33,14414534,02/02/2008,2.0,"Okay, I gave two stars to this book because I kind of hate everything it stands for, but the facts remains the I've read ALL THREE books in this series cover to cover, and always feel a prick of glee when I get my hands on the newest one. I'm not sure what their diabolical pull on me is, and figuring it out would require the kind of self-analysis that would turn up things I'm sure I'd rather not know about. Here's the lowdown: Stephenie Meyer's books are hardcore teen romances with fangs-and-fur window dressing. Not being the hugest fan of romance as a genre, I was hoping the vampires and werewolves would complicate the obsessive peregrenations of the heart that the series chronicles. Unfortunately, they don't. Does anyone read these books and actually not realize that getting bitten by a vampire is just a huge, chicken-poop metaphor for the giving of a young woman's virginity? I wish Stephenie had made her books thoughtful explorations of what it means to develop and experiment with your sexuality as a young person/feel torn between your vampire and your werewolf suitors/escape near death at the hands of bloodthirsty monsters, but she hasn't. For Bella Swan, everytime things get hot and heavy, her boyfriend calmly asks her to wait until he's bitten and transformed her so that he doesn't accidentally eat her during sex. Girls, what do we learn about sleeping with our young men from this story? Yuck. Also, although Bella is presented as a passably intelligent young person, she spends about 99.9% of her time thinking about how much she loves her sanguine paramour. I don't know about you, but while I was certainly very interested in sex and all its permutations when I was in high school, I was also interested in radical politics, bad hardcore bands, soft drugs and getting enough sleep before my stupid Zero Period PE class. Bella has no hobbies; she spends all of her time taking care of, being taken care of by, and thinking about the men in her life. This is not the kind of message I'd like to be sending to young women today; I know fantasy is fantasy, and sometimes it's nice to indulge your stupider ones, but three books-worth? Please. So I guess what I'm saying is that I read all these books so I can warn folks away from them in an informed manner....yeah, that's it. Here's my recommendation, since it won't fit in the intended field: I recommend this book to those who are capable of wading through pages and pages of bullcrap in pursuit of gem-like moments of unintentional hilarity.

Although I loved the first two books and I loved all the movies, something was bothering me from the beginning. And I think I realized what it is when I reread ECLIPSE. In this book Edward and Jacob are fighting for Bella continually. None of them is far away. They are both present and pursue Bella.Then it hit me. There is this ancient guy who is basically antagonizing a teenager for the heart of another teenager. Creepy.When you watch the films, you almost never think of Edward as an old guy. He behaves and thinks like a young man. But this is so very wrong. He is mature, he is experienced.Why is he arguing with a sixteen years old boy? Seriously...On another note, Bella becomes more and more annoying. She knows that she will stay with Edward and she has still been toying with Jacob's feelings all the time.

She didn't introduce any new characters and spent the whole book on the love triangle between Edward, Bella, and Jacob. I felt like the love scenes were cheesy and tiresome. I also felt that Bella was whiney and initiating. Doesn't she understand that she can't have 2 boyfriends? This seems to be a foreign concept to her. In addition, Meyer has taken Bella from a bold heroine and turned her into an annoying little girl whose eternal existence depends completely upon the men in her life. She even says to Jacob that she has no choices. For most of New Moon and almost all of Eclipse Bella acts like the fainting women in silent movies that must carried everywhere and protected by their male companions. Do we really want to be spreading a message to young girls that without a strong man in their life they have no purpose to live? Please!

40,247391907,12/15/2011,1.0,"I finished Eclipse, the third installment of the godawful Twilight series, with a scowl on my face. At that point, I realized that I'd been scowling for the entire book, my eyebrows slammed together, my lips turned down, my face set in SMeyer's favorite word - chagrin. And while it's really easy to say, ""Oh, it's just a book - nothing worth getting angry about,"" there's still the itsy bitsy annoying fact that I spent two days reading purple prose and NOTHING happened. Well, some things happened, but they were awful, so I don't want to count them. The Twilight series has its own stages of mental distress. There are four, one for each book:1. Twilight - Boredom2. New Moon - Concern3. Eclipse - Anger4. Breaking Dawn - Numb HorrorIt's pretty bad when an entire cast of characters is so terrible that you can't help cheering for the villain. Let's get to it, then!SUMMARY:After Bella's crippling loss of a brain and Edward's thwarted suicide attempt in Italy, everyone's favorite star-crossed lovers are back in Forks. Graduation is looming, and Bella can't stand to age another day. You know how digustingly old 18-year-olds are and everything. She wants Edward to change her into a vampire before she starts collecting Social Security, and Eddie's all like, ""Nuh-uh. Not til you marry me, you breakable and pathetic little thing."" In the meantime, Bella wants to spend quality time with werewolf Jacob and his totes fun wolfpack, giving Jake the impression that he has a chance with the girl who loves a sparkly dead man. Edward disapproves of Bella hanging out with Jacob (too dangerous), and Bella's dad has a problem with Edward. He remembers how Bella totally lost her nuggets about his abandonment the year before and her subsequent disappearance to Italy to save him from the scary European vampires. Also, a new pack of vampires is after Bella. AND THEY WANT BLOOD. SPOILERS AHEAD!So a lot of things went wrong in this book, even beyond the horrible writing. The plot remained stagnant until the very end. And then, as expected, we ended up exactly where we were before. The Twilight series is very similar to a humorless, angsty, vampire version of the movie ""Groundhog Day."" Meyer overused all of her favorite words, and the reader was treated to more endless descriptions of Edward's sparkly perfection and Jacob's sizzling hot abs. Blah, blah, blah. But let me list the things that made me irrationally angry. 1. Edward is an abusive boyfriend - I think this point has been covered in every corner of the Internet, so I'll keep this short. Telling one's girlfriend who she can hang out with is abusive. Disabling your girlfriend's car so she can't see her friend is abusive. Having one's family kidnap girlfriend because you don't trust her to stay away from the friend? Abusive and illegal. It's bad enough that he talks down to Bella all the time, calling her fragile and weak, insisting that she can't protect herself. Sure, I get that we're talking about supernatural creatures here (and Bella is pretty useless and pathetic), but Edward's such a douche about it. Also, getting the girl all revved up for sex and then saying she can't have it without marriage is controlling and rude. Worst boyfriend ever. And who wants to hang out with a granite hard ice cube all the time? Cuddling with Edward would be like cozying up with a frozen pack of ground beef, only less nutricious. 2. Jacob loses his bananas and becomes a sexual predator - Jake never had a chance with Bella. He should have figured that out by now, considering Bella's catatonic state when Edward left her in New Moon. Unfortunately, Jacob is about as bright as any other character in the book (not very) and pursues the living daylights out of Bella. At first, his pursuit is fair-minded. He attempts to persuade Bella that dating the living is far superior to dating the dead. But then, when he recognizes that he doesn't have a chance in hell of besting Edward, he forces a kiss on her and refuses to let go when she struggles to escape. Later, he manipulates her into kissing him again by threatening to run to his imminent death if Bella doesn't admit that she loves him. I don't understand how any of this is romantic. 3. The tent scene - While Bella's supposed to be ""sleeping"" in a tent before their big battle with Victoria, Jacob and Edward discuss her future. The boys discuss her future. They think they know what's best for her, and Bella just lays there silently. But of course! Who needs an opinion when there are boys to decide it for you? 4. Charlie's the worst dad ever - When Bella comes home with a BROKEN HAND from punching Jacob after he assaults her, Charlie thinks it's hilarious. He even congratulates Jacob for forcing himself on his daughter. This is ... this is the 21st century, right? A YA book? For crying out loud ...5. Bella is an empty shell - All this girl thinks about are her dead boyfriend and the hot werewolf next door. That's it. Nada. She doesn't care about school, doesn't have any hopes or dreams for the future, doesn't care what her parents have to say, has no friends, and can't even WALK on her own for large portions of the novel. I couldn't believe the amount of times that Bella, an 18-year-old woman, was carried from one place to another. When she isn't being vapid, Bella focuses on being a selfish, whiny, manipulative brat with one goal in mind - sexin' up Eddie. That's it. She essentially tells Jacob, ""I love you, I do. But I love Edward more. Sorry. Hope this doesn't make your already unstable mind explode in rage. K, bye."" The Cullens throw Bella a graduation party, and she whines about it the whole time. Oh, well, god forbid someone does something nice for you, Bella. Worst person ever. The only time she comes close to growing a spine is when she tells Edward that she really doesn't want to get married right out of high school because she feels too young, and Boyfriend of the Year bullies her into accepting his proposal anyway. He uses sex as a bartering tool. Sex. YA book. Not to sound like Charlie Brown or anything, but good grief!So by the end of the book, Bella and Edward are totally still together and engaged, a heartbroken Jacob runs around the forest and cries, no one dies in the ""epic"" battle, and Charlie Swan still has zero control over his daughter. But looking back on this now, I realize that compared to Breaking Dawn, Eclipse is almost a walk in the park. The final book in the series doesn't just play around the rabbit hole - it plunges in head first. But that's for another review.",32,-0.9992,0.207,0.675,0.118,0.5443636363636362,NEGATIVE,0.9997
41,179979816,06/27/2011,1.0,"THE NIGHTMARE IS FINALLY OVER. This book is........look, I'm not going to lie. It's terrible. The writing is clunky and constantly being interrupted with em-dashes and ellipses, not to mention Steph's; irrational; love; of; semi-colons; which; she; uses; with; disturbing; frequency. The relationship between Edward and Bella is a classic abusive relationship. He controls her every move, he gets angry at her for things that she had no control over her, she refers to their kisses as terrifying, he basically blackmails her into an engagement. He LITERALLY KIDNAPS HER, BRIBES HIS 'SISTER' TO WATCH HER EVERY MOVE AND THEN LEAVES TOWN. And throughout the course of this endless book, he treats her as a child. Seriously, he acts FAR more like her father than her boyfriend. And it's incredibly disturbing. The relationship between JACOB and Bella is equally disturbing. He kisses her without consent, ignoring all signs that she's totally not into this until she LITERALLY HAS TO PLAY DEAD to get him to let her go. And then he finds him hilarious that she breaks her hand trying to express her reaction to this, and still insists that someday she'll change her mind and choose him. The non-stop comparisons to Wuthering Heights are baffling. Wuthering Heights is in no way romantic, and the fact that Edward's constantly comparing himself to Heathcliff while Jacob fits the Edgar role far better makes me wonder if Stephenie Meyer has ever actually READ Wuthering Heights. Add in a staggering amount of racism and you've got yourself a truly terrible time. The only even vaguely redeeming chunk of this abomination is Rosalie's backstory, and I honestly don't think that Meyer realised how awful that is. I mean, Rosalie tells Bella that she was beaten and gang raped by her fiance and his friends in the street and left to die. She was turned into a vampire against her will, just after being gang raped. And what Bella takes away from this story is to be jealous that Rosalie's so beautiful and pale and vampire-y.Essentially, this book is indescribably boring while also being full of rage-inducing moments that make you want to scream, and if I hadn't borrowed this book from work, I'd be setting it on fire. To be honest, I'm STILL tempted to set it on fire. Because at least it would spare a generation of teenage girls from being brainwashed into thinking this bullshit is romantic.

44,1454019415,11/28/2015,1.0,"The first twenty points are in my reviews of Twilight and New MoonI repeat, I'm only posting this because I read this article. I'm literally only refuting the points mentioned in this, nothing else. I don't like comparison, but if the other party does it, be sure that I will respond. 
REBUTTAL TO POINTS 21-30:
21. At least they talk about reliegon even 4 a short while.Why is this even a point? What sense does it make? I'm not the most religious person, in fact I'm not even Christian, let alone Mormon, so this affects me in no way whatsoever. Besides, I personally feel like authors shouldn't impose their religious views on their readers, even for a short while. At least in this day and age they shouldn't. So in my opinion, a book that talks about religion scores lower than one that doesn't mention it. 22. Twilight goes more in depth with the emotions. You can feel Bella's pain when Edward leaves her. You can feel her confusion between Edward and Jacob. You can feel her love for Renesmee.Harry Potter is more about emotions than Twilight is. Bella, at least in my opinion is torn between her lust for Edward and well, what exactly with Jacob again? I think she'd always made it clear that Edward was her choice. There was no confusion to start with. She's Renesmee's mother, of course she loves her! Lily, Harry's mother sacrificed her life for her son. Now, why ever would she do that if she did not love him? Molly, Ron's mother, loved Harry like her own son. Sirius and Lupin who were father figures to Harry, whom Harry loved like he would love his father, and they, him. Dumbledore's love for Harry. Ron and Hermione's love for Harry when they decided to leave everything behind and follow him into whatever the future would hold, because he was their friend. Literally the entire point of the climax of Harry Potter is based on the power of maternal love. Are you telling me you couldn't feel Snape's pain about Lily? The word ""Always"" made me cry. It was such a simple word, yet had so many emotions behind it! There's depth for you.23. Twilight is a modern-day Romeo and Juliet in its themes of everlasting but forbidden love; to be compared to such a classic is an honor.I read this one Tumblr post that said ""Comparing your relationship with Romeo and Juliet to express how in love you are is kind of like using Hamlet to demonstrate how close and well-adjusted your family life is"". Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy where the love between a ditzy heroine and a self-assured jerk leads to everyone's death in the end eventually. It maybe nonpareil and cliche when comparing it in the romance genre, but there you have it. Besides, nowhere has Twilight ever been compared to Romeo and Juliet other than by fans of the former. That's kind of like me saying ""I'm smart like Madam Curie, but in the 21st century context, and being compared to her is such an honour"". You cannot make the comparison yourself and then call it an honour. 24. We like the time setting of Twilight. It is modern day.Thank you for reminding me that Harry Potter was set in the 15th Century.25. Vampires stay with their partners will death. If you mess with their partners, you'll get what's coming. Even after their partner is dead, they will remain loyal to them, till their time comes.Aren't vampires immortal? Anyway, even wizards stay with their partners till death. What the fuck kind of an argument is this? Wizards remain loyal to their partners too. I mean, isn't that what everyone's supposed to do? I didn't know it was something special. Some even to their first unrequited love. Two words. Severus Snape. Remained loyal to Lily after her death, till her death. Does the word ""Always"" ring a bell? 26. We like and appreciate the fact that the vampires and werewolves in Twilight aren't anything like the one's from us before. To us, it's nice to take on the vampire and werewolf concept.The vampires and werewolves from Twilight lack the traits that make them respectively, vampires and werewolves. As a huge fan of the original Dracula, I don't like that. 27. You can read Twilight over and over again.I've read each Harry Potter book at least a hundred times. These arguments make no sense. 28. It is the rare vampire novel that isn't about sex on some level, and the Twilight books are no exception. What makes Meyer's books so distinctive is that they're about the erotics of abstinence. Their tension comes from prolonged, superhuman acts of self-restraint. There's a scene midway through Twilight, in which, for the first time, Edward leans in close and sniffs the aroma of Bella's exposed neck. ""Just because I'm resisting the wine doesn't mean I can't appreciate the bouquet,"" he says. ""You have a very floral smell, like lavender....or freesia."" He barely touches her, but there's more sex in that one paragraph than in all the snogging in Harry Potter.Harry Potter isn't about sex. It's about love, bravery, and goodness. I've read very good erotica (Anais Nin, mostly), and trust me, this line doesn't in the least bit feel erotic to me. 29. characters change throughout the Twilight series as well. they may not be growing up like the Harry Potter Characters did, but they did change. The characters become more brave, stronger, loving, forgiving, etc. Each character changed in the Twilight books. Harry Potter characters changed as well, but they kept some of their bad traits with them.How did the characters in Twilight change? Bella was still the same whiney, judgmental, woe-is-me doormat, Edward was still...hot(?), because he honestly has no more character than that, and Jacob moved on from Bella to her daughter, because yay, paedophilia. The characters in Harry Potter mature from prepubescent, clueless children to understanding, mature adults. The fact that they're not perfect and still retain some element of negativity in their traits makes them endearing and lovable. 30. IT has a graphic novel.It has a theme park.

46,40007270,12/13/2008,5.0,"Eclipse started out pretty good, and by the time I finished it, I was once again feeling the love glow that these books give me. My Thoughts:1.Bella. Bella was rather annoying in this book. I have decided that she must have the lowest self-esteem of any person alive. I just don't get why she doesn't like herself, doesn't think herself worthy of others' love. I think that everyone should love themselves, and with two parents that adore her, you think that would have instilled some degree of self esteem within her. But, no! Yes, we all see our flaws magnified, but still we should love ourselves as God made us. Unique creations, good part and areas in need of improvement, alike. And to make her more annoying, her self-esteem issues make others' lives more difficult. As much as I love Edward, Bella's attitude that he's so far above her, that he couldn't love her is frustrating. She doesn't think she should take anything from him more than his love. Like he shouldn't fight for her, or be willing to die for her. When she'd do it for him. That he can't give to her selflessly, when she gives all for him. In contrast, she seemed to take Jake's love for granted. The saving grace of Meyer's portrayal of Bella is that she's actually fairly self-aware. She can see her flaws clearly, her tendency to be selfish, despite her lack of self-love. She knows she's neurotic and grasping, and seems ungrateful at times. She wants to do better, and she tries. And in other ways, she's very giving, the way she cares for others. In the end, I still like her, but she's hard to swallow at times.2. Bella and Jacob. I'm not sure how I feel about the way Bella and Jacob's relationship changes in this book. (view spoiler)[ Why does Bella have to be in love with Jacob too? A woman/man love? I am not saying that people can't feel more than one kind of love, but I just don't believe that you can love more than one person as your mate whole-hearted. In this story, it seems as though part of Bella loves Jacob as much as Edward, but she can't live without Edward, so that's why she chose him. That's a cop-out. It makes it seem like Edward is more of an addiction, and not the man she chooses to love. That she loves fiercely. I'm not discounting Bella's capacity to love Jacob. Jacob is a wonderful guy. He's very lovable and wonderful in a different way from Edward. I think that in another life Jacob was her true mate. I know that when Edward left, Jacob was there, and his love healed that wound that Edward's leaving caused Bella. He's always going to be a part of her, and even Edward knows that. I believe that he is her soulmate in that he is her best friend. But I don't think he's her other true love. So that drama of having her heart broken because she loved both guys seemed unnecessary to me. Far be it for me to tell a writer how to write her story. If that's how Ms. Meyer wanted to write it, then so be it. I just wasn't too fond of it, though.  (hide spoiler)] I do like the sweetness and the snarkiness and the enrichment that Jacob and Bella's friendship brings them both.3. Jacob. I started caring deeply for Jacob in New Moon. Even when he is annoying, he's so vibrant, and it's hard to dislike him. I can see why Bella felt like he was so necessary to her life. He has that way of bringing life and love to the lives of those around him. I see him maturing into quite a man. I think some of what he does to Bella and Edward was kind of low-down, but he playing to win Bella from Edward and a future as a vampire. He thought he was doing the right thing, and I could see that, even though I can see why Bella and Edward wanted to hit him. I appreciated the perspective I gained of Jacob by learning more about his tribe, their pasts, and the awful things the Cold Ones had done to them. I can totally see why Jacob feels such hatred for the Cullens. I can see why he seemed so mercurial and he shows some emotional cruelty in moments. He has a whole lot on his plate. Not only does he have his unrequited love for Bella to deal with, he has a several tons' weight of all his pack and tribal family's issues to carry around. That's a lot, even for a six-feet, seven, enormous guy like Jake. At the end of the day, flaws and all, I want to hug him. Even if I don't think he should be with Bella in the long run. He needs a more balanced, more emotionally healthy person than Bella to be his true soulmate. (view spoiler)[ One thing I don't get is why he hangs onto Bella so hard, when he knows he's not imprinted on her. Is he trying to rebel against his destiny in this way? Shape at least one thing for himself? He sees that Bella can be the one thing he can claim selfishly, that doesn't have to be about his heritage as a Quilete tribesperson? I think yes.  (hide spoiler)]4. Edward. I still love him as much as I did in the first two books. Yes, he's kind of bossy sometimes, but Bella does what Bella thinks is right, and he's pretty easy for her to manipulate. He's wrapped around her finger. I love that Edward's love for Bella isn't a selfish one. He really does want what's best for her, and much of what he does comes out of that. That doesn't mean he's perfect. There are times when he does want to be selfish, or when he tries to be controlling in her best interests, but he realizes that he's wrong and he makes up for it. And I can't stay mad at him. Really, I love this character. Everything about him. He's very courtly and decent. He's also tough and protective. His beauty isn't just skin deep. It goes to the heart and that shines out, and becomes part of his appeal for this reader. I like his interactions with Jacob, how they both do the territorial guy thing, and you see some of his more primal aspects in those moments. But at the end of the day, Edward is always going to be that decent, kind man who will do the right thing even if he doesn't like it. I hurt for Edward that he could see the draw between Bella and Jacob, and how he was hurt by some of the interactions between Bella and Jacob. Almost as though Bella's love for him was so sacred, he couldn't have the normal moments with her that she shared with Jacob. I think he shows his love for Bella that he tries very hard to allow her to have that, and not to mess that up for her. I can totally see why Bella loves him, although I don't think she should put him on a pedestal. Even Edward doesn't want that. 5. Edward and Jacob talking things out. As with the movie, which I saw first, this was one of my favorite moments in this book. I felt that it shows a lot about the two characters, and they come to realize that they aren't the enemies that they believe themselves to be. They are part of a triangle that has complemented their lives even as it's complicated them, but also one that has enriched each person. I think this is when they make peace on a deep level (even though things are a bit rough after this point). Jacob comes to see how Bella can love this 'cold one', and that Edward would never be selfish when it comes to Bella. He would give her up out of love, if he thought that was what Bella wanted and needed. And Edward comes to realize how important Jacob is to Bella, and how he can give her things that Edward can't. It's a painful thing for both to accept--the importance that the other guy has in Bella's life. This part was very well done, in my opinion. 6. The Cullens' stories. I loved reading about Rosalie and Jasper's stories. Rosalie in the movies annoys me. I like her more in the books, because you can see that her enmity with Bella isn't so much against Bella, but the desire for Bella to have the life that she couldn't, and for Bella to appreciate those choices better. What happened to Rosalie was shockingly dark. It's hard to believe that people can be so wretched to do something like that. But that's real. I can't say I regret that Rosalie was 'theatrical' in exacting her revenge. Jasper's story was one of my favorite parts of the book. I have to say that other than Edward and Jacob, Jasper is up there for me as a guy in this book. I like him almost as much as Jake. I liked seeing more of him, and how Meyer takes him from being the 'strange' brother to having a rich back story and a crucial role in the story in this book. As Rosalie's story is dark, Jasper's is equally so. Even though people hate how Meyer portrays vampires, thinking is all sparkling and light, that's clearly not the case. I like the constrast that Meyer draws between the luminous beauty of the vampires, to their dark, ravenous, grasping, cruel, destructive natures. I think in some ways, these vampires scare me more than the traditional lore, and that's coming from a girl who's read vampire stories for many years. Her vampires are formidable in a more scary way than some of the traditional vampires I've read about The typical nature of the Cold Ones strikes a sharp contrast to the decent, loving, humane natures of the Cullens. I don't want to be a vampire at all, but being a Cullen....I think I'd like that very much.7.Victoria. I can't stand her! She's so selfish and cruel. I think she got just what she deserved.8.The Volturi. I can see a major standoff between them and the Cullens looming on the horizon. They will realize that it's folly to take the Cullens for granted. I especially despise Jane!Overall Verdict: After the emotional rollercoaster of New Moon, it took me a while to find my feet in this installment. However, Meyer worked her spell on me once again. There are some moments of pure brilliance in this novel. I think that she has a way with words, with painting powerful imagery in my head. I loved the line in which Jacob says he is Bella's sun, but he can't fight the eclipse (which is Edward). That one line pretty much conveys the essence of this series. I love this series because it strikes me at the heart. The idea of a love that great, something beyond understanding. When you love someone, you can't always dissect out the whys, and you can't change it. You can move on, sometimes. Live your life, but part of you is always going to be with that person, and you don't ever get it back. That's what I see with Edward and Bella, and with Bella and Jake. Although not on the same scope, as an inveterate booklover, when I finish these books, I feel like part of me stays with them after I read the last page. It echoes that powerful feeling of love in a small way in my life. And I like that!",27,0.9999,0.082,0.708,0.21,0.6054422799422801,NEGATIVE,0.9963

48,50300042,03/24/2009,1.0,"Anyone who's read my reviews of the first and last books in the Twilight saga knows that this review won't consist of much. Twilight was the beginning, the best book, the start of something great. Or at least, it should have been. Breaking Dawn was the bitterly disappointing ending to the saga that had potential, but just didn't deliver. New Moon and Eclipse were the pointless, disappointing, utterly forgettable filler books in this tragedy sandwich. You know it's sad when, three days after I read this book, I couldn't immediately remember what it was about. I still don't remember much of what happened in it, aside from the fight scene towards the end. The only reason I remember said fight scene is because I'm still infuriated that Bella was able to act like such a spoiled, selfish little brat and somehow have fate reward her for it. When Edward and his family are preparing for battle, Bella has an emotional breakdown and decides she just can't live without Edward. So she asks him to stay out of the fight. For her. Internally, she feels terrible for requesting it, but she can't reconcile those feelings with the overwhelming fear of losing Edward. So she never takes it back. Edward, like the totally pussy-whipped doormat he's become (completely uncharacteristic of him considering his behavior in the first and second books), agrees. The explanation is that he feels so badly about leaving Bella for eight months (in the second book) that he can't refuse her anything. Even if it means leaving his family to fight, alone, against a sadistic, revenge-bent she-vamp whose only target is Edward's own precious little girlfriend. So he does just that. He leaves the werewolves and his family to fight alone while he and Bella camp out in the mountains. But wait! It's okay because the she-vamp has other plans. While she sends her army of newborn vamps to fight the Cullens (the ones who didn't allow some selfish bitch to talk them out of fighting, anyway) and the werewolves, *she* loops around to the mountains with her freshly-made lover-vamp to take Bella out while the others are preoccupied. It's a real good thing she asked Edward to stay out of the fight, otherwise he wouldn't have been on that mountain to defend her from Bonnie and Clyde Vampire. Please. Don't even get me started on Bella's other admirable traits. As the series progresses, she gets dumber, more selfish, and less empathetic. I hate this character. She's not the same character as the Bella in Twilight. Not even close. Her attitude and behavior make this book barely tolerable.",25,-0.9964,0.195,0.721,0.084,0.5515480895915679,NEGATIVE,1.0

50,1435195705,11/06/2015,4.0,"Eclipse is the third book from the Twilight Series and from my opinion the most complex in action and characters all-together. Comparing it to the first 2 ones, you can definitely see an evolution of the writing style and also of the plot. It was more alert, with a lot of things going on and a lot of connections were made between the previous books and this one. After all the issues between Edward and Bella dissipated, one question lingered: Will Bella accept to marry Edward? I know.. The question was popped suddenly at the end of New Moon and everybody was left hanging, wondering what Bella will answer. Of course, the romantic scene we all imagined will not happen very soon soon.. Bella is determined to marry Edward under the condition to be transformed into a vampire. From this point on, there will be a lot of discussion whether Bella will face this transformation now on after their wedding. They are both very stubborn and eventually somebody will give in. I will let you discover who it will be.Beside this romantic problem, bigger issued occur and they all have a name: Victoria. Yap, the villain vampire who wants revenge over her partner's death is out for our couple again, but this time it won't be smooth like in New Moon. Now thing get darker and more dangerous, because she is building an army of now-born and their destination is Forks. Victoria is keen on killing anyone who had to do with James death, and her obsession is Bella and Edward. Now, everybody has to work together to protect Bella, including the werewolves. I had so much fun reading the way they cooperated, and the way they managed to learn from each other. I enjoyed the harmony between both species, even if they were natural enemies. The fact that they stood together for a cause made me believe so much that they could actually co-exist and leave it all behind. The element that made me give this book 4 stars was the love triangle made of Bella-Edward-Jacob. If you thought New Moon was packed with tension and challenges, just wait until you read this one. Bella kind of annoyed me because I am Team Edward all the way and just couldn't understand why was she so confused between the 2 of them. Her actions and behavior were sometimes odd and let me believe that she was not very sure of her feelings as she said she was. If you love somebody you don't do the things you do, even if that person was there for you in a hard period. I understand that Edward left her vulnerable and that her relationship with Jacob healed her, but doing the things she did kind of made me look at her from another perspective.Edward and Jacob were very fun to read about, their constant arguments were both funny and kind of hot, because let's face it, not any girl nowadays has 2 extremely good looking guys fighting over her. I felt that Edward could again sacrifice his love for Bella if the situation demanded it, and that he was willing to face the possibility of letting Jacob be the one for her. Jacob on the other hand fought hard for Bella and until the last moment wanted to be the right man for her. You will just have to read the book to figure out Bella's choice:)In conclusion it was a good book, with a lot of intense moments and I will repeat my idea that the evolution in characters and plot was visible, in comparison with the rest of the books from the series.4 stars!For more reviews please check https://readwithloveblog.wordpress.com ",39,0.9197,0.101,0.786,0.113,0.4822989939353575,POSITIVE,0.9921

It keeps the slightly improved writing flow, but that's about it.The Bella-Edward obsession is back. While he isn't overdoing his eyebrows and shifting his mania moods every paragraph, and isn't even dis-likable anymore, Bella is the worst. She gets so mad at Jacob over a playful kiss that anyone else would have seen coming from a mile away, she hits him and unrealistically breaks her hand. She has this very bizarre worry about aging - why is turning 20 the end of the world? Why won't she compromise even a little with Edward and wait awhile? Her moaning about aging and waiting takes up a large part of the angst.The second annoying thing that makes no sense at all is she won't wait to turn into an immortal creature, despite Edward's warnings - but she is terrified of marriage because she thinks its wrong and embarrassing to marry right out of high school. Yeah, makes no sense.Then she starts harping on Edward not having sex with her before she changes because she's worried she'll change personalities later, but this is still worth a risk for her while marriage wasn't?She is dedicated enough to die for him, give up being human for him, but is scared when he talks about being engaged and refuses to wear his ring right now because it's too unsettling?She won't let him even buy her a birthday present (only homemade allowed), but she tricks and forces him on other things like not group fighting and not waiting to turn her?

Basically, there's nothing wrong with Mike Newton. He's the only normal option but Bella doesn't consider him for some reason.Besides all that, this book dragged.

57,575583328,03/30/2013,1.0,"Actual Rating: 1.5 starsI had a lot of strong feelings about this one upon re-read. Here are a few thoughts.- It's a very bloated book and often drags. It easily could have been half the length.- Edward is repeatedly controlling and manipulative. His patterns of behavior are toxic and scary. The only thing that changes that is when he's afraid of loosing Bella. And even then he does some shitty things. She says she loves him because he's so kind and unselfish and decent, which is just patently untrue. Also he manipulates her into agreeing to marry him.- Jacob does some very problematic things that feel rapey, like forcing a kiss on Bella when she says no, and manipulating her into kissing him again later by threatening suicide. Also very not okay. But then this behavior feels pretty out of character based on earlier books, and tell me why the author is perpetuating these predatory stereotypes about a Native character?- Oh, and can we talk about the fact that Jasper was a Confederate soldier and it is ROMANTICIZED?! Not to mention the description of the Mexican vampire who turns him. She's apparently beautiful with her alabaster skin, despite her Mexican features, and is completely cold-hearted. I'm seeing a pattern. Any non-white vampires or characters are always villified or portrayed badly. There are definite undercurrents of white supremacy.- The focus on sexual purity is unhealthy and creepy in the way it is handled. All this talk about Edward ""appreciating the bouquet without tasting the wine"" and refusing to sleep with Bella unless they are married, and even that she has to basically beg for. It doesn't sit right at all.- Meanwhile we are introduced to imprinting, which is SUPER disturbing! Emily gets closer to Sam after an act of domestic violence where she (the victim) ends up comforting him??? I'm sorry, but that's really unacceptable. And another member of the pack imprints on a one-year-old, and it's played off as fine because he'll first be like a brother and friend, not a lover. But....it's creepy and grooming. And this is ONLY with Native characters, again playing into racist stereotypes involving predatory behavior and taking children. - If there was going to be any kind of romantic outcome, it seems clear that it should have been some kind of triad with Bella, Edward, and Jacob. Even though all three of them kind of suck for various reasons. But instead, we are going to get more creepy imprinting stuff where Jacob will be with their daughter which....I hate so much.

In particular, the ongoing threat posed by the vengeful vampire Victoria finally comes to a head here, which will mean a larger degree of vampire (and werewolf) climactic action than what's found in the first two series installments, and the author skillfully builds the tension as it mounts toward that point. And the strange triangular relationship of Bella, Edward and Jacob will turn a decisive corner with this book, and not without a painful gain in self- understanding on Bella's part.One of my Goodreads friends faults Bella sternly for hurting both Edward and Jacob through much of this book, as a result of her refusal to make a clean break with the latter when Edward returns at the end of New Moon. Bella, of course, also comes to fault herself bitterly. But both Jacob and Edward recognize their own mistakes and culpability in the situation, too; and in fact all three are harder on themselves than I am on them, as a reader. Part of Meyer's achievement here is making the attitudes, perceptions and attitudes of all three completely understandable and psychologically true to life, and allowing them to come across as essentially decent people in a painful situation that doesn't offer ANY options that are perfect. That's not a rosy, cheery story; but it's a story that's enormously emotionally compelling and empathetic, which engages our attention and our sympathy --a story that's, in Thomas Hardy's phrase, ""worth telling."" The supernatural elements of vampirism and lycanthropy add color and texture, but the human drama and dilemmas (and in that sense, Meyer's vampires and werewolves are as human as you and I are) are the core of the story, as they are in all good fiction regardless of genre.Strongly drawn secondary characters add to the appeal of this series. Here, we get to know Rosalie and Jasper, and their grim back histories, better than before. And, of course, you've gotta love Alice! :-) Here, also, Meyer uses Alice to suggest a (convincingly plausible, within the assumptions of the series) explanation for a point that had perplexed me, and probably other readers: why Bella is immune to some vampiric special powers, but not to others. Twilight detractors fault Edward here for controlling behavior towards Bella, stemming from his overprotective attitude; but far from condoning and encouraging this, as some of these critics imply, Meyer has Bella bucking and defying this at one point, and him finally recognizing that he was out of line and changing his tack --which sends a very different and more positive message than the author usually gets credit for!",18,0.9876,0.065,0.809,0.126,0.5355438311688312,POSITIVE,0.9998

EVER. period. not if they think it's in your best interest. not to ""save you pain."" no. never. neither should they try to prevent you from spending time with your best friends. i dont give a rat's ass that edward eventually ""lets"" her go spend time with jacob. that's not the point. it's not his place to be ""letting"" her do or not do anything. i'm sorry, but your partner is not the same person as you. they do not ""complete you."" they are not ""your soul."" you are complete on your own. and if you're not, you need to work on that by yourself. furthermore it implies that bella's love for jacob cancels out her ""love"" for edward. the whole book is consumed with jealousy but no one ever tries to resolve the jealousy. it's just like ""that makes me jealous. don't do that. because it will make me feel jealous."" instead of looking to see WHY it makes them jealous and dealing with that problem. no no, because that would be silly to resolve a problem. instead, let's IDEALIZE the jealousy as DESPERATION and then say oh yes, what a good boy edward is for ignoring his jealousy instead of dealing with it. what a HERO for letting bella hang out with her best friend. also, granted it been a LONG time since i've read wuthering heights, but i feel like bella and stephenie meyer fundamentally miss the point of the book. edward supposedly thinks that cathy and heathcliff are selfish iredeemable idiots. bella thinks that ""the only thing that redeems them is their love."" absurd. the point of wuthering heights is not to idealize heatcliff & cathy's love. the entire point of wuthering heights is that the ""love"" between heathcliff and cathy (which is the same kind of ""love"" that edward & bella have) is destructive, while the love that young cathy and hareton have is more REAL & therefore successful because is based on people changing, growing, and being less desperate and more like actual friends. Gee, that second relationship sound a little bit more like the way jacob acts with bella! until, that is, stephenie meyer turns him into edward2 by making him force himself on bella and start acting controlling. gross. desperation & control is not a basis for a healthy relationship. and in both cases (edward & jacob) bella eventually gives in and LIKES the controlling manipulation. That is a FUCKED UP message to be sending. why yes, girls, ""Ideal Love"" means letting someone control you/force himself on you and then liking it, while meanwhile you should feel (or at least act) like an incompetent moron. and boys, hear that?: even if a girl says no, she doesn't like you — or if she says, no i don't want to do these things — go right ahead and MAKE HER, she'll like it eventually. because she doesn't know what she wants. because she's just a silly little girl.JESUS H CHRIST.if the point of these books is to show that many people who are ""deperately In Love"" are actually really shallow and vapid and have no idea what love should be like, than BRAVO stepehenie meyer. but somehow i dont think that's the point, and if it is, it certainly didn't require 4 tomes of poorly-written text to get the point across.",17,0.9958,0.15,0.652,0.198,0.5686134453781513,NEGATIVE,1.0

73,6904635,09/27/2007,5.0,"I read this in one day, finishing it with a feeling of deep regret and profound relief. Or is that deep relief and profound regret? On the one hand, I once again could hardly put it down, and my stomach was twisted with nerves all day at work, even when I was reading it. I was afraid of finishing it, yet I couldn't not finish it. I was anxious for the characters and how it would end, but also afraid of finishing it because then, well, it would be finished.This third volume picks up not long after the events in New Moon, with her friendship with Jacob almost destroyed by him knowing she plans to become a vampire, his worst enemy. But the Volturi, the ancient Italian royal family of vampires, gave them an ultimatum, and Bella used this to push the issue to a vote for the Cullen family in 
New Moon
. Only Edward and Rosalie vote 'no'. They set a date for after graduation (from year 12, that is), and then Edward negotiates a second deal: if she marries him first, he'll change her herself. Bella is still freaked out by the idea of marrying at such a young age - it's what her parents did, and her mother left after she was born. But Edward is from the early 1900s, and still old-fashioned at heart. Bella is also torn between Jacob and his wolf family, and Edward and his vampire family. But Edward has a new outlook, after believing he had lost Bella forever, and will do what it takes to make Bella happy. The enmity and jealousy between Edward and Jacob is often amusing, and Jacob is tenacious and persistent. Meanwhile, there seems to be a serial killer loose in nearby Seattle, and an unknown vampire has explored Bella's room and taken some of her clothes. The Cullens work out that there's an army of newborns in the city, preparing to fight them. Almost too late Bella realises who is in control: Victoria, still obsessed with killing Bella in revenge for Edward killing her own mate, James, in Twilight. The only way to defeat them is to work alongside the werewolves. This one had lots of Wuthering Heights references, which didn't make me any less anxious about a possible tragic ending. So I was extremely relieved that no one in the Cullen family died, and that even though Bella finally realised she loved Jacob too, it would never be enough. Realistically - in terms of the story - there was no way Bella and Edward would be parted again, but I was so nervous about it that I didn't pay any attention to what I knew of plots etc., letting myself instead slide wholly into the story. It's actually been a surprise, reading these books, at how well plotted they are. The story arc is smooth and eventful without being overly-complicated and smothered in detail. Yet there's lots of detail. I also admire the dialogue - the banter is great, very believable, and often provoked one of those grins that takes over your whole face which you have no hope of stopping, even when people look at you funny on the subway. My only negative with these three books has nothing to do with the story or the author: they needed tighter copy-editing. I spotted way too many missing articles and prepositions, once a missing letter, and one grammar slip-up, you know where you change a sentence but the first half of how it was originally didn't get deleted? One of those. They are a little distracting, and surprising, since it's not a low-budget publisher. I hope that they will be spotted for future editions. I very rarely get obsessive about stories - mostly because there are very few that give me everything I want. This one has danger, adventure, a race-against-time feel, and intense passion as well as super-powers and myth. The vampires alone are like superhereos except that they don't try to save the lives of innocents - the Cullens try instead not to kill them (their inside joke is calling themselves ""vegetarians"" because they don't hunt people) - which in itself is as much as you could ask of a vampire, making them heroes of a kind. Imagine having Superman as a boyfriend but without the constant disappearing act, imagine if the one person he spent his time protecting was you. Is there any wonder that these books have such a strong allure? It makes them almost more realistic than the superhero stories, since if you do find someone to love in this world, they won't be going off to put themselves in danger by trying to save the lives of complete strangers. You can have them all to yourself. The whole idea of vampires is to blend in, be inconspicuous, pretend. Though, they (the Cullen family, in particular) do have a pretty good excuse for not using their strength and speed etc. to help others: it takes almost all their will-power to resist the call of human blood. This is perhaps the first time I've encountered a vampire story that I've enjoyed so thoroughly. I don't think I've read one before, and I've only seen a couple of movies about them - Interview with the Vampire, the usual - and I hated Buffy, way too campy and cheap and dull and soap-operaish for me. So I was perhaps a bit hesitant about these books at first. But the idea of a great love between a human and a vampire drew me in, since it presented such a huge complication, a delicious threat of danger, and personally I'd rather read a story like this and feel it, than, say, drive dangerously or take drugs or bungee jump - especially that, *shudder*. Besides, it's my personaly opinion that riding horses gives you the same kind of thrill as driving fast, only more so, which is probably why people love driving so much. Yet it can't ever come close to the feeling of excitement and control and skill you get, from riding a horse. Um, what was my point? I think I was trying to understand my own obsessiveness with certain stories, like Jane Eyre, and can only really say that whatever you can find in life that speaks so loudly to you, you don't ever have to defend that to anyone. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Even so, reading these books is a guilty pleasure, and one I can see myself doing many more times. They have now joined the list of re-readable books, alongside The Blue Castle and a few select others. ",16,0.9717,0.128,0.728,0.145,0.5681518131518135,NEGATIVE,0.994
74,3843674145,02/23/2021,1.0,"★★★☆☆ —1) Twilight ★☆☆☆☆ —2) New Moon★☆☆☆☆ —3) Eclipse★★★★☆ —4) Breaking DawnEdward and Jacob accusing the other of being controlling and possessive.I must be as naive as Edward thinks Bella is because I thought New Moon would be the worst of it. For a romance series everyone sure is miserable all the time.Edward is back! His departure almost killed Bella which almost killed him, but that’s all water under the bridge. Bella wants to turn into a vampire ASAP, which Edward doesn’t want, and Edward wants to get married ASAP, which Bella doesn’t want. Bella also wants to see her best friend Jacob, but Edward, charmer that he is, forbids it. He has his psychic (but not really, if you ask me) sister monitor her plans and hold her hostage while he goes hunting. He breaks her truck to stop her from driving to La Push, but he always holds doors open for her, so let’s call it a wash. Bella finds herself defending Edward’s actions to Charlie and Jacob, despite objecting to them herself. Meanwhile Jacob has turned arrogant and callous, hardly reminiscent of the easygoing boy next door we came to know. He insists Edward denies Bella agency, but also insists he is the better option for her, whether or not she realizes it. Jacob sells himself as a chance for Bella to have more freedom, a healthier bond with someone who values her perspective instead of just ordering her around. Yet he brushes her off when she expresses concern for the pack’s wellbeing, when she tells him she doesn’t love him like he does her, and when she punches him so hard she breaks her hand after he forcibly kisses her. Sooner or later she’ll admit he’s right (worst of all, she does).Meyer also introduces the concept of imprinting, a thing that happens to werewolves where they forge an unbreakable, lifelong soulmate attachment to someone, starting the moment they first see them, regardless of age. This is why Sam got with his high school sweetheart’s cousin. The cousin resisted at first, but after Sam tore her body to shreds on accident he felt so guilty about it that she acquiesced. And what is love if not that? It’s not like Leah deserved Sam anyway; look what a bitter spiteful hag she became after he left her!As far as racism, Twilight’s pale vampires are cast as inhuman, whereas the indigenous werewolves are more subhuman. Carlisle has a family, but the wolves are a pack. The vampires are calculating, thoughtful. The wolves are young, scrappy, brash. They think they’re invincible. They’re rough around the edges, guffawing, shoving, using threats of brute force to intimidate. The vampires are well-educated, having graduated high school and college dozens of times. The wolves never seem to be in school, from ages as young as 13. Sam opted to lead the pack rather than go to college. Jacob’s understanding of consent is…lacking, to say the least, as is his remorse after overpowering Bella physically. But boys will be boys. And Jacob is a boy (or, if you ask Edward, a mongrel), while Edward is a man. Edward is wise beyond his years quite literally, whereas Jacob can only resume aging after he manages to control his mood swings enough not to turn into a wolf for an extended length of time. Eclipse ends with Jacob considering staying in wolf form forever after receiving Edward and Bella’s wedding invitation. Jacob’s emotions lessen his humanity. Edward’s emotions do the opposite. The more I think about it, masculinity as Meyer depicts it (i.e., bad, badly) is in tandem with her depiction of femininity. The foundational issue here is conceiving of women and femininity as childlike. We see this most obviously in Bella, but it’s present in everyone from Alice to Renée. The women are sensitive, small, soft. They’re not always able to see themselves and what’s best for them clearly. They underestimate or fail to spot clear danger in their midst. They’re vulnerable targets. They need looked after and taken care of. They need protected. They can be more emotional than practical, but they should be comforted and soothed, even when their reactions are overblown and silly. And it’s better not to tell children every harsh truth. Why scare and upset them when you’re taking care of things? Why involve them in every choice, as long as they’re happy and safe? By keeping women girls, Meyer struggles to create masculinities that aren’t dominated by excessive anger and strength. She has to overcompensate so Bella has a shot at making it through the day without crying or tripping herself to death. After all, it’s natural to want to defend people you care about. And if women are that fragile, how can the men who love them keep them out of harm’s way without seeming overbearing? Edward and Jacob sporadically call each other out about how the other is too controlling, but neither are exactly credible sources. The stalker tells the sexual assailant to back off. Who would win in a fight, the guy who forces kisses or the guy who forces marriage? In conclusion, everyone is stifled by patriarchal gender norms as we define ourselves in opposition to one another and assume that to fit together we must be devoid of attributes others are born with. Everyone suffers under patriarchy, including men. But I suffer the most, because I am rereading these books.",16,0.9965,0.108,0.73,0.163,0.4839246432579766,NEGATIVE,0.9992

76,20679549,04/21/2008,5.0,"****I know this was already a long review, but I added more at the end. Thus, you may be getting this as a second email.I am so glad I read this series again. I have realized so much more than I did the first time around, and it all makes so much more sense. The author's website (www.stepheniemeyer.com) also helped things really set in. If you haven't already, I recommend reading the frequently asked questions, extras, and outtakes. Some are just for fun, but others answer questions that explain the story much better.For instance, I like how she addresses two things: why Edward left in New Moon, and why Bella fell in love with Jacob. The FAQ page answers why Edward left from his own point of view, but it also made me realize that he had to leave in order for Bella to realize that she couldn't live without him (this realization was not in Edward's plans, but it solidifies Bella's choice). In Eclipse she even wonders if she would choose Jacob over Edward if she didn't have this knowledge, and this would have been impossible to know had Edward not left. It also shows us that Bella is not making the choice to become a vampire over a typical teenage romance, or because someone so beautiful loves her, but rather because Edward is her true love.I was actually mad at first that Bella had fallen in love with Jacob, and that she let that relationship go so far. I thought she was being stupid and selfish. Now I realize, though, that it makes her choice so much more valid. Had she become a vampire at the end of Twilight, it may have left all of us wondering if she really made the right choice, and if she would just regret the decision later. However, now that she knows exactly what she's giving up (her parents, a normal-length life with someone who helped her heal from the darkest part of her life, and children), it makes her choice seem much more like a sacrifice. She is willing to give all of that up for Edward. Like Stephenie Meyer says on her website, that life with Jacob could be the better life for her, but Bella chooses the Edward option anyway. This shows that her love for Edward outshines all of the normal ""human"" wants. I was also mad that Bella cried for Jacob so much the last time she left him. I hated that Edward had to see her in so much pain and agony over another man; especially because Edward is so unselfish and really does just want her to be happy. This too, however, serves a purpose in my mind. Now that Edward has seen the depth of Bella's love for Jacob and her pain, he knows that Bella is acutely aware of all that she is giving up by joining his vampire world. It's been his concern all along that Bella doesn't realize all she will be giving up to be with him, but now there can be no doubt in his mind that she realizes this. It's strange how a second reading has put these things into perspective for me. . . .Well, this was a long review, but very cathartic. Thank you to all of you who have made it this far! I do hope that in Breaking Dawn Bella marries Edward, becomes a vampire, and that Jacob imprints on someone. We know he won't imprint Bella, because the FAQ page tells us that it happens the first time a werewolf sees the person after they become a werewolf. I really hope the werewolves don't try to hurt Edward; I think I would die if anything ever happened to him!One thing I love about Edward is that his love for Bella is so pure and so strong. I have no doubt that Jacob loves Bella, but his is much more selfish and self-centered. He just wants Bella. Edward wants Bella to be happy whatever the cost to himself. A few times in Eclipse he talks about the strong relationship between vampire ""soulmates,"" and at one time he said the werewolf imprinting thing is ALMOST as strong as the way he feels about Bella. Now, when I read about imprinting, it sounds like there is no other love in the world stronger, and that nothing can break up a couple where one has imprinted on the other. Edward fully knows how strong the imprinting bond is, as he can read the werewolves' minds. However, he still knows that his love for Bella is even stronger. Isn't that sweet?! Oh, Edward is perfect!! One more thing: Jacob still has a human heart, and I have no doubt he will get over Bella and find someone else. Edward would never get over her.",16,0.9985,0.091,0.732,0.178,0.4776575276575278,POSITIVE,0.9948
77,3320995299,05/06/2020,3.0,"I have to admit the series is getting better as its going along and its growing on me. Edward is also growing on me through I am not sure I fully like him. I liked how all the characters backstories were explained in this one.Edward literally had no right to stop Bella from seeing Jacob if she wants to see him. At least they come to some sort of understanding near the end. There were many times in the book that Bella should have been mad at Edward but just kind of let him get off the hook like when he first had Alice abduct her.The only reason I would want Edward to be in my life is to help me with my college apps. Bella should have totally stood up to and been angry at Edward. I have no clue how it took them that long to figure out that Bella's clothes were taken to get her scent. Wait Bella was riding her motorcycle this entire time without a helmet?! No wonder danger follows her wherever she goes.Idk why Edward is so jealous of Jacob? He know that Bella only likes him and she totally had a chance to get with Jacob when he was gone and she didn't take it.All the stories are true stuff keeps reminding me of Shadowhunters and how all the legends are real, but in that series there are a lot more stories that match with popular versions like vampires being burned in the sun rather than glowing. It kind of gives the vampires too much power as they can go out in the day without harm. One of the biggest drawbacks of being a vampire is that they can only go out at night which is nulled.Why does Edward pressure Bella so much to marry her? If she turns, she is going to spend forever with him anyway. Also, Bella has no reason not to marry Edward because they are going to have to separate from her family to turn and she wants to be with him too. I’m glad that Edward backed down from his side of the bargain and that Bella goes through with anyway because that’s what she wants to do. Why the heck did Jacob force himself on Bella?? Ughhh I thought that at least he was better than that. Also, why is her father so chill about it? This dude should have at least had some concern for what happened instead of casually playing it off that he never taught her how to defend herself.It’s kind of dumb that she loves both of them but expected. #TeamJacobThe series has defiantly gotten better and I am kind of looking forward to reading the next book.",16,0.9293,0.082,0.802,0.115,0.5847123015873015,NEGATIVE,0.8853

Their only problems are Charlie's grounding Bella, graduation, applying to colleges, Edward's marriage proposal to Bella, Jacob, Bella's friend, being left out, and Victoria being on the hunt for Bella. All your typical teenaged problems.I Liked:I will never understand these books. They are the fluffiest of fluff and yet so enjoyable to read (even as you are bashing your head against a wall)!1.Expanding Lore. One of the things I most loved about this book was how it expanded on all the lore that has been set up in the previous novels.Firstly, Meyer expands on the Quileutes history. Uncle Billy and one of the other village elders gathers the Council together and reveals this story through oral tradition. I loved this story, it felt so organic, so real and it really kept my attention. I didn't want to set the book down at all.Rosalie proves to be fascinating; she comes to Bella and begs her to reconsider becoming a vampire. Then Rosalie proceeds to tell Bella why: that Rosalie was a socialite, had everything, was doing great, but it was all destroyed when her fiance took advantage of her. It's a griping story, a heartrending story and it makes Bella's choice to leave the mortal world all the more serious.Jasper's story is almost more fascinating than Rosalie's; he became a vampire to fight in a war of vampire covens. I loved this concept, I absolutely thought it was brilliant and scary all at once.2.Characters. I found that the characters had even grown more to my liking.Jacob continues to be one of my favorite characters. Even though at times in this book he comes off as an a-hole, Jacob, I feel, really wants Bella to be her own person, as he tells Edward:""Better frightened than lied to"" (Page 81). And isn't it true? What woman cares to be lied to, even if it is to protect her? She isn't a child anymore and is fully capable (uh, maybe not? See next section) of taking care of herself. She deserves to be treated like an adult, not as a pet or a toy.Charlie gets to call out Bella on her bad behavior last book, which I found absolutely delicious and had to include (Page 12): ""I don't think you should dump all your other friends for your boyfriend...what happened in September...if you'd had more of a life outside of Edward Cullen, it might not have been like that.""Bella really grew up in this novel. At times, she seems to have finally developed a partial backbone. When Jacob makes advances on her, she tells him no, very firmly. Also, with Edward, I was pleased to see her reprimanding him vehemently for lying to her on multiple occasions and telling him that he won't lie to her again. Also, and I am not sure how to put this, I also commend Bella for not wanting to bend immediately to Edward's desire to marry her.Edward got a scene where he was able to reveal more of himself to Bella, and for the first time, I felt I had an idea of who he was and why Bella liked him.3.Action. There is quite a bit of action in this novel, starting much earlier than usual, around the halfway mark as everyone realizes that Bella is in danger. I enjoyed the battle preparations (if I did get lost sometimes), the actual battle, and how they meet Victoria and Jane from the Volturi.I Didn't Like:I have written this section so many times, and each time it grows longer. So I am going to try to truncate it, by using words to describe why I dislike each part and then quotes or a brief explanation.1.Bella is...Co-dependent. Her one goal in life is to be with Edward. She has no goals for an occupation, no goals to go to college, no dreams of accomplishing anything beyond becoming a vampire to be forever with her Edward.""If I had my way, I would spend the majority of my time kissing Edward."" Page 43""I would never admit to him how hard it was for me when he was gone--how it brought back the abandonment nightmares. If he knew that, it would make him feel horrible and he would be afraid to ever leave me."" Page 94""Whats the point in waiting? He's all I want."" Page 183""It wouldn't be much of a life [if I weren't in love with you, Edward:]"" Page 230""He wasn't the one who was going to have to sit behind and wonder whether or not the core of his existence was going to come home."" Page 312""I love him, Jacob. He's my whole life."" Page 330""Jacob, I can't be happy without him."" Page 333""As long as I got to be with Edward, what else could I ask for?"" Page 345""You're in every thought I have."" Page 413""And I can't stand it if you leave me again."" Page 419""There was no question that he was fundamental to my survival."" Page 420""Because right now, physically, there's nothing I want more than you."" Page 446""I have to be with you. It's the only way I can live."" Page 610""Everything in my world was about him."" Page619Yes, ladies and gents, there is no life unless you have a man.Boring. If Bella is not cooking, cleaning, dropping things, tripping at convenient plot points or nuzzling Edward...she must be dead. Bella has absolutely no hobbies and is never once shown doing anything by herself for herself. Apparently, she's supposed to be smart and interested in literature, but throwing in a random comment about Wuthering Heights absolutely does not a hobby make.A complainer. If it can be complained about (even if it is for no reason), Bella will do it. Things she has complained about (that normal people actually look forward to) include: graduation, commencement, parties, marriage, and going to college.Is overdramatic. She blames herself for everything, even things that she had no control over...and never stops.Inconsistent. Its obvious that Meyer tried to write Bella one way, and yet she comes off completely different. Let me count the ways:Meyer: Bella is mature. The reader: Bella is immature, ready to run out and harm herself instead of standing behind people who can't be easily destroyed. Rosalie says it best:""In some ways, you are much more mature than I was at eighteen. But in other ways....there are many things you've probably never though about seriously...you don't want to be rash about permanent things, Bella"" (page 167).Meyer: Bella is selfless. The reader: Bella is selfish, not thinking about her parents, her friends, or anyone but herself when considering becoming a vampire. She also whines until Edward backs out of the big fight, just so he can canoodle her.Meyer: Bella is giving. The reader: Bella uses people. She uses Angela's friendship to get out of being with Edward and ""getting in trouble"" with him. She uses Jacob to get her away from Edward.Meyer: Bella is considerate. The reader: Bella is inconsiderate. When people give her things, she whines and complains about it. She ripped out the stereo Emmet gave her, almost let her tickets from Carlisle and Esme expire, won't let Edward give her anything for graduation, and only consents reluctantly to Alice planning parties for her.Meyer: Bella is thoughtful. The reader: Bella is not thoughtful. As Rosalie tells Bella how Rosalie was gang raped, Bella is wangsting about Edward being with other women in Tanya's coven. She doesn't care about hurting Jacob's feelings by dragging him along and then telling him ""No"" at his weakest moment.2.Other Characters:Edward is so...boring. He's always polite, always overprotective, knows every subject, can get admitted into Dartmouth on a sneeze, and is a virgin. He has absolutely no conflict whatsoever and is boring because of it.""There was no end to his generosity"" Page 521Jacob is...a would-be rapist. Now, I love this guy...well, until halfway through this book, he admits his love for Bella (not bad) and forces a kiss on her (VERY BAD). As Bella herself says (page 478): ""You're an enormous monster who refuses to respect anyone else's personal space."" (Funny how she doesn't say the same thing about Edward, who also refuses to let Bella live her life...) And he doesn't get any punishment. In fact, he gets congratulated by...Charlie is...an idiot father. Number one, he is totally oblivious to his daughter and her weird boyfriend (he doesn't realize something is ""paranormal"" about Edward?). Number two, there is absolutely no subtlety to his hatred (partially justified--remember, it was Edward who made his daughter a zombie) to Edward. Number three (and most important), Charlie practically gives Jacob a pat on the back for forcibly kissing Bella. When Bella tells Charlie about how Jacob force-kissed her and she hurt her hand smacking him for his actions, Charlie f@#$ing laughs. If that was my dad, I would have hit him so hard it would have made his head spin. Then, I would promptly have moved out.3.Bad Romance. Edward is a control freak. He dictates whether Bella can visit Jacob, he lies to Bella about Alice's vision, he lies to Bella about why they went to Florida, he has Alice watch her to keep her from being with Jacob, he stalks her, he chooses what Bella should do without asking her permission...in short, theirs is the epitome of an unhealthy relationship:""I sign your name better than you do yourself."" Edward, talking about how he is going to forge Bella's name on an application to Dartmouth (page 23)""There's really no point in discussing the matter further."" Edward closing off a discussion about if Bella can visit Jacob (page 28)""It wasn't so bad, except for the fact that I was being held against my will."" Bella, about how Edward conned Alice into having a sleepover at the Cullens (pages 146--147)This doesn't even include the scene where Edward removes Bella's spark plugs so she can't drive to La Push to see Jacob.4.Inconsistencies. This book is riddled with them. Here are a few I spotted:Jacob mentions Quil being on a scouting mission with the wolf pack, yet Bella is surprised to learn he is a werewolf now.Bella asks Jacob about Sam's history, which she had already learned in New Moon.Bella asks Edward why he doesn't want her to be a vampire. He already answered that it was because he didn't want her to lose her soul.Bella loves Edward so much...yet doesn't want to marry him?Bella doesn't care what people think about her (hence her 3 month catatonia) yet does care if people talk about her marrying right out of college (page 275)?Bella's mother pushed Bella not to marry young (shouldn't this have been seen earlier)?When did Edward develop the immunity to Bella's blood (page 471)?The mountains near Forks, Washington have near-blizzard weather...in June?Edward is able to start a fire with dry pine needles...when just the night before there was a massive snowstorm (page 555)?5.Other.What is up with the heavy-handed references to Wuthering Heights (page 517 and 611)? Did Meyer just finish reading the Cliff Notes version? Talk about no subtlety.I understand this is a young adult novel, but I couldn't help but feel I was being talked down to.Meyer has a tendency to set up an interesting scene then totally cut away from it and focus on Edward and Bella snuggling (for instance, the day before the Big Fight).Meyer is hereby banned from using any of the following words or any of their forms: grimace, chuckle, flinch, wince, mumble, mutter, growl, moan, snort...I could go on.Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:There is some swearing, but nothing beyond a few d***, h***, and p***ed.There is enormous sexual tension between Bella and Edward and Bella and Jacob. Between Bella and Edward, Bella is constantly trying to get Edward to sleep with her, and Edward is always holding back. Jacob and Bella kiss twice: once, Jacob forces kisses her, the second, he tricks her into kissing him.Seattle has been plagued with numerous murders. Rosalie reveals that she was gang raped before she became a vampire. Jasper was brutally attacked as a young vampire. Bella is in constant danger. The last 100 pages is rife with rather brutal bluntness about decapitations, ripping body parts, and other ways to maim vampires.Overall:This book is very hard to rate. It was sometimes just as enjoyable as the previous books, and yet there were aspects that bugged me (namely, Bella).The story progresses well, even if there was an unnecessary romantic triangle and sudden revulsion to marriage thrown in. The aspect I loved was the vampire battle, but found myself also growing closer to Edward, Jacob, and even Bella.I know when the next book comes out on paperback, I'll buy it and read it. And I'm going to see the Eclipse movie in theaters when it comes out. It's good, but definitely not for everyone.As for parents of teenaged girls who may be flocking to it, I would recommend making sure that young ladies (AND GENTLEMEN) realize that Bella and Edward's BEHAVIOR is very unhealthy and borderline abusive, that Bella's obsession with Edward to the exclusion of others is wrong, that Jacob is wrong for forcing or deceiving Bella to kiss him, and that abuse is NOT a laughing matter.",15,-0.9982,0.147,0.742,0.111,0.5281514125229211,POSITIVE,0.9993
79,3484920023,08/13/2020,4.0,"No I did NOT cry twice during this book. I never shed tears over Edward Cullen. I swear.I appreciate the plot picking up in this book, it feels faster paced and intense than the first two. It also moves in a more mature direction, as the characters are developing and the relationships become more serious. At the core, it’s still about hormonal teenagers though and that’s still ragingly obvious. Obviously the main characters are developing, but what I loved in this book was learning more about Jasper and Rosalie, the latter especially. I feel like we learn so much more about her that her character and actions now make perfect sense. Also really appreciate where she sincerely apologises to Bella and tries to help her see things from her perspective, so her behaviour can be understood. I really love her, and I’m still not over how Edward talked about her in Midnight Sun he needs a slap for that.Listen Jacob, I’m really trying to like you but when you keep acting like a complete tool it makes it extremely difficult. At least when Edward is being an idiot he changes his behaviour and apologises, you’re just really testing my patience. I have lost count of how many times Bella, in this book and New Moon, made her boundaries extremely clear. And time and time again, Jacob is extremely pushy and will NOT leave Bella alone. He’s constantly trying to make her feel guilty and feel something she doesn’t and it’s irritating. When he’s just acting normal and being her best friend, he’s so lovely. But he always has to open his mouth and ruin it. I understand he’s jealous right, but he’s known how Bella feels for years if he loves her he should want her to be happy. I hated the way he essentially gaslights her, the ending scenes in the book are ridiculous. Jacob PLEASE get a grip and start respecting Bella. Thanks.Okay, after slating Jacob like that it's probably only fair that I talk about how Edward annoyed me. Edward I admit was very controlling in the first half of the book - I do not condone what he did at all. I was literally so irritated by how much authority he thought he had over Bella to try and stop her from seeing Jacob, but as the book goes on he apologises and he stops behaving like he owns her. He apologises and admits what he was doing was completely out of order and didn’t do it again. He grows to love and accept Jacob in Bella’s life, because he wants to make Bella genuinely happy and he wants Bella to be okay - the same could not be said for Jacob. At the start of this book Edward is a complete moron and I wanted to punch him but he did sort himself out really quickly which I appreciated. He’s usually very open and apologetic when he knows he’s in the wrong, probably one of my favourite aspects of his character.Edward and Jacob have, clearly, a really tense relationship but I loved the direction this book took. The two halves of Bella’s life were essentially forced together and it made for some interesting conversations. I think there were some tender moments between Edward and Jacob, and some level of mutual respect and understanding. It’s a shame Jacob undermined all that the next day with his stupid behaviour but there we go (clearly, I will rage about this forever sorry). If we’re being bold…. SM should’ve just made this into a poly relationship. I think it could’ve worked, and been quite amusing as they tried to navigate it. But that’s a conversation for another day, and one for when Jacob decides to act right.SM….. we need to have words on the decisions you made when inventing the imprinting system….. like…. You could have NOT done that.Anyway, I’m still Twilight trash and I feel like Breaking Dawn will rip my heart out. 13 year old me would be so confused if I told her this was going to happen honestly.",15,0.9972,0.111,0.69,0.2,0.5386479076479077,NEGATIVE,0.8194
80,12288954,01/11/2008,5.0,"I'm a bit at a loss for word. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, I think even more than Twilight. And it's left me quiet, reflective, and well, peaceful. I'd almost be okay if that was the end of the series. Not because it's a perfect ending, far from it. But it addressed such huge themes in such a loving way that it's now held in such high regard.At the beginning of this book I had my doubts. Bella(trix) was annoying me, and Bella NEVER annoys me. That had me worried. But everything was worked out in it's own way. All misunderstandings were smoothed over. Edward allowed Bella to see Jacob. Bella accepted Edwards terms, while Edward accepted Bella's. Ties were forged with the enemy, and a mortal foe was vanquished. Bella came to grips with her life altering (ending...) decision. She thought it through and accepted it, excitedly, and a bit timidly. But none of this was as important as Jacob and Bella.Oh Jacob. A fool really. A fool I love dearly. A 16 year old, headstrong, emotional kid that occasionaly turns into a werewolf, and is in love with a vampires fiancee. It's okay, we all have our problems. But I loved him. Was I angry with him? Of course! Did I think he was an idiot? Most of the time, especially when he was kissing Bella. But was it right? Of course. They were/are soul mates. It's plain to see, even for Edward. But Bella knows she can live without Jacob, while she can't live without Edward. And so the choice is made. I think the reason I like this book so much was because it handled love in such a beautiful way...in such a classic way. One of the great love stories. Romeo and Juliet. Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. Link and Tracy. Heathcliff and Cathy. Edward and Bella. And Jacob. Sigh. So tragically beautiful. But I'm not sad. Is that wierd? Yes, I think so. Maybe I should wallow a bit...But what else did I love about this book? The humor, the little details, the jokes. I loved the description of Alice and Edward playing chess. I loved when Alice was avoiding Edward so he wouldn't read her mind, and she began translating 'The Battle Hymn for the Republic' in Arabic, and thinking of Korean Sign Language. I loved getting a glimpse into Rose's head. I loved when Bella walked into the garage with a broken hand and Emmett assumed she tripped. Her response? ""No Emmett, I punched a werewolf in the face."" I can't tell you how hard I laughed. I loved Edward and Jacob's conversation as they sat in the tent. I love Alice. Oh man, are there words for how much I love Alice? Besides the whole vampire thing, I want TO BE Alice. She's the most thoughtful (ha ha) person I've ever encountered. ",15,0.9978,0.091,0.672,0.237,0.6258393866020985,POSITIVE,0.9996

God, it was so fucking long, boring, and beyond terrible.Bella, Edward, Jacob, Leah, and basically everyone else in this shit show of a book were fucking annoying as shit. God, I can't even count the amount of times I kept praying to be suddenly blinded by this book. I still want to forever be blind so I don't have to read another word from this Twilight series.I probably would've like this book if everything was written completely differently.

He will do and be anything she needs. He doesn’t want her to hurt or feel pain. He wants her to have a life, with or without him. I wouldn’t say he is noble because the bicker between Edward and Jake is kinda awesome. Hahah I am a sick sick lady. What can I say. (view spoiler)[Jake makes Bella see her feeling for him. This kind of pissed me off but I totally get why he wanted his chance. But it just isn’t in her. She wanted Edward and she always has. She cried 1 night for Jake.. She was tortured for MONTHS without Edward.  (hide spoiler)]She was willing to risk her life for his. Just so he would live. That was why I loved New Moon so much. We got to see her pain of losing her heart. And yes she loses some of it to Jake but it’s not the love she feels for Edward. Glad the action parts were as epic as I remembered.

84,27414052,07/16/2008,2.0,"I would like to have children at some point. And if they are female children and if Twilight is still popular when they become teenagers (one never knows) I’m going to pull a mean mom act and forbid them from reading anything from this series UNTIL they’ve read “I Capture the Castle” first, which I think is one of those books that every girl who is or any woman who ever was a teenage girl must read. Fantastic, fantastic book. If you haven’t read it, I urge you to do so. So anyway, I’m a bit of a Twilight naysayer (yeah, I know, go ahead and do your boo-hiss act on me, I’ve steeled myself for it). I’m too analytical to enjoy these books at face value (my own fault, I admit). Personally, I’d rather chew my own arm off than be romantically involved with someone who is as controlling as Edward. I think Jacob is the only character who’s actually been developed using the “show, don’t tell” method. And I think Bella is the most god-awful twit I’ve ever encountered in literature. Oh. And she’s a Mary-Sue. Reading Twilight gives me flashbacks to the 18-month period of my life that was spent reading Harry Potter fan fiction, most of which is horrifically bad with only one or two exceptions.***spoilers past this point***The problem I’ve had from the beginning of this series has mostly been with the uncomfortably high level of angst that never cools. But also with the fact that Bella and Edward never had any real courtship. She saw him and immediately ceased to be herself. If he wasn’t around, she turned into an empty shell of a human being and became completely worthless as an individual. For his part, he smelled her blood and was instantly hooked. There was never a tentative spark followed by a period of falling in love and growing together. Their love was too instantaneous. The way I see it, that ain’t love. Obsession? Yes. Addiction? Yes. Unhealthy teenage infatuation? Oh hell yes. And I’m sorry, but those things don’t make me feel warm and fuzzy inside. Worried and concerned but most definitely not warm and fuzzy.I suppose one could potentially argue their case by saying it was proof of that fantastic fairy tale dream we call “true love” or “love at first sight.” And so it was with that dubious explanation that I’ve continued to read this series even though I am fairly critical of it. And also, let’s face it, for the entertainment factor alone, Stephenie Meyer’s definitely got it going on. Oh. And yes, I do plan on borrowing the fourth installment from my local library!So anyway, take the fact that I never really “got” Bella and Edward in love and imagine my surprise when twerpy Bella marches onto the pages of this third installment of the series and proceeds to feign shock and utter amazement when she learns that “imprinting” is essentially the werewolf version of love at first sight. Jacob’s eyes strayed to the ocean. “Sam did love Leah. But when he saw Emily, that didn’t matter anymore. Sometimes…we don’t exactly know why…we find our mates that way.” His eyes flashed back to me, his face reddening. “I mean…our soul mates.”“What way? Love at first sight?” I snickered.Jacob wasn’t smiling. His dark eyes were critical of my reaction. “It’s a little bit more powerful than that. More absolute.” “Sorry,” I muttered. “You’re serious, aren’t you?”“Yeah, I am.”“Love at first sight? But more powerful?” My voice still sounded dubious, and he could hear that.So okay, will someone please explain to me why Bella is so confounded by someone else’s ability to experience love at first sight? A concept that has clearly already occurred in this particular world that Meyer has created??? Because the way I see it, that’s exactly how it happened for her and Edward, right? RIGHT?!? I don’t understand why this is such a shocking concept for her to grasp. To me, this is just one incident in many that shows how Bella is immature, selfish and completely clueless about the world around her (like most teenagers).Okay, so please permit me to attempt to identify here...During my senior year of high school, it felt like every single person I spoke to was quizzing me about my future. My family wanted to know what my plans were. Teachers were relentless. People from church wanted to know what I saw myself doing. So what do you say? You say, “Well, of course I’m going to college. And once I get there, I’ll choose a major after I’ve had a chance to take some classes and explore my options. I’m not sure what yet because I’m interested in so many things, such as bla bla bla and bla bla bla.” Which wasn’t entirely true except it kept people off my back and that was the point. The same thing happened my senior year of college with graduation just around the corner. What are you going to do with your life? What comes next? So I gave the bullshit answers. Told people what they expected to hear. But when I talked to my friends or when I talked to my mom (who is an amazing woman, by the way) I could be honest and felt myself admitting that I had no idea what I wanted, that I had no idea what to do with my life and that I found it concerning that me, a shy young person, was given the responsibility of making decisions that would dramatically impact the life of some grown-up who didn’t even exist yet but who I desperately wanted to see succeed in her life and be happy when her time came (See? Even as a kid I was always been overly-analytical, especially with myself).And therein lies the crux of the problem I have with this book and with Bella. She terrifies me as a person. She hasn’t become her own person and is putting herself in a situation that could potentially mean that she never does. She’s way too young to make any types of decisions that make sense. She’s selfish. She’s immature. She is a generic teenage girl. She could be anybody. And I can’t identify with her anymore because the entire time I’m thinking, “NOOOOO!!!! GIRLFRIEND, NOOOOO!!!! YOU HAVE NO IDEA WTF YOU'RE DOING!”All that said, I’m sure things will work out for her and based on the reviews/spoilers I’ve read from the fourth book in this series, it seems like it does, which is nice. Life has a funny way of ironing out the kinks over time and people are wonderfully resilient. When I think about some of the problems I dug myself into as a young adult I’m amazed that I managed to recover from them. And looking back on decisions I made 10+ years ago, there are actually very few things I’d change. The mistakes and bad choices I made shaped me as a person and learning how to mold my life to fit those decisions has made me into a person I’m okay being. So I know the same thing probably will happen for Bella and I just need to back the eff off and leave her alone, even though every fiber of my being is screaming at her to BE RATIONAL, which she just isn’t mature enough to be at this point in time. Okay. Clearly I am thinking too hard. Again. Buuuut…I’ve been doing that a lot lately…. I’m turning 30 soon and apparently this is how I deal with it. I blame poor, defenseless characters in books for my own thoughts and questions and hopes and wishes for both the past and the future. But it does make me think about it so maybe that’s an okay thing.",14,0.9966,0.095,0.769,0.136,0.527846371882086,POSITIVE,0.6509
85,7329172,10/05/2007,2.0,"I tried to like ""Eclipse."" I really did. However, I just couldn't get into it. First, it's way too long. Major events don't really happen until the last fourth of the book. The rest is basically a love triangle drama. Additionally, it's patently obvious to the reader that Victoria is behind the killings in Seattle from the beginning. I mean, are the characters in this book really that shortsighted?This book also solidified my complete dislike of Bella. One of the incredibly annoying things about her is her views about turning into a vampire. She seems incredibly callous, with little real thought of the consequences of her actions. Does she really get that she's giving up her family and friends forever? Has she really thought about the fact that she'll probably be a bloodsucking monster bent on killing humans for the first few years? She doesn't seem to have any moral qualms about these issues. It's like they don't really matter in the face of her all consuming (and really unhealthy) love for Edward. Ugh. Another annoying aspect is that she seems obsessed with the age difference between her and Edward. She refuses to wait to turn, but it seems largely because she doesn't want to be ""older"" than Edward (who was turned when he was 17 or so). Yeah, the whole Volturi thing is hanging over them, but Bella seems more concerned about being as young and beautiful as Edward. Seems shallow to me.Another annoying thing. Why does everyone in the Cullen family have a tragic past? This books reveals Jasper and Rosalie's pasts and they are, of course, tragic. Seems overwrought to me.I also have to be honest. I find Edward one-dimensional. I get it, he's hot and sensitive. Yippee.The one character I do still enjoy in this book is Jacob Black, even if he is all depressed and lovelorn throughout most of the novel. I found one line of his particularly nice. (It basically explains why the title is ""Eclipse""). The epilogue in his voice was initially confusing though. It took me a moment to realize we were switching to his perspective.Overall, you should read this if you want to keep up on popular YA novels, but don't expect much unless you're already a fan of the series. If you do want some good vampire stories (including some that don't include sexy, romantic, doe-eyed vamps), check out ""Baltimore, or the Steadfast Tin Soldier and the Vampire,"" ""Silver Kiss,"" the 30 Days of Night graphic novels, early Anita Blake novels (before they became sex fests) or watch the ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" TV series.

 I will be immortal for you any day. Bella: you're so not worthy of Edwards undying love. How you can even think of another is beyond me.

The first two Twilight and Eclipse are easy to obsess over. Plus because you get hooked on the first two - you'll probably just need to finish the series....In the first two books the crush you develop on Edward so intense and pungent that it blinds you to the mediocrity of Meyer's proficiency as a writer. It's even enough to allow you to overcome overcome the stupidity and dullness of Bella - the main character. But by book three not even Edward's ""rock hard chest"" or the ""coolness of his kisses"" can overcome the books flaws. And I just grew tired of it all. I was hoping, at least, that Bella would impress me by saying something smart, doing something brave or good but she doesn't. She's unfortunately insipid and ridiculous. And Edward and Jacob's interest in her is completely unbelievable by this book. Plus I grew tired of Meyer's inability to come up with new phrases or sentence structures.

92,17122744,03/05/2008,4.0,"Like New Moon, Eclipse started out annoying me, then managed to hook me and draw me in anyway.As the story gets started, everyone is being stupid and cliched – Bella dense and somewhat selfish, Edward controlling, and Jacob rude. Only after the action started to pick up and the conversations between the three main characters began to gain a little depth did I find myself really getting absorbed.Also like New Moon, once hooked I couldn’t put it down, and yet I finished the book feeling slightly ambiguous. Why is that? The plot is not the problem – it’s well crafted with both external and internal forces coming to a crisis with Bella at the same time, and concluding with a final decision that ought to be extremely satisfying. The werewolf/vampire interactions were really fun to read as well, with lots of delightful details about the way their minds work. Action scenes were well-written and suspenseful.Characterization is mostly good. I appreciated getting a little more depth to some of the minor characters, especially Jasper, who has the potential to be really fascinating. I think I might have a teeny crush on Jasper – only a teeny one, because my heart belongs to Jacob. Jacob is the best character of all – really well drawn, very realistic and totally charming, flaws and all. This makes it even more difficult to sympathize with Bella; but Bella has always been a bit of a Mary Sue.It’s hard to believe in someone who has vampires and werewolves falling all over her and still is remarkably clueless. I liked Bella for most of the book, but I did start to have issues towards the end when I couldn’t help agreeing with her that she was being really selfish. She was starting to acquire a rather Potter-ish savior complex, and no, she really wasn’t being fair to Jacob. Also, the conversation with Edward about sex/marriage was kind of “meh” to me. I do appreciate (as I know Alyson will agree) a man who will argue for virtue. In general, that makes me go weak at the knees. But I think Edward is using the wrong reasons in his argument, while Bella’s motivations are all confused – she’s believable and even likeable when it comes to hesitantly trying to seduce Edward, but then I find it hard to sympathize with her attitude toward Edward’s proposal. It seems selfish, again. I think one of the problems with Bella is that Meyer is trying to make her strong and independent and the next moment she’ll be fainting and dissolving in tears. Bella is a teenage girl with insecurities, which is fine and sometimes comes across quite realistically, but then don’t also try to make us believe that she is more mature than her age.Edward’s characterization is equally spotty. Good Edward moments: his joy when Bella puts on his ring; the whole conversation with Jacob in the tent, even though the setup felt contrived. Ridiculous Edward moments: that he doesn’t feel the slightest resentment toward Bella for insisting he stay behind from the fight (not how things work in real life); the idea that Bella’s really hot (literally) kiss with Jacob wouldn’t bother him in the slightest. That’s really inconsistent and unbelievable, not to mention making Edward a little too perfect – which might be part of my problem with the ending.However I think most of my uneasiness comes from the setup of Bella’s internal conflict. I realized, pondering it, what the problem is: after all the angst and struggle and indecision, not to mention my own strong belief in the idea that love is a choice, a conscious commitment – despite all this, Bella’s final decision is a non-decision. There’s no real uncertainty about what she’s going to choose. I mentioned this in my review of New Moon: when you set up the Fated Lurve that is Stronger than Death, you kind of paint yourself into a corner, as a writer. It doesn’t help that Bella’s literary comparisons have been Romeo and Juliet and Wuthering Heights. I don’t care for Romeo and Juliet, and Wuthering Heights should never be mistaken for a romance. Not to mention the fact that both those works are tragedies and only work as tragedies. No one ever wonders what would have happened if Romeo and Juliet had been happily married for twenty years and only argued about the way Romeo would never wring out the dishcloth.This is why the Jacob/Bella relationship is in many ways much more interesting than the Edward/Bella relationship. Sweet as Edward is, there’s no real natural conflict there, and all the artificially inserted conflict (like sex, protecting Bella, the timing on making her a vampire) ends up feeling forced and therefore slightly annoying. Whereas Jacob is everything a hero should be: funny, devoted, conflicted, flawed but not too flawed. I admit to tearing up a little bit during Bella’s goodbye with Jacob: “I could have been your air and your sun.” GAH! *sob* It’s not that I minded Bella choosing Edward over Jacob – it’s sad but well-written. It’s that she doesn’t really have any reasons for choosing; in fact she doesn’t choose at all. She just accepts that “this is the way it is.” If choice is the grand theme of your novel, I think there should be some, y’know, real choice involved. Poor Jacob is just as fated as Bella/Edward.Despite all this, I did like the book. I liked it, I was interested, I couldn’t stop thinking about it. It’s fortunate that Meyer is actually a decent writer. She’s created a fun mythology, mostly interesting and likeable characters, intense relationships, and readable plots. Did I mention being hooked whether I like it or not? I’m going to have to buy the next book, now.",13,0.9962,0.124,0.701,0.176,0.5633409992784993,NEGATIVE,0.9926

This book was BAD.ETA: (9/27/15):This book made me start the fake hashtag #FreeBella2K15 because this book brought out the douchebags and fuckboys.I used to be Bella/Jacob 4 life, but re-reading this book, really changed that for me, even for the early books. Why? Because Jacob is a fuckboy. It wasn't in the first book, but by the second book the seeds are sewn. Then we have the third book were he has bloomed into a fuckboy flower. He was so entitled and full on forcibly kissed her to the point were she broke her own hand in the process of fighting him off. Later it led to manipulative kisses in some weird bet between him and Edward. Some people will probably be wondering why I am all for freeing Bella. I may not like the character, because she is a badly written paperboard cut-out that is used for the reader to self-insert themselves into the story. So while I dislike the character for that reason, I still feel pity for her. Even self-insert blank female characters don't deserve this shit. So yes, #FreeBella2K15. Edward continues to be a winner by being an abusive asshat. Nothing new here.Charlie continues to be a shitty parent, who occasionally parents but in the worst ways ever. He earns my wrath for laughing and congratulating Jacob on forcibly kissing Bella and the resulted broken hand. Remember Charlie has no idea that Jacob is a werewolf. I mean this is not how a parent should re-act to this situation especially the sheriff. There are other things like shitty writing and slow, meandering, bloated plot-line that could lose a few hundred pages and retain all necessary information. Sloppy writing. Sloppy editing.

98,147929619,02/13/2011,,"**spoilers for Wuthering Heights, Twilight, New Moon, Eclipse, and Breaking Dawn**""From the Pride and Prejudice-like coming together through a series of misunderstandings and misinterpretations of feelings keeping the pair apart in Twilight, to the Romeo and Juliet star-crossed lovers story and close-to-tragic moment in New Moon, to the love triangle in Eclipse and its parallels to Wuthering Heights, the Twilight saga is an homage to these great love stories and works of literature.""http://www.squidoo.com/bellaswanWuthering Heights is nothing like Eclipse. It's not a love triangle and it's certainly not romantic. It's not a love triangle if you know the girl only wants one of the two boys who want her, it’s a love triangle if she’s torn between the two of them. And what’s romantic about a pair of lovers who betray and torture each other with their selfishness?But here’s the interesting thing – Meyer casts the boys the wrong way around. Either that or she’s never read Wuthering Heights. In her version, Bella (Cathy) didn't know Edward (Heathcliff) in her childhood, she knew Jacob (Edgar). She doesn't marry Jacob (Edgar), she marries Edward (Heathcliff). But in Wuthering Heights, Cathy (Bella) marries handsome Edgar (Jacob) over soulmate Heathcliff (Edward). Therefore, Edward is really Edgar, and Jacob is really Heathcliff.However, in Eclipse, Edwards says he identifies with Heathcliff. A physically abusive, emotionally abusive, mentally abusive madman. An uneducated loaf who, because the 'love of his life' marries someone else, deigns to destroy the current generation by running off with Cathy's sister in law and inflicts misery on the next generation by keeping Cathy’s nephew Hareton uneducated and as a servant, keeping his own son Linton miserable and ill without a doctor in attendance, and kidnapping Cathy’s daughter Catherine, physically abusing her, and forcing her to marry Linton so he can control all of her wealth as well as the wealth he stole off her uncle, Hindley (Hareton's father). Not only that, but this brute of a ‘gentleman’ tortures animals, as well. I’ll let Nelly provide the proof:My surprise and perplexity were great on discovering, by touch more than vision, Miss Isabella’s springer, Fanny, suspended by a handkerchief, and nearly at its last gasp. I quickly released the animal… I repeatedly caught the beat of horses’ feet galloping at some distance… though it was a strange sound, in that place, at two o’clock in the morning.This is the man Edward identifies with. A man who would hang an innocent and helpless dog and then run off with its empty-headed mistress at two o’clock in the morning. That’s where his creeper tendencies came from. No doubt he crept into Isabella’s bedroom and watched her sleep, as well!Yeah, makes perfect sense. Heathcliff is NOT a desirable character, yet Edward identifies with him.Does that leave Bella to identify with Cathy? A spoiled little bitch who forgoes the real love of her life to marry some guy ""because he is handsome""? Does that mean that Bella doesn't really love Edward, she just can't see past his sparkly emo facade to the real simpering weakling underneath? The kind of person who only appeals to Cathy/Bella because he is rich and handsome?Then I put her through the following catechism: for a girl of twenty-two it was not injudicious.‘Why do you love him, Miss Cathy?’‘Nonsense, I do—that’s sufficient.’‘By no means; you must say why?’‘Well, because he is handsome, and pleasant to be with.’‘Bad!’ was my commentary.‘And because he is young and cheerful.’‘Bad, still.’‘And because he loves me.’‘Indifferent, coming there.’‘And he will be rich, and I shall like to be the greatest woman of the neighbourhood, and I shall be proud of having such a husband.’Good reasons to marry a man? I should think not. But what's worse, here are Cathy's reasons as to why she loves Edgar Linton:‘… And now, say how you love him?’‘As everybody loves—You’re silly, Nelly.’‘Not at all—Answer.’‘I love the ground under his feet, and the air over his head, and everything he touches, and every word he says. I love all his looks, and all his actions, and him entirely and altogether. There now!’‘And why?’‘Nay; you are making a jest of it: it is exceedingly ill-natured! It’s no jest to me!’ said the young lady, scowling, and turning her face to the fire.‘I’m very far from jesting, Miss Catherine,’ I replied. ‘You love Mr. Edgar because he is handsome, and young, and cheerful, and rich, and loves you. The last, however, goes for nothing: you would love him without that, probably; and with it you wouldn’t, unless he possessed the four former attractions.’‘No, to be sure not: I should only pity him—hate him, perhaps, if he were ugly, and a clown.’Yep, sounds like Bella to me. If Edward was The Hunchback of Notre Dame she wouldn’t look twice at him, and if he was the deformed Phantom of the Opera (not the Gerard Butler version, but the real version where he’s a 50 year old man and she’s a woman of twenty) (now that’s a real love triangle) there is not a snowflake’s chance in Hell that she’s consider anyone other than the handsome, rich young man that sweeps her off her feet, even if he is busy grooming her for an abusive relationship.Here’s a small snippet that reminds me of Bella’s relationship with Edward and his sister Alice.She seemed almost over-fond of Mr. Linton; and even to his sister she showed plenty of affection.Here’s another segment I found that reminds me off Bella’s depression in New Moon:Catherine had seasons of gloom and silence now and then: they were respected with sympathising silence by her husband (see: Bella’s father, Charlie), who ascribed them to an alteration in her constitution, produced by her perilous illness (see: perilous break-up); as she was never subject to depression of spirits before.And here’s a section I found amusing:‘If I were only sure it would kill him,’ she interrupted, ‘I’d kill myself directly!Well, we’re all aware that Bella was only one step away from suicide in New Moon just to get Edward’s attention.And here’s the funniest part of the whole book, which reflects exactly why Bella’s a Mary-Sue: because she’s based on the most horrendous stuck-up snobby spoiled bitch-masquerading-as-a-heroine in all of classic literature:“I thought, though everybody hated and despised each other, they could not avoid loving me.’BAHAHA! No one can avoid loving Bella. Despite being not particularly good-looking or interesting, she instantly gains the attention of all the boys at her new school and also the one boy who is disinterested in every other girl even when they throw themselves at him (like Bella’s kind of bitchy friend and that vampire chick from the Denali clan).But here's the rub. With Edward playing the role of Edgar, Jacob - the boy who comes off second best in the Eclipse love triangle, plays the role of Heathcliff, the man who comes off second best in the Wuthering Heights love triangle. Heathcliff is an angry force of nature that inflicts misery on two generations of the Earnshaw-Linton family. Jacob has anger issues, worse even than Edward does. Jacob is definitely Heathcliff. This is where the comparison between the two gets iffy, and anyone who’s read Wuthering Heights would know it’s not a good comparison to Eclipse. Cathy has Edgar’s baby, and Bella has Edward’s. Heathcliff runs away when the baby is born, and so does Jacob. Yet over and over again, the story shows how Cathy loves Heathcliff more than Edgar Linton, and Heathcliff loves Cathy more than anything else in the world. The two torture each other with their love. Cathy’s love for Edgar pales in comparison. She clearly only wants Heathcliff, yet she's a selfish stuck up spoiled little cow and she marries Edgar for a whole bunch of shallow reasons. And here's what Cathy has to say about her love for Heathcliff:""My love for [Edgar] Linton is like the foliage in the woods: time will change it, I’m well aware, as winter changes the trees. My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath: a source of little visible delight, but necessary. Nelly, I am Heathcliff! He’s always, always in my mind: not as a pleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to myself, but as my own being.""And who does Bella end up with?Now we know for a fact that Edward hasn’t read the book, and I cast aspersions on whether Meyer did as well, or if she didn’t understand it. It’s not a complex story. It’s blindingly obvious. How could Meyer have got it so wrong?So: who’s read Wuthering Heights? What do you think of the comparison to Eclipse?You can find my Wuthering Heights review here:http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...",12,0.9986,0.122,0.705,0.172,0.5716466167996778,NEGATIVE,0.9991
99,31884401,09/02/2008,1.0,"Finally, my long awaited ;) review: Again, first of all, if you are going to use a piece of literature influence your book, choose a cool one! Wuthering Heights??? Another infamous piece of literature which illustrates how to destroy a romantic relationship. I loathe Wuthering Heights more than I do Romeo and Juliet. So, yes, this review is going to be somewhat harsh. Sorry.Where to begin? So many topics to discuss. First of all: do not fall in love with two people at once. Once Bella chose Ed, she needed to let Jacob (poor guy) go. It was selfish and cruel of Bella to hang on to Jacob that way, when she knew that, he was in love with her. She has a hard time letting Jacob go because she missed him and he is her best friend. If your best friend and your lover are not the same person, sorry sweetie, you need to let one go. If you're “adult” enough to love someone and have a serious physical relationship, you should be “adult” enough to handle that situation and make the right choice.Next topic: Your love and your best friend should really be the same person. Or in the very least you should be friends with your love. So much of Ed and Bella's relationship focuses on the physical aspect of it. I may be exaggerating a little, but I feel that they are not really in love with each other, they are each in love with the other person's body. Jacob sums it up well. He mentions to Bella that Edward is her drug. Um, last I checked, drugs are bad for you. I hope that their relationship remains at that level of passion for eternity, because if doesn't, there goes the relationship....gone. Reality is people, no one maintains that level of passion all the time. That is why we have we have books, seminars, and counseling sessions about “spicing up” a marriage. This is where the friendship thing comes in. At times when the passion is less, you have the companionship of a good friend to sustain you. Bottom line: passion is good, but a relationship needs friendship to support it.Next: Marriage. It irritates me that Bella doesn't want to get married because she thinks it has a negative stigma. The thought process is along the lines of, “It's not modern to get married. People will look at me funny for getting married so young. It didn't work out for my mom. We're committed to each other for eternity, what do we need to get married for?” Lame. They are going to be living together, having sex, and basically acting like married people. Why not get married? Will that somehow make you less committed to one another? And who cares what other nosy people think? Are you going to let nosy people run your life? Girls with Bella's attitude tread on dangerous ground. Many girls with this view point, meet a guy, feel passionate, and move in with him. They might decide to have kids in a year. Then when the passion is gone, he leaves and finds a new girl to live with. He doesn't have a problem with it, it's okay. He wasn't breaking a commitment. Now our girl is a single mom. She feels hurt and starts thinking all men are this way. Wrong. Some men are bums and when you go around offering them sex on a platter with no responsibilities, they jump on it. Girls should encourage men to be responsible, not feed their desires for an easy, sexual life. True empowerment is realizing that you are worth a man with morals who is willing to be responsible and committed to you. (Yes, they do exist.) If he's not willing to make you a promise to be around through good times and bad, then he's not worth your time. It's a good thing for Bella that Ed is now truly committed to her and learned from the whole dumping episode. Ed is willing to MARRY Bella, in front of everyone, and make her an everlasting promise of commitment. Wake up Bella! I mean I know marriages end unhappily sometimes but at least we are heading in the right direction.Bella states (I'm pretty sure it's in this book, if not we'll discuss it now anyway), “Love is irrational.” Wrong. If love makes you irrational, do yourself a favor, slap yourself on the face, and wake up! Okay. Now that you have your brain back, ask yourself some questions: Is the person you love stable? Does he treat you with kindness and respect? Are you making any stupid decisions that will ruin the rest of your life???? Yes, love can make a person giddy, and cloud judgment, but honestly it should not make one stupid. Seriously people. Let's have some self control and responsibility for our actions here. If you can't control yourself from impulsive decisions, then your not ready for serious commitment.Okay, last thing I will say about this book. It is very adult. I wouldn't want my teen, if I had one, reading it. Pretty much, Bella and Edward nearly have sex. There you go. That and the fact that this book portrays some messed up ideas about love makes me against it. Don't worry though, my review of

I just feel that this series gets worse with the books that come along. One of my pet peeves is that I have to finish once I'm in a series, and I'm glad we only have one book to go. I'm also a bit scared, because it's HUGE. Will probably take us 6 months.A longer review can be found at BiteIntoBooksI'm turning in one of those ""I-hate-Twilight"" people and I can't help it.

101,8656777,11/04/2007,3.0,"It's finished. At least until the next, highly anticipated book. That book that is the beacon of hope to every disillusioned, silly, teenage girl who believes Edward really exists. Here's a bit of education for you: he doesn't. And even if he did, he wouldn't be interested in a selfish, self-absorbed, teenage girl.My reviews of Twilight and New Moon still stand. Neither one was stellar, let alone worth the hype. I also think it's as if she wasted two books to get to this one. Eclipse was enjoyable to read. Twilight and New Moon failed to fulfil their potential. Eclipse wasn't stellar either, but I was pleasantly surprised by it. I could actually see myself re-reading this one. The writing improved dramatically. I think Stephenie Meyer suddenly remembered some of her college-learned writing techniques and realized what was missing in her previous work. I'd like to say she found a better editor, but I don't think so. Although, while the editing is still lacking, it is leaps and bounds above Twilight, which didn't seem to be edited at all. I appreciated the detail she finally provided. It was nice to see real conversations of substance. I appreciated the discussions and explanations. It was nice to see some back history provided for several of the characters. Although, the Cullen family is so involved with each other that it's still frustrating to see that even with the stories of Rosalie and Jasper explained, they remain one-dimensional characters. And any detail or substance to Esme is practically non-existent. I still think Bella is a selfish, self-absorbed teenager and it's still hard for me to see why Edward loves her. Lusts after her, sure. And, I find the whole ""I can't live without you"" scenario annoying. I firmly believe that personal happiness is dependent on one person: yourself. Your life is enriched and blessed when you have the love and devotion of another, but they are not responsible for your happiness. I liked the interaction between Jacob and Bella when he tells her that he was right for her and the natural path her life would have taken. Jacob let Bella be Bella, he didn't try and control her. And had Edward not come back in New Moon, Bella would have been happy with Jacob. And just for the record, I'm not pro-Jacob anymore than I'm pro-Edward. They're just characters in a book.I also find Edward's ultimate control over Bella disturbing. He orders and forbids. He acts like he owns her. And she lets him. This is not healthy. Nor is her ultimate submission to his family and what they want. She isn't her own person, but one who tries to be the girl she thinks each man wants. Is this typical of an 18-year old girl? Possibly. She's probably most like her true self when she's with Jacob. Also, in her relationship with Edward, she is prepared to give up everything: friends, family and children. And for what? An eternity as a vampire with a man whose most compelling attraction is his beauty, dangerous potential and the forbidden.I do like Edward. I think that Meyer finally fleshed out his character quite a bit in this novel and I just wish she had done so earlier. I find it interested though that even though he's 100 (give or take a few) years old, she has him act more like he's a teenager. He may look like one, but theoretically he wouldn't act like one after all the life experiences he's had, even with the high school student charade they play. Meyer has crafted a compelling story and characters with great potential. I have to give her that credit. Even though I was harsh in my criticism of the first two books, I continued reading them. I hope that the next book improves the series as this one did and not the reverse. I hope that we find more realistic substance to Edward and Bella's relationship as well.",12,0.999,0.065,0.721,0.214,0.4940381122145829,NEGATIVE,0.9996
102,20888367,04/24/2008,3.0,"Disconcertingly engrossing. Why disconcertingly? Let's start with the engrossing and work back from there. I'll give it to Meyers for getting into the plot much more quickly than she has in the past. I mean the plot that actually has something to do with the climax. This time I felt like there was quality build-up to the big ending; whereas in the last two books it felt as though she got two-thirds of the way thru and said, ""Oh crap, I need something to actually happen in this story"". That is, something besides the love story. Whatever it is that Meyers' has that draws me in, I want to know where I can get some. I sped through the book in a short day and many times stopped to wonder why on earth I was still reading. I can skim over the list of reasons why I enjoy other authors, other stories and Meyers isn't adhering. So whatever it is, I'm still unable to precisely define it. Having reached that non-conclusion, I've come to the end of my praise. . .I may draw much ire from what I'm about to say next, but it must be said. I like Jacob. I like him alot more than I like Edward. And this whole, self-sacrificing what-makes-Bella-happy stuff, isn't going over with me. I haven't read the fourth book yet, but I'm not so deluded as to think that Bella would actually pick Jacob over Edward. So, the whole love triangle thing, isn't really much of a story. After all, what good is a love triangle if there's no real conflict? Jacob is a compelling character and would have been a great third to shake things up in Bella's world, to make her take more seriously the decision that she's ultimately faced with-the end of certain aspects of her life's possibilites. Alas, Jacob doesn't have the chance and the feigned overture towards some love connection between them falls apart as quickly as it was coerced bleeding and half-formed from Bella. But I suppose you'd have to know that was inevitable, if not by the set-up, then by the simple fact that the author named the character Jacob after her brother. And if that doesn't make sense to you, I suggest you try writing a love story and placing your sibling in as the object of sexual desire-see how that works out. Even if you simply afix your sibling's name to the aforementioned character. . .If you don't find that disturbing, then you probably won't be bothered by the fact that Bella feels more hesitant about marriage than she does about becoming a vampire. Sure, I don't mind altering the nature of my existence, losing my friends and family, possibly becoming a murdering blood-sucker, because I love you so much and can't possibly be without you. But marry you? UGH. Right. Meyers is not a great writer, she's at best, decent. Her dialogue can be painfully clunky and unnatural. There's hardly a scrap of original or inspired description or metaphor. Her characters can be so altruistic it makes one awkwardly aware of how UNreal they truly are. And yet, for all that, I liked the book. I was, for the most part, entertained. Distracted, more to the point. What's wrong with that? We all need to engrossed in trite, trival things from time to time. Kudos to Meyers for succeeding in that much, if little else. ",12,0.9967,0.083,0.741,0.176,0.5112002530480791,NEGATIVE,0.9999

107,30341177,08/16/2008,5.0,"Reviewed for THC ReviewsOnce again, Stephenie Meyer has created another entertaining and engrossing volume in the Twilight Saga. I had heard that this was the “love triangle” portion of the story arc, and even though this is usually not something I care for in romances, it somehow just all came together and worked for me in this one. During the early parts of the book, I found myself feeling a little disappointed that the actual romance between Edward and Bella seemed to be fairly low-key, instead of the intense experience it had been in Twilight or even the reunion portion of New Moon. I came to realize by the last fourth of the book that this was all part of the genius of Ms. Meyer's writing, and all played into the love triangle aspect of the story. I've adored Edward since the beginning of the series, but I have always liked Jacob too and gained a new appreciation for him in New Moon. After reading Eclipse, I discovered how much I truly cared for both characters, but Edward was still “the one” for me. Still, Edward and Jacob are two very different characters with very different personalities, so I can see how some fans may be bothered by the direction that the story took. I just very naturally followed Bella's line of thinking and what appeared to be the natural course of the story, so it never bugged me in that way. I will admit though, that especially toward the end this became a very emotion-laden plot which understandably caused a lot of pain and heartache for all three characters involved. While Eclipse still has plenty of tense scenes including a wonderful suspense subplot, it does take on a decidedly lighter and less angst-ridden tone than it's two predecessors. There were many moments where I found myself smiling or even laughing at some character's teasing or other antics. Overall, I think that Eclipse had more of an equal balance among all of it's elements, and was an excellent set-up for the finale.It was wonderful having Edward, Bella, and Jacob all together on the canvas throughout the entire book. Edward, as always, is still the perfect gentleman. He is kind, sensitive, forgiving and understanding, and while he constantly reminds Bella that he is not the perfect creature she thinks him to be, his self-control and selflessness are near-perfect things of rare beauty. Bella has been a character whose actions and choices I don't always agree with, but somehow I am still able to understand her. For instance, I am a hopeless romantic, so the prospect of marriage to someone like Edward would not be a difficult choice for me to make. Bella, however, fights not only the idea of a beautiful wedding, but also the marriage itself as though it were the most distasteful thing in the world. Again, I think this is part of the genius behind the storytelling, as the author allows me to live my own perspective vicariously through other characters. Bella also seems to always be thinking of everyone else before herself, so I was pleased to see her grow enough by the end to realize that it's OK to do something because it was right for her instead of just right for her loved ones. I did find myself wishing throughout much of the book though that Bella would ease up on the self-flagellation. She constantly seems to think that every bad thing that happens is somehow her fault and that she is a bad person because of it, when that clearly isn't the case. I think out of all three of these characters, Jacob changed the most, not just physically but emotionally as well. He is still the best friend who seems to know Bella better than she knows herself, but he is also now a young man in love, who is not above manipulating to get what he wants. Sometimes he flat-out acts like a jerk and is never really the noble hero that Edward is, but again, I somehow managed to understand him even though I didn't always agree with his actions. I found the dynamics of these three character's interactions to be utterly fascinating to read.As with the two previous books in the series, the secondary character palette was extensive and diverse. A great deal of character and plot development takes place surrounding certain supporting players. Readers get to learn about Rosalie's heartbreaking backstory, how she became a vampire, and why she doesn't want to be one and thinks Bella shouldn't be one either. We also get to learn of Jasper's background as he takes up a leadership role in the climactic battle to keep Bella alive. In addition, readers will discover the distinct differences between the Northern vampires and the Southern vampires of which Jasper used to be one. Alice shows her sweet but shamelessly manipulative side as she continues to be Bella's best female friend, and one of my favorite characters. Even after three books, I still find myself completely enthralled by her and Jasper's special psychic and empathic abilities respectively. Some surprising new werewolves are added to the pack, and the riveting legends of the werewolf origins are related at a Quileute council meeting. (I have been thoroughly enjoying the Native American element of these stories.) Eclipse also sees the return of Victoria, the dangerous female vampire from Twilight, as well as the menacing and powerful Volturi from New Moon. Basically, almost all of the characters from the first two stories can be found in Eclipse, vampire, werewolf, and human alike, with the addition of a few new players and the deepening of a few characters who were barely seen before.I felt that the mature content of Eclipse increased a fair bit over its predecessors. Even though there are still no actual sex scenes, there is a good deal more passion and sexual tension present, as well as the added complication of the love triangle. There are several discussions involving the topic of sex, but as with the first two books, they are all couched in subtle terms. There is also a brief mention of a new character being the illegitimate half-brother of an existing character whose father apparently had an extra-marital affair. Eclipse also sees a rise in the violence level. Due to the books being written in first-person perspective, Bella never personally saw any of the violent episodes in the past books, but in Eclipse, she bears witness first-hand to the destruction of vampires which is not a pretty sight. There are also some brutal events related through storytelling, including a gang rape and revenge for that act, but the character relating the events stops before any graphic details are revealed. In addition, there is continued racial tensions between the vampires and werewolves, including derogatory name-calling, but they are at least able to be reasonably civil. In my opinion, none of these things are worse than a PG-13 movie, so whether they would bother a reader would probably depend solely on the individual's sensitivity and imagination level. I also feel that there is a very good balance of positive messages for young people, such as self-sacrifice, self-control in all areas of life, abstinence from sex until marriage, respect for others, and simply trying to be the best person you possibly can be despite your circumstances. I have felt since beginning the series that there is a very strong morality tale embedded with all the other elements in these books. Keeping all this in mind, I would have to say that Eclipse along with it's companions are still fully appropriate for the teenagers for which they were originally intended, while still containing enough depth and nuance to stimulate some very thought-provoking discussion starters for both parents and educators.In conclusion, I have to say that Stephenie Meyer is a huge asset to the writing community, and neither her talents nor the Twilight series have, in my opinion, been over-hyped by those who have favorably reviewed these books before me. Any author who can take characters that are very different from myself and make me like them anyway, or can address subject matter that would typically be uncomfortable enough to make me not want to read any book I knew contained it but make me like it anyway, has a true gift for the written word. In addition, any author who can write what was intended to be a novel for teenagers and have this adult and many others begging for more definitely has talent, because in my experience, it takes a very special knack for any writer to create a work that can be enjoyed by young and old alike. Eclipse has officially earned a place on my keeper shelf right next to Twilight and 
New Moon

And he knew what he wanted with his life, I mean I know that he became a werewolf but he didn’t have any options about it, maybe if he didn’t transfer to a werewolf and he could stay a human he would be ok with Edward coming back and Bella loving him. So he was miserable, he was a werewolf and he knew about vampires and he knew that Bella loves Edward and He knew that Bella wants to be a vampire, that’s why he is miserable. He protective over Bella.He knew that being a werewolf was not an option but he tried to get Bella because Bella was the person he wanted, she was his goal. He had a purpose in his life.But Bella didn’t!!!! She was like: Hi 👋🏻 I’m Bella I have bad luck with me, I am in love with a vampire and a werewolf and I don’t know what to do with my fucked up life but I like to be a vampire:|(Let me stop here because I don’t like Bell!)And now here’s where our Edward comes to the scene.

His character is so weird in books, I couldn’t figure out any thing from him, like Bella when she couldn’t read anything from Edward’s face.He’s so in love with Bella that is unbelievable and I was going to guess that he really did not Loved Bella and He just wanted to make Bella a vampire!!! He never get angry over Bella’s stupidity or even got sad. And when he left Bella in the second book I was so so so disappointed with him and the author too. Why would he leave Bella? Why? Just because you were dangerous doesn’t mean that you have to leave because when people Love someone they got attached to them and when you leave they fall.

How do you do it?How do you take something as interesting as an army of baby vampires battling century old vampires and a pack of vicious werewolves and turn it into something so fucking boring? You are truly talented in that department. You have these really cool and original ideas and you just make them so unbearably boring and mundane. I just don’t get it! You have also succeeded in making the  World’s Most Useless Main Character. Every time I turn around Bella is fainting or whining or bitching or needing or existing. Just stop. Bella is the worst main character ever written. She is so reliant on the man in her life she wouldn’t know how to take a shit without him holding her hand. GIVE ME A BREAK! You, Stephenie Meyer, have set women back about a century with the creation of Bella’s character, so congratulations. I do hope you’re happy.When I first picked these books up I really thought that I would enjoy them. I thought there would be something  in them that I would be able to get into. Instead I am rolling my eyes and just getting pissed off reading listening to these books. (The narration is fine by the way). The story is just not there. It has the potential to be there but it is just so poorly executed you miss it. The writing is amateur at best, the “love story” is pathetic and so over the top dramatic that I could never relate or even remotely sympathize with any of them, the whole side story of Jacob and his wolves is just a mishmash of werewolf lore thrown together in hopes of passing as a good story. I am finishing the series to see, as a whole, how the story ends. I have to see if she becomes a vampire or if she just faints some more and whines while Edward controls her while flashing shiny new cars in front of her. I just have to know. I also hate when people talk negatively about a series that they haven’t even read. I have been really TRYING to get into these books, honestly, I have.

I understand Jake loving Bella but the force-ness comes from Bella's side. In New Moon, while she was mostly with Jake, she was obviously still suffering from Edward leaving her and her life was hella depressing so when did she fall in love with Jake? Plus, she kept thinking about how Edward is her life and she literally can't live without him. I don't see how someone can love one person so passionately, and have time to love another. Anyways, I feel like Edward deserved better and he was too kind about the whole situation. And let's not forget that Jacob Sexually assaulted Bella by kissing her and kept doing it while she tried to push him away.Reduced my rating from 5 to 3 because it wasn't as perfect as i remembered.

131,4264220689,10/06/2021,4.0,I am Switzerland. I refuse to be affected by territorial disputes between mythical creatures I think reading this series in my 20s has given me such a more grown up and different perspective to what i would have felt about the series when i actually picked it up as a teenager. I am going to say this right now this book is my favourite in the series so far however does it have issues? absolutely but i'm trying to not listen to other people and give my own and honest opinions.  Plot:  The plot for this book to me is a lot better than new moon and is much more of an improvement in me going forward with the series. Bella is getting more and more serious with wanting to become a vampire and Edward of course is hesitant in doing it at all now and i honestly wish he would just do it already so she can shut up about it. Danger of course is just around the corner with Victoria committing murders and changing people into vampires to start up her own little army so she can get at Bella and i feel like she's like an obsessed stalker the entire book but is rarely even seen. I am going to say this I really dislike Jacob at this point and it's because of his behaviour towards bella which is turning out to be a little weird in my opinion. He's like a very angsty 12 year old who's been told he can't have the new in thing and having to hear him complain in the whole book cause he can't have Bella is just annoying. Don't get me started on all the messed up things this character has done towards Bella and quite frankly it's utterly disturbing. Bella and Edward's relationship is just as weird in itself with both of them giving ultimatums to one another which doesn't make a healthy relationship. There were somethings that i did enjoy about the two together and things that need some massive improvement going forward however with this series being out for sometime now i don't think i will get my wish with that one. I promise to love you forever - every single day of forever. I loved getting to know more about the cullen family and getting more of an in depth look into the family that Bella will be soon apart of. I really enjoyed learning more about Jasper and his journey with his old group to finding his way to Alice and the cullens it was one of my favourite scenes of the book. This book gave the cullen family some more depth and some more character which was really lacking from the other two books so i'm glad Stephenie explored them more. My heart is absolutely going to break for Charlie in the next book because i know what's going to happen and there's nothing i can do from stopping it. Charlie is a clueless blessing and when Bella does finally get turned into a vampire i will be extremely sad for who she's going to leave behind. Ok look is the writing in this series the best? absolutely not as some of the chapters are dragged out and some of the explanations are way over done i feel like this series was a game changer for the YA genre. I have always said to myself that i would never read this series and never did until i got older and decided to put my differences behind and read it and i'm glad i did. A lot of what is in this series is problematic and done poorly but in saying that it's definitely a book series that defined a genre and impacted a generation of readers for so many years and that's impressive. My own take so far in the series is that New moon was the worst book for me so far and Eclipse is the best in the series. As i said in my review in the beginning if i had read this series when i was a teenager i would have absolutely loved it with my whole entire heart but with me being older it's given me more of a grown up opinion which i have found so much more helpful with how critical i am with books now.p.s I am  #TeamLateToTheParty ,11,0.9955,0.086,0.773,0.141,0.6198329448329448,POSITIVE,0.98

133,7600618,10/11/2007,4.0,"I just finished all three of the books in this series and I loved them. They connected with me on a very personal level, considering they are about vampires and werewolves. :) There were so many little details that I appreciated and could relate to about being a teenager, it kind of brought me back there. It was fun to look at that from an adult perspective. The intial infatuations and giddiness that come from first love and the intense feelings and confusions that it causes in a teenage mind are portrayed so well.  I loved the story line, I purchased the first book on Saturday night and finshed all three by Thursday. I couldn't put them down. I would have loved more details at the end about how things really ended up, but it satisfied my ""thirst"" enough. I really loved Jacob, he is my favorite character. I think I wanted to Bella to end up with him, but I knew it would never happen. I also loved the way Jacob expressed that Edward is a ""drug"" to Bella where he (Jacob) would be the air and the sun to her and thus be much healthier. I think that that is a perfect analogy for the way intense romances go some are like a drug and others bring out the light and joy. That's why part of me thinks that this might end tragic if there is another book.  The way the Edward and Jacob react to each, especially in the ""tent"" scene are awesome. Edward is mysterious and charming with a turn of the century appeal, you've gotta love him too. I think that Bella is a typical teenager, but she grows up more by this book and if there is another book I am excited to see how complex she might become. Also, after reading some of the other reviews, people seem to be baffled by Edward's interest in Bella, because she is so mundane, immature and whines. I think that of course he mentions her oh so wonderful smell, but I think it is more the fact that he can't read her mind. So she is the most mysterious person alive to him and that's the fascination. I also thought it was great to tell a captivating love story but the keep it clean enough that kids could read it. I think there are some behaviors in the book that we hope our teenagers won't mimic, but ultimately they make moral choices, so I'm satisfied with that. I wish there was a little more of that out there. I thought it was an excellent, fun series, hope to find more from this author.",9,0.9991,0.018,0.726,0.256,0.6114537037037038,POSITIVE,0.9999

It never did. Especially when a full grown teen imprints on a baby. I know Meyer tries to give reasons and excuses, but it still doesn’t sit right with me. Sorry not sorry.✘ When Jacob kissed Bella and knew she didn’t like it yet kept insisting. No. Not ok. Never ever.✘ Charlie’s reaction to said kiss went something like:C: Why’d she punch you? J: Because I kissed her.C: Good for you.Um, excuse me???? Sir, that is your daughter. I found Charlie to be an amazing parent that didn’t deserve a daughter like Bella until this moment (and excluding this moment, he is actually a good dad).

Now, my rambly thoughts:I don't know why this didn’t hit the same way the first time I read this, but rereading this series, I loathe Jacob in this book. Both of his kiss scenes with Bella made me so uncomfortable. First, he forced a kiss on her when she was pushing him away. Then the second kiss, he had to threaten to kill himself for her to kiss him. I also hate the love triangle, and Bella for being so selfish with Jacob and trying so hard to keep him in her life when she knew she was gonna choose Edward the entire time. Meanwhile, she was hurting them both.When Edward is hurt, I'm hurt :(This book has that feel where you're angry with every character and you hate the decisions that they're making, but lets be real, if you've read this far into the series, you're already attached to everyone and there's no going back now.

143,126459841,10/15/2010,1.0,"I hated this book with a passion.In each of the previous books, Bella makes some connection between herself, Edward, and a literary work. The first was Pride & Prejudice and the second was Romeo & Juliet. (I'll admit that I checked Wikipedia to confirm which classic went with which novel.) In this one, Bella reads Wuthering Heights and sees it as a romance.Let's get the story straight here: Wuthering Heights is not a romance, but it is the perfect story for Bella and Edward--just not for the reasons Bella can understand.Wuthering Heights is a story of obsession. For those of you that haven't read it, and are relying on Bella's understanding of the book, here's a quick synopsis: Cathy is raised with Heathcliff as her best friend/foster brother. Together, they are untamed children. Their relationship is disturbed when Cathy meets the Lintons and sees what gentility should act like. When Cathy is an adult, she chooses to marry Edgar Linton rather than Heathcliff, choosing a marriage that will settle her comfortably within her class. Heathcliff disappears and returns a few years later to wreak revenge on Cathy. He seduces Edgar Linton's younger sister and elopes with her. To prevent anyone from discovering their elopement, 
he kills her dog
* when the animal's barking threatens to expose them when they run away together in the middle of the night. He does this not because he loves Isabella, but rather to torment Edgar and Cathy. There's more to the story, but I'll stop here--if you want to know more, you should read the original novel.As should be clear from my summary, above, Wuthering Heights is not a love story. It's a story about obsession and how it twists people and destroys lives.Unfortunately, Bella is too young, inexperienced, and ignorant to see the proper parallels between her story and Cathy's. She has no idea what love is, and understand only obsession.*Edit: Quick correction--Heathcliff only tried to kill Isabella's dog. He left it hanging from the neck by a handkerchief, and someone else discovered the dog before it actually died. While the dog does not die, that's through no help of Heathcliff's. He had every intention of killing the animal.",8,-0.9923,0.183,0.727,0.09,0.3870967741935483,NEGATIVE,0.9994

I thought that this book was an amazing third book in the sage, we get to know the main characters even more and we get introduced to more characters that add a great deal to the storyline, without them and the 'minor' characters this book wouldn't work at all!  We follow the wonderful (but slightly irritating) Bella Swan as she has to choose between life and death...which will she choose? While reading this book I found myself gripping hold of the pages while telling Bella how stupid she was..which shows just how much I got into this book. Stephenie Meyers fills the reader with many different emotions it truly is an emotional rollercoaster that she takes you on. So yeah I pretty much love this book I read it before watching the film and I totally feel in love with the characters and the writing style. Must say I am and pretty much always will be TeamJacob!

145,2630516049,01/17/2019,3.0,"Eclipse has always been my favorite movie of the saga: there is a bit of Edward and a bit of Jake - even if there is too much of Bella.Who will choose Bella? The centenarian vampire - beautiful, cold and made of marble - or the boy who turns into a giant wolf, tanned and warm as the sun? I think everyone chooses according to their point of view, without even having to think about Robert Pattinson or Taylor Lautner: Edward would be perfect in the summer, he's very sweet with his old ways of thinking and acting; Jake would be ideal in winter, he's very cute and, of course, would guarantee the perfect life. With the cold you can cover yourself, but from the suffocating heat you can’t run away. I could even say that one shines and the other doesn't - this is a low blow, sorry.Another point in favor of the writer is the developing characters of Jasper and Rose, which I personally love. In this way, you can understands completely how much they have suffered and how they have changed since they were transformed (like when Edward told his story in the first book).In any case, whoever you choose, I think it's for this reason - the rivalry between the two male protagonists and everything - that with this book the writer redeems the slowness of the previous book. But this third chapter of the saga is however far from perfect: the author still enjoys environments and Bella is almost more irritating than other times with her stupid guilty feelings and her constant thoughts about how she wants to act.↠ 3.5 stars",8,0.9607,0.055,0.812,0.133,0.6140686274509803,POSITIVE,0.9918

160,150365425,02/24/2011,3.0,"Review time...If someone had asked me a year ago; 'Will you be reading any of the Twilight books?' My response would likely have been; 'Hell, no!' The first two Twilight movies were trailered on most of the net, giving away the gist of the story and holding little appeal. You couldn't troll Amazon without stopping to find 11-14yr old girls taking one side or the other in mass reviews. Anyone saying the films were crap and the books were badly written were then hacked to death by said 11-14yr old girls *laughing*. So why did I decide to read Eclipse? I left Twilight and New Moon in the bookstore (see above). I bought Eclipse and Breaking Dawn because you couldn't deny the success of the books, and I wanted to know how well Stephenie Meyer wrote. Was Meyer as poor a writer as many had claimed? Or, as many reviews had said, were her books better than the Twilight movies? I was actually surprised to find that Meyer's writing was quite good. Her writing was descriptive and the prose and narrative flowed quite well. I'm not Twilight's target audience, so it's unlikely that this would be a 5 star read for me. But, for Twilight's target audience (YA female), I can understand why many rated this book 4 or 5 stars. The characters are quite well defined (being book #3 in the saga, they should be). The book stays with it's three main characters, all described from Bella's perspective (I'll come to that *smiles*), and the supporting characters are actually achieved quite well. That said, Bella's character and narrative showed little sign of maturity. It's fortunate, for Edward, that he can't read Bella's mind. Firstly, he'd be flattered, but then he'd likely be both bewildered and slightly bored to death (immortality aside). For the first 300pg's it was hard not to see Bella's thoughts and behaviour as that of a petulant child. For Bella, it seemed to be about what she thought and what she wanted, with everything else of no importance. Including other people's feelings and any intelligent or rational thought. Just act like a child who's smart enough to jump off a cliff (yes, I know it was with a reckless broken heart and very Romeo and Juliet). Yep, I actually bought New Moon on DVD about 100pg's in to this book. It did help a bit with some of the back story. From Bella's narrative I wasn't really seeing a young woman in love, so much as a young woman obsessed. And I honestly thought Bella was more obsessed with immortality (and an immortal life with Edward), than she was with Edward himself. It was as though; here's a guy who's cute, thoughtful, has lovely eyes (yes, I know *laughing*), is so strong and powerful, yet gentle... But, I can go with him and never grow old. That to me is not love. It's obsession. And if you take the 'immortal' aspect out of the equation, then I wonder how strong those feelings would be. Bella appears to be dying to be immortal, no matter what the consequences. Regardless of her father losing a daughter. Regardless of quite possibly losing her human soul. Regardless of the man she apparently loves not wanting her to become the supernatural living dead that he is. Also, regardless that she knows she will be an 'out of her mind blood thirsting killer for the first few years, at least'. Mmmmmm... It must be love, love, love... Okay, let's move on to Edward. Nice bloke, actually wise beyond his years (benefits of being immortal and over a century old), thoughtful, powerful, and apparently cute ;) I like the guy *laughing*. More importantly, he's a character who can put those he loves beyond his own needs or desires. I don't see Bella doing that, and maybe that is why many didn't particularly like this book, or the Twilight saga. Poor Jacob? Mmmmm... Okay, he's what? Sixteen? I'm sure at sixteen there were times when I acted like a cocky, immature, annoying dick ;) At sixteen, you kind of have that right. And if Jacob is one thing, he's actually loyal (and annoying). No dog jokes ;) You partly get the feeling that Jacob's often being used by Bella. Which he is, but he doesn't appear to mind as he believes he'll win her from Edward in the end (which he might. Have mercy on his soul). And it's hard not to see that Bella and Jacob are actually better suited. She get's to remain human and their maturity level is very similar. They can go for walks on the beach and play 'Fetch!' *Laughing* (Sorry, Jacob). The book is quite interesting in it's character aspect. I particularly enjoyed the relationship development between Edward and Jacob. And the last 200 pages were more atmospheric than the rest. For me, it wasn't a book I felt 'wow, can't wait to read more'. But, once you pick the book up the writing is done well enough to turn pages. The characters are strong enough to be of some interest, and there is a story there. Though I'm not in any eagerness to start 'Breaking Dawn', it may be of some interest to see 'what happens next'.

But, oddly enough, in the 6 days that I was forced to wait for Eclipse, I couldn't stop thinking about the story. Try as I might, it lodged itself in my head and just stood there, daring me to try to read something else, even something as exciting as I usually find Grisham. (Sorry, Grisham.)Those 6 days also convinced me that as many issues as I had with the first two books, I invested more than I thought in it, and rated it a bit low. Anything that sticks in my mind like this, even if it is ""trash"" as some see it, deserves at least 4 stars. So, I'll be upping the ratings on the first two books. And now, let's move on, shall we? Again, I'm not going to go into plot here. I will say that the emotional experience that Bella went through in New Moon was hard to witness, but her confusion in Eclipse was worse in a way. My poor guts were in knots waiting to see what would happen, and I don't mean whether Bella or Edward or Jacob or the others are going to live or die. I mean I wanted to know who was going to be happy together when the end came, if come it did.I have discovered that I am (again, to my own surprise) FIRMLY Team Edward. Go figure. All I've done was rag on him about how controlling he is, and yet here I am, wanting Bella to make the ""right"" choice between him and Jacob and stay with Edward. But, in my defense, (and Edward's too) Edward has radically changed his relationship outlook. He's now all for Bella having exactly who and what she wants if it makes her happy, even if it is not him. That's cool with me, even if it is cliche.But, even if I was not convinced that Edward loves Bella with every fiber of his being, I doubt I could be Team Jacob after reading Eclipse. I was so disappointed in him. For being as young as he is, he is one manipulative S.O.B., and I was shocked at his behavior. I don't know if it was caused by his newfound werewolf attitude, but the Jacob that I rather liked in New Moon was nowhere to be found here. I did pity him in a way, but pity is not enough to cut it with me, even if it is with Bella. Anyway... I really did enjoy this book, and the series so far.

After investing however many pages to both stories and developing those characters, they don't speak or have any significance to the plot for the next 400 pages. It was wasteful. And I was a little concerned that Meyer's religious beliefs are intruding in her story...what was that, ""I want to marry you before we have sex so I can save your soul...your Bible says we should get married..."" She's going to be a VAMPIRE! I think saving her soul is out. And having Jacob quote some Bible story? He's a practicing Native American-- he wouldn't know Bible stories like that. Totally unbelievable.Also, the main storyline, the killings in Seattle, seem too ambiguous to really link our Forks vampires to the scene. I didn't feel like this was as personal or enthralling for Bella to make it interesting for me.

164,463984758,11/26/2012,2.0,"When I finished ECLIPSE, I felt empty inside, like I was a seashell sitting on the beach, trying to become one with the waves. Sure, I had been entertained by the story itself and by the surrounding beachcombers, pedestrians, and dogs playing on the shoreline, or in this case, the vampires and werewolves and otherwise normal individuals who constitute the pages of Stephenie Meyer’s tale. But I felt less than fulfilled as I flipped the pages at a furious, breakneck pace.It’s hard for me to explain the dichotomy because I don’t really understand it myself. The pace of the novel never really slows, but at the same time there’s not a whole lot that has happened in ECLIPSE or the two previous installments. Again, I really have no doubt that there is talent at work here: talent at world invention, character creation, and a unique approach to a rather traditional storyline. This novel, like the others, is filled with a certain amount of promise. But at the same time, this promise seems to go unfulfilled.But do I want to keep reading? Absolutely. However, I do think the empty feeling will continue all the way to the end. And it’s hard not to feel a bit disappointed by this result. So the dance continues Stephenie Meyer, as I both admire and loathe you in equal parts, and if I ever figure out the answer to my dichotomy dilemma, I will have solved one of the great mysteries of the universe.Cross-posted at Robert's Reads",7,0.9712,0.092,0.727,0.181,0.4989538239538239,NEGATIVE,0.9537

Bella still lacks any semblance of a personality and acts shocked by Jacob's confusion over her feelings for him whilst literally walking hand in hand with the guy down the beach.5. Edward telling Bella that she has holes only Jacob can fill is without a doubt one of the funniest lines I have ever read in my life. Edward would happily be cuckolded and that is a fact.6. Imprinting is the most disgusting thing Meyer has ever come up with - talking about a man imprinting on a 2 year old by saying he will be there to be the best big brother and then when she is older they will be the happiest couple ever. Meyer, honey, that is called GROOMING! And this is NOT OKAY! Also, big brothers don't grow up to be your lover. Or do they for you?

179,56887789,05/21/2009,1.0,"it is amazing to me, the way these books actually get worse & worse as the series drags on. i gave ""twilight"" but one star, but it far outstrips this steaming pile of literary manure. if only goodreads allowed ratings in the negative digits. anyway, on with the show.so, edward & bella are back together. bella is consumed with angst because her romance with edward is hurting her friend jacob, the werewolf from quileute reservation. has anyone really examined how problematic it is that it's the local indian tribe that would phase into savage wolf beasts with merely a shred of human consciousness? could meyers maybe pretend to not be either a tremendous racist with all of her ""indians are savages"" unsophisticated metaphors, or her equally racist ""indians are NOBLE savages, with a rich tradition of legends that protect their tribes"" unsophisticated metaphors. i could also live happily without reading about 650 pages of bella constantly remarking upon jacob's ""red-brown skin"". it's pretty goddamn sickening. anyway.bella really wants to go to the rez to see jacob & make sure he's okay with her dating edward again. edward doesn't want her to go because he doesn't trust the werewolves. he worried that jacob will get mad, transform, & hurt bella. bit over-protective, is he not? he even disables her car at one point to prevent her from sneaking away to see jacob. NOT COOL, EDWARD. many twilight-haters who see edward & bella's relationship as dysfunctional & abusive have pointed to this incident as proof, & many twilight-lovers who think that edward & bella's relationship is romantic have defended this move, saying shit like, ""he just wanted to protect her...sometimes love means stopping someone from doing something that could hurt them,"" blah blah. here's what love is, in my mind: regarding your partner as grown-up who can make decisions for herself, even if they are not the decisions you would make for yourself. not PERMITTING your partner to have a private life, but ACCEPTING the fact that your partner has a private life (as should you), & that it's really none of your business. about the time my boyfriend disables my...shoes, i guess, since i don't drive, to stop me from seeing someone he doesn't want me to see, that's about the time i try being single again. fuck that noise. edward treats bella like a child, & i'm not saying she's a bastion of grown-up maturity, but maybe this is why YOU DON'T SETTLE DOWN WITH THE LOVE OF YOUR LIFE AT AGE 17. these motherfuckers are CHILDREN & meyers's story is teaching other CHILDREN that this kind of abusive behavior is forgiveable & even ROMANTIC. pardon me while i VOMIT.moving on. eventually edward gets the message that bella wants to have jacob in her life, & he stops being such a total fucking crazypants. he's still pretty ridiculous, picking her up on the rez border & not letting her drive there by herself, etc, but i am glad he finally grew up & accepted the fact that bella has friends.however, it really sucks that bella is such a histrionic little whiner. it's so fucking important to her that jacob not be hurt by the fact that she is seeing edward. she seems to be under the impression that if she just badgers him enough, he'll give her his blessing, even though he admits that he is in love with her. another pearl of wisdom from me when it comes to relationships: when two people start dating, there is usually some third party somewhere that has their feelings hurt. maybe it's an ex, maybe it's someone with a crush, whatever. them's the breaks. the people who are beginning a relationship don't owe anyone any explanations, so long as their was not homewrecking or anything going on. the injured third party needs to man up & get on with their life, & one thing that helps with this task is not having a thwarted object of affection constantly begging for forgiveness in one breath & telling the hurt person how much she loves her vampy boyfriend in the next. bella thinks she is being selfish by trying to keep jacob in her life...uh, yeah, just a tad.anyway. someone has created an army of newborn vampires in seattle. they are killing people left & right, & the cullens & bella finally figure out that they are coming to forks to kill bella. they ally with the werewolves for an epic battle. we learn more about jasper & roaslie's back stories here, & as much as i hated rosalie's back story (what is up with stephenie meyer's unhealthy preoccupation with gang rape & murder?), & as LUDICROUS & PATENTLY EMBARRASSING as all of jasper's ridiculous southern newborn army wars shit was (meyers doesn't even try to construct a coherent narrative half the time...maybe more), it beat the pants off another fifty pages of bella's whining, so all right. of course, i can't have it all. naturally, the battle starts & the person who created the newborns is victoria, the evil vampire who has been stalking bella for the last three books. she catches edward's scent & follows it to where he is on the verge of boning bella. they start fighting & stupid motherfucking bella can't accept for one second that maybe, JUST MAYBE, these mythical monstrouc creatures KNOW WHAT THE EFF THEY'RE DOING & don't need her useless attempts at ""helping"". she cuts herself with a pointy rock (i ask you--a pointy rock?!?) & distracts victoria & her helper, riley. this gives edward & the guard werewolf, seth, the advatage. seth finishes off riley & edward decapitates victoria. they join the others elsewhere in the forest, where all the cullens are a-okay & all of the newborns are dead, except one, who surrendered. jacob has been hurt, but werewolves have magically fast healing abilities (of course they do, & of course jacob is the only one who got hurt--this is seriously the caliber of suspense i was turning out when i was twelve years old, i'm not even kidding), so he'll be all right. bella, of course, doesn't believe it & has to go to the rez RIGHT NOW to see for herself. also, she decides she wants to bone edward before she becomes a vamp, & he says okay, as long as she marries him first. & then they have a long talk about souls & how edward is putting bella's soul in jeopardy by making her into a vamp, & she's jeopardizing his by wanting to have pre-marital sex. really, stephenie meyers? your romantic hero just ripped someone's head off, but you're going to give us a lecture on pre-marital sex that would make brigham young proud? REALLY? all right, carry on.WORST BOOKS EVER. & breaking dawn promises to take everything that was awful about the first three & compound it by a gazillion jermillion by throwing in a canonically (if we can really talk about canon when referencing books that a prosletyzing hack pretty much pulled directly out of her ass) ridonkulous orgy of vampire babies & werewolf pedophilia.",6,-0.9976,0.178,0.693,0.129,0.5124231374231377,NEGATIVE,1.0

It’s so frustrating because some sections are genuinely good. Jasper’s vampire wars of the Confederate South are batshit and have some troubling implications about his past, but are truly interesting and well thought out. Shortly after, it’s campfire story time with the wolf boys and the mythology (which is actually history) of the Quileute tribe is similarly, like, proper literature? Before and after, though, the quality of the writing has taken a dive off a cliff since New Moon. Almost unreadably poor which is why it’s taken me a month to get through. The already unhealthy love triangle becomes even more toxic and manipulative, with everyone motivated by guilt and constantly issuing each other with extreme ultimatums. There’s a lot of really intense and non-consensual kissing but the whole thing manages to stay completely chaste and sexless. I can’t imagine this side of the story had any impact on the teen gals of 2008 but it’s a pretty dodgy influence in hindsight.

Synopsis
As Seattle is ravaged by a string of mysterious killings and a malicious vampire continues her quest for revenge, Bella once again finds herself surrounded by danger. In the midst of it all, she is forced to choose between her love for Edward and her friendship with Jacob -- knowing that her decision has the potential to ignite the ageless struggle between vampire and werewolf. With her graduation quickly approaching, Bella has one more decision to make: life or death. But which is which?
Review
Okay, here I go. I will try my best not to spoil anything for those of you who haven’t been able to read it yet. Eclipse was a book like non other I’ve read before. I mean, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was practically edge-of-your-seat tension all the way through. But Eclipse was an altogether different kind of experience.I love the Twilight World. I love the characters—even the least likely to be loved, such as the Volturi. Stephenie Meyer is a brilliant author, and this is why: she makes you fall in love and care about her characters. And in Eclipse, when the characters are ill at ease with each other, it makes you squirm. The taste and texture of the book—Eclipse—was a bit the same as the other three. Deep, sensuous, flowing, and always blood red—like wine. But the plot was less spread out than the other three. It was jam packed with action, new discoveries, and danger. There wasn’t a moment’s rest for Bella—no reprieve for the reader, either. That’s why this book gave me a migraine—serious! Every time I picked it up I had to take some Advil! But that didn’t make me unlove Eclipse. In fact, I liked it even more than I thought I would. It was at times heartbreaking, at others memorable and light. At others violent and raging. But most of all it was surprising.It was surprising because I found out that I really did like Edward. After the second book—I never thought I’d love any character more than Jacob.And while I still don’t love Edward that much—I like him better than I did in the previous two. He really is a good guy.I agree with Anidori-Isilee that he became a much more realistic character in Eclipse than in the other ones.Jacob, on the other hand, became irritable in this book. Though underneath it all—he’s got the best spirit and personality I think of all the other characters. That’s why the ending broke my heart.But anyway: what was also surprising is that we learn more of Rosalie and Jasper’s histories. These are the two Cullens that Stephenie seems to have just shoved to the side for Edward and the rest. And I’m really glad we got to see a bit more of them. As for the very controversial scene where Bella tries to, er.....seduce Edward, I think it was really unnecessary. I think that Stephenie might have only written it in because of the demands of fans who....let’s say, feel the need for Bella and Edward’s relationship to take that turn. Which is utterly stupid if you ask me. Bella and Edward may be mature in some things, but they are innocent when it comes to....yeah. And as a Christian myself, I don’t really want to read about it. And besides—it really comes to nothing at the end. So we could have spared that scene. Well...except for the end and everything. The proposal was good...It’s just, yeah.....We didn’t need that. I was also disappointed that Bella never really mulled over the choice she had to make in the end. I mean, it’s the most important choice of her life! And it’s only after we find out that Bella and Jacob are meant to be together. As Jacob says, it would have been natural. Had not Edward gone to Biology class on that fateful day....Anyway, I’m waiting to see what Breaking Dawn bring. And in the mean time—I really encourage people to read Eclipse twice. You really get so much more out of it your second ",6,0.9799,0.053,0.847,0.1,0.5273858717040537,NEGATIVE,0.9354

I just hated it.HERE'S A RANT WITH SPOILERS FOR THE WHOLE SERIES:I tried to go into this with an open mind, guys. I really wanted to.Obviously this book has a reputation- you either love it or you hate it. I tried to like it, I really did. But I very much did not.And the first book wasn't so bad. A little cliche, and little instalove, but I can totally deal with that; Clace is my otp. I was slightly annoyed with Bella's character, but I've read worse.Then I read the second book.New Moon made me strongly dislike Bella. She needs to get over it. She's only known this guy for a few months, and yet she's willing to wreck her entire life for him? When Jacob showed up I was like, 'thank god'. Though I preferred Edward, at least Bella wasn't such a pity party. The ending was annoying, in my book. Both Edward and Bella were being overdramatic, but I still sighed with relief when the ending had them back together.The third book, Eclipse, was the one that killed me.You see, I read these for the romance. The plot's fine, but that's not really what I enjoy. And in this book, I ended up despising both Edward and Jacob.Let's start with Jacob. That makes me less mad, as Bella has an appropriate reaction and *spoilers* doesn't end up with him. He totally kissed her without her consent- her inner monologue was trying to get away, and he thought she enjoyed it. Not cool, man, not cool. I do not approve of that at all, and it makes me mad that it was brushed off after that- if I were literally anyone in that series, I would have slaughtered Jacob. It really didn't change anyone's perception of him drastically, and that is awful for me.Now onto Edward. He's had his share of possessive, overprotective moments in the last two books, but that's because he's a vampire and he's so desperately in love that he'd do anything to keep her safe. That's ok, right?I would have said so, but as I read I noticed a few interesting points that led me to the conclusion that Bella and Edward's relationship is toxic, creepy, and downright abusive.First off, the smaller points. Edward is creepy and overprotective to the point of stalker-ness. Breaking into her house to watch her sleep? That's not good. He also really doesn't understand Bella that well, a point that is shown many times, but most cleanly demonstrated by him leaving. Did he not know Bella well enough to understand that it wouldn't end well? Apparently not. Finally, he's very controlling about Bella's activities and lifestyle- he always seems to want her to do this, or not do that, and she complies almost every time, even when she doesn't want to. That's not compromise and healthy communication, that's downright abusive behavior.However, due to the writing style (romanticizing this) and the fact that the fandom obviously ships them so much, I didn't see that these things were so problematic until the beginning of the third book.Edward, while he is away, forces Bella to stay in his house, even when she wants her freedom, and makes Alice have her stay with her.Where have I heard this before?Only with one of the least-popular ya love interests of all time, Tamlin the tool. I'm glad I've read ACOMAF before, otherwise I might have continued to delude myself that Edward was keeping Bella safe.Now, I haven't read the fourth book, but I doubt it gets any better. Edward is a Tamlin, except that Bella certainly doesn't have a Rhysand to rescue her.These are my problems with the relationships in Twilight, and if you choose to read it, I urge you to think about these points- and also check out the ACOTAR series if you haven't already.",6,0.8958,0.117,0.751,0.132,0.4797346938775511,NEGATIVE,1.0

If it were exciting enough I may have been anxious for a fourth installment, but as it is I am bored with the series and the cliff hanger backfired. The previous books both spanned almost a year, while this happened in about six weeks, that's about 100 pages a week, most of which was making out far too intense for its young adult audience. But considering the Twilight Mom's club, page after page of making out is just what her many fans want. Nothing happened, and what little did happen was not intense or exciting. The vampire chase was but a shadow of the first, not a page turner in the slightest. Maybe it's because I do not see the appeal of Jacob, but I found the relationship contrived and cheesy. There was nothing natural or believable about the way he manipulated the kiss and I was appalled Bella fell for it. I find her personality ever more elusive and flighty. Edward's sudden change of conviction was confusing and out of character as well. It disappointed me. It frustrated me. The only truly enjoyable part of the book for me was the fire and ice chapter where Bella listened to Jacob and Edward discuss her. I was also glad to finally relate to Edward's argument for keeping Bella human and feel hesitation along with her instead of wishing it would happen already. Finally I get a sense of realism to the huge decision she is facing. Not that I don't want her to become a vampire, but I want her consider what she is giving up. There were a few good things but overall the book frustrated me.After reading Breaking Dawn I'm upping my stars here. It still wasn't my favorite and there was much in the book to bother and irritate me, but I can't say I hated it or that it left me so annoyed with the story I don't care what happens to the characters anymore. At least speckled through a lackluster story is some good. Now I can see the point of this book was to drag out the love triangle and make Bella definitively decide her future.

New Moon
 comes to a head in the third installment of Meyer's supernatural saga, when the stage is also set for what initially appears to be a full-out vampire war complete with old grudges and unexpected alliances. Tragically, only half of this unwieldy epic-length book is devoted to this epic-worthy action. The rest of it is plagued with too many extended dreary monologues from minor characters and inexplicably drawn out transitional scenes and exchanges. Those anticipating the aforementioned war should prepare themselves that all is not what it seems with that, and oddly--the bulk of the battle happens ""offstage."" Perhaps the biggest shame of all is a couple of really outstanding scenes at the end that relate to the big love triangle of the second and third books. It's a shame because they're good enough that they might have made up for the awkward pacing and some of the novel's other weaknesses if the book had only been more condensed. Unfortunately though, the road to get to those scenes is just far too long, and uphill the whole way (in snow). If another sequel follows (and the ending manages to still leave a little room for one)the reader can only desperately hope that Meyer has a surprise in store and comes to the table with renewed energy, because one fears that the books have been progressively gaining momentum in the wrong direction: in the waning chemistry between the two main characters and charisma of almost all the main characters save Jacob, and in the deterioration of quality in the suspense and action. One cannot help but give a backwards glance to the characters introduced in the shining first novel (Twilight) and ask them, ""so what brings a nice bunch of kids like you to a place like this?""",6,0.8138,0.085,0.819,0.096,0.5088915470494416,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Twilight:

1.5★

New Moon:

-★--1.5/5 stars--Well. I didn't dislike it as much as New Moon, but the love triangle drama was probably the worst aspect to this part of the series:Edward: get off your high horse and let Bella see her friends--it doesn't matter what the hell you think about them, and it only makes you look abusive. Which you kind of are, so I guess that doesn't redeem you anyway. Sucks.Jacob: that wasn't cool, dude. I hope you learned your lesson, albeit the hard way, so please don't ever do that again. Thanks.Bella: STOP. FUCKING. LEADING. PEOPLE. ON. Do I really have to explain this to you? Really? I mean, I get that you were hardly around normal high-schoolers, but still, isn't it common sense? I guess you didn't really have any to begin with, so why do I even bother.Honestly speaking though, this was a slight improvement from the first two books (even though the plot is next to zero) and I'm hoping we've ditched the messy love triangle in a grave somewhere. As I have a vague idea of what goes down in Breaking Dawn (I had it spoiled long ago, thank god, or else you lovely readers would have had to scroll through another scathing review like New Moon), I believe the worst of the drama is behind us.And yes, to anyone who has been following my reading progress updates: I am solidly Team Jacob.
No regrets.

I have decided that she must have the lowest self-esteem of any person alive. I just don't get why she doesn't like herself, doesn't think herself worthy of others' love. I think that everyone should love themselves, and with two parents that adore her, you think that would have instilled some degree of self esteem within her. But, no! Yes, we all see our flaws magnified, but still we should love ourselves as God made us. Unique creations, good part and areas in need of improvement, alike. And to make her more annoying, her self-esteem issues make others' lives more difficult. As much as I love Edward, Bella's attitude that he's so far above her, that he couldn't love her is frustrating. She doesn't think she should take anything from him more than his love. Like he shouldn't fight for her, or be willing to die for her. When she'd do it for him. That he can't give to her selflessly, when she gives all for him. In contrast, she seemed to take Jake's love for granted. The saving grace of Meyer's portrayal of Bella is that she's actually fairly self-aware. She can see her flaws clearly, her tendency to be selfish, despite her lack of self-love. She knows she's neurotic and grasping, and seems ungrateful at times. She wants to do better, and she tries. And in other ways, she's very giving, the way she cares for others. In the end, I still like her, but she's hard to swallow sometimes.",5,0.9959,0.133,0.6,0.267,0.6078125000000001,NEGATIVE,0.7615

210,1066726855,09/28/2014,2.0," ever since seeing that meme I can not shake from my head the theatre kid-ness of Twilight. Combined with the awkwardness of Meyer's descriptive writing there is some true cringe weirdness in this book. Take, for example, the scene at Bella's graduation party (hosted by the Cullens) when Jacob and his friends show up. Bella's being all *mysterious* but eventually, the wolf pack figure out something's going on and corners Alice and Bella to confront them about it. We get gems like this: ""The Quileute boys watched silently, reading every unconscious play of emotion on our faces. They were rooted in place, and yet not completely still. All three pairs of hands were trembling.""  and then when the wolfs and vamps decide to team up a few seconds later we get this (don't forget vamps hate the way wolfies smell and vice versa) ""Alice was on her toes, Jacob leaning down towards her both of their faces lit up with excitement, both of their noses wrinkled against the smell. They looked at me impatiently."" how am I supposed to picture that??? tf? Imagine being another kid at this party and seeing this happen in the corner of the room. Theatre kid weirdness vibes. There is no world where that looks as cool as the book seems to think it does. Sadly this book in general is Twilight at it's worst. The pacing is God awful. It could easily have been a third of the size but we instead we get a lot of redundant scenes and a lot of redundant thoughts. Eclipse decides it wants to focus on the characters and character dynamics to a detrimental degree, so plot advancement happens at an almost comically drawn out pace.Also as a random side note, Bella seems to have so much more fun when she's hanging out with Jacob? They literally jump up and down when they see each other and he makes her laugh, and he has a super high body temperature. Idk how Eddy isn't fighting for his life. Meanwhile, Eddy is full-on controlling at some points in this book, and I honestly was a fan of Edward the last two books so this is definitely some newer behaviour. As I said, I think Eclipse is just these characters at their most regressive. Bella is mad horny in this book and I swear there are like three chapters where she's just trying to peer pressure Edward to have sex. The ""heart"" wants what it wants I guess. And there's nothing wrong with character study/ no plot type of book except that this book doesn't have the creativity or introspection to carry it out interestingly. In fact, I was pretty mad at the inclusion of Rosalie's sexual assault story, Jasper's war stories, and the instance when Jacob kisses Bella against her explicit nonconsent. They all felt inappropriate in such a silly novel, like a cheap attempt to add moral ambiguity or depth to the ""story"". (being too harsh here) If you want to know what the experience of reading this book is like, here is an example of Bella's inner monologue (as she angsted over Jacob):""I loved him, more than I should, and yet still no where near enough. I was in love with him, but it was not enough to change anything; it was only enough to hurt us both more. To hurt him worse than I ever had. I didn't care about more than that-than his pain. I more than deserved whatever pain this caused me. I hoped it was bad. I hoped I would really suffer. In this moment, it felt as though we were the same person. His pain had always been and would always be my pain-now his joy was my joy. I felt joy, too, and yet his happiness was somehow also pain."" That last line in particular felt pretty immature., and at that point anyways, everything is blending together into emotional sludge. But you know what, she is going 17, so I'm probably sounding like Scrooge. I don't think I was wiser than Bella at 17 by any means. It's just, well 17-year-olds are annoying (looking at you across the living room Trev.) This, among other reasons, is why every time Edward says some dramatic profession about his love for her you kind of feel like Pictured below is the braclet that caused probably around 50 pages of redundant angst Oh God and there was that part at the end where Jacob wants to go to join the Big Fight and Bella can't stand the thought of him getting hurt (and getting hurt on her behalf, although that's what everyone else is doing). And so he's like 'you know how to convince me', and she realizes he's implying she has to consent and beg him to kiss her. And she does.  I actually would love to an even deeper review of the melodrama and redundancy of this book except I already feel like this: I did enjoy some parts of the book, the rainy west coast atmosphere is always fun. Also what I take to be a pretty big strength of the book is that often the supernatural characters are more hanicapped by their supernatural abilities than benefited from them, and there are a lot of random aspect to their supernatural lives that come in to play in surpsing and fun ways. For example, wolfies and vamps hate the way each other smells and find the opposing scent really strong and overpowering. And so they come up with the idea of keeping Jacob near Bella to hide her scent from the evil vampies. That's pretty fun tbh, and there were a few things like that in the book. But my rose-tinted glasses were just really struggling to hold up this reread. It will probably be the last reread for a very long time cause I don't want to corrode the nostalgia.

CONS (these first because I feel passionately):- Bella constantly fretting over everyone else's well-being all the time is annoying as hell. I think Stephenie does this with Bella as an attempt to make her more likable, but it only pisses me off. The reason this book is so long is because over half the pages are her freaking out and someone else is trying to reassure her. I rolled my eyes every time she ""flinched"" or ""cringed"" when another person might be in ""danger."" - JACOB BLACK SEXUALLY ASSAULTS BELLA AND THEN LAUGHS AT HER FOR DEFENDING HERSELF. This is unforgivable to me. He forcefully kisses her, she fights back as much as she can, but when she realizes that she cannot overpower her attacker, she simply goes limp and lets him finish. This is the reaction of many victims of sexual assault, especially when they feel powerless in the situation. Once he's done, she punches him in the face, which breaks her hand. He proceeds to laugh at her and tells her that it's HER FAULT that her hand is broken because she should've known better than to punch a werewolf. THEN (yeah, it gets worse), he takes her home where Charlie, HER FATHER, laughs at her and takes Jacob side!!! Because he'd rather see Bella with this ""good guy"" over Edward. - To continue that point, Charlie Swan is the Chief Police Officer and doesn't believe his own daughter is a victim of sexual assault and sides with the attacker. He should be fired. - The fact that Jacob refuses to respect Bella's choices and will absolutely not take no for an answer is so scary and I'm upset that anyone is a supporter of Jacob. - In the epilogue, where we get Jacob's narration of a chapter, he uses the r-word. Yet another reason to hate this guy. - Bella ""realizing"" that she loves Jacob as more than a brother should NOT have happened. It isn't something we needed, it lasts five minutes, and it makes it that much weirder when he imprints on Renesme in the last book. PROS (these are weak because, let's be honest, this book is weak): - Edward really does grow on me in this one. Of course, I was obsessed with him as a teen, but reading the first two novels now made me realize how terribly unhealthy his relationship with Bella is, but in Eclipse, we truly do get to see Edward have some character development. Edward is probably the only character in the series that actually grows and changes, even if it is only slightly. He realizes he wants nothing more than Bella's happiness, and he's willing to do whatever that takes, even if it means letting her be with Jacob (kill me), or hell, even running off to clown college. He would do anything for Bella, and even though I don't understand what he sees in her, I still love his literally undying love for her. -Bella fighting back against Jacob's assault and then calling him out for it made me proud. Although she eventually (too soon) forgives him, I loved that she stood up for herself.- Bella demanding that vampire dick while she's still human is extremely funny to me. What makes it even better is the whole ""Edward's dick-game is so strong that he will actually kill her with it"" thing. I laugh every time. - The engagement scene is honestly really cute. Edward still creeps me out with the whole ""you are mine"" possessive crap, but that's really nothing at this point. Bella really is his according to her, so whatever.

224,271209598,02/02/2012,3.0,"This is the third book in the twilight saga, in which we once again join Bella in her strange love triangle with her boyfriend Edward (a vampire) and her best friend Jacob (a werewolf).The supposed main storyline deals with a group of new vampires in neighbouring seattle, who as it turns out are actually being made to hunt Bella, as their maker Victoria is still pretty violently put out about Edward killing her lover when he attacked Bella. This storyline is greatly overshadowed however by the love triangle between the three lead characters.Edward, (who is possessive and controlling at best) is demanding that Bella marry him before he turns her into a vampire (which she doesn't want to do) and even more rigidly demanding that she marry him before he will have sex with her! I mean, what age are we living in here? Is this not just a bit bizarre? He also seems to think that Bella is being unreasonable about the whole marriage thing, when she is only 18, and of course her parents will object and everyone think she's crazy! Never mind that if he's going to turn her they will have an eternity in which to get married anyway.Jacob on the other hand is either not talking to Bella at all, or desperately trying to convince her to pick him over Edward, and acting very much like a jealous, obsessed stalker who won't leave her alone. Although, in his favour, at least he seems to be happy to take Bella as she is without making the outragous demands Edward does.Bella herself seems to get stuck in the middle of this little tug-of-war, although a lot of the time she puts herself in that position, and doesn't make things easier for anyone, especially as it seems she has already choosen who she wants to be with. She also constantly cries and whines throughout the book, and is apparently incapable of being alone for even a second without someone to watch over her. I also don't get why she is so incapable of making a choice and sticking with it. If she wants to be with Edward she should just say so and stop leading Jacob on, and if she doesn't want a graduation party, and doesn't want to get married she should just say so too instead of allowing everyone else to make her decisions for her.I would suggest that this book is too long for the events that take place, with major events like the fighting and the graduation glossed over, while most of the focus is on discussing characters feelings over and over again when it really isn't necessary - we've heard it all before. Action-wise, its not as good as 'New Moon' which at least seemed to have a little pace and excitement. I have to admit that at times during this book I felt my attention really wavering, and had to make a conscious effort to bring my attention back to what I was reading.Overall, the book continues the story set out in the first two, and gives us a glimpse into what Bella's life would be like depending on which boy she picked, it also leads up to the obvious finale and expected turning of Bella in the final book. Hopefully the last book in the series 'breaking dawn' will make up for what this one lacks and mean that I haven't totally wasted my time thus far, and hopefully Bella will grow a backbone and learn to stand on her own two feet for once.

225,1393465891,09/16/2015,3.0,"First Read: September 2009Reread: December 2015Actual Rating; 3.3 Newborn StarsTwilight introduced us to Bella Swan and the mysterious Cullen's a family of vampires. New Moon pulled Bella and Edward Cullen apart, and tested their love and introduced us to Jacob and the battle between wolves and vampires. It also left us hanging with a decision about Bella and immortality: when?Eclipse is different. We return to the town of Forks and find that nothing much has changed. Graduation is closer than ever (after which, the Cullen's have agreed to make Bella a vampire) and a serial killer is loose in Seattle. Bella cannot see Jacob, her best friend because he is a Werewolf, and due to her ties to the vampires, it would break treaties and bonds made between them. This book really focuses on Bella's relationship between Edward and Jacob. She must make her final choice with who means more to her. Jacob's crush-if you can call it that-is stronger than it has ever been. She loves Jacob but isn't quite sure how she loves him. Does she love him or is she 'in love with him.' While she tries to balance her relationship with Edward and Jacob she seems to be digging herself into a deeper heart ache than before.Bella is now in her senior year. But everything is so complicated. There's Edward to think of and be with. But there's also the decision--to remain human or to be a vampire--looming overhead, along with the deadline of the Volturi. And then there's the matter of the crazed-for-vengeance vampire--Victoria from New Moon--who is hot on Bella's trail. And who could forget conflicted Jacob Black who has a few surprises to reveal. And if that's not enough, someone is killing people in Seattle. The serial killer that is in Seattle turns out to be supernatural: newborn vampires on the loose. This brings up even more issues for Bella and her decision to become immortal. Not that anything could ever persuade her to give Edward up, but it makes the choice more difficult by showing her the realities of becoming a vampire.What's acceptable about this book is that the author never betrays her character-is-king roots. I thought Bella became even more developed as a character, as did Edward. While some might argue differently, I appreciated some of the concessions made. I agree with some of the reviewers who said that Bella was annoying at times. But honestly, isn't that the mark of a vivid character? Who can blame her for being conflicted? One thing that might bog down readers is the tremendous amount of backstory that must be covered in order for the action and some characters' points of view to make sense. It makes for a lot of exposition, even when the stories are coming out of the characters' mouths. But at least the stories are told in varied styles, according to the characters relating them, so monotony is not an issue. It's just a LOT of information to keep straight.Eclipse also offers it's share of action and suspense. Like the first two books, it builds up slowly until near the end, where the plot takes off and people come dangerously close to losing their lives.",5,0.8484,0.085,0.814,0.102,0.4960216715651496,NEGATIVE,0.8181

227,32031145,09/04/2008,1.0,"Ugh. I feel I deserve some sort of medal for finishing this book. I had my doubts about the Twilight series ever since I first heard of them a few years ago, but then more and more people I know who have actual taste started reading them and liking them. So I thought, what the hell? I like a good vampire yarn. I made it through all the Lestat chronicles, I'm a big Buffy fan, I even read a couple of those Sookie Stackhouse novels, so how bad can it be?At first, with the first book, it was bad, but bearably so. Terrible writing, silly heroine, paper-thin plot, but I was entertained nonetheless. I spun through the 1st two books in a couple of days and decided maybe I would like the series after all, you know, in the way you once liked a Spice Girls song but would never admit it. Of course, I had trouble adjusting to all the usual vampire ""rules"" going out the window, and found it laughable that the reason they can't go into the sun is because they sparkle. Really? Whatever. I guess I like my vampires a bit more less glittery. I could also do without constant desperate housewife descriptions of Edward's amazing beauty. God. We get it. He's prettier than her. He's prettier than Johnny Depp. He's really really pretty, and even his breath smells amazing. Enough already! I was tempted to be incredibly offended that a woman would write a character like this as if to say that Edward is the epitome of perfection, he's what every woman would want. It's just such a 13-year-old girl-type fantasy of what a perfect boyfriend would be like. But I kept on going, still willing to give these new vamps the benefit of the doubt. Then I hit Eclipse and any remaining good will just got sucked right out. This book is ridiculously long -- there is absolutely no reason for at least half of it to exist. I'm at my wits end with Bella. It's all been said before, but I'm offended that the heroine has to be such an idiot. On and on and on with her stupid, self-absorbed, oh-my-god-i'm-a-danger-magnet chatter. Seeing things from only her damsel-in-distress perspective is excruciating. And the love triangle -- human, vampire, werewolf, is just so, I don't know, so meh. I just can't bring myself to care. At all. I have absolutely no reason to believe that anyone -- redneck high school boy, Indian werewolf, 19th century vampire, would be madly in love with Bella. Why? She's BORING.And seriously, seriously? The vampire won't have sex with her until they're MARRIED? Gah! That just pushed me over the edge. I guess that's the Mormon in Meyer. But apparently I am a glutton for punishment, bad writing, stupid storytelling, sad-sack vampires, idiotic heroines, and whiny werewolves, because I am slogging on to book #4.

228,2155898883,07/28/2018,5.0,"Eclipse is maybe edgier than the other two and definitely deals with the love triangle more, but so far it's my favorite of series.This is definitely the most action packed of the three so far. And I loved seeing the dynamics change between the werewolves and the vampires as they went from ""enemy allies"" to working together and caring about each other. Also, Charlie in this book was hilarious.I didn't like Bella and Jacob as much in this book as the last one, I didn't hate them, but Edward was definitely the best character in this book.Edward's character arch is just- it's so huge it's mind blowing. I know some people question how good of a guy Edward is because he's somewhat controlling with slight stalker-like qualities, but really guys, Edward overcomes these flaws in this book. He starts off lying to Bella and trying to make decisions for her, but then he realizes what he's doing and how he's acting and he stops. He becomes this really sensitive guy who puts Bella first in all respects, even if it hurts him. And it does. A lot. It broke my heart just a little bit to see Bella unintentionally hurting Edward and him hiding his pain because he knows it would hurt her to know that she hurt him. There was just a lot of hurt going around, guys. And that's why I think Edward is the better guy, Jacob used his pain as a weapon against Bella, Edward hid it so deep where he prayed Bella would never find it.This book has a lot of Wuthering Heights allusions and while I did love that book, I detested Cathy and I hated Heathcliffe with every fiber of my being. So while I could see Bella maybe sharing some traits with Cathy (very few) I was always upset when they would compare Edward to Heathcliffe, but then there is a scene in this book that makes it seem more like Jacob is Heathcliffe, so who knows?Content wise: there's some language and quite a bit of kissing. Bella tries to seduce Edward, but he tells her that he wants to wait till their wedding because he doesn't want to break the last commandment that he hasn't already (view spoiler)[I wasn't a fan of the end where they're in the meadow and Edward finally relents and tells Bella that he'll do what she wants, and I'm glad that Bella decides not to go through with it because she realizes how much it means to Edward. Honestly, Edward was being too selfless for his own good. (hide spoiler)]",7,0.9529,0.134,0.708,0.159,0.511937984496124,POSITIVE,0.9993
229,1110321879,11/19/2014,5.0,"Reading the third installment in the Twilight series was as satisfying to me as eating a Snickers candy bar.Because, after all, Eclipse is BIG--629 pages--and in this volume of the story about Bella Swan, a mortal teenager, and vampire Edward Cullen, several big What If questions are explored: What if Bella decides once-and-for-all to become a vampire like Edward; how can she possibly know when she's ready? What if Edward relents and redraws his ""many careful lines"" for his physical relationship with Bella? What would it look like if something so evil were to terrorize the Olympic Peninsula that Bella's good vampires and her werewolf friends had to try to unite to fight it, despite their ancient animosity? And how would Bella's closest friend Jacob, probably the swiftest of the Quileute werewolves, compete with her supposedly true love Edward for her eternal devotion?Once again, Stephenie Meyer has written a compelling and often humorous sequel set in the lush environment surrounding the small town of Forks, Washington. Her colorful characters feel like real people rather than types--a big thing for me. And what situations couldn't been written morosely or indelicately came off instead as, well, as a kind of sensuous elegance. Even though the more private moments of pain or pleasure were described honestly, with realistic detail, they weren't stripped of their intimacy by such telling. That impressed me. And there are lots of these kinds of moments throughout the book. I just ate it up.One thing that might bog down readers is the tremendous amount of back story that must be covered in order for the action and some characters' points of view to make sense. It makes for a lot of exposition (as opposed to plain ol' action), even when the stories are coming out of the characters' mouths.

But I don't see how you can hate it. almost nonexistent plot, love triangles, annoying characters, repetitiveness, long chapters, predictability, what more could you ask for? doesnt' that just sound amazingfor real though, it's just so entertaining and so good haaahSo Eclipse is definitely DEFINITELY better than New Moon, not that New Moon was bad, it was just a lot better, well, I enjoyed reading it more.

231,78396232,11/19/2009,3.0,"There was no reason for me to read this book after the horror that was New Moon. I detest Bella with every fiber of my being. Is it even possible to have a main character that is more weak and pathetic? I was treated to the pleasure of 600 pages of watching her ignore the many warnings from friends and family that her relationship with Edward was not healthy. Nothing else matters in the entire world to this girl because she loves some guy. No one could possibly understand their love, so all those warnings are just ignorant. Seriously? I could possibly understand if Edward showed one ounce of emotion toward her that wasn't a possessiveness that borders on dangerous. The Twilight series is sending an absolutely horrendous message to teenage girls. Becoming obsessed with the first boy who ever pays attention to you, dating that boy even though he's got ""future wife-beater"" stamped on his forehead and ultimately agreeing to forgo college and your living, breathing life just so you can marry him right out of high school (even though you don't really want to) and become a vampire (because you're going to be 19 soon and that's like ancient) are all things to strive for? And, my god, what was with all the begging for sex?Crappy love story aside, Eclipse was oddly compelling. The werewolf-vampire interaction was decent and the vampire back stories were more interesting that expected. I have this strange need to read the next book even though I want to strangle Bella, Edward and Jacob for being so damned annoying.

232,38023800,11/18/2008,5.0,"I am really shocked that I am so thoroughly enjoying this young adult series. I resisted reading these books for so long, and now I can't read them fast enough. Eclipse is probably my favorite of the three books I have read in the series, but they are all so thorougly connected that it is somewhat difficult to differentiate between them.

233,2577472549,03/06/2021,5.0,"Eclipse is the third book in the Twilight saga and follows Bella as she must choose between her friendship with Jacob Black and her love for Edward Cullen, all the while a newborn army created by Victoria is preparing to move against her and those she loves. 

“In the dead silence, all the details suddenly fell into place for me with a burst of intuition. Something Edward didn’t want me to know. Something that Jacob wouldn’t have kept from me. It was never going to end, was it?”

I really, really enjoyed Eclipse, just like I enjoyed New Moon and Twilight. There’s something about this series that is just addictive. I’m not surprised it was such a global phenomenon when Twilight was first released. I just can’t get enough of the story. It’s so damn entertaining. One of the main reasons I enjoyed Eclipse so much was because the love triangle was done really, really well and I’m surprised at how much I enjoyed it because I kind of see Twilight as like the basis of the love triangle trope, even though it’s most likely not, and with that I always assumed negative things about the love triangle. But having finally read the series, I can safely say that this is one of the best love triangles I have ever read about. 

“He laughed with me, and then his eyes were sad. “When are you finally going to figure out that you’re in love with me, too?”“Leave it to you to ruin the moment.”“I’m not saying you don’t love him. I’m not stupid. But it’s possible to love more than one person at a time, Bella.”

Bella really goes on a journey in this book and maybe I should have cut her some slack in New Moon because it was her obvious through her heartbreak and wallowing for Edward that she was completely in denial about the depths of her feelings for Jacob. And I liked that Jacob wasn’t written out of the love triangle in this instalment or that he was made negative in any way. In fact, much to my surprise, Bella confesses that she is in love with Jacob as well, but that it’s not enough, because she loves Edward more. That scene towards the end of the book between Jacob and Bella where they both talk openly and vulnerably about their relationship and what the means for the future was done incredibly well. I thought it was written very well, the dialogue felt really real and authentic and it was the point in the book where the characters felt the most realistic. I also really enjoyed Bella’s emotional development. She juggles her feelings for both Edward and Jacob and she feels like so much more of a mature character in this book, and I really enjoyed reading about her journey, both emotionally in terms of the love interest and also mentally regarding her decisioning about leaving her human life behind and wanting to turn into a vampire.

“You love him,” he murmured gently.“I love you more,” I said.“Yes, I know that, too. But . . . when I left you, Bella, I left you bleeding. Jacob was the one to stitch you back up again. That was bound to leave its mark — on both of you. I’m not sure those kinds of stitches dissolve on their own. I can’t blame either of you for something I made necessary.”

However, Eclipse, just like its predecessors, also has its problems. I feel like the beginning of this book with the jealousy between Edward and Jacob and everybody acting like Bella’s babysitters just made me cringe. But it was through this behaviour that I realised just how right Edward is for Bella. He quickly realises what Bella wants and what would make her happy and even though it goes against what he believes in and goes against history, he puts aside his hostility and negative feelings towards Jacob in order to ensure Bella’s happiness. But Jacob isn’t able to do that. And there are times he gets really annoying with his petty behaviour but to me it just another reason as to why he wasn’t the one for Bella. There’s a specific scene where Edward and Jacob are talking and Edward states that he isn’t joining the war because Bella doesn’t want him to and Jacob says that he wouldn’t be able to do that. Also, Jacob’s reaction to Bella talking in her sleep saying that he thought “she’d never shut up” felt really rude to me, especially when you compare it to the way Edward talks about her sleep talking. It’s clear in Eclipse that Edward is better for Bella than Jacob.

“He’s like a drug for you, Bella.” His voice was still gentle, not at all critical. “I see that you can’t live without him now. It’s too late. But I would have been healthier for you. Not a drug; I would have been the air, the sun.”The corner of my mouth turned up in a wistful half-smile. “I used to think of you that way, you know. Like the sun. My personal sun. You balanced out the clouds nicely for me.”He sighed. “The clouds I can handle. But I can’t fight with an eclipse.”I touched his face, laying my hand against his cheek. He exhaled at my touch and closed his eyes. It was very quiet. For a minute I could hear the beating of his heart, slow and even.”

The most problematic aspect of this book is Jacob’s behaviour towards the latter half of the novel. He basically assaults Bella, kissing her without her consent and then forcibly holding her in place so that she can’t move away. I feel like Bella did express that he shouldn’t have done that but nobody ever thinks to have a conversation with Jacob to explain to him just how wrong that was of him to do. And then when the battle is happening, Jacob threatens to kill himself if Bella doesn’t give him what he wants and kiss him. And later he admits that although he is sorry for doing it, he doesn’t regret it and would most likely do it again. That is such problematic behaviour, and so far from the Jacob in New Moon who was so respectful of Bella’s wishes to just be friends. The Jacob in Eclipse was pushy, always trying to pressure Bella to admit her feelings, he assaulted her and emotionally manipulated her and it’s just wrong on so many levels.

“I stretched my neck up to whisper in his ear, laying my cheek against his warm skin. “You know I love you.”“I know,” he breathed, his arm tightening automatically around my waist. “You know how much I wish it was enough.”“Yes.”

Overall, Eclipse was such an entertaining instalment in the Twilight saga. I'm not the biggest fan of how Bella was basically absent from the fight at the conclusion of the novel and so we didn’t get a first hand account as to what exactly went on, even though a lot of the novel is building up to this climax. But I still though it was a great instalment and I am beyond impressed with how the love triangle was handled.",13,0.9987,0.092,0.739,0.169,0.5323749219271607,POSITIVE,0.9998
234,444111648,03/19/2018,2.0,"Back during my Twihard days of yore, this was my favorite of the four books, because of the drama of the love triangle. Reading it now, it irritated me more than anything else. Bella, Edward and Jacob all love passionately, and that powerful love brings out the worst in them. They all hurt each other in different ways trying to get what they want, and I hated it. Jacob, who was willing to stay platonic with Bella as long as she'd stay in his life, completely changed his attitude and became a complete jerk here, forcing his love on her even though he hurt Bella every time. And part of the reason I enjoyed New Moon was his willingness to stay friends so this deterioration of his character really ruined him for me. Edward at least, developed somewhat in this book. He was incredibly controlling at the beginning here, refusing to let Bella see Jacob (inasmuch as going to ""kidnap"" her for a sleepover with Alice so she couldn't see him), which I hated. However he eventually realized he was making Bella more unhappy by doing this so he learned to deal. Go Edward! The only one of the three of them to gain actual development.After three books Bella's character hasn't developed at all which is probably the saddest part of this whole series. She's still the boring selfish girl she's always been who still doesn't deserve either Edward or Jacob.So, yeah.

251,3859513728,02/27/2021,,"0.2 starsI'm not writing a lot about this book because I'm so mad at it, not only was it god-awful writing (as usual) but all of the characters are awful, aside from Leah, Seth, Rosalie, Alice, and Charlie is debatable. His whole thing with being friends with Jacob is understandable, you just want your kid to be happy but then when Jacob is like 'I kissed her' I was like wtf? he literally sexually assaulted your daughter and not just as a police officer but as her FATHER, you're okay with that??For starters, I was bored for most of the book, because most of it was just Bella and Edward being romantic and I don't like either of them and therefore, don't care about their romance. I think despite reading Midnight Sun which has 200+ more pages, this felt just as boring and pointless. Once again, the fight scenes are boring and the ""threats"" of Victoria and the Volturi were not captivating.I couldn't care less what happened to any of the characters, especially Jacob.So, in my other reviews, I defended Jacob because Bella led him on and used him, which I STILL STAND BY but that doesn't mean I agree with all of the kissing and manipulation? What is happening? If Jacob was unattractive then he'd be left to the curb and what is it with her insistence on being friends with him? If some guy who's my supposed ""friend"" sexually assaulted me, I'd kick them to the curb. He kissed her after she said no, and then continued to be an arrogant prick the entire time. I started to feel bad but then, she forgives him? What the fuck? What kind of message is that spreading? If the guy is your friend, forgive him? What is going on in this series??Jacob and Bella piss me off so much, she is constantly like 'oh no, I'm hurting Jake' then overcompensates by going 'oh kiss me before you leave' like what? I honestly have no words, normally my reviews are more formal than this but wow, this book is SO BAD. Justice for Leah and Rosalie, those characters are so hated by Meyer and it is so undeserved. Rosalie's back story is rough and yet she's the bitch because she doesn't like Bella, our protagonist? Good, Bella's an awful person and is so, incredibly selfish. Leah's story is also so sad but she's hated by everybody in the book, no thanks to Meyer. So it's okay for Jacob to be in love with Bella for years, despite her showing no romantic interest (well, aside from the 'kiss mes' and touching him and generally being romantic, okay, so showing some interest because she's manipulating him) but as soon as Leah does it, after going out with the guy for 2/3 years and then he falls in love with someone else, that's not okay? It makes me so mad. This book genuinely made me dislike most of the characters, and most of all, the entire series even more than I already do.I'm so glad I finished this lull of a book.",4,-0.8753,0.202,0.606,0.192,0.6285416666666667,NEGATIVE,1.0
252,3893389041,07/01/2021,2.0,"When you sit there, slamming the book shut every two words because of the second hand embarrassment, you know it won’t be good. Eclipse pissed me off so much, I considered throwing the book into a fire, maybe into the pool. Almost every other chapter I would ask myself, how was this published? How is this not a wattpad book? Who allowed this to be made? Answer: I don’t know.As always my biggest complaint is their relationship. We have Bella, a 17 year old (in the first book) now 18 in this book, who falls in love with a century old vampire. I don’t care if he’s stuck in a 17 year old’s body, if Edward were human, he would be floating dust. Anytime Bella describes Edward as pale, shimmering or bright I just thinkof the fact that he’s one step away from being ash. The love triangle in this book barely existed, it was fighting for its life in this story. Jacob trying to get Bella when she’s with Edward literally put the love triangle trope on life support because of how bad it was. Nothing happened it was boring, mostly filled with embarrassing lines, overused phrases which I think were meant to be cheesy, but just made me hate myself for reading them.Also I thought I could trust Jacob as the only cool person in this book. Guess Alice is the only one left. I mean it’s self explanatory that the guy best friend falls in love with her, but Jacob just took things too far. He went after Bella, fighting for her love which sounds adorable. But then kisses her knowing she’s in a relationship and when she tries to stop him he just keeps going. His actions in this entire story made me wanna punch him because how do you not realize that you are assaulting (is that the right word) someone when they don’t want you to touch them. I mean Bella literally broke her arm trying to push you away! She even accepted his apology like two seconds later and then acted as if it never happened. It’s as if it’s okay for someone to do that because hey they are your best friend!And is no one gonna talk about the pedophilia in this book? Because I don’t care if it’s a werewolf thing where they print something on each other as a love at first sight thing, BUT A TWO YEAR OLD?! Yeah sure the guy was like 16 or 15, but who in their right mind goes, yeah this is perfect, a teen falling in love with a baby who can’t talk fully yet. Like I wanna know what the thought process for this part was and how this went from a draft to being edited to being published without anyone thinking of removing it.In the end, this entire book was 629 pages of boring, embarrassment and trash, as well as stupid shit I never thought I’d read in a published book. Anytime I look at the cover I wanna throw it somewhere because of how much it bothers me. But am I gonna continue the series? Yes. Why? Because I have to finish it, I started the series I need to know how it ends even if I’m gonna hate myself after it.",4,0.9955,0.098,0.724,0.178,0.5414839772386942,NEGATIVE,1.0
253,2468518010,07/24/2018,4.0,"#1 Twilight ★★★☆☆#2 New Moon ★★★☆☆#3 Eclipse ★★★★☆#4 Breaking Dawn ★★★★☆Ah, how I will intensely keep wishing that Goodreads would implement half star ratings. This is about a 3.5, but I decided to round up to four simply because I enjoyed reading this that much.This was definitely my favorite book in the series so far for a few different reasons: The first being that Stephenie Meyer’s writing grows exponentially from Twilight to this one. It’s still not the best writing I’ve ever read, but where the first book stumbled around with awkward and choppy prose that depended more on the ‘tell instead of show’ approach, Eclipse delved deeper into emotions and details. It made it much, much more enjoyable than the last two books have been.Second reason being that because Meyer’s writing grew, so did the characters. I’ve had my fair share of problems with Bella as a character up to here; most of them stemming from her unwavering ‘not-like-other-girls’ syndrome (because I would have never called her a Mary Sue as she has an abundance of flaws from day one and I’m not talking about her clumsiness) more than anything. In Eclipse, she actually does grow into her own. She still has her moments where I got slightly irked, but nothing near what it was. Also being older has given me some startling insight into Bella as a character. I understand more than I did when I first read these books so a lot of what she does and says, I get it more than I ever did when I was younger.Third being because as little damage as it did, it was extremely satisfying to read Jacob getting punched and I really wanted Edward to do it just because that would actually hurt.Which leads me to my customary rant: I hate Jacob Black so much. It’s almost amazing. He is obnoxiously arrogant, self-centered, and disrespectful. He depends more on Bella’s compassion and love for him to get his way because she made her choice and it wasn’t him. He—unlike Edward—wields his hatred quite openly and unapologetically around Bella, not really caring whatsoever what it does to her because it amuses him, and his whole reason for being disgustingly persistent is the hormone, hate-driven need to be better than a vampire—to win a game, despite Bella’s blatant rejections. He corners her into multiple corners that she cannot get out of and then pins the guilt on her because she doesn’t feel the same (view spoiler)[or Gods forbid, realizes a piece of her, from the time Edward left, does love him but still not enough to be an option at all for her (hide spoiler)]. He is manipulative and cruel and needed far more than a punch from Bella. I have no sympathy or empathy for him whatsoever. And maybe that’s mean, but I just really do not. I liked him when he was a friend to Bella, but that lasted all of five minutes and from there, it’s been a disaster that has done nothing but fuel this intense dislike. The entire premise that movies took and spun into a love triangle is nothing more than Jacob refusing to take no for an answer because he feels like he has a point to prove in the books. That’s it and I am so, so done with it. I suppose, because of this, I do have to give Meyer some more props. Her evolution in writing has definitely amplified my reactions and feelings to a lot of situations and characters when before, I wouldn’t have really blinked and been apathetic towards most things. Some characters (Bella, Edward, even Sam and some of the wolves) had positive growth and some (looking at you, Black) had negative growth, but either way, I have something to say.So yes. Yes, I am having an absolute blast reading these and I’m entirely unapologetic about it. I know I already said it, but I mean it. If you can read these books with a grain of salt (as they do have their tropes and theatrics) and put aside your inner book snob that’s used to writing like Cassandra Clare and Leigh Bardugo and the likes of popular YA authors now, these books are a very entertaining ride.",4,0.9853,0.109,0.743,0.147,0.523471177944862,POSITIVE,0.9754

255,3372583147,07/30/2020,3.0,"Disappointing. I thought this one would be really good. HOWEVER, WHY DOES NOBODY TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT JACOB BLACK SUCKS?! I'm not even going to review the book I'm just gonna tell y'all why Jacob is actually the worst and Bella needs to cut that toxicity out of her life it's not doing any wonders to her skin. I apologize in advance for any and all Team Jacobs.1) He doesn't respect any of the people Bella cares about: In what I'm pretty sure is the first conversation they have together, Jacob keeps calling Edward ""bloodsucker"" and Bella's like ""yo this isn't cool"" and he goes ""okay I'm sorry"" AND THEN KEEPS DOING IT?? I just don't understand. He makes no effort to actually be nice to any of the Cullens, especially Edward, even when EDWARD MAKES AN EFFORT bc he loves Bella and wants her to be happy. But no. Jacob only cares about himself and his own interests. Which is strange bc it's in his best interest to make Bella happy. I know he's nice to them in the end (kind of but not really), it doesn't make up for any of it. And sure, Edward's mean to Jacob to bc of werewolf/vampire drama, but he makes an effort to keep things civil. Jacob just kind of goes off whenever he feels like it, and it's quite angering.2) He kissed Bella without her consent and showed absolutely no remorse: This one is a bit self-explanatory. This is never okay. She was very much pushing back against the kiss. And even if he couldn't feel it and therefore did not stop, that doesn't excuse the fact that he did so in the first place when she keeps saying that she doesn't love him and, oh yeah, HAS A BOYFRIEND. And then,,, every time it was brought up after because of how Bella punched him (AS SHE SHOULD HAVE) he like treats it as a joke off?? Example:Bella: Edward's the only person that I've ever kissed. Jacob: Besides me.Bella: I don't count that as a kiss. I think of it more as an assault.Jacob: Ouch that's cold. I did apologize about that.AND LIKE THAT'S HIS REACTION TO THAT?? AND BELLA SHRUGS IT OFF LIKE NO BIG DEAL EVEN THO IT HIGH KEY IS?? (also Charlie totally condoned the non-consensual kiss so he lost a lot of respect points I'm glad he had like no lines during the confrontation in the movie bc it would have made me big sad)3) Most if not all of his conversations with Bella end in her storming off bc of something that he said: Let's not lie to ourselves people. When has Bella ever had a decent conversation with Jacob and not stormed off? They are few and far between. Yet she keeps coming back to him. I just don't understand. I really wish she would kind of just say enough's enough and leave him be. It's not worth it. He's causing you too much stress, and no, you don't love him. That is a product of manipulation and it needs to be addressed. Speaking of which...4) He is M A N I P U L A T I V E: I don't remember exactly what he said he would do (I think like kill himself or sumn IDK) if Bella wouldn't kiss him, BUT HE SAID SOMETHING AND THEN BELLA ALLOWED A KISS. AND LIKE?? WHY DOES HE KEEP BUGGING HER ABOUT KISSING HIM AGAIN?? This boy keeps telling Bella that she loves him and doesn't know it yet TO THE POINT where she starts to believe it herself and I don't buy that for a second. This is pure manipulation. It makes me sick. Love how this was being romanticized :)))Sorry if I came for the wigs of all Team Jacobs from 2010, but he is just not a good friend. Or person. I was already harboring bad feelings for him from the end of New Moon after enjoying him, and this just made it all the worse. I truly believe that Jacob might be the worst character from this series because his character is everything that a person should not be. I know he's like 16, but that is not how anybody should act. Consider this a ""how-not-to"" guide for getting a girl to like you or being a decent human being (as he so desperately tries to convince Bella of). Um anyway I hope he just isn't in Breaking Dawn at all. Like I know he will be, but either he's gotta be a changed man or he's gotta go.

271,3979309652,05/02/2021,4.0,"4 stars for Edward, Charlie and... Jacob. Yes. Maybe Jacob.Okay then, I wasn't sure how many stars to put on this book because I liked it too much, but at the same time something happened near the end that infuriated me and almost brought me down to 3 or 3.5 stars.I will try to go in order:1. If I really liked this book, it was because of Edward and Charlie. Especially Edward. He is a being of light. He so LOVING and noble. My favorite male lead ever and I seriously doubt anyone will ever resemble or steal the # 1 spot from my heart. Sure, there are beautiful men like Luc King, Julian Blackthorn, Daemon Black, Aaron Warner... but are any of them as intense as Edward? I do not believe it. They are not. But that's okay with me because there is only one Edward in this life.2. Edward deserves better than Bella, which is surprising for me to say considering that even before the end of the book, I valued Bella's loyalty and devotion to him.3. The only thing I liked about Bella was her unconditional love for Edward. Of the rest, she left much to be desired. She was so apathetic, so unbearable... she didn't seem right at all. Bella was bored and bitter. She never wanted to party, she never wanted to go shopping, she didn't want to get married (which seemed silly to me considering that she wanted to be a vampire, something stronger than the betrothal and that would seal her fate with Edward forever) , She didn't want gifts, no... nothing. How could people even bear to be around her, when she only had her ass face as her personality? Sometimes it felt like she had no emotion whatsoever for anything other than Edward. And look, again, I liked how devoted she was, but there are limits. She could be devoted and entertaining. It would have been more interesting for her to spy on Edward in his spare time, to see what funny consequences he would bring. I do not know!4. Charlie is simply the best. They didn't give him enough credit in the movies. He was so funny, such a good father, even when he was embarrassed or seemed not to know what to say ... it was obvious his love and concern for Bella. I was absolutely delighted with him and laughed at every scene of him. I love him.5. Bella was spoiled with Charlie, she hated her and didn't really understand how someone would NOT slap her for being disrespectful. Ok, cut that out. Hitting children is wrong, but I will say something: no young man from my country would get out alive if he responded in this way to his parents. I blame American education for Bella's disrespect. **joke**6. Jacob... Jake. I should hate him because his presence hurt Edward, but I really liked him. He sometimes got unbearable, but he had the cheerful demeanor of a child. So I liked him because he reminded me of the younger brother of my fantasies. The moments with Bella were fun because I had a more jovial, cheerful look of her, and I would have liked them to stay close.7. The Cullens. The cullens had a lot of potential and I was sorry that they did not appear so much in this book, although I'm not complaining because they were more than in New Moon. LOL. Anyway, I loved the couples and the separate characters, although I'll be honest: I was expecting more charm from Alice. Yes, she's great, but I think I foolishly hoped her personality was pigeonholed into being the cheerful sister and she acted irritated at times. I think I hoped she was like Dee Black (Saga Lux by jla)8. The scene that almost cost all the stars in this book: Bella and Jacob's kiss. And no, I'm not talking about the first kiss, I'm talking about the second kiss. The one that happened when Edward took a few steps away (how convenient!). When the kiss started and Bella wasn't very into them, I was relieved. I was still angry about the direction the chapter was taking, but I could pass up the kiss if Bella didn't actively participate in it. Then he did it and it felt so hot and intense that I almost threw up in disgust. Her kisses with Edward were never as great as the kiss she had with Jacob. Not only that, then it occurred to the stupid woman to admit to herself that she was in love with Jacob. I almost committed suicide. Really. I was so angry and desperate that I didn't know what to do with myself. I couldn't believe it!!! Bella, who had never given Jacob the time in that way during the entire book, who rather seemed not to care much and irritated with her presence, did she suddenly claim to be in love with him? Edward didn't deserve that! He deserved better. I honestly do not fit the words. I'm very indignant and I feel a tremendous disappointment. So many horrible male characters... and this happens to the best man. So damn unfair. It makes me miserable on behalf of him.And it seems like an exaggeration on my part, but I terribly hate it so much when there are decent, caring male characters who must share a girl's love. They don't deserve that.Following the line:I thought my suffering would end with the kiss and the discovery of Bella, but no. God hadn't had enough! When Edward came back, I just wanted him to kill her and save us from suffering. Really. I give you permission.But not. Edward is the sweetest and most lovable person in the world, so he just spoke to her sweetly, caressed her face and told her that he wanted the best for her, and that Bella could take whatever she wanted from him. At this rate, if Bella planned to marry Jacob and take Edward as her lover, he would agree.Bella felt worse and said something like: ""but I love you more..."" yeah, you silly bitch, as if that eases something.Then she Bella promised herself that she would never suffer for Jacob again, and I thought: Well, finally. Keep your promise bitch.Okay, Edward was still the wonderful man and I really would have preferred him to be mean. GIVE US YOUR WRATH EDWARD, WE DESERVE IT !!The big battle is coming, and I hoped that, just like it was seen in the movie, Bella would do something and stab herself to distract the bad vampires with her blood. That shit didn't happen. Edward noticed that she wanted to intervene, and did a whole cartwheel to kill the vampires and save Bella the fatigue of bleeding. You should have let her bleed, Edward!After that, Bella found out that Jacob had just been hurt... And the daughter of a bitch passed out!!!!!!!!BELLA FAINTED FOR JACOB. I almost lost it. I was about to kill myself with rage.Of course, things can get worse, huh?Edward was worried about Jacob, like he was his little brother or something. Because Edward is a being of light and I bet you he fell in love with Jacob just by reading his mind.Bella goes to Jacob to end their friendship, because they both love each other and they can't go through with this... I was hoping it would be a clean ""breakup"". Like, get this fucking over with.But not. They snuggled and whispered, Jake about how much he loved her and that they probably would have been together and happy had it not been for Edward. I thought, well, Jacob almost died on us today, he sure is talking bullshit again. But then Bella started to agree, AND BELLA SERIOUSLY SAID SHE AND JACOB WERE SOULS. AND THAT she WISHED she FOR her TO HAPPEN THE VISION SHE HAD WHILE THEY KISSED, the one where she saw a future with him, and where she and Jacob had children. And I thought: BITCH ?????? ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUSLY?And if it weren't for all the magic (that is, Edward, vampires, wolves, etc.) she and Jacob would have ended up happily together, because that's how the world should have run its course.I almost committed suicide, again.(Parenthesis, I read this book at a bad time in my life, okay? Desperately wanting some happiness, so I ended up so angry with everything that happened, how normal that I talk so much about killing myself. Don't panic)So yes, that Bella had the assurance that Jacob was her soulmate almost killed me. Edward doesn't deserve that, but I think we've already made it clear that Bella will never deserve Edward.Then I thought, WELL THIS CAN'T GET WORSE.God spat in my face, and in the next chapter Bella was crying FOR HOURS. Edward picked her up in the middle of the street and hugged her AND THE BITCH WISHED THOSE ARMS BELONGED TO ANOTHER PERSON (that is Jacob). I almost lost it again.Honestly, death was the best option for me at this point.After that, Bella tried to calm down, but she couldn't repair her broken heart and she kept crying throughout the day, with Edward comforting her.The next day, Edward asked Bella if he had made the right decision for her, because he had never seen her in so much pain. And that he wanted her to be happy. Oh boy, you are a VERY GOOD PERSON. Really, again, she would have preferred Edward to rage and abandon her again, because no one deserves to share someone's heart. But our dear Edward loves her so much that she would take crumbs.Now look. Before the kiss between Jacob and Bella, I empathized with Bella. I really believed that her feelings for Jacob were only friendly and her affection did not seem strange to me, that she repeated ""my jacob, my jacob"" or that she thought so much about him and suffered for him ... It didn't bother me because I understood. I've had those kinds of friends and I would have given my all for my best friends too. Especially when you're young, you tend to that kind of intensity. It didn't seem out of the ordinary to me, okay?And I understood that Bella would have considered hers all from her to Jacob, at some point, because he was the one who saved her from sadness and all that. I can understand dependency.But when suddenly the pieces ""fell into place"" and it was no longer brotherly love that was there, but romantic love, I clearly got angry. Because Edward deserves someone who loves only him. It is not fair to have to comfort a girl who sighs and cries for another boy. FUCK. It's not fair to anyone. I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.And then there's the fact that Bella said that maybe she would get jealous of Jacob's next girlfriend ????! Lord Jesus, he just finishes me off. I vomited from disgust. What fucking rage.How selfish of shit. Tremendous dead mosquito that turned out to be the very bitch.Also, it seemed very out of the hair that Bella suddenly admitted to being in love with Jacob. During the book she did not have an attitude that led me to suspect it, seriously. Everything was very friendly. Her feelings and actions, nothing made me believe otherwise. So I think there was a mistake or she is very confused or James's punch in Twilight still affected her reasoning. I simply refuse to believe something that never existed for me. That's why I'm not 100% mad, because I think she's so stupid that she's still confused. Now, if Bella had spent her time pining for Jacob 24/7 while she was with Edward... my attitude would be different. I would not give this book 4 stars, I would be so angry that I would give it 1.However, I understand why Bella ""fell in love"" with Jacob (I put in quotes because I'm still waiting for a confirmation in Breaking Dawn, where she says she was confused and never really wanted it that way. A girl can dream) in New Moon. Edward left her and took Bella's heart, her soul, her thoughts, and her desire to live from her. But there was something left there, something minimal capable of resisting and loving... that was given to Jacob who helped him recover. As Jake said during the book, all of Bella's heart belonged to Edward, but Edward left and she had to give Jacob some parts of herself.Anyway, I get it but I still don't like it.The end for me is bittersweet. I don't like to watch Bella suffer for another, while she feels compelled to marry and she will anyway because she wants to be a vampire. Sometimes she acts like she only cares about being immortal. But of course, I know that it is not like that. It's just that the last 100 pages made that shit look like. And then there is Edward, who I know she suffers and keeps everything to herself. I'm doubly mad about that, show your reactions Edward !!! But nope, he doesn't want to scare or hurt Bella.By the way, he wished Edward was more aggressive. There were so many scenes where some good battles must have happened... but Edward's passivity appeased everything. I wish he was a little bit more alpha male.Alpha Male + Intense = perfect for me.And, I do not know, if those last pages had not existed, I would be with a happy smile. I'm not, I'm so mad I wouldn't hesitate to give this book 1 star, but I really liked the first part. And I want an explanation, I pray that everything is a mistake and Bella really isn't in love with Jacob.Like I said, I wanted to entertain myself with this book and be happy, but I ended up disappointed, miserable and sad. I probably won't read Breaking Dawn until much later. I need to recover from this stress.By the way, I stayed up until 4am to finish this book and then I had nightmares from the anguish and rage that I felt the last 100 pages.By the way 2, it probably has bugs. My first language is not English, but I will not continue reviewing this review because I am very emotionally exhausted because of this book",3,0.9996,0.157,0.629,0.214,0.5828434626375802,POSITIVE,0.9997

280,3653893530,11/19/2020,1.0,"PREFACEAt this point, I just have to finish this series, even if I look like Bella post-cliff dive back in New Moon. You only read the first one, or you're stuck reading the entire train wreck. Rip to me. So alas, here we are. ULTIMATUMLet me sum up the first 50% of Eclipse for you right here and now: Bella and Edward make out, Bella and Edward have disgusting conversations, Edward has a hot take on Wuthering Heights that I weirdly agreed with, Bella has an immature take on Wuthering Heights that shocked me not at all considering she should be banned from books, Bella runs off to see Jacob on occasion to shamelessly use him, Edward kidnaps Bella to prevent these ""we're just friends, and I'm using him"" trysts, and other assorted nonsense. Word to the wise: there was zero plot, so don't read it. Basically, we all know New Moon is bad. But take everything that sucked about that, throw it together in a bowl, preheat the oven to 350, bake it for 28–32 minutes, and make it altogether worse, and you have Eclipse. You thought Bella was dumb before? She's worse. You thought Edward was controlling? He's worse. You thought Jacob was pushy? He's worse. You thought Charlie was a terrible father? He's worse. You thought the Native American stereotypes were awful? They're worse. You thought the plot before was a slap-dash contrived bit of nonsense? It's worse. EVERYTHING IS WORSE. So I have an ultimatum for Breaking Dawn: can you be even worse? EVASIONThis book is also the one where Bella has to make some major life choices: should she become an undead monster, and should she let the boy she shamelessly used go? Big choices when she's only 18. Also big choices when she's a straight up moron. We've put this garbage off long enough, so let's just get it done right at the beginning of the book, Stephanie. NOPE. We have to read like 600 pages of Edward and Jacob one-upping each other and telling Bella how she feels. We also have to read like 600 pages of Bella being sure she wants to be a vampire but also getting cold feet because she finally realised becoming a vampire = death (which means no sex, and apparently that's the bigger issue here).Luckily, Bella doesn't really have to make a decision. Jacob literally assaults her, and Charlie is cool with it, so any hope of Team Jacob is now shattered into a million pieces. Just like Bella's hand when she punches Jacob's stupid face. Honestly that punch scene and resulting hand breaking deal was a real highlight of the book. That should say a lot about the book. But the dumb love triangle really culminates with one excellent (and by ""excellent,"" I mean dumb but funny) scene: the camping. Picture this: Bella, Edward, and Jacob in one tent during a random snow storm in June. The storm only occurs so Bella is forced to share a sleeping bag with Jacob, so she doesn't die. Then Edward just sits there and watches. Wat. But wait, there's more: Edward and Jacob have like a ten page conversation about how much they both love Bella and where they both stand with her. I can't believe I had to read that conversation with my own two eyes. But wait, there's even more: in the morning, Jacob rolls onto Bella, and Edward throws him into the wall. Genuinely the highlight of the book, and I hope future literature students get to study it for comedic purposes. UNHAPPY ENDINGThe ending is where Stephanie Meyer remembered she was writing a book (instead of a 600 page fan fiction) and decided to throw in a little bit of plot—like usual. Remember how it was stupid that one vampire was chasing Bella across the country because of her smell? It's worse. Now one vampire is amassing an army of newborn vampires to (you guessed it) hunt down Bella. Why? Apparently it's *revenge*. But really, it's just stupid and dumb. BUT I did have one burning question (kinda) answered: why are there no female werewolves? My question wasn't answered, but at least now there's a female werewolf. Yay! But also not-yay because the boys call her a ""harpy"" and whine about having to share thoughts with her and save her because she had to ""prove she was as strong as them."" 🤮 Why can't I just have my female werewolf without any misogyny? WHY?In conclusion, this book was awful, and everybody needs therapy, and Seth Clearwater deserves all the good things in life.",4,-0.8343,0.136,0.749,0.116,0.5802552718745903,NEGATIVE,1.0

283,100826335,05/01/2010,2.0,"What in the world do all of these people see in Bella? And I'm not just talking about Edward and Jacob. That also includes Mike Newton, the entire Cullen family, Angela, and even Victoria and James from the first book. The entire Twilight universe revolves around Bella. Everyone is obsessed with this girl. Why? She's whiny, hypocritical, self-obsessed, co-dependent, moody, childish, sulky, I could go on, you get my drift. She has no goals, ambitions, hobbies, dreams, or talents. She shows no interest in the world around her. She basically shows disdain and/or contempt for anyone in her life who isn't impossibly beautiful -- including her own parents. Her one goal in life is to become a vampire so she can live forever, be impossibly beautiful and strong, and never age.What disturbed me more, besides the rickety plot, the endless comparisons to Wuthering Heights (the author studied literature in college, I get it. most of us college educated people did and I still don't see the need for comparisons to Heathcliff and Cathy), and the annoying love triangle, was how self-deprecating Bella was. How she constantly went through the book saying how unworthy she was of everyone, how at fault she was of everything, how clumsy, stupid, selfish (that one I actually don't argue with), immoral, weak, helpless, pathetic, and frighteningly normal she is. Sure, it's hard to have immortal, strong, mostly male friends, but as a woman I'd like to see Bella shed that ""oh well, I'm just a little weak girl, woe is me, I'll just sit in the corner and die now"" attitude without having to become a vampire. At every turn in ""Eclipse"" Bella depicts herself harshly, and the story does nothing to turn that around. The men (with the exception of possibly Alice) are the selfless heroes by the end, and the women are selfish (Bella), shallow (Rosalie), and bitter (Leah). Where have the strong female role models gone? On top of all this, the big battle at the end was thoroughly disappointing. Not one character is lost, despite the danger. Seth isn't even injured fighting with the newborn vampire, despite his youth and inexperience. After all the Victoria build-up over two books then to see her ripped to pieces with extraordinary ease by Edward was hugely unsatisfying. No one had to sacrifice anything; in fact, the scene was so un-compelling I skimmed most of it. After 600-odd pages, this was inexcusable.Book Details: Title Eclipse (Twilight, #3) Author Stephenie MeyerReviewed By Purplycookie",4,-0.9603,0.154,0.738,0.108,0.6586640211640213,NEGATIVE,1.0
284,870649654,03/03/2014,3.0,"This is a hard book (and series) for me to review. On the one hand, there are many concerning behaviors shamelessly promoted, ones that I had romanticized as a young teenager: toxic masculinity, controlling and manipulative actions from all characters involved, the scarily intense obsession with possession of people you love, unhealthy mentalities toward what it means to be happy and in love. I could go on for a little while more with that list. With this being the first time I have read this since leaving behind my teenage years, I feel uncomfortable and skeeved out by how much this entire series circles around two men in competition over the love and attention of a woman. It is literally a p***ing contest drawn out over several books, which apparently I had once been all for and begged for more. (What the hell, young B.R.?)But as much as I now find the characters annoying and their behaviors alarming, I cannot ignore what this series did for me and the good it has to offer. I absolutely love the delving into history when we get the lore and backstory for the different ancient characters or family lines (vampires and werewolves, respectively), and once the book stops focusing on Bella and what is going on internally, the action and suspense really enraptures me. If we could just cut it down to just the histories/backstories and the action/suspense, this series would be golden and more in line with the awesome that we find in her The Host, which is hands down my OF ALL TIME favorite Stephenie Meyer book. I also cannot deny the love of reading this series helped to further cement into my heart and mind. Guys, I used to religiously read and write fanfiction for this series. I used to eat, sleep, and breathe these characters, because Meyer's story lit a fire in my creative soul. Even with this series' faults, I cannot deny that it helped lead to my decision to major in creative writing and pursue a lifelong journey in storytelling and reading (pfft, as if the latter wouldn't have happened if the former didn't). So yes, I will be one of the first people to point out every remarkably awful part of these books, but I will also be bringing forth everything that redeems this series, because this series gave me so much. If you have never read it and want to, I want you to go into it knowing what I said above. I think keeping that open mind and being aware of what to expect might help you look past that nonsense and be able to enjoy the parts that I love.",8,0.9745,0.061,0.824,0.115,0.4881448412698413,POSITIVE,0.8818
285,3481042351,08/06/2020,2.0,"Well, here we are.Everyone Is An Awful, Manipulative Person: The 629 page epic. A brief summary: Charlie lifts the (reasonable) curfew placed on Bella after the end of New Moon, much to Edward's delight, but he begs her to be a good friend and go visit Jacob with this new freedom. This will be a theme for the entire novel: you should feel as though you owe someone something for their friendship. Little does Charlie know that Edward is the one keeping her from going to see Jacob, just like any loving partner would! Edward gaslights the living hell out of Bella, forges her signature on college applications, and refuses to share important information with her. There's some kind of murder spree happening in Seattle, and everyone wants to keep Bella away from it. Edward takes this to the extreme, bringing Bella out to visit her mom in Florida for a weekend, where Renee remarks: ""you orient yourself around him. When he moves, even a little bit, you adjust your position at the same time. Like magnets...or gravity. You're like a...satellite, or something.""Need I remind you that Bella is 18?Upon arrival home, Bella is guilted into calling Jacob, who has been blowing the phone up since she left. We begin the running motif of Jacob feeling that he deserves a relationship with Bella beyond what they have, and will do at nothing to get what he feels he is owed. He shows up at the high school to have a conversation with Edward, drives off, and when Edward is off hunting that weekend, Bella sneaks down to La Push to see him. Bella apologizes, Jacob makes her feel terrible, they have a conversation about hunters and prey, and Bella always being the prey and not giving Jacob his fair chance. Bella drives back to Forks and Edward is furious with her for not telling him. Naturally, Bella is at fault for wanting to visit her friend, and that friend just happens to think Bella should date him, not Edward.Right.Alice's visions have become nearly infallible. From Twilight, where they were infrequent, to New Moon, where they were incomplete, to her now having a dashboard of futures to stare at. Her blind spot is the werewolves. We get Rosalie's backstory (and will get Jasper's later) and I'm going to editorialize for a moment to say...are we supposed to feel bad for people who, during times of civic unrest, were in the dominant class? Make no mistake, Rosalie's story is horrific, but should I feel bad for people who, in the Great Depression, had enough money for new dresses - made of organza - and time to set a new hairstyle just to meet a potential suitor? And later, am I supposed to feel bad for someone who signed up with the Confederate army?! I'm gobsmacked. Anyway, I guess we needed the complete Cullen backstories, and now we have them!Jacob (more or less) kidnaps Bella from school to bring her to La Push and we learn about what imprinting can truly mean - child grooming! One of the pack has imprinted on a two year old, but it's cool, because he'll be like a big brother, then a best friend, then the ultimate partner. And I guess imprinting only works if you're a male, imprinting on a female? Anyway, Jacob tells Bella he'd prefer if she were dead to her becoming a vampire, Bella runs off to the Cullens' home (she's having a sleepover with Alice), Edward returns in the night and has decided that she deserves to see Jacob and be friends. Wow! What a man! While Bella was away, someone has been in her bedroom. Since Edward and Jacob are going to play it cool, Jacob comes over to get the scent.Bella is invited to a Quileute bonfire and hears the legends of the wolves. Bella, of course, identifies with the unnamed, self-sacrificing woman. I have a huge problem with Meyer slapping her own lore into a story and calling it by the actual, real tribal name. Then it's Bella's turn to share legends with Edward, which is Wuthering Heights. She's not in love with the idea of getting married straight out of high school. Jacob forces himself on Bella, and even when she BREAKS HER HAND to get away from him, he still counts it as a victory. Charlie applauds his effort. Edward is furious that Jacob assaulted her, and that Bella is hurt because of it. Bella puts the pieces together about the murders and the person in her house: she's being tracked. She tells Alice right before graduation. I remember the graduation being longer when I read this when I was in high school; I probably saw graduation different than I do now. This reads VERY much like someone who has attended many, many of the same events, not at all like a teenager experiencing a major life event. At Bella's graduation party, Jacob shows up and still won't take no for an answer; however, the vampires and werewolves decide to work together to neutralize the threat. A lot of nothing happens. We find out Leah Clearwater is a wolf because #feminism! In the middle of it, Bella finally tries to seduce Edward into having sex with her. Edward's reason for rejecting her advances is that he wants to remain pure until marriage, since it's the only purity he has left. More nothing, posturing for the inevitable fight with the newborn vampires...and then the tent scene, where Edward and Jacob confess their feelings for Bella to each other and agree to share her? Or something.Then the big fight happens (mostly offscreen) and Edward shows down with Victoria, at long last. The Volturri guard show up to check in, Jacob was hurt offscreen, but everything is fine! Charlie is worried about losing Bella after a crazy day and Bella affirms that she's not going anywhere. Epilogue from Jacob's perspective, featuring the r-word and a lot of gay bashing. It's...just great.I really did think New Moon was as bad as it got, but I'm apparently wrong. Saying ""Twilight is bad because teenage girls like it"" is a shallow, bad statement that rejects all of the real harm contained in these books. With New Moon, much of it was internal only to Bella, but now, it's external influences, too. 1. Bella repeatedly refers to the six months she dealt with depression as ""when I went crazy."" That language is so harmful for so many reasons! But Bella calling herself crazy is not the fullest extent of her self deprication, oh no. She blames herself for hurting Jacob, for not being what Jacob wants, for not being a vampire yet, for being too human, for not being what Edward needs...the list goes on and on. My head hurt by the end of this because it's so realistic for a teenager, but Bella never gets through it. She just keeps going and everyone around her affirms her behavior and encourages it. She has such a complex about being a monster and hurting the people she loves because she cannot be what they want her to be. Bella agreeing to a wedding that everyone else wants for her. Bella, and everyone: you are enough by being who you are.2. The boys are such trash. Edward letting Bella see Jacob because he knows not letting her see him would make Bella sad. Jacob forcing Bella to kiss him twice. Edward and Jacob constantly using Bella as a pawn to out-maneuver the other. Edward's whole bit about purity, and Jacob offering himself to Bella to satisfy her sex drive. Jacob jockeying for Bella's affection, threatening to allow himself to be killed so she'll kiss him. Allegedly, Wuthering Heights is the inspiration but a. I don't care to read it and b. if said inspiration is anything like Romeo and Juliet in New Moon, I have no doubt it's been twisted.3. #feminism: Leah is LITERALLY called a ""bitter harpy"" by Jacob and repeatedly, we're told she is making pack life miserable because she's not over Sam. Bella, you can marry anyone you want, whenever you want. I'm so angry at this point in trying to get all my thoughts out that I can't put this to decent words. 4. Does SMeyer hate brown people? Jasper's story revolves around the ""uncivilized south"" which is just Mexico. (No other South American countries exist?) The CONSTANT referral to the Quileutes as dogs and mongrels. Replacing real tribal legends with your own whitewashed ones. The imprinting on literal children. Jacob, for some reason, can quote the BIBLE?! SMeyer guts the Quileute people as though they are a pumpkin and fills her own fantasy about them in, and Bella inserts herself from there. The violence done against Native people in this book is absolutely galling.I know there's more, but just trying to process all of this is infuriating.",3,-0.997,0.138,0.753,0.109,0.4990026744350053,NEGATIVE,0.7479

I really enjoyed the insight we got into Rosalie and Jasper during Eclipse, they've been really left out up until this point so it was nice for them to have their moment. First person narrative is tricky for me, it's either a hit or miss depending on the mains voice, and man is this voice annoying. I know I would have loved this series a whole lot more if it was written in third because being inside Bella's head is pretty depressing. It bugged me that up until she admitted her feelings for Jacob she didn't consider her family, or her friends in her life changing decision to become a vampire. It was like they mattered all of a sudden. She is written, towards the end, as a giver, she's giving everyone what they want to make them happy, which felt really out of character seen as she's the most self-centered person in the written universe. I was liking Jacob, I wanted a Jacob in my life, the cool best friend who always has your back, even if he is crushing.. But that's when things went to hell, the crush, the obsessive love and his desperate need to force Bella to admit her feelings for him. He wanted her to weigh up her options, yada ya, that's no bloody excuse to force yourself onto someone, that scene made me sick. I don't care if she was in denial, it was disgusting. Then the tacky 'kiss me like you mean it or I'm going to kill myself' move, like what the actual hell Jacob? I didn't even feel bad when he almost got his lame ass killed. Edward, what do you see in that chick? I liked that he is less possessive in Eclipse, he's learning to let the danger magnet be her own person. He's willing to compromise for her, he's willing to risk what he values the most, her life, to please her. I also really liked how much he laughed in this book, despite the hell they went through throughout. Bella on the other hand, I put it in my updates that I wished I'd counted how many times she cried during the book, jeez Louise that girl could fill a pond. I don't think a single one of these characters can be described as role-model material, in saying that the Twilight Saga was the first fandom I ever fell into, and years later it still has it's teeth in me, I don't think any amount of time will change that.

I also think this book is way too long and if you cut out about 200 pages the story would remain intact.My main issue with this book surrounds Bella. I really think she is so ungrateful and selfish in this book and her inability to be apart from Edward for 2 seconds (except when she is with Jacob which I will get into) is so infuriating. Like seriously Bella, you can't endure a graduation party that Alice put so much time and effort into for 1 night? Also, I really didn't really like when Bella begged and pleaded for Edward to fuck her. He made it clear literally in book 1 that he wants to remain chaste until marriage (and has spent 100+ years doing so) and yet Bella is like...but pleassse 👉👈🥺🥺. Sweetie no. If the genders were reversed, people would be in uproar over how manipulative that is but cause its Bella who is just so insecure and desperate it fine apparently....no. Also, while New Moon had me wavering between Team Edward and Team Jacob, Eclipse firmly planted me on the former. Jacob is so manipulative in this book and imo his and Bella's relationship is just so toxic. Not once did I believe that Bella was attracted to Jacob and Jacob's insistence that she will eventually change her mind really bothered me. No means no Jacob get over it. And THEN Meyer decides no you know what, Bella is in love with Jacob thus justifying Jacob's actions. Fuck right off. Jacob's absolute refusal to accept that Bella will never be with him and Bella's insatiable need to have him near (but only when Edward is out of the picture of course) does not make for a healthy relationship. Also, I thought the ""twist"" was so obvious and I literally could not believe that Bella of all people was the one to make the connection. This book made me really dislike both Bella and Jacob which I was very surprised about. I also don't like it when authors try and subtly reference classic books in their work as it always feels awkward and forced. In both New Moon and Eclipse it was so heavy handed and I actually think the reference to Cathy and Heathcliff's relationship in Wuthering Heights is more applicable to Jacob and Bella than Edward and Bella but it works either way.Overall,⭐⭐⭐OR🌘🌘🌘",4,-0.9958,0.185,0.745,0.07,0.5269652695789058,NEGATIVE,1.0

But I found myself not liking Bella at all in this book, which I think is strange since she is the heroine of the book.The book is fabulous of course, filled with classic lines (mainly from Jacob) like 'Dr Fang'. But I found myself a fence sitter on this book. New MoonNew Moon made me love Jacob and hate Edward cause he left. But then this book made me feel sorry for Edward and Jacob and I get annoyed with Bella. My reason? I think she is very selfish in this book. Jacob is going through his version of New Moon in Eclipse because he has lost Bella. After everything he does for her and she keeps him at arms length. Then when she knows that Jacob loves her, she still leads him on. Why. Because she likes who she is with him and she feels good around him. Edward has to sit back and watch as Bella more or less tries out both sides of the fence. (Yes, I am jealous!!)Edward is too controlling in this book and it irks me, assuming that Bella is completely helpless and incompetent, meanwhile she did fine when he LEFT!!I can't help but feel that Jacob is the obvious choice.I often wonder why Stephenie MeyerStephenie Meyer made Jacob so perfect and the obvious 'better option' if only to then not have Bella pick him. It doesn't shine a better light on Edward, in fact I find it highlights Edwards overbearings. Jacob's only flaw is that he is in love with Bella.But obviously Edward is everything to Bella and Jacob really never had a chance so you find yourself falling all over yourself to be with him. But I still love this book and I thank Mrs Meyer for the 'Tent Scene' cause it my fave scene of all time, made even better by the thought of Taylor Lautner squeezing all his muscles into a little sleeping bag with Bella. mmmmmmmmmm...

I thought if I read this I would have to read Breaking Dawn as well. Well I needed a ""romance"" for a winter challenge so I put both of them on order at the library.Breaking Dawn came available first and I started reading it - then the audio for Eclipse came available so I opted to listen instead of read (unusual for me in general)First...I didn't like the narrator. Particularly the way she voiced ""Edward"" and especially Alice - that high pitched wafting voice just really grated on me. But I don't think it interferred too much with ""the material"".So all in all I thought it was not bad. Better than New Dawn for sure but not nearly as good as Twilight. I do see quite the pattern here across the three books that annoy me. Which is first part of book a bunch of relationship, relationship, relationship...then toward the end we'll have some sort of ""conflict"" with ""outside forces"" then we wrap. Tada. -- Doesn't really work for me I usually like books with much more to the plot here the ""conflict"" seems tacked on just so there can be a conflict.I do think she does some decent ""dialog"" and is a good ""first person"" writer.

I care for the characters and their mistakes, annoyances and problems make them realistic, we all whine and complain and fall in and out of love, why should this be any different, besides it's the author's world and we are lucky enough that she shares it with us.The main plot of Bella being in danger takes a back seat through most of the chapters as the love triangle takes over. Somehow Jacob Black has made a little nest on the side of Bella's heart and she can't seem to shake it off, or maybe she doesn't want to. He was there for her when Edward left her ( for her own protection, which didn't work) and she knows that his energy, warmth and newly discovered abilities speak to her on many levels. Her mind has stopped wondering why she seems to fall for the monster types and accepts one of them for her partner, I can't say who because that sort of spoils the ending, but I had a wonderful time reading the whole shebang. Towards the end my mouth would sort of drop open and I would make small sounds, there are some crazy intense scenes that make this more than a bridge between middle and last book, there was danger, drama and the usual clumsy Bella stuff that sure, at times was a bit much, but hey, I can't see most teenage girls living this way and not being a bit batty.

You can't tell me that after reading it for the ""seven hundredth time"" you didn't notice the stupidity Eclipse possessed.

Would YOU be as headstrong and consistently annoying as Jacob was to get what he wanted, despite the fact that you knew you and your victim were certainly NOT meant to be?If you have any ounce of humanity in you, I'd assume that both of these answers are a no.
