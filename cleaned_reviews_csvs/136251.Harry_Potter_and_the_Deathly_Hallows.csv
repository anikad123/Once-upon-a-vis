I wish this series would go on forever!I don't know how I've gone through my life without these books. I regret not reading it when I was younger, but I am so happy that I finally did, better late than never, right?The world built in these books is so real and tangible, it is truly a masterpiece. The characters are engaging and brilliant, and I love how the plot is so interwoven and twisted within itself, especially in this last book.I was taken by surprise when I started the series, I didn't think it would pull me in as it did. As I kept reading through the books, the characters slyly stole my heart. Now, having finished the last line, I am flooded with emotion.

The final adventure, towards which we've been sailing for - through six amazing Hogwarts years - is here at last. And yet again, Rowling surpasses her own standards to bring us the most adventurous book of the entire series, to conclude everything is a most dramatic way. Twist after twist after twist is going to keep the reader immersed more than ever. Be warned: once started, you won't have a moment's rest till your finish this one!""Twelve Fail-Safe Ways to Charm Witches""It seems redundant now to repeat all the good things about Harry Potter books in general - from plot to writing style - which never reached a plateau, but kept on improving. All of that is still there. But setting up the atmosphere for events has reached a level that is far beyond anything we've seen before. And the complexity of the events has also been increased. Even the few sup-plots are highly detailed and complex, and contributes a lot to the main story. It gives a very fulfilling feeling, when the reader is allowed to connect all the dots as progressing towards the end, tying up a lot of loose ends. Also, it's unbelievable how well the plot twists are introduced - whether they are happy or sad - maintaining suspense better than ever.""permettez-moi to assister vous,""The reader is bound to encounter a lot of heartbreaking disappointments here, but all that help make the ending much more satisfying. I did miss the occasional humor, though it would not have complimented well the dark world we are in right now. Oh, and I'm really happy that I only had to hate Snape for a few days... (from finish of Half-blood prince till now) I guess that's the good thing about reading all the books of series at once: less anxiety!""Wit beyond measure is man's greatest treasure!""When I started Philosopher's Stone, it made me realize that I've been missing out on a lot - a world of magic which is full of amazing characters. Then the journey got ever so thrilling and entertaining, with each book outperforming the previous one in every possible way. It's been three magical weeks for me - literally and figuratively - from the starting of the first book till the last. I don't recall ever been immersed in a book series as much as I did with Harry Potter, and, though the ending was great, it's sad not being able to continue, to know that this is the end. I've watched the first few HP movies a long time ago, but those didn't come anywhere near the books in my opinion, and I really wasn't a fan. But now, I'm finally enlightened as to why Harry Potter series is much loved by millions. It's impossible not to, once you're through with the books! A well thought out foundation put in place in first three books, then setting stage for the core of the series in next two and finally, an incredibly thrilling ending with the last two books, while each book being a five-star read, at least for me. Harry Potter became the my all-time-favorite book series. ""Only the difference between truth and lies, courage and cowardice,""",512,0.9966,0.074,0.754,0.172,0.5794941169941171,POSITIVE,0.9996

10,1115588640,07/22/2017,1.0,"Hot take: I like A Very Potter Musical more than I like the Harry Potter series. Please feel free to physically fight me. (And no, “AVPM wouldn’t exist without the series” is not a valid argument, because duh.)https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...God, what an unexpected result this is. Let's talk about it for six pages. I loved Half-Blood Prince so much that I postponed finishing the series for five months. More context: I started rereading this series in December, I was done the sixth book in February, and I didn’t pick up the finale until July.I thought this book was going to destroy me!!!And, like, it almost did. But not in the oh-my-god-this-amazing-series-is-over-cry-cry-cry way I expected. More like I, too, divided my soul into horcruxes, and they, like Voldemort’s, were being taken out at an excruciatingly slow pace over the course of 784 pages. Just weakening infinitesimally and kind of being like, can you just get this over with already? But instead of, you know, my actual self being killed, it was my enthusiasm for this series and any appreciation I may have had for JK Rowling.Seriously, I feel like any love I had for a couple of the books in this series has been brutally, torturously, painstakingly extinguished.This book was a CHORE.Let’s talk about why (for an extraordinarily long time).(Like all of my Harry Potter reviews, this is nothin’ but spoilers.)PLOTYou saw those glorious GIFs. You know the concept for the first half of this book is Not Great.The storyline is already, like, What if we just sat around in the most depressing on Earth for a few hundred pages, jumping locations every day, having the same conversation repeatedly, and granting our readers in-depth analyses of the gross fish we’re eating? (Sorry, British people, but I think we can all agree that a freezing/damp moor is no tropical vacation.) (Also shoutout to the time when Harry, Ron and Hermione overheard other wizards saying “Accio salmon” in order to eat and were just like, That information’s going straight in the mental trash can.)But then on TOP of it, the pacing is so!! horrible!! Nothing happens, and then something will happen and take literally no effort by the golden gang. Like when a thing they need just SHOWS UP in a frozen pond. How exciting. So glad I waded through hundreds of pages of freezing moor bickering to get to this point.Also, the bickering is legitimately the same three conversations over and over and over and over.HAHAHAHA. I just remembered that the seventh book was divided into two movies. LITERALLY WHAT WENT DOWN IN THE FIRST MOVIE?? Hahahahaha. Oh man. I am just never going to watch those adaptations, probably.I’m almost grateful that this book was so bad. Because now I never have to be sad it’s over! I do so much better with anger.CHARACTERSLike every young woman with a semi-functional brain, I’m big into Hermione. Or I was, for the first five or six books, before she was completely ruined and it was like she was never goddamn helpful or smart in the first place.IN OTHER WORDS, WHY DID J.K. ROWLING DO HERMIONE LIKE THIS?In this book, Hermione totally ignores logic in order to: a) stare lustily after Ron (Ron! Can you believe it?? We’ll get to that), b) sustain the stupid arguments that keep cropping up between the supposedly-golden trio, c) also maintain the TOTALLY USELESS ROMP THROUGH THE BRITISH COUNTRYSIDE, and d) ignore the good ideas that are exclusively coming from Harry presumably just in order to extend the book.Which, speaking of, this book is just the goddamn Harry Potter show. He comes up with every single plan, everyone at Hogwarts defers to him like he’s Team Good's Voldemort, and the whole book he’s treated like this misunderstood genius, too smart for the world around him.WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MAGNIFICENT SIXTH-BOOK CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT FOR GOD’S SAKE.Ron also sucks. He is constantly complaining and picking fights. He offers exactly zero (0) good ideas throughout the book. Legitimately all he does is try to be funny AND NOT BE. I cannot believe the (usually) fab Hermione was handed off to him like some sort of prize for the biggest pumpkin at the state fair.The only character who got what they were owed in this book was Neville. Which, if I had to pick one character to get the best ending, that’s who it would be, BUT STILL. His perfection is no excuse. He’s barely even in the f*cking books. Impossible to mess up.And I missed Dumbledore soooo muuuuuch but then he showed up (in death or quasi-death - this book is stupid and we’ll get to it) AND TALKED TO HARRY FOR EIGHT HOURS AND IT DIDN’T FEEL LIKE HIM ONCE. It was just sh*tty writing and plot exposition and explanation. How DARE you use Dumbledore as a plot point.Wow, I am especially bitter today.ROMANCEEVERY SINGLE ENDGAME ROMANCE IN THIS WHOLE SERIES IS THROWN TOGETHER AND BAD. I will go through each and explain this.Harry and Ginny: Ginny is so cool in the sixth book. So cool that I took back all of the Ginny-sh*t talking I did for approximately four years. I was even open to the concept of Harry/Ginny (even their ship name must be awful, no? Hinny? OH MY GOD I AM PRAYING IT’S “Garry”) just based off of Ginny’s apparent greatness. BUT NO IT’S JUST BAD. Harry spends a significant chunk of this already-boring book moping about Ginny. And it couldn’t be less cute. It’s just I miss Ginnyyyyyyyyy overandoverandoverandover without any mention of like, who she is. Or what their relationship is like. OR ANYTHING. It’s just J.K. Rowling being like, Oh, Harry would probably miss Ginny. Here’s a substance-less reminder.Ron and Hermione: like...areyoukiddingme. Not even Joanne and her terrible Twitter account are pro-Ronmione. They could NOT be less compatible. They are not fun together at all. My last words will be WHY NOT HERMIONE AND FRED. (I will scream them, which will be very startling to the loved ones who may be gathered around my hospital bed.) And no, Joanne, Harry and Hermione are not the correct answer. SERIOUSLY HOW IS HER TWITTER ACCOUNT THIS BAD. HOW DOES SHE HAVE SO MANY REGRETS ABOUT THE DUMB CHILDREN’S SERIES SHE WROTE 15 YEARS AGO.Lupin and Tonks: I don’t...I don’t even...when do they interact? When did this happen? How am I supposed to even support this? Isn’t Lupin a million years old? A shabby sloppy old were-man? Isn’t Tonks a young hottie? Also, literally how f*cked up is it that everyone thinks Tonks is like mourning and blaming herself when actually she’s all, “Why won’t Lupin loooooooove me.” Dumb.Lily and James: This one makes literally NO sense. Just because your BFF calls you a racial slur doesn’t mean you have to f*ck and then marry his bully. James sucks. Just because Snape somehow sucks even harder doesn’t mean that James’s dreamy green eyes override his TENDENCY TO BE THE WORST PERSON IN THE MAPPED UNIVERSE. (Second-worst.)Are there any more? Actually, scratch that. If there are more I do not want to recall.WHERE IS THE GODDAMN LOGIC. SOMEONE FIND IT AND HAND IT BACK TO JOANNEOne, don’t just KILL CHARACTERS TO TRY TO MAKE YOUR BOOK SEEM SAD AND POWERFUL. A good writing strategy is definitively not, “Oh, guess what, the stakes are high. How do you know? Um, I’ll just...kill these 14 people. Who matter a lot to you nerds I guess. How crazy, it’s almost like I’ve emotionally manipulated you into building a devotion to these works of fiction for the entirety of your child and made a literal billion dollars off it! But this book has already been super boring? No time to mourn!!! Sorry! Whatever, bye!”You can literally watch my progression into convincing myself that J.K. Rowling is a full-on real-life witch over the course of this review. And not a Hermione type of witch. A Wizard of Oz Wicked-of-the-West witch. A Salem witch trials witch. But CAN YOU BLAME ME. She’s a billionaire with nothing better to do than tweet about the project she keeps pretending she can move past!!! But she can’t!!! Because she keeps writing stuff! Is a billion dollars not enough? Can you release your stupid 90-page ebooks for not-money??? I am FURIOUS. And also sleep-deprived.But back to the stupid stuff. Well, the other stupid stuff.The sh*t that goes down in this book makes literally no sense at all. Dumbledore even says, “You and Voldemort have traveled into realms of magic hitherto unknown and untested,” which is really Joanne saying, “I have really f*cked up this time. Wow, I have no clue how this makes even a magical sense of logic of my own creation. Um, what if...can I just not explain it?”Here’s one example of how dumb this is. Voldemort survives death continuously because there’s a piece of him in Harry, which supposedly “dies” when Harry dies. This is somehow the only part of Harry that isn’t, like, resurrected, but whatever. There is then in turn a piece of Harry (or Lily’s protection force-field thingy) within Voldemort, which is what keeps Harry alive. SO WHEN VOLDEMORT DIES, HOW DOES HARRY SURVIVE???? THIS MAKES NO SENSE NO SENSE AT ALL AND YES I REALIZE I’M THE TECHNICAL-ADULT TRYING TO READ LOGIC INTO WIZARD-DEATH BUT IF JOANNE, WHO IS A MILLION YEARS OLD, IS ALLOWED TO STAY IN THIS WORLD FOREVER THEN I’M ALLOWED TO DO THIS.Fair is fair.SNAPEI am barely controlling the section of my Harry Potter-related fury that is dedicated toward the pond monster/anthropomorphized dumpster/human Port-a-Potty/damp sock that is called Severus Snape. (It actually makes up 84.6% of my Potter-anger, so you ain’t seen nothing yet.)All I will say is that there is a Snape rant coming, but I am almost frightened to write it. I think when I start typing I may transform into some sort of anger-monster. In four stages. Duh. Like the cover of an Animorphs book.I’m going to go drown my sorrows in A Very Potter Musical now.Bottom line: The number one item on my bucket list is “get in an Internet fight with J.K. Rowling.” AVERAGE SERIES RATING: 3.57 starsQUESTION: Should I read Harry Potter and the Cursed Child???-------------------------whoops, my hand must have slipped. either that or this book was garbàge.regardless, i'll never admit to being wrong. ever. in my life. i am always correct and perfect and infallible. that's actually in the fine print of the contract you agree to when sending me a friend request.

I can't believe how that book fit everything we're all been asking about since the very early beginning ,and some of the facts that anyone wondered about like How the trace dedicate the underage magic, Why we can't just create food from thin air, or why there was a Taboo on saying ""Voldemort""'s name..and so more.It dive deeply into the past of important characters we thought we know enough , Dumbledore and Snape.From the beginning you see a wrapping up for the characters,the places -like Private Drive- and the events.. you'll see a lines that connected to the very early of the series and book one..you'll be in a journey toward the ending without feeling disconnected from the whole previous events and characters.There's no something you'll feel-if u pay enough attention - out of place ,out of the plot or out of the characters .The Characters **************Was so glad that J.K.Rowling announce that there's no ""new"" character presented in the last books which was perfect since it's the end of the series and it's better to focus on our beloved characters and the ones we lived wit them for years.The characters deals here with the ""real responsibilities"" that comes with the coming of age. or the quest they asked for and they have to do for their good and greater goodThere were no any ""Exaggeration"" or over acting, the characters go normally ,naturally and very real, The writer chose to describe even the smallest feelings they feel in some important situations like for example Harry's final visit to the Dark Forest, or the boredom of the days on the run from place to place.And won't forget the wrapping up of Every character sometimes with surprises which is never out of character.She was always have it all planned and well drawn   The Message ***********I have to admit at my second reading I find an extraordinary spiritual amazing messageIt starts with the 2 quotations one is pagan, and one is from a Christian tradition.. one about the Death and one about Friends..and it fit perfectly to the theme of the book,and the message of Love that can beat any other force.I saw also a symbol in the Dumbledore's character and the whole Harry -Dumbledore's relation, complicated symbol of Faith, religion and religious people. in many ways that you have to look carefully to dedicate it.ِِAnd look at the final fight between Harry and Voldemort ..I was like..My God you're the best writer EVER
“You’re right. But before you try to kill me, I’d advise you to think about what you’ve done. . . . Think, and try for some remorse, Riddle. . . .” “What is this?” Of all the things that Harry had said to him, beyond any revelation or taunt, nothing had shocked Voldemort like this. Harry saw his pupils contract to thin slits, saw the skin around his eyes whiten. “It’s your one last chance,” said Harry, “it’s all you’ve got left. . . . I’ve seen what you’ll be otherwise. . . . Be a man . . . try . . . Try for some remorse. . . .”  It's not just normal fight between Good and Evil , It's amazing written novel.Can't seriously describe all of what I want to say about this series Just one thing I can admit,It's my wonderful journey, It's my friends, It's the books that made me- trying to be- a better person. It's where I meet my friends.. It's where I truly Laugh while reading/living the story..It's where I cry with characters and feel sorry for some. It's magic..It's real magic cause It's words of Love So glad to finish it at 2nd May, And so strange I didn't feel I'm going to miss the Harry Potter books although I finished it before in Arabic, and that was the ending of my experience with it in English, But deep inside me is sure I'll go back to Hogwarts again ,re-reading from one to seven soon ISA.Before I finish I have to share this great man's word..Who really was the best transforming a paper character to a real life Thank you Joanna Rowling.

I liked that.but the newspaper articles about the backstory was boring. & the part before the main story begins, & the camping-no-clues part, without anything interesting (or useful) happens were slow.This is the most emotional book in HP series; from the beginning. maybe the most crying book of my whole life:I cried at first, 25%, in the middle, later in the middle, in 75% & many times toward the end:(view spoiler)[Hedwig's death, Kreacher's tale & Regulus' bravery & kindness & acts trying to make his mistake right (why if my fav character is not the main hero, they ended up already dead?!😭 James & Regulus), the scene of James & Lily's death was very emotional, especially at the end when little Harry found out something was wrong, Luna's room, even cried (a bit tho) for wormtail, Dobby's death, many Deaths in the battle of Hogwarts😭 the Forest again; how he felt about Life when it was going to an end, his courage to face the his destiny... & Always (I liked Snape just because he made hard times for Harry.

(better than my imagination; also Harry's voice is exactly the voice I always heard in my head reading the books.)I love this book!I think in my 7th read, I cried even more over my most crying book.(I mean, I cried all over the 'forest again' chapter & the last sentences made me completely burst into tears.)don't worry, it has fun times too.the ending was brilliant! mysteries solved!

To you, yes you, reader of this review
, should you decide to read this review from beginning up to the very end, I offer you my deep thanks for your resilience, bravery and loyalty for this may be one of the longest reviews you’ll ever read on Goodreads. You still have time to back out though, so don’t tell me you haven’t been warned.^^
To J.K. Rowling, 
there is no argument about your brilliance. You are a certified genius, a person with superhuman writing ability and imagination and I can’t praise you enough for writing these books that have forever changed my life. But you’re still human and surely you’ve recognized your flaws. One of which is your penchant for killing your characters. You can’t blame me for thinking that one of the reasons you created so many great and memorable characters is for you to be able to kill as many of them as you want to. I accept though with the heaviest heart that certain characters needed to die, needed to sacrifice their lives for the greater good but I find no good reason for the death of (view spoiler)[Fred! (hide spoiler)]. Why? Why kill him? Haven’t you killed enough already? Why did he even have to die?! Why not Percy instead? (kidding). I honestly think no Weasley should have died for obvious reasons I don’t think I still have to enumerate. Also, I honestly believe the last book lacks at least 200 more pages. Why jump to 19 years later epilogue right after the devastating war? Don’t the rest of the other characters deserve a few pages about them? A simple tribute perhaps to all their sacrifice and pain and loss? I have gone so far, have read hundreds and hundreds of pages from book one only to be spared of better resolutions before an epilogue. Also, don’t you think (view spoiler)[Professor Severus Snape (hide spoiler)] deserved a better, more respectful way to die? And whatever happened to (view spoiler)[Professor Moody’s (hide spoiler)]body? So you see, even though I admire you with 99.72 percent of my heart, .28 percent percent is resenting your choices. But thank you. Now my heart is tougher and braver. Characters in the next books I read could all die and I probably wouldn’t shed a tear. I just wish I read your books before Allegiant and Mockingjay. I probably would have considered those happy endings. 
To Harry Potter
, I will never forget your brave and pure heart. You showed me that heroes can be an average boy with no special superpowers except courage, trustworthy instincts and strength of will, oh and of course, a bunch of awesome wizards and witches supporting and protecting him the best way they can.  
To Hermione Granger 
, you are the most kick-ass heroine I’ve ever met without needing to actually kick ass. You only needed your intellect, level headedness and kind heart and like Ron said, without you and your beaded bag, he and Harry would not have survived a day during your quest. 
To Ron Weasley
, you probably are the biggest idiot in the story but you showed the best of you in times you are needed the most. I admire your loyalty, sarcasm and free spirit and there is no better man for Hermione than you.  
To Fred and George
, when in tears, I could always count on you guys for a good laugh. It's no fun without you. (view spoiler)[George, it’s hard enough losing a part of your body but to have to lose your twin brother too. Oh Gaaaaawd! *wails*  (hide spoiler)] 
To Hagrid (and Graupy) 
, *hugs* I’ll never forget your gallons of tears and rock cakes! Thank you for your loyalty, friendship and bravery. You will be remembered for generations.  
To Professor Snape,
you are indeed the bravest of them all. Your sacrifice is utterly selfless and certainly the biggest of all. Your memories Harry and I saw in Dumbledore’s Pensieve ripped my heart to pieces and I spent days and nights crying for you. You're a true hero and you deserve a monument. Maybe I'll name my son after you. *wails* 
To Professor Dumbledore
, you are the true epitome of sacrifice, love and humility. You find something good in every person and you never fail to offer kindness even to those others deem undeserving. 
To Dumbledore’s Army led by Neville, Luna, Ginny,
, you guys are awesome! 
To the Order of the Phoenix,
 you were amazing especially you Mrs. Weasley! I’m so sorry for your losses but thank you, thank you so much. 
To the Hogwarts Professors led by Prof. Mc Gonagall
, you did an amazing job holding off Voldy! You were all brilliant! 
To the Malfoys,
uh I don’t know. How about I just stick my tongue out at the lot of you! 
To Dobby, 
 *wails* I can’t…just thank you so much. You’re the most loyal elf. The bravest free elf I know. 
To Kreacher,
 you poor thing. I had no idea what you had to go through and what made you the way you are. In the end, thank you for your bravery and for leading the elves to the battle. 
To the Death Eaters and Snatchers led by Bellatrix and Greyback
, I have two words foryou. “AVADA KEDAVRA!” 
To Umbridge,
 off to Azkaban, you go!  
To Voldemort
, that’s right, I dare! I am completely with Harry, You don’t learn from your mistakes, Riddle, do you? 
To the rest of the fallen,
 (view spoiler)[Professor Moody, Cedrick, Sirius, Remus, Tonks, James and Lily, Colleen Creevey and many others (hide spoiler)], like Neville said, your death was not in vain. Thank you! *wails* 
To the movie makers and actors
, thank you for bringing to life the characters we love. We will always look up to you people. Don't you dare disappoint us!^^
To my Goodreads friends who bullied me into reading Harry Potter,
 thank you for destroying my life! I was doing perfectly fine without these books. You wrecked me pretty bad especially when I was reading the last book. I felt like hundreds of Dementors were surrounding me while reading it that I had to constantly cast a Patronus Charm while reading. It was really exhausting. My Patronus is a baby elephant, btw! Oh and I'm House Gryffindor, hurray! I'm afraid, I'm becoming worse than Luna Lovegood.

'Do not Pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and above all, those who live without love.'
it still feels weird to me me for finishing this series. I mean, I had read this series since August and I feel really ... weird. I feel like I just bought the first book yesterday instead of months ago. I feel like I just read the first book yesterday instead of months ago. Months ago, I thought I would feel okay when I finished this series but I do not feel that way. I feel ... like empty or hollow on the inside, you know what I mean, right? like there is this sad feeling and you just want to read it forever and ever but you can't because the story is over and there is nothing you can do. the only thing you can do is hugging the book because that way you would feel much better, like you actually hug the main characters.maybe this is how it feels like when you have to say goodbye to your best friends who have always be with you. no matter how difficult the situation is but they are there. I always envy those people who grew up with Harry Potter series. I envy them because they have such incredible childhood and me, I was a muggle that time and I used to hate reading novels so much and I had never once thought that I would love reading novels as much as I love breathing. Harry Potter series also has a great impact in my life. I was the kind of girl who always shy and never be myself because before reading HP I wanted people to like me, so I became what they wanted me to be and I rarely stood up for myself even when I knew I was right but Harry Potter series has changed me. you guys do know Luna, don't you? many people called her "" Loony "" because she believed in many things but Luna didn't care what they called her, she kept being herself and she had never ashamed to show her true self and that was the time I realized I was such a stupid girl who let my so-called friends changed me to be the girl I didn't even want me to be and now, my friends often say that I am such a weirdo or crazy girl who is very different from them because I love reading books so much and you know what? I just don't care about them anymore. I don't care when they say about me such a weirdo because I am not ashamed of being myself anymore because this is who I am and Luna also taught me one more thing, when you are being yourself and everyone teases you because of it. don't you ever worry about it because your true friends will come to you. these friends will accept who you are. Just like Luna who has amazing friends, Harry Ron, Ginny, Hermione and Neville.like I told you, I used to be very shy that I never stood up for even myself. few weeks ago, my friend who always insulted me, she insulted me again and no one in class was brave enough to stand up for themselves. the next thing I knew was that I snapped back at her and she was shocked and she has never insulted me again since that accident and she is kind of nice to me and we're friends now.This series has changed me to be a braver person. I don't think I can say this is a review because it's all about me and one more thing,,(view spoiler)[ I will never ever forget 2nd May 1998. I lost so many great friends Remus, Tonks, Colin, Fred, Sirius and many more.   (hide spoiler)]I really want to say many thank you to Mrs. J. K. Rowling who wrote this awesome series because this series has changed me to be a better person and this series also changed me to be so much braver person. Thank you very much, Mrs. J. K.

(Victoire, who was snogging Teddy — Lupin and Tonks’ son — is Bill and Fleur’s eldest.)Harry, Ron and HermioneWe know that Harry marries Ginny and has three kids, essentially, as Rowling explains, creating the family and the peace and calm he never had as a child.As for his occupation, Harry, along with Ron, is working at the Auror Department at the Ministry of Magic. After all these years, Harry is now the department head.“Harry and Ron utterly revolutionized the Auror Department,” Rowling said. “They are now the experts. It doesn’t matter how old they are or what else they’ve done.”Meanwhile, Hermione, Ron’s wife, is “pretty high up” in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, despite laughing at the idea of becoming a lawyer in “Deathly Hallows.”“I would imagine that her brainpower and her knowledge of how the Dark Arts operate would really give her a sound grounding,” Rowling said.Harry, Ron and Hermione don’t join the same Ministry of Magic they had been at odds with for years; they revolutionize it and the ministry evolves into a “really good place to be.”“They made a new world,” Rowling said.The wizarding naturalistLuna Lovegood, the eccentric Ravenclaw who was fascinated with Crumple-Horned Snorkacks and Umgubular Slashkilters, continues to march to the beat of her own drum.“I think that Luna is now traveling the world looking for various mad creatures,” Rowling said. “She’s a naturalist, whatever the wizarding equivalent of that is.”Luna comes to see the truth about her father, eventually acknowledging there are some creatures that don’t exist.“But I do think that she’s so open-minded and just an incredible person that she probably would be uncovering things that no one’s ever seen before,” Rowling said.Luna and Neville Longbottom?It’s possible Luna has also found love with another member of the D.A.When she was first asked about the possibility of Luna hooking up with Neville Longbottom several years ago, Rowling’s response was “Definitely not.” But as time passed and she watched her characters mature, Rowling started to “feel a bit of a pull” between the unlikely pair.Ultimately, Rowling left the question of their relationship open at the end of the book because doing otherwise “felt too neat.”Mr. and Mrs. Longbottom: “The damage is done.”There is no chance, however, that Neville’s parents, who were tortured into madness by Bellatrix Lestrange, ever left St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies.“I know people really wanted some hope for that, and I can quite see why because, in a way, what happens to Neville’s parents is even worse than what happened to Harry’s parents,” Rowling said. “The damage that is done, in some cases with very dark magic, is done permanently.”Rowling said Neville finds happiness in his grandmother’s acceptance of him as a gifted wizard and as the new herbology professor at Hogwarts.The fate of HogwartsNineteen years after the Battle of Hogwarts, the school for witchcraft and wizardry is led by an entirely new headmaster (“McGonagall was really getting on a bit”) as well as a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. That position is now as safe as the other teaching posts at Hogwarts, since Voldemort’s death broke the jinx that kept a Defense Against the Dark Arts professor from remaining for more than a year.While Rowling didn’t clarify whether Harry, Ron and Hermione ever return to school to finish their seventh year, she did say she could see Harry popping up every now and again to give the “odd talk” on Defense Against the D",128,0.8637,0.055,0.867,0.078,0.5417267009719838,POSITIVE,0.9979

NON-BINARY PEOPLE ARE NON-BINARY.Harry Potter changed my life and the memories I have associated with it can never be changed or tarnished no matter what its creator says or does. Her comments have caused me so much pain and disappointment and even if one day she realises how ignorant and hateful she has been it is now too late to amend the harm she has caused. Nevertheless, like Daniel Radcliffe said, the relationship between a reader and a book is sacred and nothing can change that. Harry Potter is no longer hers and I will continue loving and cherishing this world and these characters forever (and yes, I will be re-reading the series and watching the movies time and time again during my lifetime). However, I can no longer support her or her future work. Rowling is TRANSPHOBIC and supporting her in any way, shape or form supports her views and harms trans people and the LGBTQ+ community profoundly. I cannot take back the money I have given her already, but I can choose to never again spend money that will go directly in her pockets. I want to use this space to encourage everyone to support trans authors and read more literature featuring trans characters. This page is a good place to start.Please consider donating to a trans charity of your choice (MermaidsUK could be a place to start, because they have been directly attacked by Rowling) and click here to find about more trans organisations in the UK and what you can do to help.

Let’s all actively work together to make this fandom inclusive to everyone and show trans people especially that we are a loving community who would never question their identity or experience. PS.

I started the Harry Potter audio books at the end of August 2016. It took me a little over 4 months to listen to them all (I fit a few others in-between) but I’m so happy I finally finished. If you haven’t read them before, or you’re a long time fan looking for a re-read I can’t recommend the audio books enough. Jim Dale does a fantastic job with the narration. I can see myself going back one day and listening to them all over again! Now to the final book of the series: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. The book begins with Harry, Ron and Hermione on the run doing the task that Dumbledore gave Harry. To be honest, the first part of the book (and by first part, I mean the first 70-80% or so) was a little slow for me. There were exciting things to pop up here and there, but a lot of it was slow. Then the last few hours of the audiobook happened. I’ve gotta say, once this trio got back to Hogwarts, the ending was epic. There were moments of sorrow, moments that made me laugh, smile, cry… it was very emotional (view spoiler)[GAWD that Snape scene.… I can’t even! It made me cry like a baby. And love a character I didn’t care for much! (hide spoiler)]. I’m pleased with the way it ended. Overall, this series has been fantastic for me. I’m so glad I finally made the time to read them all.

“Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and, above all those who live without love.” 
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows literally touched the deepest part of my heart. This book has many layers and each one was refined by the smartest author I've ever known. J.K. Rowling always has a plan, she never threw anything into her books without thinking it first. In this case, I think she planned the ending of this book since she started writing for sure, and every point she emphasized in HP 7 was unfaltering and made me believe that it's a pure diamond when she ended her story with an epic score.
“Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?” 
Harry, Ron and Hermione prove themselves that they're just ordinary humans. They bicker. They argue each other. They make the sly plan. Importantly, they get to know how to forgive and forget, that's all that matters.
“We're all human, aren't we? Every human life is worth the same, and worth saving.”
This book is EVERYTHING. It became much more than just a fiction for me. It had its voice and when it whispered in my ears, I literally believed that there was magic in this world. Each chapter made me strong and wanted to be someone better. Each character epitomized a different kind of person. This book doesn't deserve five stars review, it's beyond measure and a thousand stars are not even enough.
Albus Severus,"" Harry said quietly, so that nobody but Ginny could hear, and she was tactful enough to pretend to be waving to Rose, who was now on the train, ""you were named for two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever knew.”

Even though the book is slow burn, I didn’t mind as long as I already know where it goes. It might be my fourth time read and I’m so sure it won’t be last! So many people may think why we connect with HP books so deeply? My answer is it awakens different feelings that change at each people. For me: it brings out so many complex feelings: an emotional trip in memory lane that reminds of my excitement at each time I start a new book of the series. Hope, sadness, fear always blended. Seeing my favorite characters’ growing up, making mistakes, choosing their paths and evolving are the best things I’ve witnessed! The entire final book focuses on Harry’s teaming up with his friends- more like family- Ron and Hermione to finish the task Dumbledore gave them. The ending of the book gives us the epic final that has been promised from the beginning. Its big screen adaptation truly reflected the terror, emotional breakdowns, excitement of the conclusion even though making two additional movies from one book was not the best idea! Prisoner of Azkaban is gonna be my favorite book of the series( the author’s significant walk to the dark side and Harry’s big discovery about his godfather) but it was still great to have fourth tango with the final book of the series! I think it’s time for me head out Universal Studios to visit Hogswart and have a thrill ride for showing my tribute to this strongest installment of the century! Let’s see my favorite quotes;“It is the quality of one’s convictions that determines success, not the number of followers."" —Remus Lupin“No, Harry, you listen,' said Hermione. 'We're coming with you. That was decided months ago — years, really.'""“Words are, in my not-so-humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic. Capable of both inflicting injury, and remedying it."" ― Albus Dumbledore“It is a curious thing, Harry, but perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it.

I bought it at a midnight release party, devoured it, and knew that I loved it.But now that I've spent the last couple of weeks reading it aloud to my son, I understand why I loved it so much. Does anyone fully appreciate the scope of what Rowling did with this book? She spent years upon years, and six other books building a world and populating it with characters, and then she BROUGHT IT AND THEM ALL TOGETHER. Spells, tools, people, events, that had been sprinkled throughout the other six books were now smoothly woven together into this last great battle. And yes, they spend a lot of time camping, but as Harry says to Ron, ""Did you think we'd be finding a Horcrux a day?"" No, I didn't, or at least I hoped that they wouldn't, because that would have been too pat, too unrealistic. Instead, they had to search, they had to learn, they had to struggle, and be bored, and be lost, and then find what they needed. The Ron-Harry-Hermione friendship is tested, and found to be unbreakable. Ron and Hermione's relationship moves forward, Harry has time to reflect on his life, the people who have helped him, what his future might hold.And I loved it. I loved the moments of solemn reflection. I loved the testing of loyalties, revelations about the youth of Dumbledore and Snape (and if you don't bawl like a baby reading about Snape's memories, YOU HAVE NO SOUL!), Lily and even Petunia. There are no throwaway characters in Rowling's world, yet it isn't just some endless catalogue of: And Dean did this, and Neville did this . . . Everything is part of one whole, beautiful story. The Weasleys continue to show their strength and love for Harry (and if you don't cry when Percy shows up, or when Fred . . . you know . . . YOU HAVE NO SOUL!), Neville proves that he is his parents' son, and a true Gryffindor . . . and in short, there are so many stand up and cheer moments that I couldn't sit still while I was reading it. Of course, there are many, many tragedies, but after each tragedy, a moment of triumph to balance it, for which I say:Thank you, J. K. Rowling, for creating one of the best, most magical series for children of all time. Thank you for giving us Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred and George, Ginny and Luna, and so many wonderful moments.And thank you, most of all, for not screwing up the grand finale.Best. Series ender.

It was still unknown except to a vast population of younglings who'd read it... and I fell in love. Oh, how I fell in love. I fell in love with the poor, starved-for-affection, later known to be a twit Harry. I fell in love with the pretentious know-it-all Hermione. I fell in love with the awkward, grew-up-in-his-brother's-shadows Ron... and most of all? I fell in love with the snarky, unplatable, snarling, rude, hygienically-disinclined professor of potions, Severus Snape.Almost ten years later, I'm still obsessed with it in many ways. This is the Seventh Book. This is the end of Harry Potter. I cried, I wept, I laughed, sometimes quite hysterically. And overall? I loved it. I loved Ron's humour, Harry's angst, Hermione's smarts, Snape's devotion, Dumbledore's love, Percy's return, Dobby's sacrifice, the change of Kreacher, absolutely everything. I kept waiting and waiting to be disappointed and yes, I was disappointed on the occasion, but the thrill far outweighed the flaws. As for Snape? One of the characters I fell absolutely in love with? THIS IS A HUGE SPOILER.Snape..................Snape dies. He dies working for Dumbledore. He dies, looking into Harry's eyes. He dies because for the last thirty years of his life, he has loved Lily Evans and everything he has done and everything he sacrificed was for her. His death provoked a number of emotions in me and one of the major ones was utter, utter grief. He's been abused and used his whole life, whether by his parents, by his classmates, by Voldemort, by Dumbledore, and I felt such freaking anger that in the end, he wasn't even given the proper funeral that he totally deserved. In the book itself, it made sense, because whatever Snape did for the Greater Good, he was still a bastard. But as a reader, my heart broke into ittybitty pieces over him. There were tons of other things going on at the same time. I say, Rowling is an excellent action scene writer. I'm terrible at writing action that's vivid and engaging, but she managed to do it. Harry himself lives. But he's been forever scarred by his experience. And that, actually, is one of the best parts of his book. He was such an arse in books 5 and 6, and to have this mature young man emerge was one of the greatest joys in this series. I was so, so, so happy that he got the happiness he wanted. The ending was much WTF? for me, since it was like a SOOPER HAPPILY EVER AFTER ending, but at the same time... Harry is finally happy and that means a great deal to me. Well. Harry, I've been a fan for almost ten years and in those ten years, you've made me laugh, cry, scream, whoop, run around, obsess, tender, hard, awesome and about a million other things. I've watched you grow from a scared, unsure first year into a hopeful young man in the third and fourth, an angsty teen in the fifth and sixth, and in the seventh? You came full circle and you were as your parents were. Happy, with children of your own. You changed so much and it felt like I had grown up partly with you, though I was but fourteen years old when I read you. I love all of the characters, I love all the books, and well? R.I.P. Severus Snape. You'll be missed. Same with you, Fred, Dobby, Lupin, Tonks, Moody, Colin, Scrimgoeur, Bellatrix, Peter, yes, even Voldemort.

Book Review

 4+ out of 5 stars to Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the seventh and supposedly final book in 2007 by J.K. Rowling. But then ""Cursed Child"" came out last year... so is a series really over? Not in our hearts and minds, my friends... neither shall this one be... and although I considered spending a huge part of today drafting a very thorough review of Harry Potter, my instincts kicked in and told me not to do so... instead, let's meet up and talk about it somewhere if you want to get into the details. I literally don't have the ability to write everything I am thinking about when it comes to these books... and I wrote my first novel in less than 3 months with not a stitch of writer's block.Sometimes things just flow out of your creativity and into the world's waiting and willing hands. And that's exactly what's happened with the HP book series. It's the kind of book where you can read it at any age and feel a deep connection. You can re-read it and watch the movie all in the same day and never be bored or feel the need to do anything else. When HP movies are running on TV back-to-back over a weekend, I always catch a few of them.These characters are wonderful. The plot is just brilliant. And in this last book, when all the surprises burst from within our own little goblet of fire, we find true nirvana in a set of books unlike any other. From drama to shock, sadness to beauty, Deathly Hallows re-invents the construct of an emotional roller-coaster. Whether you read the whole series or just picked up the last one, you feel the power inside the text... especially when you consider it all started with an innocent and scared little boy who lived under the stairs at 4 Privet Drive.We are all Harry Potter at one point in our lives or during the course of his life. Could be when you were a child searching for someone to love you, or it may be now as an adult looking back on the differences you faced in the eyes of good versus evil. Whatever the connection is, you'll feel it until you are no more... and while this may seem like an exaggeration or a rather ethereal point of view... one thing I know is true:We all make the exact same face when we hear or think of anything to do with his amazing story: there's a brief pause, our lips curl, our eyes roll back a little as we shut out lids, our breath thins out towards the back of our throat, and our hearts all decide it's OK to stop beating for just that 1 second. And in our collective sigh of ""I love Harry Potter"" exclamations, we are all for once, connected by a shared intense feeling that might be strong enough to fuel the world's future.

And it is needless to say that now this series holds 1st position in my list. I haven't read a series/book which explains literally everything. Imaginative to be exact.  OVERVIEW Now harry wants to destroy all the Horcruxes to kill Voldemort completely.  RANDOM THOUGHTS=> It was a big shock for me that Harry was also one the horcruxes. And this fact was also mouth-dropping that Dumbledore was preparing Harry for death by the hands of Voldemort. Umm... it's understandable. It has to be done to kill the Voldemort completely. But I didn't feel good. It was good that Harry didn't die. And Mrs. Rowling handled this fact reasonably.=> The Tale of Three Brothers was interesting.=> Action scenes were pretty vivid. I still remember them.=> I was expecting that Nagini would be killed by Harry but not. It's okay by the way.=> Epilogue seemed to me J. K. Rowling had in mind that sometime later she would again start this series.
 BEST BOOK OF THE SERIES
I enjoyed them almost equally. There is very, very minor difference in my liking:1. Prisoner of Azkaban2. Goblet of Fire3. Deathly Hallows4. Half-Blood Prince5. Chamber of Secrets6. Sorcerer's Stone7. Order of PhoenixI just wanted to do this. But in short I adore every book of this series.So that's it! I have finished this series. I am happy. For now I don't have plans, at all, to re-read books because I think there is a very little time and there are sooo many books I want to read very much. But IF I ever will plan to re-read books, then this series, for sure, and Artemis Fowl series will be the one which I will choose to read.Both are unique in their own accord. I wanted to do the comparison but it's useless. I always end up liking both equally. 1st position is given to HP because of J. K.

40,2175622,06/20/2007,5.0,"Was this book so awesome because it finally addressed all those long unanswered questions?  Yes.  Was this book just fantastic because we finally know what happens to everyone?  Yes.  Was this book wonderful because Rowling was ruthless and took no prisoners?  Yes.  Was this book splendid because we knew all the characters and cared about them like they were real?  Yes.  Was this book so great because it made you laugh, cry, gasp, emote out loud?  Yes.  That was one of my favorite things about the book.  Regardless of where I was, whether it be sitting on the couch next to my roommate, alone in my room, or standing in my shop, I found myself cheering and gasping and all other sorts of reactions, I was just that into the story.The most emotional part for me, one of them at least, was when Dobby died.  I don't know what it was about that, but I was sobbing and had tears streaming down my face.  When they describe putting the socks on his feet, that was the part that opened the floodgates.  I am one of those people that supports the theory that socks are a very imporant symbol in the Harry Potter series.  I even did a report in one of my high school English classes on it.  ""Ron sat on the edge of the grave and stripped off his shoes and socks, which he placed upon the elf's bare feet.  Dean produced a woolen hat, which Harry placed carefully upon Dobby's head, muffling his batlike ears.""  Rowling, master of subtle detail, still includes that brief mention of socks.  It was that which really did me in.Another thing that impressed me was how well the story flowed.  Probably a combination of being a good writer and knowing, without a doubt, where the story was going and what she wanted to have happen allowed Rowling to keep the story smooth and not jerky.  So easily, especially in the beginning/middle chapters in Harry, Ron, and Hermione's search for Horcruxes things could have become so choppy.  And while time did pass quickly in brief sections it still flowed.  A lot of writers, even good writers, can't seem to make something like that work, yet Rowling did, proving herself yet again.I was also really impressed by her ballsy moves of killing off several main characters, especially right in the beginning.  I thought it was going to be in the big final battle ('cause c'mon, you knew it was coming) that we lost all our favorites, not within the first few chapters.  RIP Hedwig and Mad-Eye.  That was one major way you got sucked in because you're thinking, ""Oh my God!  Characters I love are already dying!  What the-"" and then you keep going because you need to know if anyone else is going to kick it.  For some reason though Rowling just loves killing off my favorite characters, Dumbledore, Moody, Fred (and George too in a way), Lupin, Tonks.  I was especially angry over the Lupin/Tonks death.  It felt like a sort of snub because, yay they're married!  Yay, they're having a baby!  Yay, he's a little metamorphmagus.  Boo, both parents are suddenly dead.  Rude.  But I guess it made the whole thing hurt a lot more, and it did.Honestly, I felt Rowling tied things up beautifully and not in that harried, ""Oh yeah about that?  Um... this happens!  Yeah, that's it!""  I think many fans feel vindicated (i.e. the Snape/Lily shippers, those who thought Harry was a Horcrux, don't mess with Mrs. Weasley) after reading this book.  Of course there are probably some who are broken down and upset that what they thought was going to happen didn't.  In the end we all got one hell of a story and went on one fantastic adventure.  No matter what happened, no matter who died or who ended up with who this book was more than I could have hoped for, I was not disappointed at all.All I can say now is: Jo, thank you.",101,0.9865,0.123,0.701,0.176,0.5573952641165757,POSITIVE,0.9979

42,4122751,08/05/2007,4.0,"grrr. *spoilers*This book was meant to be a masterpiece.It wasn't. I was VERY disappointed with the last portion of the book. But the criticisms are for later.I've always thought that JK's writing was admirable if a little underdeveloped, but the paragraphs just don't seem to flow together as well as they used to.They finally leave school. I never thought they would, but it sure as hell was an exciting notion. However the lack of supporting characters (that you might find at Hogwarts) means that this book is darker and the lack of humour makes for a depressing hundred pages around pg200.The deaths... a little weird how the human deaths are less effective, maybe that's just me but Hedwig and Dobby's deaths broke my heart. With mad-eye... well, he was an asshole so i didn't care. With Fred... well, there is another one so the impact is lessened. With Lupintonks... well if they were stupid enough to name Harry godfather (even THEY should have seen the parellalism!) then they deserve to die. No i don't mean that, but as we didn't see them die it seems less horrifying.So much more interesting and original than the others this daring new direction led to some bad writing which didn't go anywhere in the end (wtf was the hallows about?).The Hallows was a ridiculous idea and frankly i was horrified that Rowling was attempting to introduce such a 'major' theme in the last book with only one brief reference in book six. They were pointless, in the end what did it matter who had ownership of the elder wand? no one used it in 'the final duel' anyway.I no longer like Dumbledore, JK dragged him through the mud and didn't thoroughly wash him off. Harry forgave him but i sure as hell didn't (and who didn't see the 'Harry is a Horcrux' thing coming?The chapter 'King's cross' made me cry. But not because it was well written, rather the opposite, it didn't make sense at times (where the hell were they?) i had to reread the section on harry's 'phoenixlike' ability several times and i still hate it. It was so weak. This sequence was nothing like the other 'endofbookharryanddumbledore' explanations we have come to know and love. Nothing was explained in this chapter everything was re-explained and slightly embellished. The chapters immediately preceding this were the real treat of the book, Snape is finally redeemed (although after ten years of waiting i did expect a better ironclad reason for trusting him than loving lily). Harry facing his mortality is heartbreaking even though most of us have imagined it countless times. The moment right before his death is about as perfect an HP moment there is. He should have stayed dead and the narration flick to another.Voldemort's Invincible Army is defeated too easily and Bellatrix's death is unsatisfying as Molly has no real motive for revenge (nono Fred's death doesn't count). Harry should have done it. He also should have performed at least one killing curse in the book, he performed the other unforgivables, so why not?Voldemort is killed by a reflecting spell.What?WHAT?Are you KIDDING me?Could it possibly be more anticlimactic?What was the point of the elder wand then? Why the elaborate buildup when Harry doesn't even perform the execution?Anyone could have duelled to a reflection, and since when can that happen?A true HP fan must take alot on faith to enjoy this ending.The less said about the epilogue the better. Probably been written since book one and it shows. There is no depth, any hp fan could guess (or assume) this ending, its not even worth reading. Albus Severus was the only icing on this unsatisfying and dry cake.If you do read this book close it at the end of 'the forest again' and write your own ending.OR wait for JK to realise her mistake and re publish with an alternate ending.This was not a rant.Update: Look.

If this is not a good finale, then I do not, and will never know, what is. This brought it all. Every quality deemed to each Hogwarts house, bravery, skill, cunning, ambition, knowledge, wit, honesty, equality, plus action and adventure, were prominent throughout the entire book. J.K. Rowling is a master and brings in real world issues into her fantastical one. I cried, I laughed, I screamed, I smiled, and when it was all over I just sat there and contemplated what my life will be like now that I have finished the series once more. I highly recommend this series more than anything else in the world to those who need some magic in their lives, which is virtually everyone. Love conquers all, and without delving too much into spoilers, that is where I will leave this. Please pick up this series if you have not, I promise it will not disappoint.This next portion is a little bit into my history with Harry Potter, to better understand how I come up with my thoughts about this series. The first time I read the Harry Potter series I was 13 years old. Now, that may seem a bit older than most when they started reading this miraculous series, but I was skeptical to the power that these books had on so many. Although I was older than most when I first read this series, I was also still pretty young and could really only relate to Harry and the others up to about the third book, Prisoner of Azkaban, when they were 13, like I was. Now, exactly five years later, I have been every age (other than in '19 Years Later'), that Harry, Hermione, and Ron have been throughout the entire series, which I think benefits me greatly in understanding their thoughts, feelings, and decisions in each book. When I first read the books, I knew that I could never love anything more, and now, five years later, I am even more sure that this series will not only stay with me forever, bring me light in my darkest days, and be passed on to my children, but also that I have not felt this way about anything. It might seem silly, but I think when one finds this in something, they know, whether or not others will understand. I will most certainly be rereading this series in the future many more times and will continue to be astounded with the growth that I see in myself as I get older, but also with this series, because as I change, it changes with me.

He also took special interest in killing Harry Potter whose main mission for the book would be not to die long enough to fulfill the mission given to him by Dumbledore in the previous book, thus no Hogwarts studies this time; it is about stayin' alive for Harry:Something I noticed again during my reread of the series, especially this book: J.K. Rowling is not at all shy about killing her characters, especially good ones. George R.R. Martin often gets all the slack for doing thisbut despite Harry Potter's author saying that she feels bad about killing good people, a great number of them died in the series (and outside it if you start counting from Harry's parents). Some of these deaths are still as tragic on the second time around. Harry's gradual discovery of Dumbledore as not-quite-good-guy is brilliant. It took me two reads to grasp all the nuances of this. Now for the bad parts which unfortunately made me reduce otherwise perfect rating by one star. Ron - to use his favorite word - is a git, especially in this book. He was destined to remain forever in Harry's shadow, but this is exactly the place he deserved. He did not do anything exciting on his own since fated chess match in the first (!) book. As a character Ginny Weasley cannot be even compared to Luna Lovegood, not to mention Hermione Granger. If Harry could not get Hermione, I hoped he ended up with Luna - sure she is loony at times, but she is always understanding, brave, and smart; read carefully her parts if you do not believe me. She was able to help Harry more than Ginny whose only help was kissing him a couple of times. The forest sequence of the book was way too long. This is probably the only part of the series which felt drown out. The whole epilogue feels off. I understand the need to show happily ever afterbut it still feels out of place. So as I mentioned with these complaints I have to reduce the rating by one, reluctantly. The whole series however deserved unconditional perfect rating. If you have not read it because you think this is for children or because it is too mainstream, or because you think it offends your religious beliefs - get off your high horseand head to your nearest library for the magical experience.

49,3624358527,11/20/2020,5.0,"As we enter the final formal novel in the series, J.K. Rowling takes readers on an adventure like no other. This is the plot line that series fans have been waiting to see play out over six previous novels. Harry Potter prepares for his final clash with Lord Voldemort, where only one can survive. Good versus Evil if ever there was a clear and symbolic interaction. Rowling develops a story unlike the previous pieces, where a scholastic year serves as the story’s undertone. Rather, this book reads more like a journey from a fantasy novel, with various creatures met along the way, precious items are discovered, and an epic battle proves to be the climatic moment in the narrative. Full of action and sorrow, Rowling does not skimp out here and keeps her fans glued to the page until the final sentence is done, but even then it lingers!After a long time waiting, Harry can finally see the age of seventeen before him. After the numerous calamities from the end of the Sixth Year, Harry is ready to fulfil the prophecy and will begin a journey to defeat Lord Voldemort, protecting good from the clutches of his evil ways. After those troublesome Durselys reluctantly agree to go into hiding, keeping the Death Eaters from preying on them, Harry sets off with Ron and Hermione to locate some of the other horcruxes about which Dumbledore spoke before his murder. The desctruction of these horcruxes is the only way to ensure that Voldemort can be killed once and for all.After a plan to get Harry to safety by using a number of doppelgängers goes awry, there is some doubt if it is all worth it. However, there is no second-guessing the plan and the three forge ahead. If tackling the quest were not enough, rumours about Dumbledore’s past emerge in a tell-all biography that offers more dirt than glory for Hogwarts’ former headmaster. Harry begins to wonder just how well he knew the man and whether there was a dark side to him that was shielded. There are many pitfalls and struggler that Ron, Hermione, and Harry face, which leads to struggles and painful realizations. Ron’s temper is frayed when he feels he’s been duped and he flees, returning home.Harry and Hermione are crestfallen that their closest friend has abandoned them and seek answers in Godric’s Hollow. Voldemort almost obliterates them there, leaving the two to feel as though the Dark Lord is anticipating their every move. What’s worse, Harry’s wand is broken in the skirmish, leaving them without proper protection at the worst possible moment. There’s little left to protect these two, other than their wits, which are growing shorter by the moment.Weeks later, another clash takes place and Harry is almost killed. His savour is none other than an apologetic Ron, who arrives just in time. Using Gryffindor’s sword, the three are able to destroy another horcrux and they become enlightened about the provenance of a mysterious trio of magical objects called the Deathly Hallows. Anyone who possesses all three items is said to ‘own’ death, which may be one way to guarantee defeating Voldemort. However, it is not as easy as it sounds, something to which Harry has become accustomed over the last while.While Harry inches closer to an ultimate clash, he realises that he may have to sacrifice everything to save others. As heroic as it sounds, it is rare for someone of seventeen to sober to this so easily. Will Harry agree to die in order to save others? Can he stomach a life without himself around, even if it means Voldemort dies as well? Dumbledore’s prophecies all come together and Harry must soldier on, forgetting what others have said. A chance encounter with a spirit form of Dumbledore opens Harry’s mind to new truths.The final standoff is set, with Harry and Voldemort facing off. No others can interfere and there is little that can be solved by talking. Harry has made his choice, for his friends, his family, and himself. Death no longer scares him, if it means others can rest peacefully. It’s time for a spell like no other... and perhaps some luck from Merlin’s beard!This series definitely increased in its intensity as things progressed. J.K. Rowling offers her readers something that is less a story in this final novel, but more of an epic adventure that pushes the series into the realm of fantasy (not that it was teetering before). The complex nature of this story shows a deeper set of themes that the mature reader will readily understand. A friend of mine commented that Rowling definitely wrote these latter novels with the expectation that her reader had matured, as Harry did, and would be able to comprehend the nuances. While I am not sure Neo caught some of it, I know he appreciated the action and detail, as he spoke with me about it once I had read enough not to hush him.Harry Potter retains the role of protagonist, but is also the ‘good’ for all that can be found within this book. With this on his shoulders, Harry must come to terms with the realization that he is the only one who can fend off Lord Voldemort. Like a teenage Jesus, Harry cannot turn away from this fate, even if he questions it from time to time. Harry has moved from being a young boy with a mysterious scar to the only thing left to save the world from the clutches of evil. As dramatic as it sounds, series fans will likely agree as they synthesise the growth Harry has made along the way. Still, there are moments of teenage ‘normalcy’ as he urns for love and acceptance, as well as wanting to turn away and let someone else handle the heavy lifting.Rowling has developed her supporting characters throughout the series, allowing the reader to choose those they favour and hiss and the folks that are best left outside the tent. However, in an epic novel such as this, it is time to cull the herd, so to say. While Rowling injects as much magic into them as she can with her written word, she also leaves some to perish and forced the reader to process this for themselves. There are many faces who have made an impact who return, almost in a cameo manner, and Rowling flavours the narrative with their interactions. Series fans will likely revel in all that is provided here, though there will surely be some whose passing will not be readily accepted by the larger reading community.This was a highly complex and multilayered novel, understandably so. There is a general journey theme that serves as a story arc, but also smaller revelations in each chapter. Plot lines merge or blur, depending on what Rowling wants to do, but the final goal is clear throughout. Harry’s maturation comes to a head and the final battle will surely draw clear lines.Easily the most mentally consuming of all the novels, I could not allow myself a moment to rest as I tried to make sense of the threads that weave together. The younger reader is soon sobered to truths that things are not always going to be positive, where good is sure to triumph over evil. That being said, there is a ray of hope, albeit faint at times.Rowling has waited until the seventh novel to really pull out all the stops. The symbolism of Good versus Evil is not lost on many, though I am sure some would have liked something a tad more nuanced. It is war and Harry must realise that Voldemort is not one to stand down, but to rectify what he family to do on Hallowe’en night 1981. Rowling dazzles with her intricate narrative that weaves together a strong story and provides countless adventures in well-developed chapters. I cannot say enough about the piece and am pleased to have undertaken this reading challenge. While the formal books and done and I have a sense of where things have gone, there’s still a stage-play, a Book 8, to conquer. I will return to audio for that, as I am not sure I could wait to find a production of it. Kudos, Madam Rowling, for keeping me enthralled throughout. I’ve loved this journey, as it brought me closer to my son, some of my dearest friends, and helped me tap into a part of myself I never knew existed.Love/hate the review?

Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and, above all those who live without love
 This is my favourite Harry Potter book, I adore it, I love it so much. It's weird because it's not /usual/ Harry Potter. It doesn't have much Hogwarts, there's no quidditch -- but I love it I don't wanna get gushy about Harry Potter I mean you all feel me on this everyone loves Harry Potter, you get me. I'm just gonna list some reasons I love this book, this series, so much. - The characters.  I just want it to be on the record Harry James Potter is one of my top five favourite characters. He is just SUCH A GOOD PERSON. I admire his bravery, his selflessness and his determination ( and also he's literally the most savage person his roasts are life ) I love so much about him - I love that he's not perfect either. He can be mean, arrogant, literally annoying asf but I LOVE HIM. He makes me so emotional, like he actually breaks my heart. Thats why this book is actual crack for me. There is so much of it relating to Harry's parents, his past, his childhood. There is so much about him having to do the right thing even though it's hard, even though he's suffering, even though people have literally been fucking with him for years he does the right thing anyway I JUST LOVE HIM ALOT Other characters, Ron man. Ron. He fucks up bad but he comes back and he redeems himself and urggh I love him. His loyalty is amazing, but he's such a real character. I love how he (quite literally) is able to conquer (stab with a sword) his demons and his character development is amazing and he's just so funny and such a good friend he's my son ?? I love him. HERMIONE I honestly can't say anything except wife me she's so inspirational and passionate and sticks to her beliefs even when they're unpopular and I honestly just love her and the trio so much ?Deathly Hallows is just so good like lets recap on some highlights.  --> Opens on Dudley actually accepting Harry and thanking him --> Wild broom chase, crazy sky wand fights and I'm Holey Fred ... get it ? --> Ron fighting his mother about the wedding. Harry and Ginny. Horcrux planning.  --> Coffee shop death eater skirmish --> REGULUS ARCTURUS BLACK --> Lily's letter --> KREACHER --> Ministry break-in. Harry sticking it to Umbridge --> Potterwatch --> GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN ?!?! --> The DA resisting in Hogwarts, magical graffiti that says Dumbledore's Army, Still Recruiting! --> Speaking of Dumbledore, just the entirely of his and Aberforths family story --> Godrics Hollow. Harry seeing James & Lily's graves and the house. Heartbreaking but beautiful --> THE BIT WHEN NEVILLE WIPES OUT NAGINI --> Snape's story --> Everything coming together so beautifully at the end aND THE GRAND HALL SCENE --> Harry mending the Phoenix wand  --> Teddy Lupin existing --> Harry getting to see his parents/Sirius/Lupin say what he's always wanted to crying bye --> like the whole book tbh ?? I love it ??I could say alot about the beautiful messages and sybolism. I could say about the beautiful and poignant way Harry's grief and loss about his parents is dealt with, or talk about the perfect symbolism of Voldermort's death - and how it shows that he was not special but just a regular man who was devoid of love and took his quest for power way too far. I could talk about how Voldermort's soul is represented and what Voldermort represents for humanity but I wouldn't be the first and I won't be the last and I would have too much to say anyway (and no way to say it how I wanna)So instead I'll just say I adore this book, forever and always. I adore this series and everything it gave me. I love that it created such a wonderful and expansive world I wanna live in. I love that it gave me characters who were my friends growing up. I love that it's defined my childhood and become to important to me and I can't believe it came out nearly ten years ago. I love it so much, forever.

“Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and, above all those who live without love.”
Harry is now 17, which means the protective charm that has kept him safe till now has expired. Voldemort is stronger than ever, not only is he wreaking havoc in the wizarding world but even the Muggles know that there is an evil surrounding them.Harry, Hermione and Ron have the difficult job of leaving behind their loved ones to continue the mission Dumbledore left Harry. What should have been their seventh year at Hogwarts is instead a hunt for Lord Voldemort's Horcruxes. “I'm going to keep going until I succeed — or die. Don't think I don't know how this might end. I've known it for years.”Deathly Hallows is everything I could have wanted in a series finale. It ties off Harry's story so well. The change of setting, the character growth, plot twists and heists — is what makes this book stand out compared to the others. Every single part of this book was just so well thought out. I can distinctly remember reading it as a kid completely in awe of this story. I still am. Despite the heartbreaking deaths of some of my favourite characters; every time I turn the last page I do it with a smile on my face and tears in my eyes. 
“You'll stay with me?”“Until the very end,” said James.

I can step back from the hoopla and step back from the movies and really get into all the Grindelwald passages and connect the dots with Dumbledore. Best friends, no? One creates the wizarding war and sends his wizard troops out to conquer based on a young Dumbledore's words, only to end in a duel that leaves Dumbledore with the Elder Wand that was in his friend's hands for so many years. Of course, we get to skip the first one that ended in the death of Dumbledore's sister, but who knows, we will probably be seeing no only Dumbledore but perhaps some Pensives. :)Such delicious stories to pick up soon with the sequels to Fantastic Beasts, no?

63,8791724,11/07/2007,5.0,"This review contains spoilers.2011 REVIEW - 2ND READINGI made a promise to myself that I wouldn't read my review from 2007, when the book first came out, until after I'd published this one. I want to see how they compare - what thoughts/reactions etc. had changed, if any, and any additional insights - but it does make me nervous, because I reckon my first review will prove to be much better written - and what if I seem dumber this time around? I find I get a bit muddled from watching the films, too, in that after watching them I can't remember if bits were in the book or the film and vice versa. Oh well. Really must stop over-thinking things! [Scroll down for my first review, from 2007.]The final Harry Potter book always looks too short to me, like, how could everything possibly be wrapped up in a book that's not as long as The Order of the Phoenix, when there's still so much to do?! I felt that the first time, and I felt that again. But once again I admire Rowling's skill in crafting a tremendous story and a powerful ending for what is to me one of the best fantasy series out there. There's a lot going on in this novel, but it's nicely balanced with quieter, slower parts and you really get that last chance to really know Harry, Ron and Hermione. Rowling never lets plot overpower her characters or her story, and she won't be rushed: the pacing is steady and consistent throughout, which only adds to the tension-filled scenes where you start biting your nails.This is a book that makes me cry, and I'll tell you why - in a bit. I wondered how I could share all the things I love about this particular book, and figured listing them was probably the best option. 	 Hedwig dying. I had completely forgotten, and it's so, so sad. I like how they did it for the movie, giving her a role and using her as a visual means of identifying Harry, since in the book it's more complicated. 	 Hermione erasing her existence - removing knowledge and memory of herself from her parents' minds and sending them off to Australia under new identities so that they aren't a target. There is something incredibly tragic about this, though it doesn't get much attention. I can't imagine the kind of strength and resolve it would take to do that, though the realities of the world would probably help give you the resolve. 	 Kreacher becoming an ally. And all for an act of genuine kindness (Harry gives him ""Master Regulus'"" locket after hearing his story). And what he was made to do for Voldemort. Nothing, not even Kreacher, is black and white, and that's an important lesson to learn. He betrayed Sirius at the end of The Order of the Phoenix, but when you learn more about him, you realise it's not a simple matter at all. 	 Dobby's death. He was such a brave, selfless elf, and as characters, he and Kreacher really brought into sharp relief the whole issue of house elves and their mistreatment. 	 The mortality of the Weasley's. Until this book, they always struck me as one of those solid features who come close to utter tragedy but always manage to avoid it, like with Arthur getting attacked by the snake. Here, though, George loses an ear and, at the end, Fred is killed. Fred's death is one of the saddest things for me.  	 Likewise, Lupin and Tonks' deaths at the final battle - I remember reading that the first time and feeling that sense of utter disbelief. I felt it again here, like someone had surely made a mistake, especially when Harry sees their bodies next to Fred and their described as sleeping. But with a newborn left behind, and the fact that Lupin only recently found the first real happiness he's ever known - to have that cut short, it makes me want to cry just typing this. The deaths of these characters had a much bigger impact on me than the death of Dumbledore - as big a surprise as that was on first reading - at the end of The Half-Blood Prince. In a way, Dumbledore had to go so that Harry could come into his own. But these characters, their deaths are so needless, and they were too young and left too much behind. 	 Snape's love for Lily. I knew there was a good reason why we forgave Snape at the end, but I was glad I couldn't remember exactly what it was. Snape is another complex character, who shows that it's not a simple matter of right or wrong, good or evil. He's not someone to be judged at face value or first impressions, though obviously that's what everyone has been doing all his life. It's not even pity that I felt for him, but empathy at losing the woman he loved and sacrificing everything in memory of her. He never stopped loving her. Timeless love. No wonder Dumbledore trusted him implicitly: he understood the power of such emotions and never dismissed them as insignificant. 	 The truth about Dumbledore's past, and his sister Ariana. So sad. I haven't seen the second half of the movie version yet but I hope they include these details. 	 Harry walking to his impending death, supported by the ghosts of his parents, Sirius and Lupin. I cried when James and Lily and Cedric appeared at the end of The Goblet of Fire, and they had no less power here, bolstering their son and being there so he wasn't alone as he went to Voldemort, knowing he was going to be killed - and not knowing that he would survive it.  	 The dragon kept imprisoned in Gringott's Bank. I felt so bad for the poor tortured beast, and so happy when they freed it. 	 Xenophilius Lovegood. The position he was in, having his daughter taken away and used as a threat against him, to betray his beliefs (i.e., in Harry as the Chosen One). 	 Petunia Dursley, Harry's aunt, is a sad figure in her own right. It becomes clear in this book why she was so anti-magic: she was jealous of her sister Lily's ability. The scene where Lily mentions that Petunia wrote to Dumbledore, asking to be let into Hogwarts, and Petunia's feelings of embarrassment and shame and longing, of feeling excluded - you can't help but feel for the little girl who grew into a resentful woman in denial.  There's lots of happy things here too, like Fleur and Bill Weasley's wedding and Ron and Hermione finally getting together, as well as great mini-adventures that all lead up to the final show-down. The plan to get into the Ministry of Magic, and later the Gringott's Bank break-in, for example, were really fun and exciting and scary. And one of my favourite scenes is the Neville Longbottom snake-killing scene - really, I just love all the Neville scenes but that one in particular really stuck in my head all the intervening years since first reading it.And underlying it all is this Hitler-like race and class war that Voldemort is enacting. Muggles and Mud-bloods become demonised and terrorised and everyone has to prove their ""purity"". The film captured this really well in the set design, especially inside the Ministry.I loved that there was so much I couldn't remember when I started this book - I couldn't remember what the Hallows were, or what was inside the Snitch, or how they found the other Horcruxes. I had forgotten Dobby died until I watched the film a few months ago. It was wonderful to read it almost like it was the first time.And then there's the epilogue - I'll mention it because I remember how much fans railed against it when the book first came out. I'm still not sure why, except maybe it wasn't up to the standards of the rest of the series. I read somewhere that Rowling wrote it at the beginning, which is kinda cool, and shows just how well she planned it all out. The line that I love is this one, where Harry tells his son: ""Albus Severus, [...] you were named for two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever knew."" [p.607] It gets me every time.2007 REVIEW - 1ST READINGSo, there were huge expectations - and quite a few bets, debates and demands - for this last book, and personally I thought it was a great ending to the series. One of the things that I love about these books, that has always impressed me, is how tightly plotted they are, how detailed. Others have complained about the plotholes in Deathly Hallows, but I didn't see any. Granted, I wasn't looking for them, and I didn't succeed in my intention to re-read the previous books before this one (managed Philosopher's Stone but left it too late for the others) so I had forgotten some details. Deathly Hallows made me laugh, made me cry (seriously, I bawled - and there were no tissues at the cottage so had to mop my face with paper towel...), had me pressing my knuckles to my mouth (the closest I come to biting my nails), and kept me on the edge of my seat. What more could you ask for? Quite a few characters die in this book, but everyone knew there would be some deaths because Rowling said there would be. She's also said, apparently, that the books are about death, though, having read the last book, I understand now that she doesn't mean they're about death, but about death. The whole idea behind The Boy Who Lived was that his mother's sacrifice protected him from the killing curse, and when Harry in turn sacrifices himself, he protects everyone at Hogwarts (where all the characters assemble for the big show-down) from Lord Voldemort. I also liked how the death of Dumbledore (in the previous book) and Snape's betrayal are resolved; I liked that Snape did it all for love of Lily, Harry's mother. It worked, brought out the humanity that has always lurked deep beneath Snape's corrosive veneer. The saddest deaths were of Fred, one of the Weasley twins, and Lupin and Tonks, only weeks after the birth of their baby. Is it any wonder that I cried? And even though there was always the hope that Harry would survive, still the section leading up to his sacrifice was written so convincingly, so non-melodrammatically, that I actually had to put the book down for a minute and do a quick turn about the house to calm myself down a bit. The only bit that looked like a glaring plothole at first was when Neville pulls the sword of Gryffindor out of the Sorting Hat to lop Voldemort's snake's head off with. That confused me - last we saw of the sword, the goblin had taken it and disappeared into the depths of Gringotts with it. Then I remembered: Harry had pulled the sword out of the Sorting Hat in the Chamber of Secrets, too. The last lingering doubt is why the hat was on fire and why exactly Voldemort wanted to non-sort them then and there. Ah well, it works for dramatic effect! Another part of the book which has received a lot of flak: the epilogue. Saccharine, it's been described. I have to agree, and it's the only bit of saccharine in the entire series. Apparently it was written way back in the 90s, but I don't think that excuses it. It was like icing on the cake - sickly sweet, not at all filling or satisfying, hiding the cake beneath which is what you really want to eat, as long as you can have the icing too. So we learn how they paired up and what their kids' names are, that Neville is a Herbology professor and, well, very little else. Noticeably, Harry's conversation with Dumbledore in King's Cross Station shows how much Harry has grown and matured. He's moved through his teenage angst and become reliable, responsible, thoughtful, more patient. By not going after the Deathly Hallows, his first impulse is tempered by a new, cooler head. Aside from the humour, reminiscent of Roald Dahl, and the plotting, the character development of Harry is another reason why the books are so enjoyable, and long-lasting.",64,0.9821,0.127,0.73,0.143,0.5026830571987639,NEGATIVE,0.9994

“Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and, above all those who live without love.”
The last stand. Holy shit, this was definitely one of the best books I've ever read. It was interesting to the core and never bored me for even a second. This was through and through a pain in the ass. It pained me to read the last chapter, the last book. I didn't want this to end. Still don't want to.(view spoiler)[Fred, Dora, Lupin... Snape...  (hide spoiler)]Why is Mrs. Rowling so keen on killing? Holy shit, she's turned this into heart-break. My heart shatters every time someone dies, I'm emotional and a cry-baby just like that.There were moments in the book when it reminded me how fun it all used to be. No matter how morbid it all becomes, Mrs. Rowling always manages to keep some things intact, like the humor. The humor is definitely reduced but not non-existent.I laughed so hard when Molly Weasley screamed ""NOT MY DAUGHTER YOU BITCH!"" at Bellatrix (view spoiler)[and then killed her.

“Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?”
I just want to say that Harry Potter taught me to be brave and love rather than hate and not being afraid of even dying for those I love.

67,1829428865,07/23/2018,5.0,"[Warning: spoilers ahead but names withheld where possible]The Deathly Hallows was a fantastic, explosive ending to the incredible Harry Potter series. All the work Rowling did to build this story over nearly 3000 pages to reach this climax is quite an accomplishment. The tension between the quest we learned of in Half-Blood Prince for the horcruxes and that we learn in the beautiful fable of the eponymous Deathly Hallows is spectacular. The whole book resonates with dark energy - the attack on wizarding society by Voldemort's minion's honestly reminds me of the unholy alliance of the ammosexual christofascist right and Trump especially in the massive hypocrisy involved - and is extremely well-written throughout. Overall thoughts on the series: I really liked how Rowling dealt with the janus-type themes of racism and acceptance. The horrors of Voldemort's followers tortures and murders of the semi- and non-magical peoples is a frightening reminder of both the Shoah and of slavery in America. On the other hand, the composition of Team Harry with misfits and a relatively decent amount of female protagonists was a fantastic way to discuss diversity. Sub-themes about freedom of the press, the loss of innocence, the failing of illusions of youth...all of these are treated with delicate precision. That is perhaps what I appreciate most about Rowling's universe - besides the relatively solid consistency from end to end as well as fantastic characters that one wishes they could meet in real life (Hagrid!), there are also subtle and not so subtle calls to a basic pagan morality that doesn't need to call out to the Bible (like in A Wrinkle in Time) or biblical analogies (Narnia). That being said, it is fascinating how she built her Potterverse with a mixture of Greek (centaurs, phoenixes) and Hindu (Nagini is like the Naga of the Churning of the Sea of Milk story) mythologies. She demonstrates a wide-ranging curiosity and creative power of merging various traditions into her own unique fabric which feels familiar and less foreign than, say, the Tolkien universe.Deathly Hallows was certainly a worthy place for Rowling to end the legacy of Harry's time at Hogwarts and is a true literary achievement in writing for children and adolescents.",87,0.9874,0.103,0.711,0.186,0.6190178571428573,POSITIVE,1.0

This is the climax of the series as it brings to a close the essential conflict between these two characters which is at the heart of everything.[1] The first problem, Voldemort descends from an intelligent, capable, callous, ruthless, high-functioning psychopath (strong evil) into a witless, delusional madman (a rabid dog).
... Voldemort began to laugh, and the sound was more frightening than his screams; humourless and insane, ... (a page later) ... but now let out a cackle of mad laughter.
JKR is not the only author I've read that posits Evil = Madness. (Here's looking at you Raymond E Feist). This is a convenient and soothing fiction. If evil is a madness, then healthy people wont be evil. If evil is a sickness, then evil could be cured. I've even seen people posit evil as a form of stupidity or ignorance - oh, if it was only that simple we would have cured evil a long time ago.It strikes me that Evil is a fundamentally rational approach to life and far more dangerous as a consequence of that rationality. That is, people who will do evil, do so because it is the most expedient way for them to reach their goals. They just don't care about the negative consequences of their actions on others (lack of empathy, lack of a conscience, lack of compassion, etc).By reducing Voldemort from a highly capable strong evil character to a two-dimensional clownish figure of madness, JKR greatly reduces the threat and tension of this climatic moment.OMG! I lament the lost opportunity JKR had to draw true evil as it is... (Sigh. Such is life, we seemed doomed to live in ignorance...)[2] Voldemort loves the sound of his own voice, and Harry is happy to engage, including telling Voldemort precisely what was about to happen.
... 'because Dumbledore's last plan hasn't backfired on me at all. It's backfired on you, Riddle.'
Indeed, and it is precisely Voldemort's use of the Eldar wand, after being told that it magically belongs to Harry, that he is killed by his own backfiring spell.Given that Voldemort is now a witless madman, his defeat is assured and without surprise.I'm reminded of Tom Riddle in the Chamber of Secrets explaining everything to demonstrate the marvelous cleverness of his evil plan before snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.Gloat speeches - please go away. The Climax was a drawn-out FIZZER and as welcome as a wet blanket on a cold night - deducting 200 points from all houses...The second last word, which will be series wide, I'm giving to one of the characters who seemed to have missed out on a bigger role.The Sorting Hat: ""And why wasn't I considered for the post of Professor? I could teach Defense against the Dark Arts, or Potions. I'd certainly be an improvement on the ghost that teaches the History of Magic. It's discrimination - pure and simple. No one wants a teaching Hat!""And the last word goes to the villain ...Voldemort: ""Things I wasn't allowed to do by the author. [1] Cut Harry's head off after zapping him with an Avada Kedavra spell for the 2nd time. I mean, would you take any chances with the fracking 'boy who lived?' [2] Bring a 9mm automatic to the final battle. [3] Install half a dozen snipers around Hogwarts prior to the final battle - just in case. (Shakes head) I really envy the dragon Smaug, he got to be ""Chiefest of Calamities,"" whereas I was just a mad idiot.

70,1570226618,03/05/2016,5.0,"When I started reading The Deathly Hallows for the first time, it seemed impossible that J.K. Rowling could wrap up all the unresolved issues and contradictions with her final book. The friends have no idea where to start hunting for horcruxes. Where are they? WHAT are they? And when they figure those things out, how do they destroy them? Dumbledore is gone, so he can’t help. And what the fuck is up with Snape? I am happy to say that, despite my doubts, Rowling did a wonderful job of resolving everything, all the while changing everything I thought to be true. In the first three chapters alone, so much change has happened. Dumbledore is gone, and Harry can’t reconcile the man he thought he knew with all the accusations and doubts flying around. The Malfoys are no longer powerful but instead are being humiliated by their fellow death eaters and by Voldemort. And instead of Harry leaving the Dursleys’ at the end of the summer like always, the Dursleys are running for cover. Even Dudley behaves completely out of character and is nice to and concerned about Harry. What is the world coming to? Voldemort’s return has changed virtually everything.Throughout the book, we get one mind blowing reveal after another which caused me to flip back through previous books and grin at the brilliance of a series that was fully planned from start to finish before book one was ever written. And the changes kept coming. I saw them everywhere: in the behavior of the Ministry, in the loss of characters we adored, and in the revelation of characters we hoped for but were unsure of (I’m looking at you Ron, Dumbledore, Neville, Percy, and Snape). And although I hate to admit it, because I have ignored on principle that the epilogue even exists for many years, I saw them there, too. The orphan boy with no one to love him from the first book is part of a wonderful family he has always wanted, with his trusted friends by his side.

Pity the living, and, above all those who live without love.”…“Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?”At this point, you’ve either read the Harry Potter series, or you’ve deliberately chosen not to read them. Either way, there’s not too much to say here. Is Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows perfect? I suppose not. I know some people think the trio spend too much of the middle section tromping through the woods. I know others feel that too much of the story and the plot turn on wand lore. Personally, I wasn't bothered by either of those parts. And in reality, it would have been impossible to satisfy everyone's hopes and expectations for the finale.There are so many gripping, moving sections in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Dudley's redemption. Hedwig. The backstory of Kreacher and Regulus. Godric's Hollow. The Tale of the Three Brothers. Dobby's death and burial. Breaking in and out of Gringotts. And then everything that happens in the last six chapters of the book, especially the Prince's Tale and the final confrontation, which is so much better here than the movie’s version.But in many ways, what sets Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows apart is Harry's learning and understanding that Dumbledore was just a man, powerful but flawed. Symbolically, it completes his transition to adulthood, and leaves him ready to face Voldemort as an equal. Finally learning the details of Dumbledore's past illuminates parts of earlier books, gives him more depth as a character, and in context is even more evidence of Harry's heroic nature.The author may have let people down later in her life; people sometimes suck more than you realize at first. But the Harry Potter series is an achievement that will outlast her and all of us. If somehow you've stubbornly refused to read it, you are really missing out. And Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is a wonderful, thoughtful ending to this series.",58,0.9901,0.054,0.81,0.136,0.4971253229974159,POSITIVE,0.6884

79,7711007,10/14/2007,1.0,"Deathly Hallows is in fierce competition with Half-Blood Prince as the worst book of the series. It is an extremely bloated book in which nothing much happens for chapters upon chapters because Rowling is dragging the storyline out -- so it can end at the end of the school year, like all the other books. Many plotlines of previous books are barely touched upon (S.P.E.W.) or ""resolved"" in an entirely dissatisfactory manner (Grawp, though I wasn't unhappy about not seeing more of him). Characters who were hyped in interviews but turned out to be of little importance include Ginny Weasley, who winds up doing absolutely nothing of relevance throughout the whole book, whereas she was annoyingly and tediously present (and acting like a complete jerk) in Half-Blood Prince. Despite my dislike of this character, I had expected to see much more of her, and I was disappointed to see her true purpose was bearing Harry Potter's childrens in one of the, if not the, least believable ""romances"" of the series.The book, and the series, then end with a cloying epilogue which tells us little about things that actually matter and instead focuses on who marries who, complete with precocious children (who are naturally of similar ages; so considerate of everyone to get pregnant at the same time!) and insipid names (Albus Severus, but no child named after Ginny's dead brother?). I like to pretend this epilogue, or ""crapilogue"" as disappointed fans have dubbed it, doesn't exist, and that the series officially ends after Harry kills Voldemort. Leaves much more to the imagination and is much more of a fitting end.My expectations prior to the release were faily high. That turned out to be a mistake.

Yes, I know that I still gave it five stars, just like for each Harry Potter book. It's because I decided to ignore it. I read it twice in the book (only because the first time I read the books, it was the french translation) and watched it once in the movie. Then, every time I read it, I stop at what I decided was the end for me and I do the same thing when I watch the movie. I know many people love it, because isn't it wonderful to know that, in the end, ""all was well""? And I respect that people feel that way. But it just didn't do it for me the first time and it still doesn't. I know why J.K. Rowling did it, I understand. It even makes more sense given that children also read it and because people in general want a happy ending like the one she delivered. But here's the thing:What is truly amazing in this world and in those books is that, despite the magical universe, it feels real and we can relate to it so much from the beginning until the end. I first read The Deathly Hallows when it was released in French, I think it was in October or November 2007, I'm not sure. I was 15. First, I think that I'm far from being the only Millenial not being able to relate to ""all was well"". There are others reasons that I'd rather not dwell on. But the true end in this book for me, the one we can all relate to, was just after the War ended. It was hopeful, but with a vibe of ""and from now on, they'll have to heal and rebuild"" and we didn't know how they were gonna do it, where they were gonna start, each one of them, whether some wouldn't be able to. And that was okay for me, because it was an ending where, yes the Dark side had been defeated in the War, yes there was hope, while still being realistic and relatable. For me, this is the true end. Just like in the movie, the true end, the one filled with hope but relatable is that last scene where we see Harry, Hermione and Ron standing outside of Hogwarts, in the middle of the ruins, looking at the future in front of them.",53,0.9954,0.072,0.772,0.157,0.5367571059431523,POSITIVE,0.9895

Finally, i've reached the finishing line. I really enjoyed the first few books, personally I don't feel Rowling has enough content to justify books the size of bricks. The last few books the whole plot line has happened in the last 20% of the book and the rest of the time your just plodding along with Dumbledore in your ear talking in riddles, making zero sense and waiting for Harry to have an OMG moment when the riddles unravel themselves. I think I missed the boat in the magic of this series. I think the wait for the books to be written, being 11 years old and growing with Harry probably all contribute to the enjoyment of the reading experience but for a woman in her thirties who has chosen not to procreate, I just couldnt deal with the teenage mood swings and having to read about so much snogging without getting a sex scene. I'm also not sure this is YA, it felt more Middle Grade to me but I do appreciate that the YA genre as a whole has had a total overhaul since HP was written and categorised. I also think the hype for these books has died since the author has become problematic and that definitely contributed to my stump spells. It's hard to get behind characters that have been created by someone who doesn't fit into your own core values.

I think I've made it quite clear throughout my years on Goodreads how much the Harry Potter series and world means to me, but I have yet to do any kind of review on any of the books. This series means so much to so many people, it gave me friends when I had none, and most importantly, the courage to be myself. There are so many wonderful things about this series; how detailed the world is, the history, the myriad of different characters. But maybe my favourite part of the story is how realistic the characters are. They are without a doubt flawed, Harry often acting too quick (and without much thought) while trying to carry the world on his shoulders, Ron's feelings of intense jealousy that follow him through the whole series, and Hermione's sometimes narrow mindedness. These are the things that made me fall in love with these characters. I could see myself in them and they never made me feel less than—they made mistakes just like every other human being. This has marked I think close to the twelfth time I have reread this series, and every time it somehow manages to shape the person I turn into. Every time I read this series there is a new problem I am facing, a different quality in myself I am battling with, and I always feel like I take some kind of knowledge or comfort from this series, from all different characters.

And as we get to the final battle, Snape's memories, and we see how cleverly the allegiance of the Elder Wand has been plotted out all along, you just want to sit back and applaud for the skill of the storytelling.

Good because I've experienced it all, bad because it's now over.I knew the plot before going in because the last movie was the freshest in my mind, so I braced myself for the deaths that were coming, revelations that jumped out to reveal themselves, and the creative wrap-up. Rowling used her imagination at top form to show the hidden natures of some of the characters we previously viewed as villains, backstories of heroes, and twists in escaping death and losing for Harry Potter himself.Since it was the last book, it was the darkest as the battle reigned supreme for Hogwarts and Harry and his friends - they finally had to face that final fight, leaving no one unscathed. My favorite part was definitely at the school when the battle was waging. McGonagall remains a favorite, I wish we knew about her story afterward. Bellatrix versus Mrs Weasley was an epic time, Neville standing up for his friends, and of course the sad, sad deaths that happened to some series regulars.Truthfully some of the down parts were a little dull at times - Harry and Hermione and Ron wandering around had some interesting scenes though, such as the snake Nagiri in the Hollows scene being so creepy it was like something written out of a horror book. The scene where Harry finds the sword was awesome as well, but it just seemed like a little magic was missing when the gang was separated so long from the school and other characters. Those characters, classes, school, hiding from teachers...all of that was a strong binding substance for the story being as great as it was. It would be nice to know more in the epilogue about what happened to some surviving characters, such as the Weasley's besides Ron and Percy, Luna and her father, and a few others. Hopefully Harry kept Kreacher around as a personal house elf for life. The resolution was sweet since it showed the future and who the main characters got together with, as well as Harry giving an important tribute to two main characters in the naming of his son, but it did feel a little off for some reason, not sure why. It almost felt a little forced. It answers marriage and kids but what about careers and other stuff? I know some wanted Harry to end up with another girl in the series, but I'm happy with how it ended. Even J.K. Rowling herself now says she wish she had done that differently, but I think she made the right decision the first time.As evil as Voldemort was, he made a memorable villain. On the other side of the coin, Harry and his friends made intelligent and worthy heroes. I'll miss the school and the stories - everything from laughing and learning, to fighting and plotting. I'll miss the characters who were killed off, and wonder what happened to those left behind. I still think it would have been more interesting had a certain professor lived and played a part in the ending.Of course this series couldn't last forever, but it's good the author wrote seven lengthy books that are impossible to forget.

101,3798963,07/30/2007,3.0,"(shamelessly cross-posted from my livejournal entry) Spoilers below!I remember picking up Harry Potter around the time that book 3 had come out. There had been buzz about the books in the post with a picture of JK standing by railroad tracks and some inside joke about ""muggles."" I probably wouldn't have read them had I not babysat for my nextdoor neighbor's kids who were 7 and 10 at the time, and asked me to read it to them as a bedtime story. What is so compelling about these children's books? The well-woven archetypes, the mystery, the imaginative combination of fantasy and fancy? As another blogger put it, the books are overflowing with story. Never once are they a method for JK to assuage her vanity as a writer, because the writing itself isn't deep, their success is a result of Rowling being an increadibly steady storyteller whose approach has more than a few similarities to classic storytelling. Her main three characters account for the three things Aristotle named as the only necessary ingredients in successful rhetoric - Ethos (Harry) Pathos (Ron) and Logos (Hermione). She extends this to all aspects of the Harry Potter world, to houses in Hogwarts, their respective teachers, as well as borrowing latin for names of spells and words from other languages as names for characters-- Malfoy (quoting wikipedia) is derived from Old French ""mal foi"" or ""mal foy,"" which means ""bad faith"" or ""bad trust"". The Old French mal foy itself is derived from Latin mala fide, which as a judicial term means intentional mischief, ill will or evil intentions.(/quoting wikipedia) Grimmauld place is also a pun on ""grim old place."" As far as the pacing, it takes into realistic account the rest and hunger the characters go through with no detail spared as to when and what the characters eat. For some reason this makes a story more effective to me, call me weird, I like reading about people eating. Though while I read the Odyssey this made me put the book down more than a few times because it made me hungry. Anyhow, the constant thread through these books was the final showdown that had to happen between Harry and Voldemort, though I think I would have read them anyway for her generously detailed fantastic world...I was surprised Harry didn't die. I really thought it was going to happen and was a little disappointed with the end, mostly because the meeting with Dumbledore in the train station purgatory was a bit much of a deus ex machina for me. I know she had to vindicate Dumbledore and I thought that was fine but something about it was too clean and easy without her usual foreshadowing. I knew Snape would be vindicated in the end! I loved how she rounded out his story, all that was perfect. I was a huge fan of the way in which Rowling discredited the phrase ""for the greater good"" probably much to the confusion of most of her younger readers. Was a little taken aback at the vague comparison of that to the holocaust, how she wrote something like ""for the greater good"" was on the gates of a place where Grindewald killed people but it drove the point home. The Elder Wand ownership thing was...it was like she painted herself into a corner and had to get it resolved before she could finish the book, made the final duel a bit too, er, complex. But my favorite moment in all of these books came at the end of chapter 35 right before Harry regains consciousness for the final battle. It was the most elegant way to finish out this series that has made millions of children into avid readers:""Tell me one last thing,"" said Harry. ""Is this real? Or has this been happening inside my head?""Dumbledore beamed at him, and his voice sounded loud and strong in Harry's ears even though the bright mist was descending again obscuring his figure.""Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?""",45,0.9954,0.055,0.809,0.136,0.5570329257829255,NEGATIVE,0.996

Rags to riches author J. K. Rowling recently came OFF the billionaire list because she’s given away so much money to charity.As I write this in the fall of 2019, I approximately the gazillioninth reader to post a review and no doubt my humble words will be wholly insufficient to convey my genuine feelings that this is a very special work.Young Adult? Yes and no. Certainly the series began this way but Rowling had the very cool idea that as the characters matured, so too would the tone of her narrative. In this the seventh book and corresponding to Harry and his friends being 17 (a legal adult in the wizarding world) Rowling has reached the height of her mature writing and explores some deep subjects like death and mortality, child raising, unrequited love and vengeance. There is murder here and cruelty and Rowling trusts her readers enough not to pull punches.Most notable to this reader is the great complexity of her characterizations. Too frequently this is a terrible deficit in fantasy writing, but over the last few books, and culminating in this excellent adventure, Rowling has shown us the good, the bad and the ugly in even her most endearing players, and of course this makes for a better work.In Voldemort, Rowling has created one of literature’s great villains. Considering the Dungeons and Dragons alignment system, many pundits have placed Voldemort in the Lawful Evil category (a spot also frequented by Darth Vader). I could also see Neutral Evil or even Chaotic Evil, though I’d agree most closely with LE. Actually, this makes me think about the alignments and one commentator NAILED it when he opined that Evil represents selfishness while Good is about selflessness – and Tom Riddle is one of the most diabolically selfish antagonists in print.Fantasy. Rowling’s work will be likened to Tolkien and Lewis and these comparisons are legitimate. Rowling has created a wonderfully complex and layered story with three dimensional characters that breathe with life.This last book in the series ties everything together as nicely as Jeff Lebowski’s rug. We learn more about Dumbledore and Harry and even some sympathetic lines about the Malfoys. There is death and life and magic. ",45,-0.7941,0.174,0.645,0.181,0.5828425655976677,POSITIVE,0.9999

105,3254389914,03/31/2020,1.0,"EDIT: i lowered the entire series down to 1 stars because i utterly LOATHE these books. Harry Potter is a series which greatly benefits from the power of childhood nostalgia. From its first release in 1997 to its official end in 2007 (Cursed Child is not canon) the kids who had started reading it were at that point adults and very different people. But just because they had grown up didn’t mean they had lost their feel for the magical world. The series was something they had grown up with, and it had greatly impacted their self-identity. Nostalgia is something that can hardly be replaced. Even if one were to read it many years after they were fully grown and they loved it, they still wouldn’t have that same sort of attachment. Well, I’m someone who read it past my time, and I didn’t particularly enjoy it. Soooo, here’s the thing:I’ve got to be straight right away and say that my opinion is only slightly influenced by some things the author has said over recent years. While usually an author wouldn’t affect me, every little thing she says seems to bring the series down, so I can’t help but take that into account. J.K. Rowling’s series, spanning seven official books and ten years, grew an entirely new wizarding world with characters that had real human emotions and creatures never seen before. Ten years and seven books and yet she still couldn’t figure out how to write good characters. Snape and Dumbledore are the most egregious cases of this. She really built up an entire plot where Snape belittled and mentally abused many of his students, even going as far as to be seen as Neville’s biggest fear in the world. (I’ll remind you that Neville’s parents were literally cursed for eternity, but his biggest fear was his teacher.) He insulted students’ looks (Hermione), often made them go through physical torture (oclumancy lessons with Harry), and was an overall terrible person. J.K. seems to think that this is all redeemable, however, by the fact that he loved Harry’s mom. Because an abusive man part of a psychotic group of murderers being so obsessively attached to a married woman who wanted nothing to do with him is a completely normal thing. All of this is done, of course, right under Dumbledore’s watch. Dumbledore, seemingly, is the guy who lets this all happen. He lets Harry live with abusive protectors (I don’t care that Petunia had Lily’s blood and had the power of love or whatever stupid excuse. That senile old man could have helped him somehow), lets students and staff get away with repulsive behavior, and literally doesn’t tell anyone anything! He sucks!!!!And, God, I can’t stand Hermione. Before the first Harry Potter movie came out J.K. signed the deal with Columbus because his favorite character, the same as hers, was Hermione. It may seem hard to believe now, but back in 2000 the fandom liked Ron way better. I agree with the fandom. Hermione is the most idiotic, untrusting, whiny, and egregiously loathsome friend ever. She spends seven damn years doubting every single thing Harry or Ron say and making them feel stupid. She tells Harry he’s crazy for thinking Draco is a death eater. Harry is correct. She tells Harry he’s crazy for thinking Snape is up to something. Harry is correct. She tells Harry he’s crazy for wanting to go after the Deathly Hallows. Harry is not only correct but saves the damn world. She takes every opportunity to put herself above her two friends and make them feel inferior. She cries if anyone stands up to her in any way and acts the victim. She even makes Luna, one of the nicest people in the entire series, feel like garbage because she doesn’t believe what she does. I hate her, Jesus Christ. Besides being terrible at making bad people seem good, J.K. Rowling is terrible at making good people seem bad. I can’t be the only one who thinks it’s really weird that she has such an obvious loathing of slytherins. (Yeah, Albus-Stupid-Name is a slytherin, but she didn’t even write that book so I don’t care.) Like, she put all of the cunning and ambitious people into one group and said “these guys, they’re evil.” She could’ve at least made the slytherin moto like “we hate muggleborns” so that it would have been more obvious that she wanted them to be the only bad people. By the way, it’s impossible for all slytherins to be like this. There are literally 28 pure blood families and there are confirmed thousands of hogwarts students, so hundreds of them must be in slytherin. I don’t think J.K. actually reads her own books. But I’m not going to get into the whole house-politics thing because it’s literally a made-up sorting game that tracks people when they are ELEVEN!!!!!!!!  People change dramatically!!!!! You cannot expect an eleven year old to be the same for the rest of their lives!!! There are just so many other weird mistakes or flaws that bug me. Krum must have been of age when he took 14 year old little Hermione to the dance and became infatuated with her. The time turners, which could have ended this entire mess, were conveniently destroyed. Ginny and Harry fall in love in, like, one book. Literally all of the young Slytherins were teenagers when they were FORCED to become death eaters.  Dumbledore knew for 11 years before Harry Potter came to Hogwarts that he was destined to die and he never told the damn kid until it was almost too late.  Every single non English person is a stereotype holy shit she named the one Jewish kid GOLDSTEIN and the whole goblin thing? ALL THE RUSSIANS DRINK VODKA AND ARE SLIGHTLY EVIL? What’s up with the elves by the way? They like being slaves? Look, I know I’ve gone on and on about how terrible every part of this book is, but I really don’t think it’s  that  bad. I think the magic, while it lacks any good rules or a decent system, is interesting. I can’t deny that J.K. Rowling built a complex world with interesting characters. Interesting does not mean good. People can like what they like, but this series just wasn’t written for me. Sorry, J.K., but I guess you can go tweet about how sad you are that people don’t like your stupid book that has zero diversity. You really made the only Asian character be called Cho Chang, you prick.",43,-0.9986,0.167,0.732,0.101,0.5576039516039516,NEGATIVE,0.9998

'Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?'
This was my 100th review here, and I always wanted to write it about this one. About the last one, the one that explains it all. Or at least, almost all of it, because we still don't get to know what became of Ludo Bagman. Or if Gilderoy Lockhart ever regained his memory. Or if Oliver Wood ever made top of the league with Pride of Portree. But you know, you can't have everything. This is the book about the Golden Trio. For big parts of it, we are alone with them, three teenies in a tent who are the only ones with the knowledge of how to kill the most evil wizard of all time. They're alone, they almost always have no clues, no food, no allies, and they have no idea if the people they love are okay or even still alive. So people, don't judge Ron. I'd like to see how you behave if you have no idea whether your family is still alive, and are wearing a piece of Voldemort's soul around your neck. 
'He must have known I'd want to leave you.''No, he must have known you would always want to come back.'
This is also the book about Dumbledore and, as we only realise at the end, about Snape. We get to know their life stories, just like we got to know Voldy's in 'Half-Blood Prince'.And most of all, it's about Harry. About his thoughts, his motivations, his faults. About his mistakes, his extraordinary selflessness and shining cleverness. For it's not like we see it in most of the movies. It's not Hermione who always figures everything out. No, it's Harry. Hermione has the book knowledge, Ron has the word knowledge, but Harry is the one who figures all of it out. Because he trusts his gut and his instincts, which are almost always right. Plus, he finally gets to curse Umbridge.
'I'm going to keep going until I succeed — or die. Don't think I don't know how this might end. I've known it for years.'
Obviously, people are dieing in this one, but it's war, and I get why Rowling chose to kill the ones who died. I also love that final duel, the sheer beyond-everything-ever-before-epicness of it, something which in my opinion was a total catastrophe in the movie. As for the epilogue, well. I never felt it was too cheesy or something, but come on, Harry, why would you name your son after Dumbledore and Snape? Dumbledore manipulated you and was willing to sacrifice you, and Snape was still a total asshole. What about Hagrid? Lupin? That's people who would've deserved for you to name a child after them. Okay, so not Lupin cause it'd be strange for Teddy. Take Hagrid, then. Or Grawp. Or take Dobby. Oh, Dobby.This is the final book we deserved, with an epic ending and all of the characters at their best. Rowling had to fulfill such high expectations, I mean, I remember how everyone was waiting for this one. 'Winds of Winter' is nothing compared to this. People used to run into bookstores in the middle of the night to get their hands on this one as fast as possible. I remember reading it that same day, without eating anything until I'd finished it. It took me eight hours, and it didn't disappoint me at any point. 
'Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and, above all those who live without love.'
 To me, this is the perfect ending to the best series there ever was. Rowling has made a whole generation into readers with this series, and this is the worthy coronation. It's beyond competition. There's so much happening, so many threats, so many climaxes, so much heartbreak and so much love. 5 stars. ----Dialogue 5Setting 5Characters 6Writing Style 5Plot 5",43,0.6118,0.118,0.758,0.124,0.5373639455782312,POSITIVE,0.6442

110,3408945,07/23/2007,3.0,"Upon further reflection...I think this installment could have been much better. Perhaps Rowling was freaking out under the enormous pressure...never expecting her series to be so wildly adored by so many...Still, this book left something to be desired, I think. Rowling made so many predictable moves...and not even the ones that would have had more of an impact...Snape could have been the hero of the entire series, for example. It would have been rather ironic, considering the fact that he's been the object of every one's disdain--which would have made an outright act of heroism all the more outstanding. I understand that he made a significant contribution to Harry's safety, and Snape's storyline was heartbreaking and interesting...but he could have openly faced Voldermort. He could have raged and fought--he was a powerful wizard, after all... Snape should have gone out with a bang, I think--instead of a blood-soaked whimper. Also..The necklace around Ron's neck...bringing all of his envy and mistrust to the surface...Where have we seen this before? (just take a glance at the Lord of the Rings)...Harry and Ron have already had that fight about inequity in popularity...been there, done that...Why revisit it in such an awkward, hackneyed way?The gratuitous deaths also bother me. If you're going to kill a character off, kill one who is critical to Harry's development. Make Harry a three dimensional character! Do something earth-shattering to him! Also--merely showing a pile of dead bodies on the floor doesn't drive the point home. Some peripheral characters were cast off, as though their deaths were intended to evoke a certain emotion--yet they were clearly not considered important enough to be given more than a page of recognition upon their demise...What does that lead the reader to feel about those characters? Also, why the hell did Harry spend such a huge swath of the book sitting in a tent like a big doofus? Why didn't Rowling use all of those pages to illustrate the maturation of Harry's skill as a wizard--to give us some details as far as Voldemort was concerned...why wasn't there more conflict there? Why am I taking all of this so damn seriously is a better question...bleh.There were some interesting bits in this book. I guess it's time for me to state it--there's better young adult fantasy out there...series that deserve just as much, if not much more recognition...as they are better written, better rendered, etc. I do think of Harry Potter with fondness, however. Perhaps it's the combination of book and film...perhaps it's because so many friends of mine adore the books...I like them for their entertainment value...These are good pleasure reads--and could have been elevated to something much more. Perhaps my expectations were too high for this one. ",43,0.9826,0.09,0.76,0.15,0.5721650055370985,NEGATIVE,1.0
111,3232458,07/18/2007,2.0,"Too expository, same disjointed plotting as ever. Nothing particularly surprising or shocking. Gains more strength through familiar characters and nostalgia than from new developments or understandings. Smacks of the improbably untragic wars of any happy ending; though Rowling's wealth of secondary characters provides a little fodder.Character growth in the likes of Dumbledore, Neville, Kreacher, and the predictably D'arcy-like Snape provide the most interest in the book. Perhaps Rowling was more concerned with closure than constructing a more complex story. Then again, she may just be glad to be free of it after all these years. I do congratulate her on getting out while the getting was good.The epilogue particularly felt like an attempt to make an utter and unapologetic finish to the story. Unfortunately, it will likely not keep the questions at bay. I, myself, couldn't but wonder if the older Harry might have adopted a fatherly middle-class mustache. I'll have to pen a letter.Despite the claims that the books were plotted out and foreshadowed from the beginning, we get a lot of last-minute additions to the world to build toward a convenient plot coupon ending. Rowling was, more-or-less, beyond the power of editors, and I wish she had used that power to write an interesting, audacious book, but this ending was very safe, and free from the surprising plot twists Rowling sometimes managed.I guess she was trying to please her fans, but she had a lot of people to please. Hopefully she pleased some of them, but I was disappointed that as the series neared its end, it became less quirky and character-driven, and more predictable and cliche.My Fantasy Book Suggestions",42,0.9872,0.052,0.774,0.174,0.6133186705767353,NEGATIVE,1.0

JK ROWLING YOUR WRITING IS TOO AMAZING FOR US TO EVEN COMPREHEND. ❤️👏🏼❤️👏🏼❤️👏🏼❤️👏🏼❤️👏🏼❤️👏🏼❤️👏🏼❤️👏🏼❤️👏🏼❤️The great re-read of Harry Potter is now complete (for the fifth time), and here are my final thoughts on this perfect series. Don't even try to argue with me that it's not perfect because the fandom will get you...mafia style. This book does an incredible job of taking all the pieces from all of the previous novels and weaving them together into a beautiful and gorgeous conclusion for our characters. ""Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and, above all those who live without love""Even in death, Dumbledore gets a quote that helps to incapsulate an incredible theme from this beautiful book. Another reason why Rowling is a masterful genius. Here are my favorite things: 🧙🏻‍♀️ The Deathly Hallows themselves. I love how they are unveiled through a child's story. How poetic considering the journey for our characters and the majority of our readers started as children. 🧙🏻‍♀️ Hermoine. It's no question that she is forever my favorite, but this book is such an amazing testament to how clever, caring and kick-ass she is. She is always there to defend her friends but also call them out on the nonsense and keep their journey moving forward. To conclude, she is the best. 🧙🏻‍♀️All of our fallen heroes. I love that Rowling isn't scared to actually have fatal losses in a story. It shows us that we can move forward after a great loss. It shows us that we all have trials and pain and we next have to keep loving one another and fighting for life. I could list a million more things, but I think my opinion of this series and conclusion are pretty clear. It's the greatest epic fantasy of our generation. ❤️👏🏼📚",42,0.9963,0.082,0.677,0.241,0.6706140350877192,POSITIVE,0.9997

This is where I'm supposed to say ""the end"", or something profound about the closing of my journey with Harry Potter. I'm not going to. You see, the joy of reading is that there never really is an ending. Not really. For a simple reason. You can always go back to the beginning, revisit people you miss, rediscover those that have been lost, perhaps experience something new you may have not noticed the first time around. Or the second, or the third. There is always a chance for a new beginning. 
Always.
I'll see you again one day soon, at Hogwarts.

 ★★★★★ ALLL THE STARS


This series is for you if… , above all, you value to learn something about yourself and the world while getting lost in fictional texts.
⤐ Overall.I've spent the last reread enjoying this absolute masterpiece of a series alongside the magnificent Harry Potter and the Sacred Text and I could not have made a better choice in life, seriously. I think I recommended this podcast in every single review of the series and I think I will recommend ituntil my very last breath.(Although I am not pleased with Dumbledore)What makes this series so special is that it enabled people across generations to grow up and older with friends that never disappoint. No matter what sort of person you are in life, granted, there will be at least one if not even several characters in this series that you can identify with on a deeper level. Seriously, if you're unable to find anything between Luna and Umbridge that calls to you, what are you even doing?As Potterhead, you went to Hogwarts for the first time, visited the forbidden forest, defeated the basilisk, used the marauder's map, participated in a deadly tournament, rebelled against an ugly pink demon, felt the tensions growing up as a teenager that had to safe the world and also just navigate puberty and, lastly, realised that no sacrifice is too big for the ones you love.And if that isn't enough of a reason why grown-ups all over the world call themselves potterheads, then I'd love to rogelio-de-la-vega the heck out of you.⤐ What’s happening.

‘We're all human, aren't we? Every human life is worth the same, and worth saving.’

I do like the entire concept of Hogwarts and the wizard world, and I'll look back at Harry Potter with fondness, but, in this case, the films were better. The initial problem with this particular book, is that I felt like I had been reading it much too long. There were parts that dragged ridiculously, such as, the part where Harry was in the tent, and the part where the three friends were on the run. It became tedious, and I felt like I was waiting for something significant to happen. While the character development was adequate for the most part, it became highly evident to me in this book just how much of a coward Voldermort really is. Snape will always be my favourite character. He was misunderstood, and he didn't really have a shred of evil in his body. And then there's that epilogue. It was pretty cringey. I expected something more. I wanted to know about the other characters and what had happened to them. Maybe I expected too much here, or, maybe I should have read them when I was much younger.

122,1482090302,12/27/2015,5.0,"I don't think I will ever get over this series. Each book was definitely a trip down memory lane and I really enjoyed all the adventures that Harry, Ron and Hermione went on. It was definitely interesting to see them always being near or in trouble. It also made me fall back in love with so many characters and I honestly was never fully prepared for the heartbreak that followed after. I never will be either.Now you all know how much I love this trio but I'm just going to say that Neville was the light of my life in this one. Especially in the movie too - he's just way too adorable and I love how he was always going to stand up to the death eaters.

123,158806142,04/04/2011,1.0,"I wasn't happy with my previous review, and decided to re-write it.I will round all of my dislikings of this book to three things;1. The PlotholesOh, JK Rowling. You and your plotholes. Firstly, we have the issue brought up many times by others -- the time turner. I assume Minerva McGonagall had more of those, since she was able to just give Hermione one. Wouldn't they come in handy when everyone was dying? Why not turn back the clock and warn someone about what was going to happen? After all, as shown in the fourth book time is not set in the Harry Potter world.Secondly, we have the confusion of the ending. How did Harry come back to life? Can someone explain this to me? I thought his mother's love broke when he turned seventeen. How did Voldemort die, but he lived? Why can't Volemort kill a seventeen year old boy with seemingly infinite magical knowledge? The first four books it was cute how Harry kept escaping, but then it started to get confusing. Is there another magic at work here, besides Dumbldedores love? Can we make this more clear? Sigh. Believe me, love is cool and all, but love won't solve all your problems. What about hard work and perseverance? We have a little of that, but not as much as there should be. Love is the answer to everything, I guess, but there comes a time when you need to be practical. That time is when people are dying and you know, you're seventeen and not eleven and you're a chosen one and hey, things are starting to get serious.2. Hermione Granger's Lonely Hearts ClubI really wanted to use that. Moving on,I admit, I ship her with Harry. However, that is not why I'm miffed at her ending up with Ron. From book one, Ronald Weasly has belittled her, underestimated her, called her stupid, annoying, hinted that she was ugly, ignored her, yet begged her to do his homework, and promptly not proved that he deserved her affections at all.And yet, we have book seven, they're supposed to be in love????Now, I'm not going to pretend like she hasn't been mean to him too, but let's face it -- Hermione was never a jerk towards Ron without reason. He usually always did something to provoke her first, like call her a know it all, ask her to the Yule ball at the last moment, say that she has no friends, imitate her, act as if he was above her and generally be a prat with the ""emotional range of a teaspoon"" as she so fittingly states.We are not given any reason as to why she should be in love with Ron. We are just told that she is. That bugs me.3. Why Do Donuts Have To DieMaybe that last title was a bit random. By donuts, I mean excessive amounts of minor characters.I know it isn't meant to be this way, but to me as the reader, it seems that JK Rowling killed off a lot of minor characters to sub for one major character. Since I didn't like any of the minor characters she killed off, I guess it seemed gratuitous to me. I mean, I just didn't care that much. Granted, there are casualties in war, but it seemed like she was showing this off at the end to seem badass. It didn't work. It was just annoying.BONUS TIME!4. Some Scars Can't Be SeenWhere's the emotional scarring? Everybody ends up happily married at the end, as if a horrible war hadn't taken place but twenty years earlier. They were tortured for the love of god -- some of them were even locked in a dark cellar for weeks on end! Tell me that isn't scarring. Please do.In conclusion,I gave the book one star for a reason. Despite that, there are some things I did like about it;1. Snape!2. Dean, Luna, and Oliver.3. ...Snape?4. We got a lot of Harry/Hermione bonding scenes, even if they were ignored.I'm sure there were other things, but I can't remember them/am too lazy to go into them right now.Keep in mind, I like the Harry Potter series and think JK Rowling is a pretty decent author. But this book just didn't do it for me.",39,0.9855,0.111,0.743,0.146,0.509736811391223,NEGATIVE,0.9997

“Words are, in my not-so-humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic. Capable of both inflicting injury, and remedying it.”

I cried once this entire series, and for a reason that seems minimal in comparison to the extent of everything that happened. When Harry tells his son that he was named after Severus Snape--the bravest man he knew--I was done for. Harry’s maturity in being able to forgive Snape, and Snape finally being appreciated by someone--by a Potter no less--IT’S TOO GOOD!The Deathly Hallows was far from anything I expected going in. Our main trio was away from Hogwarts for the majority of this novel, which I eventually got used to. The absence of characters who died previously in the series felt like a gaping hole in my heart, which is to say I was not ready for what took place.Rowling’s writing was great as always. The tone was nothing short of perfect for a middle grade series, and Harry’s narrative does a wonderful job of conveying emotions to the reader. While I did miss the presence of a lot of Hogwarts characters, I eventually grew to like the way Harry was always on the move and interacting with newly introduced characters.Something I’ve loved about the past two books in this series is the prominence of backstory. I love discovering more about the adult characters in particular, as there’s always something to uncover in their younger days that adds to their intrigue. It was great to get more on Snape, Lily and Dumbledore in particular. The final fifth of this book held my attention really firmly; the last bit of drama and action always seems to elevate each instalment by a significant amount for me. While the ending after the final battle did seem a bit abrupt, and the time jump of 20 years for an epilogue lasting only a few pages was rather short, I’m not altogether unhappy with the ending. I wish there was more of the students in their teenage years recovering from the war rather than the abrupt switch to having everyone married with children.Overall I do thing the quest for horcruxes made for a great concluding book, as the plot never relented! While I was upset over the fate of certain characters (3 of my 4 favourite characters are unfortunately dead... ) I can’t say I didn’t enjoy this story as a whole. A well executed finale indeed!

It has, once again, been an emotional rollercoaster filled with magic, mystery, moments and more. I feel honoured that I get to be a part of Harry’s life and live with him as he makes friends, loves and solves the big puzzle that is Lord Voldemort.

128,1920216498,02/21/2017,5.0,"All good things must come to an end. It is hard to forget where I was when Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was released and I read the epic conclusion to the heptology. My daughter turns thirteen this week, the same as this book, and a friend who worked at the library saved me a copy, the first from the library to read it. With two kids under two, I still managed to read the entire book in under thirty six hours in between naps, baths, and meal times. Harry’s tale was complete, and I moved on with my life, rereading the series time after time after time as I navigated motherhood with four kids in five years. The kids got older, old enough to read and reread Harry on their own as I moved toward more literary fiction and nonfiction tomes. As the kids moved closer to that magic age eleven, I began to view the series as a kids series and no longer read it every time I needed a tonic to pep up my life. While I engaged with the kids in the same questions that me and my friends have asked for years, I did not necessarily partake in reading Harry with them as I let the kids savor the books for themselves. Adults in the real muggle world lead busy lives, busier than even that of Harry and his friends, making time that we do have precious, and the idea of rereading a book may not have the same appeal as it did when we had our entire lives in front of us. Reading is supposed to be pleasureful, something J.K. Rowling taught us from the moment Hagrid knocked down the door to the hut at sea and told Harry that he was a wizard. Late last year I proposed to a group of women that we reread Harry in 2020. There is never enough time to savor the series as we should but each of us could take as long as we needed to read through Harry’s magical world once again. Then in March, time seemed to have stopped and like the time turner allowed us to have extra time to read as we stayed home and navigated a real world crisis. Many things are wrong or sad about the year 2020, but making the decision to reenter the wizarding world of Harry Potter is looking, in Ron’s words, bloody brilliant. Like he has countless other times, Harry Potter and his fictional world and fight against evil has been with me in 2020, a time when I desperately needed some magic in my life. I had timed my own reread to finish on Harry and J.K. Rowling’s birthday July 31, but like I did way back in 2007, I could not resist and finished in a little over a day of reading. Harry indeed saved the day again. J.K. Rowling has noted many times that Harry Potter is about death and how the living have taken to heart. She did not lead the happiest childhood, and Harry has been her way of coping and grieving. In the each of the first six books a key character or magical creature dies, leaving the living to deal with the consequences surrounding the death and how to move on with their lives. No where was this more clear than at the end of the fifth book where Harry grappled with Sirius’ demise and reviewed the prophecy with Dumbledore multiple times. Dumbledore buffeted Harry’s mood by noting that even if there was no prophecy, would he not want to honor the memories of his parents and loved ones by continuing the fight against Voldemort and the Death Eaters. The answer is a clear yes, that Harry by age fifteen has friends worth fighting for and he would do all in his power to defeat Voldemort once and for all. The seventh book does indeed have a war and lots of death, some more painful to read about than others. Yet, the seventh book also brings together all the peripheral characters, places, spells, and creatures who comprised the first six books in an epic conclusion. It may be about death, but the Deathly Hallows is Harry’s quest toward coronation as the Boy Who Lived, a tale compelling enough that even a mother of four adolescent and teenaged kids can read it in a little over a day. While the final two hundred pages are action packed, Rowling begins the tale with a parting of ways and later a wedding. We find out that Dudley actually had fond feelings for Harry, and later through interviews, find out that Rowling went back and forth as to whether Dudley should have a magical child. She ultimately decided against it, but I believe the idea of Dudley fathering a magical child is what this series is all about- teaching children and older readers that all creatures should be viewed as equals, that it is does not matter if one comes from a muggle, half blood, or pure blood parentage, and that it is not abilities that make a person who they are but their actions toward their fellow humanity. With all the fan fiction in the world, it would be intriguing if Dudley ever did have a magical child and what the consequences would be for his family. Yet, in book seven, as we are about to enter the grand climax, the treatment of muggle born witches and wizards and elf’s and goblins and all those deemed inferior are the stark difference between Harry and Voldemort, how they view their fellow creatures and the consequences of these actions. That Harry and Voldemort came from similar backgrounds is not to be overlooked either, as it becomes clear that Harry exhibits, in Dumbledore’s words, one in a million, empathy, whereas the former Tom Riddle does not possess a bit of remorse. As such, the long battle over souls and control of the magical universe begins. No one said that the journey would be easy. Ron even noted that it wasn’t like they were going to find one Horcrux a day. That would have been too easy. The friendship of Harry, Ron, and Hermoine is tested to the limits, but as is this series is at heart for kids, Rowling would never allow the trio to separate; that would be too painful to take. Dumbledore knew each of their strengths, leaving each the tools they would need to ultimately complete the quest. They penetrate the outer reaches of magic, something farthest from the minds of most other seventeen year olds with their whole lives ahead of them. They are prepared to die if it means creating a world where all creatures are free to live freely. Whereas on the surface, Harry Potter is a series for middle grade and young adult readers, this ultimate book contains mature thinking topics that I wonder if the series should be read again when the teenaged reader is nineteen years older and can appreciate the scope of its depth. Rowling studied Lord of the Rings, Shakespeare, Arthurian legends, and other classic tales to develop the names and themes for her novels. In one small segment I noticed a passage that could have been borrowed from Lord of the Rings and another that could have been borrowed from Return of the Jedi. That J.K. Rowling takes ideas from each of these tales and weaves a more complex one of her own speaks to the brilliance of her as a writer and Harry as an epic hero. As the book and series come to a close, Harry is indeed the one in a million man that Dumbledore envisioned him to be, the one who could bring down the dark arts once and for all. Harry defeating Voldemort has become more emotional for me with each passing reading. We know nineteen years later that Harry marries Ginny and Ron marries Hermoine and all of them lead relatively normal adult lives. In the defining moment, where evil is defeated once and for all and families faced with uncertain futures are reunited, one can not help but shed tears of joy, especially in the uncertain times we are living in now. What makes this magical series appropriate for adults with busy lives is the end, where Harry, Ginny, Ron, and Hermoine along with their school friends see their kids off to the Hogwarts Express. The adults turn wistful and giddy for their time spent at school, giving them cause to pause from their busy lives and perhaps reenter Hogwarts for a day or two to relive the magical memories of their youth. While there has not been much cause for celebration in 2020, reentering Harry Potter’s wizarding world has been the most joyous times for me this year. J.K. Rowling has created a series for the ages, one where the reader can slow down time and relive the magic again and again while creating new memories with their families over the years. Even though the series may be about death, in 2020, Harry Potter has been about the magic of life that I needed so desperately to help me through this unprecedented year.

130,858762188,02/18/2014,5.0,"Aaaaand it's over. Again.And I'm utterly shattered, but I'm also in a state of ecstasy because of how the many pieces of the puzzle the Harry Potter series is fitted. Seriously, I can't think of no other series of book so cautiously planned, in which all the details are important and everything - everything - makes sense in the way this does in the end.It was about time I truly appreciated what a fantastic world J.K. Rowling created with this series. As I had said before, I didn't really love this series before this reread - I simply liked it, and that was enough for me to not get the fweels and not to be in pain because of all the deaths that happened.Deaths which, by the way, made the book better and worse at the same time. Worse because duh, characters we learned to love no longer were; and better... because well, doesn't that prove how brave an author Rowling is? She doesn't go the safe, sugar-coated way. She goes in the painful and realistic one, even though this was not supposed to be a book for adults.This book is not my favourite in the series (that place goes for both The Goblet of Fire and The Prisoner of Azkaban), but it's still brilliant. The plot gets more complex than before, it's more action-packed and intense, and all the loose strings in the series finally get attached, that is to say, the missing explanations are given and the last twists delivered, some of which include this:Oh, Snape. A complex character, that one was. I never hated him. I admit sometimes I loathed him when he was unfair towards his students, but it was passing anger and I got over it; besides, he was a damn genius in Potion-making and magic in general. Now after reading book 7, I realised I actually feel kind of bad for him. All the life he didn't have... and all because he wallowed in his past.I'm eternally grateful for my decision of rereading this series. During it, I infected my brothers with HP obsession love, and I finally became one of those people who see the world of HP as real as our Muggle world, because as Albus Dumbledore said,Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?It'd be a lie if I say I'll never get over this series - I've gotten over worse things (i.e. The Monstrumologist) - but nonetheless I'll never forget about this journey, and of course, I'll always keep it in my heart, no matter how cheesy and unlike me that sounds.",37,-0.9823,0.166,0.713,0.12,0.6031125356125357,POSITIVE,0.9762

I'll never forget this book for the emotions it manages to exude in each and every scene. I'll never forgive it for that, either. Hogwarts features far less here, than in the previous six books, which only makes our final return to it feel all the more poignant. The wonderful ending, and the tears I shed over it, served to encapsulate what this entire series promotes and what makes it so eternally powerful and beloved.

134,1314792861,06/22/2015,5.0,"POSSIBLE SPOILERSRating:After all this book has put me through and has been dragged through itself, it deserves a 5 star rating. Especially since it is the conclusion to such a beautiful series.Plot:My Blurb:Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived, The Chosen One, is supposed to be in his last year at Hogwarts, enjoying the time with his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.Instead, he has been forced to grow up fast, suffering through death, hardships, and even duels.Still stricken by the death of one of the most important people in his life, Harry sets off with Ron and Hermione to find the remaining Horcruxes that will destroy Lord Voldemort.The task proves a daunting one, but with the help of his friends, and some unknown people, he may be able to succeed.If he does, he may finally be able to put an end to the evil in his world, creating a better place for all.My Commentary:This book.This. Book.It killed me.Harry and his friends have to go through a lot of crap in this book. The bias, the society, the prejudice.Harry has to hide his face everywhere he goes, even at Bill and Fleur's wedding. Almost everyone is against him, and those who we think are with him, well, some of them end up betraying the trust. Some of them are people we would never expect that from. And then there are the people who we thought for sure were against Harry but end up being on his side.I can't even express how much this book infuriated, overjoyed, excited, scared, and everything me.Characters:Harry Potter:Harry is still pretty perfect. He forgives Dumbledore, he forgives Snape, he forgives Ron, he tries to save Peter Pettigrew, he saves Draco and his cronies, he even gives Voldemort a chance. I mean, seriously, this guy? Amazing.Harry knows what it takes to save everyone; he knows very well that this could end in his death. But he is willing to sacrifice that if it means keeping everyone else safe.For that, I admire him as a character and as a person. His development throughout this series is incredible and the changes he brings to the Wizarding world are even greater.Ron Weasley:Ron has to once again deal with the pressure of being The Boy Who Lived's best friend. He has to fight his feelings for one of his best friends since he does not want to hurt his other friend. He is struggling still to find his own destiny without being shadowed by Harry Potter's. He's not really sure where he fits into all the plans until he finds it himself.Hermione Granger:Hermione. God, Hermione. She is so fierce, so strong, so passionate. She changes her parents' memories to be like she never existed. If that's not a savage move right there, I don't know what is. She sticks with Harry even when Ron gives up on him, and she does not waver from the quest. She knows what they need to do and she is not ready to surrender.Ginny Weasley:I love this girl. She is not afraid to kick butt or to show that she can. She will defend herself and the people she loves until she can't anymore. She is so much like Harry; they are the perfect match.She, Luna, and Neville, along with a ton of other Hogwarts students, kept the D.A. running so that they could support Harry from afar. That is just so great. I love Ginny.Luna Lovegood:Luna Lovegood? Oh! You mean my favorite character EVER? That Luna Lovegood?She is eccentric and odd, but with that brings her uniqueness and strength. She is her own person completely and does not hesitate to express herself. Even when held captive, Luna does not waver but spends her time trying to find a way to escape with the others. Harry admires her so, Ron thinks she is just the greatest thing, and Hermione is one of her best friends. Luna's personality is so great, and I wish I had someone like her in my life.Neville Longbottom:Neville, the awkward, clumsy, dim Neville Longbottom, has transformed into a hero. He helped Harry defeat Voldemort. Not in a small, cheesy way, but in a HUGE, nessecary way. He was scared and impressionable, but he helped the D.A. and the journey to defeating Voldemort in an incredible way.I just love this chubby, awkward kid. And I love Matthew Lewis in the movies but for reasons other than his personality. . . .Draco Malfoy:He is just one of those villains I can't bring myself to hate. His personality was terrible, yes, but beneath all of that, he was a vulnerable boy whose choices were fogged by his parents. He did not get to choose who he was. His entire life, he spent it shadowed in the legacy of his father, Lucius Malfoy, the Death Eater.He was not evil. He wasn't really a villain.He was the son who never got a choice. He was a young man who needed a second chance. He was a student, like all others, who needed to learn. He was just a boy who needed saving, even if he didn't want to admit it.Plus I ship Dramione, so there's that.Fred Weasley:*sniff**stifles sobs*George Weasley:I cannot express my love for these twins. My sympathy for George is immeasurable. For the whole family it is.I don't think George is ever ok after what happens in the Battle of Hogwarts. I don't think he ever healed wholly, but I do believe that his family helped him. He found a wife, I know, and they had 2 kids. Roxanne and Fred.Of course, there was Fred. Of course he cried, he hurt, he yelled. Of course his children wondered why their dad cried and why their mum had to comfort him. Fred wanted to know whose memeories it was that made his dad smile. George told his kids stories, I'm sure. They know who Uncle Fred is, even if they won't meet him.I hope George got better. I really do.Bill and Fleur Weasley:Geez, The Golden Trio owes Bill and Fleur their lives. He kept them safe when they barely escaped from death. They healed Hermione after she was tortured. They . . . gave up the spot in their yard . . . I can't . . .Percy Weasley:I had honestly forgotten about Percy until he showed up again. In the beginning books, I liked him, then I hated him, and now I love him. He's still not a huge character, but he is sorry, and he has a heart, which is what matters.Molly Weasley:This lady. She accepted Harry as her own even when her family was already so big. She would do anything for her family. She was devestated when she lost one, she was fierce when she fought for one, and she loved when she saw all of them.She was ready to sacrifice herself for her children and she used the only mildly violent curse word in the whole series for herself. Of course, there were Ron's frequent outbursts, but really, Molly gets the fame.She took on Bellatrix for her daughter. And! And! She defeated her!Molly Weasley, everyone.Arthur Weasley:His excitement with the Muggle world is great. He has such a curious mind that wants to explore everything. This is usually something reserved for a child, but Arthur has it too.Remus Lupin:The last Marauder standing. I guess a group that tight knit must all have similar destinies.He is such an amazing guy. All around. Sure there were times where I was annoyed with him because he didn't appreciate Tonks, or he was going to leave his son, or he was going to sacrifice everything, but in the end, I cried for him.When he asked Harry to be the godfather for his son, I was so touched. I had so many feelings combined into one ball of emotion, and I'll admit that I teared up.He would be such a wonderful dad, no matter what he thought.He may have denied his love for Tonks, but it did show in this book. It was a messy, complicated relationship, but beautiful nonetheless.Nymphadora Tonks:Tonks is supportive, protective, and determined. Her first thought in the battle was of her husband's safety, and their journeys finished together. They brought a new life into the world, and yes, their son may be confused as to why his mum and dad left him, but he will be loved. He will have Andromeda, Harry, Hermione, Ron, Ginny, the kids, everyone.Anyway, this is about Tonks, not Teddy. She is hilarious too. Her hair and her features and ""Don't call me Nymphadora.""Oh, Tonks . . .Severus Snape:Snape, Snape, Severus Snape.So . . . Some of you are going to hate me for saying this but . . .I still don't really like him.*winces* Is it over?I know, I know! His story, Lily, jealousy! Yes, it's all very heartbreaking, and I like him a lot more than I used to, but I still don't really like him.All those years, he was terrible to Harry. Maybe it was to protect him, because he reminded Snape of the Potters. I don't deny that, but at the same time, just because Snape loved Lily, I can't forgive him for all he has done.Snape was Neville's boggart. His biggest fear.Harry was not scared of Snape as Neville was, no, but he was intimidated by him.James Potter may have been a bully when he was a teenager, but Snape grew into a bully. Snape chose the dark arts over Lily; James changed for the woman he loved. That was the difference.Not that I'm glad Snape is gone, because I think he deserved a chance to redeem himself to Harry or prove that he wasn't evil, but I after going through all the tormenting with Harry though the books, I just can't bring myself to forgive him as Harry did.Harry, you are a much more forgiving person than I.Minerva McGonagall:She is such a savage, this lady. Her wizard mind tricks (and physical tricks) are what make her so cool. My love for her can't be expressed in words. And when she was upset about Harry, I loved her even more.She is such a fierce lady and she should he headmaster. I don't know what I would do without her. Haha.Voldemort:He comes last. Ol' Voldy. Probably the most evil of them all. Except for Umbridge of course. But this isn't about her.I think that he thought what he was doing was ok. He thought it was for the good of the Wizarding World. It was not, but he didn't know. His childhood and adulthood were demented and tortured. He didn't know what was wrong and what was right.Harry gave him a chance to apologize for his wrongdoings. Harry gave him a chance to be human again.Voldemort didn't want to be human. He wanted to be the monster he was. But in the end, he died with ""mundane finality"", showing that he was really just Tom Riddle.Author:Good old JK. She is so brilliant. Her story is an inspiring one that proves to everyone that nothing is really impossible if you have enough nerve. If we're quoting Ginny.She went through such a dark time, but she turned it around. Now she is a wife, a mother, she is happy. And that's all anyone could ever ask for: happiness.Recommended To:I doubt there are many people who haven't read Harry Potter, but I didn't read it for the first time until now, and that's WAY behind everyone else, just like I tell you about below. But everyone needs to read these books.Overall:This was my last read of 2015. It was a great finale. The twists, the turns, and the loops send you for a wild ride in this book. I could not have asked for a better conclusion to Harry Potter and to 2015.I am definitely glad I read them. Most people read these when they were 9 or 10. I did start the first book in 3rd or 4th grade, I think, but I didn't really enjoy it. Now, I am glad I picked them up. Thank God for my neighbor who lent them and the movies to me or I never would have gone back to these books. I would have remembered picking them up and ended it there. Now I have completed the reading, no matter how long it took me, but it finally happened!I may not have grown up with these books or had them shape my life, but they have built within me a deeper appreciation for literature itself, those who did shape their lives around these books, and for the great novelty of this series.Everyone needs to know the story of Harry Potter, his friends, his family, his determination, his passion, his forgiveness, his selflessness, his bravery, his sacrifice, and most of all, his strength. Because his strength, will make you stronger. And everyone could use a little more strength.For lack of any possibly better word, this was a truly magical series.",35,0.9998,0.11,0.686,0.204,0.5843495747751067,POSITIVE,0.9225
135,150065587,02/23/2011,4.0,"Relevance AlertThis is not a review of the book.My comments specifically relate to a scene in and a song from the soundtrack to the first Deathly Hallows film.Sexuality Content WarningI originally posted a version of my comments in a GR discussion about sexuality and Harry Potter.If you are the sort of reader who thinks these two issues should never be associated with each other, please do not read on. I don't want to spoil your world view.Sexuality, Adolescence and Harry PotterOne of the funny things about the original discussion and the response to it is the lack of recognition of how important sexuality actually (and overtly) is to HP, especially later in the series.It defies me how people expect someone to write about or think about or progress through adolescence without considering sex or sexuality.Heartstring Wands and Love TrianglesFor me, HP is a love triangle in which there is enormous sexual tension around who will end up with Hermione by the time they escape the chains of adolescence.Obviously, JKR for her own reasons avoids the obvious temptation to let Harry end up with Hermione.However, right up until the last moment, there is some doubt as to whether Ron will get the girl.It's totally misguided to think that HP's adolescent audience isn't right on top of this issue.In fact, they're probably way ahead of most adults in the audience (including me).Let's DanceIn the first Deathly Hallows film, Harry and Hermione dance together, while Ron remains banished in the wild.This was a tipping point in the story, when Hermione might possibly have reversed her sexual selection.When I saw the film, a whole group of kids burst out laughing in this scene.I still don't know whether I missed something (was it Harry's seriousness or clumsiness?), but I was too busy concentrating on the soundtrack and trying to work out its significance.The Ship Song[I wrongly thought] the song was Nick Cave's ""The Ship Song"", which was the last thing I expected to hear in a HP film.It's a great melody, but if you have a look at the lyrics, you have to wonder what was intended by the director, at least.http://www.stlyrics.com/songs/n/nickc...Did Harry create a ""little mystery"" with Hermione?Did Hermione loose her dogs on Harry? Or let her hair hang down?Did Harry have to remove her wings, so that she could try to fly in her own right?Did Hermione have to escape Harry's legendary pull, so she could find happiness?I wish I could have asked those kids.Post Script:I just asked my 12 year old daughter why people laughed at that scene, and she said (in this order) ""because they weren't together"" (i.e., a recognised couple) and ""because they were goofy"".

136,403852352,08/30/2012,5.0,"Re, re, re... re-read! As you can see, this is not the first time I’ve re-read this amazing series. However, I think it is the first time I’ve done all seven books in one month, and it is glorious! Somehow, the film versions have a tendency to assert themselves in my recollection, and although I do really like them, and have visited the studios several times to great fun, they are not as good as the novels, especially from book 4 onward. All those little details, and well, the big ones of course, make all the difference. I absolutely LOVE this world and characters and shall keep coming back :O)------------The final book!Gosh, I can remember actually queueing for this one at Waterstones Piccadilly, something I had never done before (or since) but it was too big an event to miss. I arrived late evening and spent the next 7 hours with people of all ages and nationalities, all enamoured with Rowling's characters. It was absolutely brilliant!!!!!So, anyway, what about the book? Following on from the Half-Blood Prince, this last instalment is full of action, suspense, revelations and battles. It is war, after all. Some people do the right thing for the wrong reason, or indeed the wrong thing for the right one. Many scenes echo the ones seen in the Philosopher’s Stone, with visits to Diagon Alley, Gringots Bank, the Sorting Hat, Olivander, the four school Houses, Hogwarts’s Ghosts, etc. Our trio has a hard time finding out what to do - which items did Voldemort choose for his Horcruxes and where could they be? And what are the Deathly Hallows? - but that just made it more believable.The characterisation was spot on, not just for our group, but also for Dumbledore, who comes across as being much more complex (and flawed) than imagined. Our favourite teachers are still there and we finally find out Snape’s secret. And Neville, my favourite secondary character, shows his mettle and shines! His gran appears here too and what a spunky sight she is!A word about Molly Weasley as promised. I loved that Rowling went against the stereotype of making her ‘weak' as would be suggested by her motherly behaviour. In fact, Molly is one hell of a strong witch as becomes apparent in this book, and which was hinted in the series by the many parallels shown with Ginny. It seems the girls ‘have' it in the Weasley family. In fact, Rowling tackles quite a few roles. In her universe, it is ok to be intelligent, love books and the library, or be the funny sidekick, or the shy one, or the slightly weird one. Courage comes in many guises and can be found in the seemingly most unlikely places. Finally, I truly love this series and shall keep coming back to it, again and again, to lose myself in this incredible and amazing universe full of beloved characters. Although I haven’t given all the books the maximum score, the series as a whole definitely deserves the 5 stars :O)",35,0.9919,0.074,0.786,0.14,0.5307219662058373,POSITIVE,0.9991

Someone throw Snape in the dumpster on their way out, thx)21/10/2017I started a marathon reread of the Harry Potter series thirteen days ago in preparation for a Harry Potter trivia night (we came second, for those of you who care). I made it to within 15 pages of the end before I had to run out the door or risk missing the tram. HARRUMPH. Anyway. I finished my marathon reread when I got home from trivia at 11pm. I cried over the scene between Harry and Ron. Again. I cried over Fred. Again. I *nearly* cried over Luna and the patronuses scene again, and only didn't because I already had my make up on and no time to fix it if I ended up with mascara all over my damn face. I love everything about this freaking book. The end. 24/12/2016I cried. Again. But over weird things this time?? I cried over the scene where Harry's struggling to produce a patronus because it's the middle of the Battle of Hogwarts and he can't think of anything happy, and Luna - patronus leading the way - tells him that they're all still there, they're all still fighting. FEELINGS. FEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELINGS. 31/12/2015Frankly, I'm impressed that I managed to cram this one into the last three days of the year, because I desperately wanted to finish the series this year. And I did - with four hours to spare. *high fives self*For some reason, this reread brought a hell of a lot of emotions with it. The developing relationship between Ron and Hermione gave me feels. Harry's reaction to Lupin turning up gave me feels. All the deaths gave me feels, obviously. Neville proving himself to be a true Gryffindor and his grandmother's pride in him gave me feels. McGonagall's pride and heartbreak over Harry gave me feels. Dumbledore's backstory gave me feels. And I may have broken down and sobbed during the scene between Ron and Harry that I mentioned below. Basically, this book is perfection, and it's hands down my favourite of the series. Now let's just go ahead and pretend that Snape redemption plot never happened... 29/6/2014Everything I said last time around still stands. But one of the things I find most interesting about Deathly Hallows is getting to see the other side of Dumbledore. In the other six books, he's basically presented as this massive force for good, who would never make dubious decisions or do the wrong thing or endanger his students. But here? Here we see that Dumbledore operated in the grey areas of morality as much as anyone. Which is one of those interesting things that comes with age - realising that your teachers and your heroes aren't infallible. They're human. 18/3/2013There are literally no words for how much I adore this book. It takes a lot in a book to make me cry (almost nothing, however, when it comes to movies and TV shows...), and yet Deathly Hallows reduces me to a weeping mess every time I read it. That said, the epilogue grates a little more every time - it just feels slightly sloppy or a little too neat and tidy or SOMETHING.That said, I love how there are so many tendrils to the story that have been gradually developed over the previous six books, and how expertly they're all pulled together here. Neville becomes more of a BAMF with every reading, and I will never not cheer for Molly Weasley screaming ""NOT MY DAUGHTER, YOU BITCH"" at Bellatrix. While I know a lot of people get all ""Harry Potter and the Prolonged Camping Trip"" about the central portion of the book, those same people likely would have been upset or annoyed if they had, as Harry yells at Ron, been finding a Horcrux a week and home safe and sound by Christmas. Besides, the prolonged camping trip leads to what is arguably my favourite moment in the entire series - Ron destroying the locket, then breaking down in tears, and Harry saying ""She's like my sister. I love her like a sister and I reckon she feels the same way about me. It's always been like that. I thought you knew."" It's such a simple moment, such a small thing. But for me, it says so much about Ron, about Harry, and about the honesty that underpins their friendship. In summary, twenty years from now, people will say to me ""After all this time?"". And my reply will be ""Always.""",34,-0.9898,0.132,0.784,0.084,0.4495824175824177,POSITIVE,0.9808

Especially Deathly Hallows. First, as an ""semi"" adult (I'm not that old, bless my soul), I am more comfortable with my emotions, so that I was able to connect with (not joking) every single character. And second, the last time I read this book was in my high school years, and as such the actual (and horribe) death toll of the war was long forgotten. For the most part, it was like experiencing those deaths for the first time (yet again). And while I was aware of the main deaths (I could never forgot those), their loss was even harder for me to bear. It's like every emotion in me has doubled (or even tripled) in intensity. I usually devour books in the blink of an eye, but alas, JKR had other plans in mind while writing this book. Any attempt made by me at continuous reading was repeatedly and mercilessly thwarted by my constant need to ugly cry every other page or so.Regardless of the drama and all the controversies involving JKR at the moment, there is absolutely no doubt that she is a literary genius. HP shaped our generation by instilling in its readers values of the utmost importance, and which are sadly diminishing in recent years.

Big D is able to see past the lies his parents fed him with his entire life. Perfect closure. I really wanted Petunia to say some nice things to Harry as well, but I felt that it would probably be extremely OOC for her to do so :/ I understand she was jealous of Lily for being a witch and took it out on her son, a constant presence and a constant reminder of what she could never have and could never be.

141,7692497,10/13/2007,5.0,"What can I say but genius? All along I have considered myself a mild Harry Potter fan, but once you get to the end and Rowling wraps up all the minute details she plants from book one you cannot help but be amazed at her creativity. Building on each of the books, writing each one at a slightly higher level as the characters grow up, all the details, and lets not forget the insignificant matter of the entire world evolving to hold a joint consciousness of Harry Potter. Children's literature has boomed and for that alone I give her immense credit. We are finally rewarded with Ron and Hermione. I am finally justified in Snape being my favorite character. We get to see the emotion to McGonagall and the history of Dumbledore. And of course, we finally, after 4100 pages, get to see the face off between good and evil, see what powers truly lie in Harry, and discover how strong our own allegiance to the boy really are. Rowling satisfies both camps on Harry's fate (without having to scar the boy with a task like Snape's) and even me who cared more about Snape's destiny than Harry's.  Yes the book is long and there are a few scenes in the Forest of Deans and at Bill & Fleur's that drag, but they are spaced out and there is so much else packed in to reward you for a few pages spent just as frustrated as the hero trio. Besides my favorite scene happens in that lonely forest when Harry finds the sword. But once the action winds back to Hogwarts, the book is nearly impossible to put down. The wand loyalties could have been explained better, but overall the complexity of the plot and resolution were impressive.The emotion in the book is so strong. Maybe it's that after all these years and all these books, you feel so committed to the characters, but you can't help but feel so full of emotion, and even I'll admit it cry, at the height of the story. I don't think there's an emotion you don't feel in reading this book, but the strongest one is in the end when you have to close the book and say goodbye to the chapter in your life tied up in the story. I can't read this book without feeling sad at the end that it is over.My favorite thing about book 7 is the way it ends, back at King's Cross where your view shifts from seeing Harry's adventures as a lost 11-year-old about to have a fantastic journey to a caring adult guiding a broken boy through the pain and challenges he is about to endure and conquer on this spectacular journey.

142,24132880,06/10/2008,1.0,"I waited 9 years for Rowling to do the right thing and kill off the Christ Figure, you know, like the *professional* writers do. Don't get me wrong, Harry was my favorite character--brave, deeply loyal, naturally talented--all wonderful qualities not meant for this foul Earth. I wanted him to die in his prime, to be celebrated in song, like all the great heros before him. Alas...Rowling didn't write so much a novel, as she did a Hollywood screenplay! Complete with lame wincing juvenile lines like the one uttered by Molly Weasley to Bellatrix LeStrange in the Battle for Hogwarts, ""Not my daughter, you BITCH!"" A line meant to draw applause, cheers, and laughter from a bunch of teenagers in a darkened movie theater, not a line that would have been used by the prim and proper mother, Molly Weasley, that we grew to know and love in books 1-6.The book could have been better edited as there were long stretches of BORING reading throughout. It's as if Rowling just ran out of creative juices in the end and chose to let her fans write the final book for her. She inserted ""PotterWatch"" as a nod to the PotterCasters(PotterCast and MuggleCast), and she wrote in a nude scene for Harry Potter, as a nod to Daniel Radcliffe's nude stint in Equus. The whole *camping out in the forest waiting for something to happen* part was NOT something I expected after Book 6, when it was shown with such great care how Voldemort had hidden the locket horcrux. I can't believe they are making 2 films out of this, the crappiest book in the series!Oh, and that Epilogue, where to begin? If Rowling sent out apology letters to all her fans for writing it, that still wouldn't be enough of an atonement! The woman should be tarred, feathered, drawn, and quartered for that criminally putrid Epilogue! The visual of a middle aged Harry Potter waiting at the train station to get to his 9 to 5 job was the let-down of the century. I loved Harry because he was special and because of his aura of destiny! I loved that, despite his emotionally abusive childhood, he chose to become a decent human being, instead of following Tom Riddle's path of evil and bitterness! I loved that, when presented with a challenge, he almost always chose to do the right and moral thing, over what was easy. I didn't want to see him become a regular, boring adult, with a lame, humdrum life, he was too talented, too moral, too heroic for all of that mundane crap!",33,0.9952,0.067,0.749,0.184,0.5598649716296776,NEGATIVE,1.0

Last year I failed, but this one I fulfill my promise. I already feel nostalgia that this series is over and maybe, in many years, I'll hop back on the Hogwarts train to meet again with Harry and his friends.This book is so sad. Harry and his friends are in danger as Voldemort and the Death Eaters walk at ease, killing who they want and chasing their opponents. No one is safe. Everyone is afraid. That is why Harry is determined to finish with the task that Dumbledore left him and with the greatest secrecy, he will be in charge of eliminating the rest of the horcruxes with the help of Ron and Hermione.With more than 600 pages, we have a relative calm before things get very bad and that's why the book may have an irregular pacing. I really liked learning more about the past of characters like Albus Dumbledore and all the mystery about the Deathly Hallows. As the plot unfolds, the motivations of the characters and their relationships are developed more: tension and fear are problems for Harry and his friends and the deaths of friends and family will be hard to bear.The novel takes us to a grand finale. I only had the referent of the 2011 movie (which I saw when it came out and destroyed my poor soul) and I loved seeing how the Battle of Hogwarts differs in several points to what we saw on screen. I do not think it's a surprise for many but first I must say that I was very surprised to see how Rowling was giving explanations so everything made sense. Although sometimes I felt some details are hard to swallow, everything was explained and wrapped up in the end. Needless to say, my favorite character was always Snape (you'll know why) and if I explain why is spoiler, so I let it be.Epic moments, painful and heartfelt deaths, beautiful but sad scenes and there is also time to laugh. There's a little bit of everything. I know I'm late for the party but it's inevitable to feel sad when we get to the famous epilogue. I would have loved that the end had more pages before reaching that moment in the future. Still I believe that the ending meant the end of an era for many. And for me too.That's it. The book is as good as might be expected, with aspects that can be improved, but a worthy conclusion to a saga that marked a whole generation of children like me. Of course I recommend it.PS: I'm NOT going to read Harry Potter and the cursed child. I consider it a nonsense the size of a Hungarian dragon.PS: How amazing is Minerva McGonagall. She deserves an altar like, NOW.********************************RESEÑA EN ESPAÑOLTodo termina. Y también mi viaje por esta saga. Para muchos no es sorprendente que reseñe este libro, 
  pero esta historia empezó en 2011 cuando empecé a leer cada uno de estos libros por primera vez, uno por año.
 
  El año pasado me descaché y no leí este y ahora con algo de tardanza cumplo la lectura.
 Ya siento la nostalgia de que se ha acabado y que tal vez, en muchos años, vuelva a subirme al tren de Hogwarts para reunirme de nuevo con Harry y sus amigos.Este libro es sobradamente triste. Harry y sus amigos están en peligro ya que Voldemort y los mortífagos caminan a sus anchas, 
  asesinando a quien quieren y persiguiendo a sus opositores. 
Nadie está a salvo. Todos tienen miedo. Por eso él está empecinado en terminar con la tarea que Dumbledore le encargó y con el mayor secretismo
   se encargará de eliminar los horrocruxes que le faltan con ayuda de Ron y Hermione.
Este libro también lo leí en inglés como el anterior. Con más de 600 páginas, en este libro pasan muchas cosas y se amplia la información de muchas otras. Tenemos una relativa calma antes de que las cosas se pongan muy mal 
  y por eso el libro puede tener un ritmo irregular.
 Me gustó mucho aprender más sobre el pasado de personajes como Albus Dumbledore y todo el misterio sobre las Reliquias de la muerte. Creo que a medida que se va desarrollando la trama se profundiza aún mas en las motivaciones de los personajes y su evolución y sus relaciones: 
  la tensión y el miedo hace mella en el trío meteórico de Harry y sus amigos 
y las muertes de amigos y enemigos harán mella en su viaje.


Yo terminando el libroLa novela va llegando a pasos agigantados para un final apoteósico. Yo solo tenía el referente de la película de 2011 (que vi cuando salió y me destrozó el alma viva) y me encantó ver como la batalla de Hogwarts se diferencia en varios puntos con respecto a lo que vimos en pantalla. No creo que sea sorpresa para muchos pero antes debo decir que me sorprendió mucho ver como Rowling fue hilando las explicaciones para que todo tuviera sentido. Aunque a veces sentí algunos detalles cogidos por los pelos (y si que le han criticado a la autora plotholes en este libro) pero creo que luego puedes aceptar todo lo que sucede. Sobra decir que mi personaje favorito de todos siempre fue Snape (ya sabrán porqué) y si me explico es spoiler, así que lo dejo estar.Sin duda hay de todo para sufrir y ser feliz. 
  Momentos épicos, muertes dolorosas y sentidas, escenas bellas pero tristes y también hay momento para reírse.
 Hay de todo un poco. Sé que llego tarde a la fiesta pero es inevitable sentirse triste cuando llegamos al famoso epílogo. Me habría encantado que el final tuviera más páginas antes de llegar a ese momento en el futuro de los personajes, ver como concluye todo de una forma más redonda. 
  Pero bueno. De resto creo que ese final significó el fin de una era para muchos. Y para mi también.
Y eso es todo. El libro es tan bueno como podría esperarse, con aspectos mejorables, pero una digna conclusión para una saga que marcó una generación entera de niños como yo. Claro que la recomiendo.
PD: 
No voy a leer el libro de Harry Potter and the cursed child. Lo considero 
  un despropósito del tamaño de un dragón húngaro.

  PD: 
Qué genial es Minerva McGonagall. 
  Un altar para esta señora YA.

149,1891148253,01/31/2017,3.0,"3.25/5 starsNot a review, just a commentary since this is my 2nd time reading the series, and, well I found some issues with the last book. I know I said previously that the 1st one was my least favorite, because of how childish it was (yes, I know the first books ere geared exclusively towards middle grade audience, but still), but the last book is my least favorite because of how many problems it has. It dragged on forever... I felt I was reading it for way too long. - The first and foremost is how much overall this series has in common with LotR. And the fact that J.K. Rowling denies being inspired by him at all (maybe in her subconscious, but she didn't mean to were her words in an interview - pleaseeeeee). But that's probably a topic for another place and another time. - The part of the trio being on the run was extremely over stretched and plain boring. It felt as because they were not at Hogwarts anymore and had no classes to go to, or homework to do, well they didn't know what to do with themselves. Also while all of them were good and quite brilliant while at school, on the run they seemed rather dim witted. - The fact that it was so incredibly hard for them to believe in Deathly Hallows was stupid. Wizards, goblins, unicorns, souls splitting.... all the magical stuff and they cannot believe in something just as magical?! Say what ?! - I have been liking Fleur for a while (ever since she appeared basically) but this book solidified my liking for her character. She seemed real, composed and an excellent image of a great wife. - Remus Lupin is forever my favorite character of the whole series. And while it was hard to read the part where Harry yelled at him for wanting to leave Tonks, I think that it was a great point of Rowling's saying that adults should listen to children more often, because sometimes they know what's best better than adults with all of their life experience do. - Reading second time around I have to agree with Ron. Dumbledore was quite mental. The book should have been named Dumbledore's games or something... I enjoyed Aberforth though, little that we got of him. - At the final battle of Hogwarts when house-elves joined the battle, what was up with them poking enemies with their kitchen knives??? They are house elves, they have strong magic on their own! But the best they could do is poke with knives?... what? - Voldemort is even more of a coward second time reading. - The whole book to me seemed stretched and drawn out, but I did enjoy the beginning a lot. The wedding part was very interesting. Also all of the lore on Dumbledore's and Riddle's young lives was great. And obviously Snape's (sob, sob, sob).- The epilogue, ehhh. I feel like a lot of important characters were left out of it. The whole series had such an extensive character count, and all of them were built exceptionally well. Leaving them out seemed a little like taking the chocolate chips out of chocolate chip cookies. I would much rather read about what George was doing, how were Bill and Fleur , where was Luna... than to see what cliche of names Harry + Ginny and Ron + Hermione named their kids.... That was just so unrealistic! - While I loved Ginny's character in all other books, she didn't have much page time in this book and thus was pretty blah.My WEBSITEMy INSTAGRAMMy WORDPRESS BLOG",37,0.9966,0.077,0.767,0.155,0.538375850340136,NEGATIVE,1.0

Well Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is something like this. All those years of waiting for that Epic epic finale, you get 2 paragraphs of a fight between Voldemort and Harry. I was expecting Harry would use the killing curse at least. But he didn't. The upside though is he used Cruciatus Curse on the Carrows. HAH!!!!! Ooohh I loved that part. Makes me swell with happiness.I don't mind that J.K killed awful lot of characters,(Although I'd be happy to exchange Cho Chang for Fred) I think it was needed to show that the war was indeed gruesome. Because to NOT kill a lot of characters will make DH a wizarding and early version of Breaking Dawn. Where all the characters lived to tell the tale. No, that would be too painfully idealistic. Idealism is not in any way J.K's way of writing. If Harry Potter was too perfect to the point of unreal-ism, then it wouldn't have been the best selling series of all times.I didn't like the ending so much.

Those who, like you, have leadership thrust upon them, and take up the mantle because they must, and find to their own surprise that they wear it well.”Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows follows Harry Potter, who is leaving Privet Drive for the last time. Not for his seventh year at Hogwarts, but instead, to seek out Voldemort’s Horcruxes with Ron and Hermione, to stop him once and for all. His protective charm that kept him safe at Privet Drive breaks the moment he turns seventeen, so he knows that as soon as he leaves, Voldemort and his Death Eaters won’t be far behind. Harry, Ron, and Hermione go on one last dangerous, life changing adventure, in order for Harry to meet Voldemort in one final battle.Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is such a fantastic conclusion to this series. For a book that’s set almost entirely in the woods, it’s incredibly fast paced and packed with action. Out of all the books in this series, this one definitely has one of the darkest moods, for good reason. This book definitely isn't the usual for Harry Potter—it’s not set in Hogwarts and there’s no classes, homework, and Quidditch—but it’s still so amazing. Once again, though, J.K. Rowling takes no mercies when it comes to characters we love, and I won’t spoil it for the three people who haven’t read this series, but the deaths in this book hurt so much, even eleven years later.Can we talk about the characters for a moment? I love watching these kids grow up, especially Harry. What a brave, selfless boy. He will forever be one of my all time favorite characters in all of fiction, and it makes me so sad to see how he’s treated by most of the fandom, because he’s wonderful. He has been through so much shit in seven years and still, he doesn’t let that change who he is. He cares so much and it’s amazing to see after what he’s been through. Ron and Hermione develop so much as well, and I love seeing their friendship survive such difficult times. They all deserve so much more.“Hello, Minister!” bellowed Percy, sending a neat jinx straight at Thicknesse, who dropped his wand and clawed at the front of his robes, apparently in awful discomfort. “Did I mention I’m resigning?”I’ve said this before, but I love how easily Rowling found the balance between humorous and serious moments. This book is, of course, morbid and dark—but there’s still hilarious, light moments when you’re least expecting it. And, a lot of the time, when you really kind of need it. So much of this book is hard to read, especially considering these events are happening to teenagers, but there’s some great little moments that make it a lot easier to get through. I will forever laugh about Ron fighting his mom about having to clean his room before the wedding. These characters are so damn normal and realistic, despite it all, and I love that.I’m in the minority with this opinion, and that’s okay, but I love the ending and I always will. People claim it’s too sentimental and that it didn’t show their trauma and grief enough (as if we didn’t see enough of that in all seven books), which is ridiculous. As someone with PTSD, who has had it since I was a child, sometimes it feels like it’ll never go away. Harry learns to deal with his grief so well, and learns to deal with the death of his parents and family so well, and it ends with these kids growing up and having families and being happy. The overall theme of this series is love, and that’s what it ends on. Overall, I loved Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows as much as I always have. This is the series that made me love reading as much as I do, and that has consistently been the escape I could always turn to since I was very small child. There will never be another series that I love as much as this one, or that means to me what this one does, and I’m definitely okay with that. My rereads always go by far too quickly for my liking, but I always love it so much while it lasts. In conclusion: thank you, Harry.

153,187204014,07/22/2011,5.0,"The conclusion to a truly epic series. I’m so happy I made this re-read. All the wonderful memories, the great moments now … Although I usually remember all details the first time, there were some here that I had forgotten about and revisiting them was a delight!After the death of Albus Dumbledore at the end of book #6 Harry, Ron and Hermione have not returned to Hogwarts. Instead, Harry goes back to Privet Drive one last time and then goes to the Burrow. Of course, he is being chased all the time, leading to two tragic deaths right at the beginning of the book (in fact, the casualness with which one of the two was mentioned almost broke my heart). There are some lighter moments in this that give a bit of a respite (like Bill and Fleur’s wedding), but the main tone is that of darkness, loss and action, naturally.While being on the run after the aforementioned wedding, Harry finally puts most of the puzzle pieces together (with the help of not just the smartest witch of his age but also of Kreacher who became mighty sweet) and starts the hunt for the Horcruxes. Between the mad dashes we get a lot of background story, most notably the missing pieces about Albus Dumbledore himself, all the connections to the titular Deathly Hallows and Voldemorts greatest weakness (these bits of history were actually the best part for me, always, not just now that we have the Fantastic Beasts movie(s)).Again, there are some moments that were conveyed better in the movies which came as a bit of a surprise (but it was fun seeing how the movies and books complete each other). Such as the dragon that was chained up in Gringotts giving the impression it knew exactly who freed it and that the kids were sitting on its back so it flew lower to let them off at the lake; the Patronus being such a special feat of magic that not just any happy memory will do to conjure it (a pet peeve of mine with the books ever since book #3); the Grey Lady giving Harry the riddle about the Room Of Requirement; McGonagall being even more kick-ass (without help); and probably most notably (view spoiler)[Dobby’s death that was heartbreaking in the book but translated even better in the movie (which is weird considering that Dobby hadn’t made an appearance between movies #2 and #7.1 so there was never the same kind of redemption as in the books) (hide spoiler)].What I cannot forgive, that they changed for the movies, is the story of Harry’s wand. For anyone who doesn’t remember: Harry’s wand gets snatched almost in half when Harry and Hermione make their escape from Godric’s Hollow – both in the book and the movie. The difference: in the book the core is not broken! And in the end, (view spoiler)[having the Elder Wand, Harry uses it only once – to repair his old and loyal wand (successfully) – before giving it up (in a better/more intelligent/more plausible way than in the movie as well) (hide spoiler)]. That, in my opinion, is crucial. Which is exactly why it borders on blasphemy that it was changed in the movie!Then there were moments that were brilliant but missing from the movies completely, like Neville’s gran (bwahahaha!), Dudley’s goodbye to Harry, Percy finally coming around (and the twins‘ reaction to him coming back). It was small moments like these that glued the action-packed sequences together. Because all the action and the stakes being so high, of course, means that not everyone is going to make it out alive and the readers need to care. In fact, there is quite a number of people who were important supporting characters that didn’t survive the Battle of Hogwarts (most notably (view spoiler)[Fred Weasley (hide spoiler)] for whom I mourned almost the most). And that is one of the greatest strengths of the series if you ask me: even after all these years readers like me cannot stop thinking about this world and its inhabitants, wondering what happened afterwards, obsessing over every little detail throughout the seven books/movies and never waivering in our love for it all. That love means that no matter how many times we read or listen to the books, the tragic events are never less of a blow, the funny moments are never any less funny. The writing is crisp and vivid as it was the very first time and the entire series is a fixed part of the readers‘ life (no matter how old one was when reading it for the first time).

158,14253922,02/01/2008,4.0,"I liked it. I really did. I laughed, I cheered, I said ""Holy SHIT!"" at least twice.... I even got a little choked up at some points. All in all, I'd say it was a successful end to the series. Ms. Rowling deserves to take a little time off and enjoy basking in the glow of the knowledge that she has not only written seven successful books in ten years, but created an entire world that is big enough to fit hundreds more.Anyway, about this actual book. It felt a lot longer than the rest of them did, probably because of the format change - no more Hogwarts, no more Quidditch, points gained, points lost, detentions with Snape and all that. Our Heroes were kept on the run for pretty much the entire book, so that by the time you get to the climax you think, ""Wow, did they do all that in just 500 pages? A wedding, a break-in at the Ministry, a break-in at Gringotts, a major battle in the Malfoy mansion, a brush with death at Godrick's Hollow and all that in just 500 pages? Hot damn....""Speaking of Gringotts, that's one of the many reasons I liked this book. Rowling told us in book one that you'd have to be a fool to break into Gringotts, and most authors would require you to take it on their word. But she went and showed us, and came up with a hell of a scenario.As much fun as it was finding out that Dumbledore was just as obnoxious in his youth as most of us are was cool, it did feel a bit forced. The entire scene where Aunt Muriel lectured Doge on Dumbledore's youthful indiscretions and mysterious family goings-on should have just WARNING: EXPOSITION stamped on it in red. I'm not sure what the purpose of it was, other than to humanize Dumbledore and to give us a lead-in to the Deathly Hallows. Which I'm still of two minds about anyway. As cool as the idea was, I don't think we should have had to wait until this late in the series to find out about them. At the end of Half-Blood Prince, Harry's path is straight and sure - Horicruxes all the way - and now we have this distraction in the Hallows. Also deserving of the EXPOSITION stamp: Snape's final memories in the Pensieve and Harry's last conversation with Dumbledore.I don't know, maybe it was to give him the choice between destroying Voldemort and defeating Voldemort or something. I haven't really processed it all yet, since I did read the book at approximately Mach 4, which is not the recommended reading speed. Perhaps I'll be more comfortable with the Hallows in the re-read.And then there was the camping sequence. I get it - they're lost in more ways than one. I suspect this may have been an artifact of the one book = one year format. It was probably also meant to keep us in a sense of heightened danger, but that's pretty much where I felt the book drag.Okay, now that I'm done nit-picking...DEATH!Ms. Rowling said in an interview that this book ""isn't a bloodbath.""Oh really? 1. Hedwig - This was Rowling saying, ""I'm not fucking around. I've just killed Harry's most faithful companion, his tether to the world in which he belongs. Imagine what else I'm planning."" 2. Mad-Eye Mooney - A fallen warrior, just like the chapter title says. I think Mad-Eye would have been surprised to survive this battle - of all the Order of the Phoenix he seemed most in tune with the reality that they faced. 3. Dobby - This was where I got choked up, I don't mind telling you. Dobby didn't deserve a knife in the heart. Hell, he didn't deserve to die at all. Having said that, he died very well, and his death was handled with dignity. It was also another reminder from Rowling - ""See? I killed off another completely innocent character. You people have no idea what you're in for...."" 4. Wormtail - Devious bastard. Good riddance. I would have liked to have seen more of his super-hand in action, though. What was it truly capable of? 5. Crabbe - We finally hear him speak! And we find out he's been hiding his light under a bushel. Too bad it then proceeded to burn up the bushel, and the room it was in. 6. Fred - I hate being right. Dammit. 7. Snape - Ah yes, Snape. This was done well. She kept us wondering right up to the end, and it paid off. I seriously thought he was on the dark side, but that's probably because I have no faith in real human beings, much less fictional ones. Now since I'm not a fan-fictioner, or a 'shipper, I never caught on to the idea that Snape and Lily might have had any relationship prior to Hogwarts. I thought her reaction to James' hazing was simply out of compassion for her fellow human being. I had no idea. Anyway, it's good to be wrong. Knowing everything will certainly make re-reads a little more interesting.... 8. Remus and 9. Tonks - There seems to be a lot of anger out there about the way they died - off-screen and without much impact. A lot of people appear to have a lot invested in their relationship, which surprised me. I thought they were an interesting couple, and the idea of their child was very fertile ground for future storytelling, but their relationship was never a central storyline to begin with. Every step of it was happing without the reader's knowledge. It was just revealed to us through Harry. Their courtship, their wedding, their child and their death, none of it was meant to be - and I know I'm going to get snapped at for this - important. They were a nice couple, but as we've already seen, ""nice"" doesn't exempt you from dying in this book. If you want to get analytical about it, it is probable that the orphaning of young Ted Lupin was meant to provide a positive mirror to Harry's own experience: here is another child of a wizarding family whose parents were taken from him before he even knew who they were. Unlike Harry, though, Ted will have a loving, supportive extended family to look after him and see that he's brought up right. For his part, Harry will be able to redeem Sirius in that he can be the godfather that Sirius never was. So while the deaths of Remus and Tonks was regrettable, it was not wrong. 10. Colin Creevey - The grace note. One last reminder from Rowling that she plays no favorites with the supporting cast, and a reminder that being innocent and nice and likable won't be enough to save you. See Remus and Tonks. 11. Voldemort - Definitely dead, if the epilogue is to be believed. So there.That's a pretty impressive body count, not including all the nameless characters who died and the people who only got seriously maimed. And it was this willingness to be brutal to her characters that made me love Rowling all the more....Let's see, what else.... Yes, Mrs. Weasley is my hero, and hopefully we can get Sigourney Weaver to play her in the movie. And Neville finally lived up to his promise. He could have been in Harry 's place, and he finally proved that he could have been every bit the hero that Harry was. Bravo for him. And his grandmother kicks ass in every way, shape and form....I loved the callback to Sorcerer's Stone. In that book, Harry, Ron and Hermione were trying to get past Devil's Snare, which can be repelled by fire. Hermione laments that they don't have any wood, to which Ron replies, ""have you gone mad? Are you a witch or not?"" In this book, while trying to get past the Whomping Willow, Ron moans that if they only had Crookshanks with them, they could hit the secret knot and freeze the limbs. To which Hermione replies, ""Crookshanks? Are you a wizard or what?"" Bless Rowling's heart for trusting us to be paying enough attention to get that joke.I really wish we could have seen Dolores Umbridge get her comeuppance. Imagine this scene from chapter 31, The Battle of Hogwarts.... Umbridge dashed as quickly as her legs would take her through the carnage. She was nearly hit by blast after blast of green light coming from wands carelessly aimed. Her thoughts ran on one track - I have to get out of here. She turned the corner and ran into a resilient, pinkish wall. She barely had time to register what it was before Grawp clenched his fist around her. ""Release me!"" she screamed. ""I am the senior assistant to the Minister of -"" And then Grawp ate her.Ahh, the poetry. She was an evil word-that-rhymes-with-runt and deserved to be punished.Oh, also, Pansy Parkinson: ""But he's right there!"" Winner of Hogwarts' first Slowest on the Uptake Award. That was a great moment. I would have liked to have seen a few of her fellow Slytherins stand up as well, but I guess it's tough to go against your own House.The epilogue was a good idea, if rushed. There was a flood of information that needed to be processed in only a few pages, and I see no reason why she couldn't have let it out for a few more pages. It's not like we were going to get to ""Nineteen Years Later...."" and just give up because the epilogue was too long. But it serves its purpose - it lets us know that after all that we'd seen, everything eventually works out. Not right away, and not perfectly - note that after all the talk about not allowing themselves to be divided, there are still houses at Hogwarts and Slytherin is still the ""evil"" one - but all in all everything's okay.Which brings us to my final thought, at least for now: I said at the beginning that Rowling has earned herself a nice break. She's put in a lot of work and reaped massive rewards, both tangible and intangible. But I suspect that she won't be able to rest for long. There is so much Story there, just waiting to be told. The fans will certainly take a stab at it, and I wouldn't be surprised if someone's already written a threesome between Albus Potter, Scorpius Malfoy and Teddy Lupin.Anyway, that's a whole lot more than I was planning to write, and I'm pretty sure I left things out. But there it is, my thoughts on Deathly Hallows. A good end to a good series.",30,0.99,0.118,0.743,0.14,0.5661678065524218,POSITIVE,0.9588

Granddad Weasley would never forgive you if you married a pure-blood.”, “Don’t forgive to give Nevill our love.” “Mum! I can’t give a Professor love!”— but my favorite moment from the chapter is probably Harry reminding Al that Hagrid has invited him for tea next Friday, THIS IS SO PURE (also, how old is Hagrid? WTF) :D — “All was well.”""When I'm 80 years old and sitting in my rocking chair, I'll be reading Harry Potter,"" the quote card says. ""And my family will say to me, 'After all this time?'

167,1108867092,11/17/2014,3.0,"3.5 StarsGenerally, I'm not a big fan of continuous-storyline series, and the Harry Potter series is a good example of why. I'm too much of a completionist, too OCD for this shit. Even though I rated most of these books below three stars, I felt compelled to finish them because I started them. Even after it took me six months to read GOBLET OF FIRE, I pressed forward. Even though I one-starred ORDER OF THE PHOENIX, I continued on. I had to know why people love these books as much as they do. At least I got my answer.J.K. Rowling did one major thing right with this series. Her writing matured along with her readers. As Potter got older and wiser, so did Rowling's style. This helped her quite a bit because the first three novels are horribly formulaic. But how many middle-grade kids are going to dissect overused plot points and cliched story structure? Not many. And by the time her audience was old enough to start questioning the borrowed ideas and storylines, Rowling had already established her characters and readied her pawns for battle. Had the series maintained the goofy middle-grade tone throughout, it would have likely failed. Had the first three books been as dark as the final four, the series wouldn't have seen half the success it did. In the end, it became a phenomenon because it spoke to the proper age groups at the proper times.I give this series a lot of grief, but not even my cynical ass can ignore Rowling's accomplishments. After writing this series, she went from homeless mother to one of the richest people on the face of the planet. Good for her. But I think her greatest success was getting kids reading again. And while I do not fan flail over these books, I do understand the draw. I understand the nostalgia and fond memories they invoke in their readers. THE DEATHLY HALLOWS was a little heavy in the middle. Its belly meandered and dragged some, but I was never bored to the point I was with PHOENIX. Then again, I think a lot of what I enjoyed about this book stemmed from the knowledge that I was reading the last one in the series. That thought alone made me smile and was a big reason I didn't want to put the book down.I'm glad Neville got his time in the sun, but Snape's story arc was my favorite of the bunch. Luna was another one I liked. Harry didn't really shine for me until book six, and I fucking loathed everything about Ron. I wanted Hermione and Draco to end up together, as they seemed hellbent for each other, but maybe that was just me reading too much into their hatred of one another. I kept expecting Harry to catch them rage fucking in a closet between classes.Finally, I'm pretty sure Peeves and Trelawney were screwing each other every time they were able. Next time you reread this, see if you can catch why I say that. The scene I remember the best out of the entire series is the underwater stuff in GOBLET. In summation: Six easy reads and one big pile of shit equal a series that owes a lot to young readers and nostalgia. Books six and seven are clearly the best of the bunch. If I had to rate the series as a whole, I'd have to give it three stars. Final Judgment: Done at last. Done at last. Thank Tom Cruise almighty I'm done at last!A rundown of my ratings for each book:The Sorcerer's Stone ***The Chamber of Secrets ***The Prisoner of Azkaban **The Goblet of Fire **** (Wow...

A journey that’s only begun. I finished the last book this morning and yet I feel I don’t know the whole story yet. I know there are people who make a hobby, an obsession, maybe even a career about Harry Potter lore and now I can understand why. This is not a story, it’s an experience. This is the masterpiece of a truly gifted author who understands what it means to be a great storyteller. Rowling understands that it’s not enough to throw action and plot at a reader, but to draw them, gently and unobtrusively, into a new, believable world. Her world doesn’t play by the rules of ours, but no matter. From the first chapter of book one, we are taken under Rowling’s cloak of invisibility as an ordinary human and she doesn’t insult our intelligence nor write down to us. She gains our trust, word by word, tale by tale. She gives us rich background, complex characters, deep emotion. At every page, we find something we relate to—whether an action or a feeling. Until we are under the spell and our trust in her is absolute. Like Dumbledore’s Army follows Harry, we are willing to follow wherever Rowling leads. Because we believe in her world.There are things I don’t fully understand. Things I want to explore further. And this is why the ending is only the beginning.

174,38710105,11/26/2008,1.0,"I was stunned and dismayed by the time I finished this book. I have been a fan of the HP series since about 2000, when a friend recommended Book 1 to me as a cute little book that she was tutoring 5th graders with. I read it, liked it, and figured I'd pick up the next book when it came out.As each book came out, many critics and fans commented that JK had a unique style of approaching her series; the way that her books grew with her targeted audience. The series became darker and more complex, the writing more intense as the series continued.By the 5th book, I was well and truly hooked, and read each book voraciously when it came out. I re-read the entire available series just before the next book was released, and enjoyed them immensely.When Book 7 came out, I was disappointed, but only in the way that a fan is when what they have enjoyed so long is at an end. There would be no more HP books to look forward to. As I had not been part of HP online communities, nor did I enjoy the movies, this was the end of the series for me.Then I read the book, and I was furious. Six books she spent preaching about house unity, and how Hogwarts must unite or fall. Six books she spent warning of a terrible and devastating war that Harry would be in the thick of. Six books that were well enough written between plot and description that I could overlook her lack of characterization for antagonists or the fact that Ginny was essentially a flat character. And then book 7, where she completely ignores everything she spent 6 books setting up, skips around the reality of war by having Harry wander around lost on the moors for a bit, and then pulls a religious analogy out of her hat. Although the religious analogy did make me laugh -- I can't help but wonder if all those who said HP was the devil's work will be praising it like it's Narnia in 10 years.Still, I couldn't believe what she'd done to her work. I don't know if that honestly was her vision from the beginning, as she claims -- if it was, then the entire series suffers for it, and her vision is severely limited. The other alternative is that she sold out or simply didn't care because she's already richer than a queen. Whatever the reasoning, it was an awful, disappointing end to a beautifully textured series.---EDITED TO ADD---I still dislike book 7, although I love the rest of the series. I love how JK structured the books, right? I mean, she's a genius with the foreshadowing and with dropping in information about the characters backgrounds without being heavy handed. She's just a brilliant writer who structured these very rich, well-crafted worlds that hold up to multiple re-readings. I love how the books ""grow"" with the reader, with the first books being written for a younger reader and the later books being written for an older reader. Most of all, I love how she foreshadows across the books, so things that happen in, say, Book 5 are foreshadowed in Books 1 and 2. It's AMAZING. She's so incredibly talented, and it makes reading her books a real treat. Which was why I am still so incredibly upset at reading book 7. See, in Book 7, she brings up this whole notion of those three items (the Elder Wand, Invisibility Cloak, and Philosophers Stone) being tied together by the myth of the three brothers. That's the part that pissed me off. It felt ... cobbled in. Pulled out of a hat, last minute. Like, JK had told us about the numberless clock in the Weasley's house warning us about danger, about hunting for garden gnomes, about the time Ron's teddy bear got turned into a spider ... but she didn't mention this apparently incredibly common wizarding childrens story? She talks about all these daily aspects of wizarding life on a regular basis, introduced through Ron's family, but never once -- never once in 6 entire books does Ron or Ginny or anyone even let out a breath of a whisper about this apparently common wizarding fable? Think about how often you reference common fairy stories and fables in your life. Cinderella, Red Riding Hood, Big Bad Wold, etc. So if JK Rowling actually had this idea of a wizarding fable/myth as a major plot in her overarching series, I think she would have woven it in as foreshadowing much more effectively. What I think happened is this:Right around the time Book 7 was being written, all these internet/ social media/ fanboard sites were really taking off. They weren't huge before then, but they were really taking off as she'd released Books 5 & 6 and was writing book 7. I think that the fans had pretty much figured out what was happening, plot wise -- which is a mark of what a great writer JK Rowling is -- and JK felt bad about that -- which is a natural creative response.I think her publisher advised her to keep quiet about reading the fanboards for legal reasons, which she wisely did, but I fully believe she read them, and that she wasn't happy about two things:(1) The proliferation of fanfic and noncanon fanfic pairings(2) How thoroughly the fans had guessed the key points of the plot (particularly what would be happening with Snape and Dumbledore and the Horcruxes).So I think that JK just sort of pulled that bit about the 3 Wizarding brothers and the ancient fairy tale and 3 legendary items out of her hat (with no foreshadowing regarding this plotline in the previous 6 books) because she wanted to surprise her fans with a sort of ""gotcha""/ surprise moment. Furthermore, I suspect she wrote in the epilogue as a sort of middle finger to the proliferation of fanfic writers, as though to say, ""And by the way, no. That is not how it happens. Harry and Hermoine do not end up together. Harry and Draco do not end up together. Ron and Pansy do not end up together. These people end up together, in these pairs. I do so decree it, and thus it shall be.""So that's why I don't like Book: 7. I feel like it's less true to the ethos of the series than the rest of the books. I feel like JK Rowling kind of strayed from herself as a writer ... that she reacted (poorly) to her fans, and that it reflects badly on her work. I can't really enjoy reading the book even now. It feels out of step with the rest of the series.I've mostly moved on. I've forgiven her (even if the insult is imagined). She's a truly talented writer and generous and compassionate woman. She's an inspiration to me, as a writer. And it was a weird time in fandom and for the internet, when that book was being written. Everyone makes mistakes. I think JK has more than made up for the upset of book 7, though -- she wrote 6 other amazing books, she's gracious and considerate in the fandom community, and she's a principled and compassionate woman. A true role model. What's one book in comparison to the rest of her legacy? ",27,0.9982,0.103,0.733,0.164,0.522937040024196,NEGATIVE,0.993

“Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and, above all those who live without love.”
I want to make this final review about 
Neville Longbottom
Let me explain why. A couple of years ago, I had a very disturbing conversation with a Potterhead friend.Crazy friend of mine: ""Did you know that Neville Longbottom was actually the real hero in Harry Potter's book?""Me: ""WTF ?! O_o""This sounding more and more crazy friend of mine: ""Yes, I read a theory that says that JK Rowling wrote this book to make us think that Harry was the hero, but in the end, you realize that it has been Neville all along""After laughing at him and calling him crazy I went back to my business. But this idea stayed in my head for several days. I called all my Harry Potter's fan friends in the middle of the night and they all told me that this was nonsense and that I should go back to sleep.But this wasn't enough to get this theory out of my head, therefore, I decided back then to do a Potter-movies-athlon (I always need a good excuse). And I started to understand what he meant. Then I re-read all the books and I thought I needed the Internet to help me understand better.I found an awesome article online which made me realize that might be right (you can check it here if you want), but basically it all starts with Sybill Trelawney's first prophecy that you can find below: 
""The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches... born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies... and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not... and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives... the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies...""
During the prophecy, Trelawney specified that the requirements for the boy of the prophecy who was capable of (but not necessary would) defeating the Dark Lord are the followings:- Male,- Born in the closing days of July of 1980,- His parents had defied Voldemort three times and lived to tell about it,- He would have a power that Voldemort was unable or unwilling to comprehend.And of course, the book being called Harry Potter, and him meeting all the requirements, we all assumed it refers to our Harry, but Neville Longbottom also meets all the requirements: he was born on July, 30th 1980, his parents Frank and Alice Longbottoms, are Aurors who had directly defied Voldemort on three separate occasions. However, on the contrary of James and Lilly Potter, Neville parent's are still alive, they were tortured into insanity with the Cruciatus Curse by a group of Death Eaters and were placed at St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries.Moreover, Neville proved himself by standing up to Voldemort and destroying his last Horcrux, Nagini. Harry couldn't have defeated Voldemort without Neville's action in the first place.
“We’re all going to keep fighting, Harry. You know that?”
The second point that we can make us think that Neville is the true hero is the following idea, based on the fact that Harry Potter's generation is modelled on James Potter's. You can see it follows the same pattern with the following points:- Harry is like James, a leader of the group- Ron is like Sirus, a faithful friend- Hermione like Remus is really smart, a little bit outcast at first but then fully part of the group- And then Neville is Peter Pettigrew. Everyone is making fun of him. Clumsy and chubby.(- According to that theory, Ginny Weasley is Lilly Potter)But this is where the story change. Neville is loyal to Harry where Peter has been a coward. He stands by Harry no matter what, even when Voldemort asked him to join his side. This theory says that JKR wanted to show that only one ""side character"" changes the whole story. Instead of darkness and terror, Neville is the one who kills the last Horcrux (Nagini) and allowing Harry to defeat Voldemort. Instead of joining him and betraying his friends, instead of choosing the easy path, life above all moral, he chooses to be faithful.
“It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends.”
Just think about it, if Neville would have acted as Peter did, the ending would have been probably the opposite.We clearly see how his character grows during those 7 books/8 films. I personally find this theory very convincing, I'm eager to read your opinion on it!",26,0.9933,0.089,0.768,0.143,0.4229986197377501,NEGATIVE,0.9995

A lot goes down in this book so those were just the top moments for me w this reread. Until next time folks. ",26,0.988,0.0,0.811,0.189,0.5391170634920636,POSITIVE,0.9952

""Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and, above all those who live without love.""

190,1099231161,11/06/2014,,"I have finished my 2017 Harry Potter reread!This review contains unmarked spoilersAs the other 6 reviews I have done for this series this review will also be all over the place. Because so much happens in this book I think I will shorten the review by only talking about the things I really want to talk about and keeping it kind of short. First off the Dursley's are going into hiding. I sometimes wonder if Mr. Dursley has any sense because he says we are leaving then nope we aren't. Dudley was like screw it dad I want to leave. Petunia just wants Dudley to be safe and at the end they did leave Private Drive. Dudley's last words to Harry was I didn't think you were a waste of space or something along those lines. I keep forgetting that. Harry leaves Private Drive with the Order and of course they had a master plan that they would turn 6 people into Harry as they escaped into safe houses. Each one different. Harry rode with Hagrid which is very emotional because Hagrid is the one to bring Harry there and he is the one taking him away. The twins, Ron, Hermione, Fluer, and Mundungus turn into Harry and they are off into the night to the different safe houses. Apparently the Death Eaters knew that they were traveling that night which we later learned how and why they knew. Hedwig dies which is extremely sad and Hagrid fell from the sky trying to protect Harry. The first time I read it I though Hagrid was dead but he is alive and well and I am glad Hagrid is okay. They arrive at Tonk's house and then take a porkey to the Burrow. Bill and Fluer's wedding take place in the Burrow and during the wedding the Death Eaters took over the ministry. Hermione disapperates with Ron and Harry into the city where they are met by Death Eaters. I don't think it was ever com firmed whether or not Harry still had the trace on him. They spent the night in Grimmauld place and later learned Kreacher's story. We figure out that R.A.B is Regulus Black and he allowed Voldemort to use Kreacher to drink the potion to hide his Horcrux. Regulas of course with the help of Kreacher goes to the cave and drinks the potion and tells Kreacher to destroy it before dying. It was honestly a heartbreaking moment. Regulus unlike Sirius treated Kreacher with more respect and Kreacher does love Regulus more. Harry gives Kreacher the fake Horcrux and Kreacher looses it and after that treats Harry, Ron, and Hermione more kindly. He also find Mundungus and they discover that he sold the locket to Umbridge. I am pretty sure when everyone read that part for the first time they are all, including me, this lady again? I thought she was gone. With careful planning and with the help of polyjuice potion the three of them manage to get into the ministry and find the locket but like Kreacher, could not destroy it. Later on Ron will stab it with the word of Gryffindor. Speaking of the sword, Neville proves himself as a worthy Griffindor as he mamages to pull the sword out of the hat just like Harry. Neville I feel like thought he didn't belong in this hout but he proved he is brave and courageous. Not being able to return to Sirius's house they start camping out in the woods, Ron leaves but comes back Harry ignore's Ron's warning and says Voldemort's name and they get captured. Hermione is tortured and honestly that scene was very scary because Bellatrix is cruel and I didn't know the first time I read it whether or not Hermione survived. She does and recovers in shell cottage where Bill and Fluer now live. Dobby rescues the trio plus a few others including Luna and Dobby dies in the process. It is a sad moment and even Harry is so devastated that he had trouble saying anything but Goodbye at Dobby's funeral. Way before that when the met Bathilda and learned she was actually a snake Hermione breaks Harry's wand. Harry feels like a part of him is missing. Told by Ollivander his wand is repairable he later tries to fix it with the elder wand and it works. At shell cottage they made an agreement with Griphook the goblin and pulled off an epic break in into Gringotts. I loved that part and it was my favourite moment in this book. The battle of Hogwarts was more sad and more epic this time I read it. Grawp threw Hagrid through the window so he could join the fight. I really wished we could of seen that scene in the movie. Percy comes back and learns his lesson that family is very important and he witnessed his brother die. Honestly it was heartbreaking to see Percy, who finally wanted to see and hep his family again only to lose one of them. I mean I cried reading that part too.Lets not forget at the end that the house elves lead by Kreacher also helped fight. And Mrs. Weasley fighting Bellatrix was insane. Bellatrix almost killed Ginny and Mrs. Weasley was mad. I don't think I ever saw her that mad ever. People tried to help her but she reused any help and they all stared to watch. I feel like everyone stopped fighting or were half fighting but watching them fight.That's it for now and I probably add more later because I still have a lot to say.",25,-0.9964,0.155,0.747,0.099,0.5083923611111111,NEGATIVE,0.9988
191,1674238426,04/25/2017,4.0,"Harry Potter is Harry Potter, but I struggled to like this final book for several reasons. They're the same things that bothered me the first time I read it, but the final confrontation and brilliant revelations and reversals of certain characters wiped them from my memory back then. Now the second time, I find that these reasons linger. 1. So many deaths. Right from the beginning, starting with (view spoiler)[Hedwig (hide spoiler)]. Somehow that really got to me this time!2. So much speculation about Dumbledore and his true motivations and shortcomings. I do like how this was resolved in the end, but didn't enjoy the maligning of Dumbledore, or Harry's doubts about him.3. So much time spent with only Harry, Ron and Hermione running around the forest. I miss their interactions with other characters and the wizarding world.4. No Hogwarts until 75%. This is kind of the same as the previous point except that Hogwarts simply deserves its own line. I've realized that the setting is a huge part of my enjoyment of this series, and I was impatient with the book until the story returned there. I missed all of the extra characters - teachers, ghosts, portrait-dwellers, fellow students - as well as the magic of the castle itself.I still love the series. There's nothing else like it. It's darker than I would have liked, even knowing where it was going the second time around, but like I said, I just wanted to live at Hogwarts and not watch the whole world being destroyed, along with so many people that Harry could possibly consider family. The ending is really great. It's one of those endings that is actually epic, and some of the minor characters have great moments in the battle at Hogwarts. But I found this finale bitter enough that I might avoid any future re-reads and stick to the earlier books for the nostalgia of simply hanging out at Hogwarts.",25,0.9759,0.105,0.739,0.156,0.4826984126984126,NEGATIVE,0.9996

It's an incredible story, everybody knows that.I am not unique in my connection with these books. When I was younger, I would wait with excited anticipation for the next HP book to come out. When it did, I would hole myself up in my room and devour it in a day. I had read other books that I'd liked well enough prior to HP, but this was different. It was that feverish feeling you get when you're so wrapped up in a story. It's the absolute love you have for the characters, and the spectacular world-building that stretches your imagination. It cemented my love for reading.Twelve years later, I re-read the series, finishing with this last installment. This time, I read it slower. I wanted to savor every bit of it.

Still, I found myself an absolute teary mess during chapter 34 - 'The Forest Again'. Coincidentally, Rowling has stated this is her own favourite chapter. The Prince's Tale and the deaths of Fred and Lupin still make my eyes water, but nothing compares to those scenes in the forest. Rowling deserves every little bit of her success. This is a fantastic conclusion to an unbelievable story. She is a true rarity; a fantastic author and an even better storyteller.  “Do not pity the dead, Harry.

194,2319005229,05/01/2018,5.0,"05/01/18A completely mind blowing work of literature. How I went my whole life without reading these, I will never know.07/21/18Don't mind me updating my thoughts 2.5 months later, I just really think I need to get out more than just one sentence to sum up how I feel about something I have thought about literally every single day since I last picked it up. There will be a lot of spoilers in this, just as a warning.Anyways, reading these was an absolute adventure from start to finish—I can’t see any other series giving me the same emotions that this one has. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was, again, a really good one hence the 5 stars.I don't know if it's because I was late to the party that I feel like it's overlooked, but I really wanted to know how Aunt Petunia felt when she was saying goodbye to Harry... I was so looking forward to that loving embrace he lacked all those years! But honestly I liked how it packed that punch right at the beginning; I wasn't expecting something like that to happen so soon. I'm also happy that Dudley was at least a little bit concerned for Harry when he realized he would probably never see him again. It doesn't excuse how awful he was to him, but at least he had some sort of empathy at the end.Admittedly, for the first three-quarters I was (for lack of a better word) bored? Experiencing Harry, Ron, and Hermione venture off to find the Horcruxes was fun but I really missed the Hogwarts setting and I was becoming quite restless with none of the questions I had being answered yet. Then, after they visited the Malfoy Manor with about 200 pages to go, I really got more into it and read that last bit in a day. Dobby’s death I knew about already or else I think that would have shocked me but Fred’s death I didn’t know about and that had me so sad, I cried my eyes out. Literally a good seven pages before that, Ron and Hermione kissed and I was so happy because I had wanted them together for SOSOSO LONG, but then Fred happened at the end of that chapter and I was really saddened. I had to put the book down in order to soak in that all of that really just happened within such a short time. I think by then, it was actually starting to set in that this was ending for real and I was really scared to see who else would die.Now, for the whole Snape storyline: knowing the truth about Snape, I am really sad that he died. And that whole white doe thing?! My mouth actually dropped because I was sure that was Dumbledore’s patronus. However, I don’t think that makes up for everything he did to Harry throughout the years at Hogwarts. I almost can’t believe he was loyal to Dumbledore the whole time because of all the negative things he did in the other books. I know people really love Snape by the end, but my feelings didn't really change all that much. I mean, he bullied Neville to the point of being Neville's boggart, completely embarrassed and ridiculed Hermione in front of other students when Malfoy's Densaugeo spell hit her, and don't get me started on what was supposedly love for Lily. Snape's hatred for James was stronger than his love for Lily, and it caused him to be obsessed with having her. If you really love someone, and I mean genuinely love and care about them, I would hope you would treat their orphaned son a little bit better than Snape treated Harry. Yeah, what he did was great and all but all those things he did to him and others in 6 other books aren't justified to me just because of that. Honestly, thinking about it again makes me angry all over so I will stop while I'm ahead. Nonetheless, I do still think one of my favourite parts was when Harry looked into the pensive at Snape’s memories and found everything out; it had me reading so fast to know what had happened.Moving forward, I'm not sure if I would read Harry Potter & the Cursed Child because a) I don't know if the whole ""read like a play"" thing is for me; and b) I have heard mixed reviews, most of them not being good ones. Also, I felt like this was a good way to end it off and the epilogue was enough for me. Here's to being totally ruined by a series for the first time, I'm excited at the thought of experiencing more pain and heartache like this over a series in the future (although I highly doubt any of them could affect me as much as this one did)!!¡!",30,0.9952,0.112,0.718,0.17,0.5007471264367815,POSITIVE,0.9448

Dudley at the start of this book is everything and it gives me hope that he won’t just turn into his father after all what an emotional and tear-jerking moment! J K Rowling really knows how to get you in the feels. HEDWIGGGGGGGGG! Honestly my heart can’t take this book! There is so much action in this book you just can’t stop reading – I remember reading this the first time and being made to go bed because I just couldn’t stop and I have the exact same reaction on this read - I will never stop re-reading this book. The romance really build in this book too Ginny and Harry and Ron and Hermione I means it’s about time! I think if you haven’t read the books and have only watched the films you are really missing out! The books manage to go much more in depth not only characters but also the whole plot. Creature is one of those characters that is let down in the films and the books really go into the house elves and the way they are mistreated – and why Creature is the way he is. This book has EVERYONE in all the characters really get a mention throughout this book and I love it, it really shows us the progression of the series and you really feel like you know each character personally by this point which makes this book so much more heart-felt and heart-breaking. Voldemort is also much more sinister in the books and you get more detail of exactly what his ‘perfect wizarding world’ is! I wish the conversation between Lupin and Harry had happen in the films too! If they did an extended version of the films that were on for 4hours each I would happily watch!!!!! More details about Dumbledore also emerge in this book – but I really wish J K Rowling would bring out a book just for Dumbledore’s life! The last instalment of the Harry Potter series really is ACTION, ACTION and more ACTION! Bathilda’s Street is one of my favourite chapters. There are really so many amazing chapters in this book I just can’t get enough of it! The Tale of the Three Brother is a little story in a story and it’s EVERYTHING! Ron’s fears are so sad and beautiful! So true to real life and I really felt for Ron throughout these books and even more so in this one! Always 2nd best within his family and his friendships! Kingsley’s patronus being a Lynx I mean can he be any cooler?!I am so sad that this is OVER and I will have to re-read these again! I will never be bored of these and they will never get old! I will have to read something easy next as this never gets easier! SNAPE! (That’s all I have to say) if you know you know! (CRIES) I could go on and on about this book but it’s really the last few chapters that are the most heart-breaking and the most joyful this really is an amazing series and I would suggest everyone should read it at least once – some of the earlier books are harder to read yes – but I swear its SOOO WORTH IT!

205,2570901596,10/28/2018,5.0,"A great ending to a fantastic series. It was really great to go through this series again after so long. Watching the movies just isn't the same as reading the book. I love the details that you get from the books. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy the movies, but the books are just superior to what they could put in the movies. Now I feel like I have to leave a bunch of close friends behind and others I have buried.This is such a roller coaster. The journey to get to the end is long and full of mysteries that must be solved. Characters that I loved are lost and characters that I despise are brought to a new light. Even though I knew how it would end up having read and watched previously, it didn't take away the hatred felt or the sadness that was to come.There is one thing I wish had some more finality to it and that is Umbridge. Oh, how I despise that woman and wish she would have met some sort of end that I could have relished in. That is the one character that I felt I needed more closure for. I don't often despise a character like I have her.So many losses it makes me sad. The list is like a list of friends and it is heartbreaking; each one as they come. I can see their faces and the tears stream down. I think of the death eaters and I just can't understand them; so much hatred. How can they want to be someones pawn and how can someone be full of so much hate. I guess that is a good thing that I can't understand them. That would be like being able to understand a killer out in the world today. To kill without feeling; I don't want to ever understand that. Then I look on the other side and see the friendships, the families, the love and I love that. I love to see friends coming together to help one another; to sacrifice themselves for the ones they love and to fight for the greater good. It was great to have Percy come back to the family that loves him and to admit he was wrong and selfish. Oh how I love these characters and this story. It took so much to come to the ending and to make everything right. I have always felt that the ending was just so complicated, but the story as a whole is great. I think there is just so much twisted into the Harry and Voldemort history that it makes it confused and diluted. It is definitely not simple, but in the end brings everything back to complete the circle and make everything whole. I love books that have great character development. This entire series does this for me and I believe that is the main reason why I think so highly of them. I become entirely attached to the characters and I am willing them forward on their quests or the friendships or their romances. I feel loss and cry when they pass or I loathe them something fierce and can feel the anger well up inside me. Nothing is better than great characters to make a story whole and to give it feeling.

January 2016 The perfect book to kickstart 2016 has ended and now, I don't know what to do with my life.Yes, I still get sad over several deaths. YES, I had ‘em coming but it still manage to give me a pang.I couldn't thank J.K.R enough for creating one of the most magical series ever. Harry Potter is not just a story, for one thing it's showed readers a few lessons that I won't ever forget. I've already said my goodbyes to Harry, Ron and Hermione before, this makes it the 5th time but it certainly won't be the last.(view spoiler)[Raising my wand to the brave souls who perished in the Battle of Hogwarts:- Professor Severus Snape- Remus Lupin & Nymphadora Tonks- Colin Creevey- Fred Weasley- Lavender Brown- All the other unnamed Hogwart students who fought just as bravely.

211,578312548,04/01/2013,2.0,"Traaaaaaaash.This book is so freaking good and yet! I'm so mad!Honestly there's so much to like about this series but there is an equal amount to hate.-Harry is a jerk.-Dumbledore is a moron.-Voldemort is more bumbling bad guy than evil villain.and there are so many plot weaknesses that can only be explained away by, 'because JK said so.' which, to me, is not good enough.But also:-Snape-Weasley twins-DragonsWhat makes me the most mad about this book is that it's actually pretty freaking good. It's got some great action and mystery, surprising twists, great hero moments. But then it's absolutely 
RUINED
 by the last hundred or so pages. That rubbish ending infuriates me because it's so freaking STUPID. It's like JK was just so done with this series that she knotted all the loose ends so that they can never, ever be undone again.So let's pause the hate so I can talk about the first part of the book.Aside from some familiar frustration with Dumbledore's vagueness and secret keeping, there's a lot to like. The trio set out on the prescribed quest and it becomes quickly evident that Hermione is the true hero of the book. She saves Harry's ungrateful ass so many times and barely bats an eyelid. Whereas me, I'd be reminding him every time he pulled out that angst bullsh*t. (view spoiler)[Like, 'yo Harry, I get that you're mad that I broke your wand accidentally, but remember how I also SAVED YOUR ASS FROM A GIANT SNAKE? Just saying.'  (hide spoiler)]Ron is the most real character and I love him for sarcasm and reluctance and habit of saying exactly what everyone else is thinking (oh hey, I also just described myself. Huh). He's a stand up guy. He's also hilarious with his stinging sass. (view spoiler)[Honestly disappointed about how the romance between he and Hermione played out. They deserved more than a single passionate kiss at the end. (I did LOL when Harry yelled 'OI!' at them for it, though.) They're a far cuter couple than Harry and Ginny. (hide spoiler)]As much as I love the Weasleys, Ginny does nothing for me. I do like that she enjoys blowing things up, but totally not feeling the whole her-and-Harry thing. Bit much. Also, I still think it's a dog move to go after your best friend's sibling. After all Ron's done for you, you ungrateful twat. But I love Luna and Neville and that they continue being badass without having Harry around to hold their hands. Neville in particular has had some great (albeit sudden) character development.Lupin is one of my fave characters, so I'm kind of mad about how JK writes him in this book. He acts like a total child, and I didn't believe it. It didn't make sense to me; that happens a lot here. The kids are running around doing things adults should be doing, and meanwhile the adults are chillin', taking it easy and acting like kids with no responsibility. No one seems to take control, and JK's actually pretty vague about what everyone else is up to while Harry's running around acting important.Meanwhile, Harry's gotta find and destroy 4 horcruxes, and DAMN does this kid move slow. He takes his sweet ass time, so although there's plenty happening in the first half of the book, it doesn't really progress until about 300-odd pages in. Then it all comes tumbling out in a rush and you gotta read slowly in order to take it all in. But it's kind of fun trying to unravel exactly what the heck is going on? Like all that stuff with the hallows? What's that all about?Downside though is trying to remember the fifty thousand new characters that pop up. Also I feel like a lot of these death eaters have been taken down repeatedly? Why they no die?!I LOVE the flashbacks, though, and all the hints at life before Harry. It makes me feel so sad for James and Lily. All those 'what if?'s, man. My heart.Plus DRAGONS. I love dragons. (See my review for GoF.) Also my main man Snape has gone full dark side so that's a lot of fun. (view spoiler)[Seriously, of all the deaths in this book (and there are so. freaking. many.) that one hurts my heart the most. Those feels. I wish he'd had a more noble death, tbh. He totally deserved better. (hide spoiler)]Sooooooo here's my grudges. 
YOU ARE NOW ENTERING SPOILER TERRITORY.
(view spoiler)[-SO. MANY. DEATHS.Hedwig. Moody. Rufus. Dobby. Peter. Crabbe. Fred. Tonks. Lupin. Snape. This all after Cedric, Sirius and Dumbledore in the previous three novels. There is such a blatant disregard for the aftershocks of death that these just don't get an emotional response from me. How are we supposed to believe how broken up Harry is over Dobby when a)he got over his Sirius grief pretty fast and b)he actually grumbled a fair bit about Dobby? Also, so many people have died by this stage that it's kinda desensitising. Moody was forgotten easily, and so was Hedwig. Fred, Tonks and Lupin were STUPID POINTLESS DEATHS. Of all the hundreds of students and teachers that took part in the battle at the end, only 53 people died. How did Lupin and Tonks BOTH die? How did all the inexperienced students survive when a werewolf and an auror couldn't??? And JK doesn't even grace us with an actual cause of death, so once again lives are lost just coz JK says so. Fred died a good honest death, so I'll take his. Same with Snape, even if it was a sh*tty death: his death had meaning, and kinda made sense in terms of plot. But the rest? I just got so mad because clearly JK had no decent explanation, she just wanted these characters to die. That's brutal.-That whole, '19 years later' BULLDUST:1. Absolutely ridiculous and pointless inclusion. Just quite clearly JK saying 'yo I am never gonna write more HP books so forget it.' (Happy to milk the cash cow by churning out all this supplementary crap, though, isn't she? Yet still not giving in to fan demands for a Marauders spin-off. So disappointing.)2. These poor kids have worse names than the kids of today's celebrities. Albus Severus? YOU DIDN'T EVEN LIKE SNAPE YOU TWO-FACED SON OF A GUN. Scorpius?!! You poor bastard. AND WHY ARE THERE SO MANY OF THEM??3. Zero inclusion about any of the other characters, which was a big F.U. to the series. No proper epilogue about what happened to anyone else, just 'all the power couples grew up, got married and had ridiculously-named babies. Who then went to Hogwarts.' Oh, wait, but I guess that kinda makes sense because JK KILLED THEM ALL.  (hide spoiler)]There were a lot of character behaviours that didn't seem to match up about what we knew about the characters, so that frustrated me a fair bit, and once again Harry can do no wrong and always comes out on top, while Voldy, The Most Powerful Wizard Ever, is thwarted repeatedly. Thank god he actually offs a ton of people randomly here and there or I'd have zero respect for him as The Big Bad. Poor guy just can't catch a break.There's just so much in this book that I feel was included just because JK felt like it, not for any kind of logical purpose. For example, I've been wondering a lot about the absence of Harry's grandparents, and it turns out they were just never included because JK needed Harry to have no family. So when she was questioned about it she gave some crap about them all dying natural deaths before Harry but honestly, WHAT A LOAD. It bothers me. This is such a beautifully vivid world - it's so incredibly detailed, and colourful, and it's brilliantly done, but these little plot holes really cheapen the experience. This would probably have been a 4-star read for me without those grumbles, but they just ruined the whole series for me a bit so this scrapes by with two stars. A clever installment in the series, and a truly grand finale, absolutely spoiled by what I see as author arrogance. Some authors will talk about how some stories kinda write themselves - clearly this is not something that happens for JK. The entire ending is way too forced.So while I'm finally happy to admit that I do actually love this world, and plenty of the characters and events in it, I stand by my hatred of it's hero and this absolutely rubbish conclusion.***See my other reviews for the series here:Sorcerer's Stone (4 stars)Chamber of Secrets (2 stars)Prisoner of Azkaban (4stars)Goblet of Fire (3 stars)Order of the Phoenix (2 stars)Half-Blood Prince (3 stars)***
Original delayed review:
What a load of utter rubbish.That ending? (view spoiler)[ Why do all the powerful people die but all the students survive? That just doesn't make sense! I feel like Rowling was going more for shock factor than actual sensible storyline. And the kids at the end ... honestly, what was that sh*t? (hide spoiler)] I somehow got addicted to reading this series, and it was okay, there's loads of imagination, but I actually can't stand Rowling's writing. It's illogical. She writes more to create shock factor than to evolve characters in a logical sense. She kills people off because it will create an uproar. She did some great things with this series and created some memorable characters and moments but I just was not impressed by the writing at all. Harry Potter himself is the most detestable character I've ever read. He's a complete d*ckbag and I cannot understand how people came to love him when he's just so conceited and idiotic. He's the angsty teenager to rule all angsty teenagers.I was thankful this series ended. I am depressed that they're still churning out spinoffs and films. Can we please relegate HP to the past already?",22,-0.9831,0.184,0.644,0.172,0.560277813040244,NEGATIVE,1.0
212,2028509003,06/13/2017,5.0," Re-read Again   Re-read Again:  I return to this book almost every year. What a beautiful, timeless story. Re-read for the Holidays:  Just as magical and epic as the first time around. One of my all time favourites. Re-read: 01/08/18  I had such a wonderful time listening to this as I fell asleep. In my opinion, this book was pretty much impeccable, and I do not think JK Rowling could have ended it any other way. I know these books mean a great deal to many of us, and when I heard those 3 closing farewell words read out loud in Jam Dale’s wonderful voice, I found myself smiling the way you would at something you once loved. When I was 11, this book did not appeal to me because it diverted from what I was used to in the series. But as an adult, I appreciate the complexity and darkness of the plot so much more. While this is not my favourite book in this series, it is nonetheless an incredible read, one that I will always remember and cherish.  Previous Review  ""To think that people had years and years, time to waste, so much time it dragged, and he was clinging to each second.""  I just finished reading this book and oh...my...gosh... I have so many emotions flowing through me right now. What can I say about a book that leaves me speechless? Finishing the last book in the Harry Potter series was a bittersweet experience. Like many others, I grew up with these characters and they mean a lot to me. I remember finishing this book as a child and realizing that there will probably never be a book 8. And even as an adult, I reached that same epiphany. However, I'm honoured that I had the opportunity to age with these books. I do not have enough words to describe the gratitude I feel towards JK Rowling for teaching me, and many others, about compassion, friendship, bravery and unity through this book series. Closing Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows felt a bit like losing a friend. I wonder if I'll ever feel the same connection towards another book like this again? There really is something magical about the Harry Potter book series. There are several familiar elements that are missing from this book. In the previous books, we were always used to Harry going back to Hogwarts, but not anymore. I was pretty bummed because reading about Hogwarts was my favourite part of the book series. No more Potions? No more Charms? No more Defence Against the Dark Arts? No more Quidditch? In fact, for most of this book, the trio are isolated from both the Wizarding and Muggle world. However, I understand the author wants the reader to understand the sacrifices Harry is making to defeat Voldemort. Harry has come of age and is forced to accept adult responsibilities. Finishing the dangerous task Dumbledore left Harry will prove to be a dangerous and rigorous journey.  From this point forward, this review contains spoilers  Hermione once said,  ""And if we can't trust Dumbledore, we can't trust anyone.""  In this book, we realize that Dumbledore never left Harry with clear instructions about destroying the Horcruxes. Harry is flooded with anger and resentment towards someone he saw as a father-figure. Even Ron and Hermione stumble as they struggle to continue following Harry without a clear plan. I was astounded reading about their loyalty to Harry because they both have the choice to leave and go into hiding, but they stay with him out of love, compassion and friendship. But I think Dumbledore, being the clever man that he was, knew the the trio would be able to fit the missing pieces of the puzzle together. On Potterwatch, Kingsley Shacklebolt said,  ""We're all human, aren't we? Every human life is worth the same, and worth saving.""  Despite the dangers of supporting Harry, many others fight during the Second Wizarding War. The Weasleys, Neville Longbottom, Lee Jordan, Luna Lovegood and countless others could have backed out of this. However, they continue fighting Voldemort because it is the right thing to do. The part where the trio saw the bruises on Neville and Seamus really stood out to me. They were willing to go be tortured to stand up for what is right. The scary thing is this fictional resistance reflects the protests that happened in the past and present. It reminded me a bit of the African-American Civil Rights Movement, where thousands of brave protestors continued to fight for equal rights. However, JK Rowling also makes the story complex because nothing is black and white. We are revealed details about Dumbledore that make us believe he was not the saint we all thought he was. Some of his political views when he was younger are debatable. Harry believes goodness is a leaner road and refuses to acknowledge like Ron and Hermione do that Dumbledore was simply naive at the time. Snape is another character who was always portrayed as being malicious and evil, but he loved Lily. The love he had enabled his heart to change and protect the person Lily died trying to save. He understands Lily put herself in danger by fighting Lord Voldemort and honours her by doing the same. The part that made me cry the most in this book was Dobby's death... I was listening to the audiobook and just began balling my eyes out. It was hard for me to believe that Dobby was no longer here. Our innocent, brave and noble Dobby who was a guardian throughout the book to Harry. Dobby, the creature most people treated like scum, died protecting others and demonstrating more bravery than many humans out there. When Harry scribbled,  ""Here lies Dobby, a Free Elf"" , I seriously couldn't control my tears. I think his death touched me the most in the series. The way JK Rowling was able to discuss complex topics like death and afterlife in this book were breathtaking to me. This made the last few chapters some of the most beautiful I have ever read. Near the end of the book, Harry makes the choice to sacrifice himself for the greater good. The way JK Rowling describes this is amazing. Harry acknowledges he never appreciated the brilliance of his own body. When he conjures the dead using the Resurrection Stone, he is relieved to see the spirits of his loved ones looking happy and healthy. I think the possibility of being reunited with them provides reassurance to Harry. Time also takes a standstill as Harry walks into the forbidden forest because every single second seems precious. When Harry is attacked by the killing curse, he goes to Kings Cross station, a place that once divided the magical and muggle world and now divides life and death. I know a lot of fans were disappointed with the lack of information revealed in the epilogue, but I was reading an interview where JK Rowling commented on it. She said she wrote it over and over again, but she felt like everything revealed too much information. Although it was factual, she felt like it was not a good piece of writing. I might be in the minority, but I actually really liked the epilogue. I was glad Harry finally had a family, which was the one thing he desired the most. I was relieved to know that  ""all was well""  when I ended the book series. Although I do agree it left me curious about lots of other characters, it was a nice way to end the series and keep some loop holes incase JK Rowling ever did decide to write an 8th book. This was my 3rd time re-reading this series and it was just as wonderful as I remember it. Although these books will always play a special role in my heart, I don't think I'll be re-reading them any time soon since I do want to continue forth on my reading journey and explore other books. But this is definitely a book series I'll go back to eventually and share with my future children. If you haven't experienced the wonders and magic of this captivating book, then I highly recommend you read it. :)",23,0.9961,0.128,0.703,0.169,0.4903301587301588,POSITIVE,0.9992

At the time this book came out, I was determined to re read Book 5 and Book 6 before starting this one so that I was completely refreshed before heading into this beast. I was also reading it during a Harry Potter con where I had to keep under raps that I was the only muggle alive who had not finished the book and who had not been spoiled yet LOL.I have to say because I was trying to superstar my reading life away, I wasn’t really absorbing the book and enjoying the way the plan all comes together.

Believe me it hurt to say it but its true even though it is only by a hair. The fifth book will always have a place in my heart but I just loved this book. I loved the pacing and how the plot developed. I loved the character growth and the way the wizarding world was being changed by the events of an era and war. I think what really was the most captivating thing for me in this book was how much I learned about Albus Dumbledore.In my mind all these years he was the untouchable father figure who was pretty much a saint.He could do no wrong. I had him on such a high pedestal and he was the moral compass that always pointed North in my eyes. During this re read I realized that Albus is just a man and he is as flawed as any other muggle or wizard around . I think I appreciated it even more now as an adult because I understand that we can only wear so many hats in this life and we can not be everything to everyone at every point in time. Understanding of his flaws, letting us and Harry see him as only a man who has made mistakes, was so humbling. Learning about his life made me love him more than I ever had in any of the previous books. This was a fantastic culmination of many years of character development and world building and I am so happy that I was able to be part of it when it released.

227,1733617680,08/20/2016,5.0,"This book settles it: Dumbledore may be one of the greatest characters ever created in the world of fiction. As Rowling turns her universe upside-down and reveals the past of a man who is fully accepted as the greatest wizard of all time, she reveals a character depth beyond belief. Dumbledore is made out to be a sinner, a villain, a God-like figure who does not stand in the way for an innocent sacrifice. He is good, but he is focused on the greater good, sacrificing individuals in order to achieve his goal. He loves Harry, heart and soul, but he still needs him dead. And worst of all? He has coldblodily known it all the time. While people has celebrated Snape's surprising sacrifice, I will always celebrate Dumbledore's betrayal. Purity and peace doesn't come without a price, and Dumbledore is willing to pay. He is a brilliant exception in Rowling's black-and-white universe. (view spoiler)[Along with Harry Potter of course. The part of Voldemort that lives in him reminds us that no one is pure. That we all hold a bit of evil – even though it has been attached to us by accidental spells and curses. (hide spoiler)]One thing that has been clear to me on rereading these books, is how black-and-white Rowling usually operates. Like the sorting hat, she conveniently divides her characters into good and evil and very few outsteps this path. I have always found it cowardly, how this book dismisses Slytherin-pupils for instance. An entire house of people, thrown out of the defining battle because they happen to be wearing green and silver. Rowling spends the entire series preaching how Slytherin isn't necessarily defined by evil – and yet, she chooses to dismiss them, when the fight is about to come. I've always hated it. I have always hated how the Slytherins in the end only seem to be allowed a single character trait. This time around, I also had a bit of trouble grasping the scope of Voldemort's evil. Is he about to destroy the universe? Will his rise to power mean the end of muggle-life? And if so, will it mean the end of every muggle in the world, or is his power restricted to Britain only? Why does the world not send help to fight him – why does the Order not include African, American or even European wizards? Voldemort's power and evil seems unlimited, and yet he is fought by an underground army consisting of Britains only, fighting the ultimate battle at a schoolground. I am confused by the perspective; Voldemort could rule the world, crush every offender – and yet he is at Hogwarts, fighting children. The suspense is however undeniable. We don't have time for so many strategic questions while reading this book, because it is nerve-wracking to read. Rowling makes you forget time and space – and even plot holes – as she drags you along for break-in's, wandlore, secret missions and treasure hunts for pieces of an evil soul.I have always loved the horcruxes and the psychological insight they provide into both Harry and Voldemort's soul. Little by little, you become fascinated with Voldemort's anger and his desire to be accepted, and you even come to understand the darkest corners of Harry's soul. While the treasure hunt itself is a bit tedious at times, its ultimate goal is breathtaking. However, as much as I've always loved the horcruxes, I've always hated the Deathly Hallows. It's puzzling why no one has ever mention Beedle the Bard earlier, as his tales are supposed to be the mythic pillars of the wizarding world. Why has Hermione, who has read about every book of wizardry, never stumbled upon these ancient tales – and why has Ron, who has grown up with these stories and loved them forever, never mentioned them? Why isn't there a magic frog card with Beedle the Bard? Why has Rowling never let a bit of the enthralling tales slip earlier? It's all so sudden. And to me, it's a bit implausible. As is wandlore itself.Wandlore is mythical, wonderful to read about, and impossible to understand. I'm still not sure about the whole allegiance thing; how exactly a wand's power is transferred or why. It's messy and I'd have loved a bit more explanation.But of course, I'd loved a bit more of everything. I love this book – mostly because of Dumbledore's character development (even beyond his death), and because it is so actionpacked and gratifying. Seven books, read in the dark with a galloping heart, and then this wonderful ending, where only a few characters are spared, and all are forever marked. This book may be filled with errors, but I am willing to overlook them. It is hard not to as these wonderful characters has been part of my life for so long.The Harry Potter-books are magical. And magic is hard to define. (view spoiler)[ A final note: I hate the ending relationships. This is perhaps more related to book six than book seven, but I've never understood Ginny and Harry. We get no explanation, no gradual falling-in-love process; suddenly Harry is in love with Ginny, while one moment earlier he wasn't. There was so much potential; so many scenes at the Burrow, Rowling could have used in order to build these feelings. Instead Harry falls in love out of jealousy.And then there's Ron and Hermione – another relationship enabled by hurt and jealousy. I can understand why Ron loves Hermione, but I can't understand why she loves him. He has been mean to her, ridiculing her, never appreciated her and even hinted she was ugly on several occasions. Would you fall in love with someone, who asked you out as a last resort, and loudly exclaimed that no one else wanted to go out with you? Would you fall in love with someone who got angry on the same occasion, because you actually went with someone else? Someone who ignored you, because he didn't appreciate you enough to ask? Someone who created an entire relationship with another girl, because he was jealous of a relationship you had before he had even shown interest in you? I think not. Ron is a lovely person, but he never treated Hermione well. At least not in my opinion. (hide spoiler)]",20,-0.9869,0.162,0.705,0.133,0.6270818903318901,NEGATIVE,0.9781

229,203027128,08/28/2011,3.0,"[First read: 2007. 2 starsSecond read: 1st March, 2016. 3 stars.]Read as part of The Infinite Variety Reading Challenge, based on the BBC's Big Read Poll of 2003.Here's a big fat review (longer than I usually write, more rambling and less coherent) that will focus on the series as a whole, as well as just this book.The first time I read this book-all those years ago when it first came out-I was pretty much fed up with Harry Potter at that point. It was too big: nothing deserves to be that big, not even Jesus, and it was, quite frankly, boring. So I skipped through the book and didn't really pay much attention. I also didn't see the film until much, much later and as a whole, the big pile of fandom just passed me by in to the void of nothingness behind me.As the years passed by, I wanted to dip my toe back in. I was feeling a bit nostalgic, I admit, but I also wanted to see if the magic of Harry Potter that everyone was going on about was there for me, too. TLDR; it is not.This book, the final of the series, is definitely one of the best of the series but it has some serious faults. You can definitely see the pressure that J.K. was under from, oh look, you lot, to finish the book and get it out so they could make the next film. I don't think this was quite the ending she really wanted and that is quite a big disappointment, though we can't hold the author accountable. (It's all your fault, really.)We still have two protagonists who haven't changed much in seven years: Harry and Ron have been the same semi-intelligent, slightly amusing and stupidly brave boys that we met in the first book. Hermione, I am glad to say, has changed from book to book, though there were a few moments when she really went a bit dodgy. As far as the other characters, I have to say they were all pretty much background and dull. I still can't get over how Luna Lovegood just turns up and randomly becomes an important character without actually saying or doing much at all. I also think a lot more could have been done with Neville: I thought he was pretty great and the way he ended the series was wonderful. It's very difficult to enjoy a series of books when you don't like (not hate) the main character. Did anyone really care if Harry died at the end, as long as Voldemort did as well? I didn't.I was also not a fan of the way most of the unpleasant characters were either fat or ugly. Most of the weird characters were a bit odd-looking, as well, and it just felt like an easy get-out of having to think of interesting characters who didn't conform to type. The thing about fantasy is that it's usually mostly the locations and settings that really make it magical. Harry Potter is extremely limited in location and that really made it feel small and closed off. Yes, Hogwarts is a fun Scottish castle, but really how much do we know about Hogwarts; how much did we really see? We barely explore the place and the places around it. I understand that magical people are pretty much hidden away, but it always felt like such a lacking world. Hogwarts was no more magical than Harry's cupboard, really (enchanted ceiling notwithstanding).The Deathly Hallows never quite felt like the ending it should have been. It was definitely the best written of the set, which just shows how a writer learns from their previous mistakes (which, sadly, a lot of authors don't seem to do) and the flow from preceding book to the follow up was better than it had been earlier on.I can't really see myself ever reading these ever again, unless I really run out of things to read. I find that rather saddening, because I can remember a time in my childhood-during the first few years of the earlier books and films-when I really loved this series. I remember the two weeks I really wanted to be an actor so I could be in the film and elope with whoever it was that played Sirius (Gary Oldman, I know, but back then I didn't care). I strongly remember that I felt bad for being in love with Draco for about a year, too (I have a thing for blondes). I will look back fondly on my mis-remembered feelings on Luna and treasure my rekindled love for Hermione. I think I am incredibly lucky to be of an age where I grew up at the right time for this series, but I'm also not supremely disappointed that the magic is no longer there.Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Pinterest | Shop | Etsy",20,0.9939,0.1,0.752,0.148,0.4788961038961041,NEGATIVE,0.9978

231,1210860250,02/24/2015,5.0,"As a whole series, my average rating for the series ends up roughly around 4 stars. This is purely because once the series gets over its initial roughness, keeping the charm and developing the characters it becomes a very solid and imaginative series. It may not be the 'epic' that some people are looking for in their fantasy - but like The Chronicles of Narnia its a quirky and appealing little series. Let's be honest: nothing I say or do not say about this series will persuade or dissuade anyone from reading these books if they put their mind to either standpoint. All I can say is how I found the novels and with all honesty I found that they improved so much that I think I will actually miss not having another book in the series to move on and read. I'm a huge reader of fantasy and have been since my mother read The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe to me as a six year old child (I went on to read the novel for myself the following year). There's something about the way a truly great fantasy novel can take you to a whole other world (same with sci-fi) and yet remind you about real world concepts, themes, emotions and values that is appealing. So, I admit that when other children grew up on Harry Potter, I grew up on the novels which preceded Harry Potter. I grew up in Narnia, Middle Earth, Wonderland, Neverland and so on. So as I saw the hype for the Harry Potter series (coupled with the fact that my parents thought the books a touch too dark for my age) I may have decided to avoid reading them, thinking that they were copycats of other, better, books. How snobbish of me.I would easily add this series (for the improvement, character building, world etc.) to my list of unique fantasy series. Of course this would be a list featuring the before mentioned books and also anything by Brandon Sanderson (particularly his Mistborn books), The Wheel of Time (if you don't mind looooong drawn out epic fantasy tales) and The Name of the Wind (as far as it has gone till now). I definitely am willing to recommend any books that you might like if you grew up on Harry Potter or anything similar. Pardon my ramblings, all I wish to say is that I was very impressed with the series after being less than so with the first two and a half books. The other four fully make the most of the promise of the first few books however and therefore create works of fiction which perform all that I believe literature should do.In the novels there are subtle and nuanced reflections on education and the influence of governments and politics on daily life. Rowling seems to imply that while government is a great thing behind the scenes to keep the world running there are times when it meddles in the greater good. Leonard Nimoy (RIP) passed away earlier and he once said (in character) that 'the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few'. I believe this is the concept that Rowling wished to convey about education and government. The few are in power and authority and it is their job to fulfill the needs of the many, not their own.I also love the final part of this novel with its very Christian message. In some ways Harry becomes a rough Christ figure in these novels (which has lead to the book's fair share of criticism such as how can you mix a message of faith with magic etc.) with how his love and sacrifice for his friends enables him to be able to defeat dark magic. It's a similar theme to that used in The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe but in a different way and I loved how it was used here. I was often told that the books were so non-Christian with the magic and everything but this conclusion is very Christian in how it conveys that evil is created through fear and a desire to become like God (all-powerful like Voldemort attempts to become) and that only sacrificial love can truly defeat the curse of evil. It's a great message and I would definitely not hide these books or ban them, I would encourage children to read them and then ask them questions about those themes!All in all, I definitely enjoyed the books and have also been enjoying the movies simultaneously. I wish in some senses that I had read them sooner and definitely recommend them for the story. Don't be sucked in by the hype, but do read them for their beautiful little story and thematic expression!",20,0.9994,0.055,0.726,0.219,0.5091056910569107,POSITIVE,0.9953

Until the very end, said James. They won't be able to see you? asked Harry. We are part of you, said Sirius. Invisible to anyone else.” “The house-elves of Hogwarts swarmed into the entrance hall, screaming and waving carving knives and cleavers, and at their head, the locket of Regulus Black bouncing on his chest, was Kreacher, his bullfrog’s voice audible even above this din: “Fight!

Always.""I've been staring at this blank box for over 10 minutes trying to think of a way to start reviewing the majesty of a book that was Deathly Hallows.There are truly too many emotions clouding my judgement at the moment, just give me a sec.First off I want to say that I'm utterly heartbroken, not only because this book was heartbreaking itself, but because I've just finished reading the Harry Potter series for the first time. I had seen the movies, many, many, MANY times, but I'd never picked up the books, don't ask me, I honestly don't know why. Now that it's over, I truly don't know what to do with myself, I'm so invested in this world, and in this story...to not have another book to look forward to is the most saddening thing. But, still, it was an indescribable experience, and I'm so glad I decided to start this journey back on September. I remember that I actually read Harry's first September 1st scene, on September 1st. I don't know why that brings me so much happiness. The coincidence made it feel like fate, and I DON'T CARE IF IT'S CHEESY, IT'S REAL.On to the good stuff: THIS BOOK WAS UNREAL. Everything, literally EVERYTHING was pure magic. Pun intended. This epic conclusion was, by far, the best series closer I've ever read in my life, nothing could beat this magnificent ending. Everything was so well explained, and thought-out, many loose-ends from other books were corrected in this conclusion, making every book essential, every pointless detail was taken into consideration, and made part of something bigger. That's where J. K. Rowling's true magic lies: being able to forge simple details and conversations into something so big, none of us could see it coming.Harry's, Ron's and Hermione's friendship was severely tested in this book, and their weaknesses were enhanced, so we got to witness the good, the bad, and the ugly that each character has, part because of the environment they endured for basically the whole book (being hunted 24/7, and having to live in the woods for a ridiculously long period of time) and because of the Horcruxes' effect. The whole deal with the Horcruxes was utterly fascinating, every aspect of it intrigued me, from Voldemort's fascination with conquering death, to how he came to know about the Horcruxes, to how he started making them, to the importance of his past, to the though-out locations where he hid them, to the effect they had on people, to how they had to be destroyed, and to the fact that he made a seventh unintended Horcrux that lived inside the boy he most desired to kill. The irony in all of it made me relish with amazement. Something I'd missed with the movies were the lengthy explanations that we get with the book, the explanations of why this Horcrux lived inside Harry, why he lived through two Killing Curses, and how Dumbledore wasn't truly the great man we thought he was.I'm not going to go into a lot of details about the book in case some of you haven't read it, or don't know what happens. Basically, I loved all of this:1. RON AND HERMIONE. -- this the book where Ron's actively trying to start things up with Hermione, with his love advice book at the beginning, and his distraught at Voldemort's Harry/Hermione ship (the scene when he destroys the Horcrux), and protecting her at EVERY moment. This book made Ron shine so much, through the ups and downs, we say an incredible, loyal man.2. HARRY AND GINNY. -- I mean. MUST I SAY MORE? I LOVE THEM.3. THAT EPILOGUE, MAN. -- Perfection. I do wish we'd gotten intel about what became of our three main characters: did Harry become an Auror? What did Hermione & Ron end up doing?4. The EPIC HOGWARTS BATTLE -- Neville. UGH what a SWEETHEART.5. EVERYTHING THAT HAD TO DO WITH HORCRUXES -- finding them, their locations, what they were, how to destroy them, their meaning, EVERYTHING.6. DEATHLY HALLOWS -- I ESPECIALLY loved the scene where they share the myth revolving the three objects.7. HAGRID -- THAT MAN KILLS ME. He's a sweetheart, and everything he does and says will always be beautiful to me. The scene where he has to carry Harry's body. Jesus. That scene is powerful. It brings everything full circle. 8. Kreacher's redemption: DEAR LORD, this elf was the death of me. I used to hate his GUTS, and in the movie, his redemption didn't happen, but in the book it did, and it was beautiful. He helped Harry, Ron & Hermione get one of the Horcruxes, and he had a hand in the final epic battle, where he led the elves against Voldemort's army.9. Dobby: Dobby was very painful. I can't quite put into words how much I loved this character and the sadness his ending caused me. 10. I LOVED the breaking into the Ministry's scene. EPIC. And breaking into Gringotts was SO MUCH FUN, Hermione's impression of Bellatrix was everything.11. SNAPE'S TRUTH: This was my absolute favorite part of the book. When we (FINALLY!) get to see his memories, and see how he's been protecting Harry all this time, was truly on our side, and beautiful his character actually was... He wasn't perfect. He wasn't a great guy. He had his flaws. But he was real. He was loyal, to a fault. He protected, even when sometimes he shouldn't. He was a magnificent character with an incredible arc, without a doubt my favorite character of all-time. Watching him during this book was heartbreaking, but the end was worth it. When Harry finally found out the truth...it was worth it. Silver doe. SILVER DOE. Enough said. I'm done. No more.12. ""Not my daughter, YOU BITCH"" -- epic.When Percy came back, to help in the Hogwarts battle... I broke down. I broke down BAD. And his stunning scene with Fred... where Perce made that joke. I still can't quite put into words how much it affected me. My heart breaks. Every time.As I said, this was an amazing experience, I can't wait to reread them, and then re-read all my reviews. It's been amazing.I really can't say more, I keep crying every time I write a new bullet, so I'm gonna go, watch the final two movies, and cry some more. If you're still here, thank you for reading.

244,4103832281,07/08/2021,5.0,"Ratings:Stars: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)Plot: 👑👑👑👑👑👑 (5/5)How Much I enjoyed it: 💙💙💙💙💙 (5/5)A good morning/afternoon/evening to you muggle/witch/wizard! Here is my review on The Deathly Hallows book! I put on my Ravenclaw Diadem on for it😜😜😜It would be an insult to the book if I simply stated ‘I love this book’. I mean, look at that opening sentence. The two men appeared out of nowhere, a few yards apart in the narrow, moonlit laneI mean like.. who could resist that sentence?!?!I have a deep opinion about the Deathly Hallows:The Invisibility Cloak:*I could eat unlimited chocolate from the fridge at midnight without creeping any of my family members*I could get out of the house without getting in trouble*I could ride a motorcycle and freak people out to make them think it was self driving*I could surprise my cousins at their doorstep at the other side of the world*I could go places like movie theaters and concerts would be accessible without fee.*I could be a fantastic hide-n-seek player.(which I'm usually terrible at)* And my personal favorite, you could pull some pretty scary pranks on Halloween.But with the Resurrection Stone:*I could bring my favorite people back to life*I could make other people happy with the power of it *I could make 'grumpy' people 'ungrumpy' (I don't know if that's a word)With the Elder Wand though:*I COULD BECOME INVISIBLE WITHOUT the Invisibility Cloak!!!*I could beat up alot of bullies and people I don't like (like... OK, some people aren't gonna like this but.... okay... I'm not gonna say.. if you really) wanna know just tell me*It's a combination of a cloak and a wand ultimately powerful undefeatable wand and a cloak that can make your greatest dreams of a midnight chocolate frog fiesta true!!!!! ____________________________________All you need to know about Horcruxes:A Horcrux was an object in which a Dark wizard or witch had hidden a fragment of his or her soul in order to become immortal. Horcruxes could only be created after committing murder, the supreme act of evil. The Horcrux was considered to be the darkest art and the most terrible of all dark magic.Voldermort's horcruxes were:⦿Tom Riddle's diary. ⦿Marvolo Gaunt's Ring. ⦿Salazar Slytherin's Locket. ⦿Helga Hufflepuff's Cup. ⦿Rowena Ravenclaw's Diadem. ⦿Harry Potter (unknown to Voldemort until after he had ""destroyed"" him) -> Destroyed in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows⦿Nagini the Snake (Was previously a woman)It is perhaps interesting that no person destroyed more than one Horcrux. Harry, Ron, Hermione, Neville, Dumbledore, Crabbe (indirectly: the diadem fell apart in Harry's hands after being damaged by Crabbe's fiendfyre), and Voldemort each destroyed one of the seven.So the destroyers and which horcrux they destroyed are:Tom Riddle’s Diary- Before his demise, Voldemort gave his Diary to Lucius Malfoy. Malfoy gave it to Ginny Weasley both to get rid of it and discredit Arthur. It caused a lot of trouble and possessed Ginny, though it was destroyed by Harry Potter in the Chamber of Secrets by a Basilisk fang. This one was arguably 100% luck.Marvolo Gaunt’s ring-destroyed by Albus Dumbledore behind the scenes by Gryffindor’s sword, though it pretty much cost him his lifeSlytherin’s Locket- after being carried around by the trio for months and causing a lot of trouble, it was destroyed by Ron Weasley in an unknown forest using Gryffindor’s sword. It didn’t go without a fight, however, and made Ron see his worst fear, such as the fact that Harry and Hermione both like each other more than him.Hufflepuff’s cup- retrieved from the Lestrange vault in Gringotts Bank by the trio, it was destroyed by a Basilisk fang in the Chamber of Secrets during the Battle of Hogwarts.Ravenclaw’s diadem- found and destroyed in the Room of Requirement by Fiendfyre cast by Vincent Crabbe. Crabbe was killed by his own curse.Nagini- killed by Neville Longbottom using Gryffindor’s sword during the Battle of Hogwarts. Neville has just bravely stood up to Voldemort and had the Sorting Hat placed on his head and lit aflame. Neville pulled the sword out and cut Nagini in half.Harry Potter- killed by Voldemort’s Avada Kedavra in the Forbidden Forest on the second day of the Battle of Hogwarts. Harry survived due to his true ownership of the Elder Wand, which would not kill its own master.Voldemort- killed due to his own rebounding curse. Harry cast expelliarmus and Voldemort cast Avada Kedavra, and once again the Elder Wand would not kill Harry. The both curses hit Voldemort, and Harry caught the Elder Wand while Voldemort died.And how could I end without any quotes?Albus Dumbledore:Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and, above all those who live without loveDumbledore watched her fly away, and as her silvery glow faded he turned back to Snape, and his eyes were full of tears.After all this time?Always,"" said Snape. (Potterheads like me start to cry over Lily's death)Harry Potter & Ron Weasley:Death's got an Invisibility Cloak?"" Harry interrupted again.So he can sneak up on people,"" said Ron. ""Sometimes he gets bored of running at them, flapping his arms and shrieking... (Potterheads exploding with laughter)And what in the name of Merlin's most baggy Y-fronts was that about? (Every Potterhead in the universe still shocked that of all people Hermione said 'Merlin's pants!')If we die for them I'll kill you, Harry!

Those who, like you, have leadership thrust upon them, and take up the mantle because they must, and find to their own surprise that they wear it well."" (718) -Albus Dumbledore Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ends the series on a particularly sweet note for fans who have grown up reading about Harry, Ron, Hermoine, and the entire wonderful cast of characters and creatures who inhabit it's lore. The book begins in a rather depressing way. Dumbledore has passed on and Harry is left to finish his fight against Voldemort who has slowly gained power over the past six novels; enough to control the ministry of magic and leave Potter and any witches/wizards who rise against him to flee into hiding. A good portion of the book has Harry on the run, and while meant to be despairing, this is where the book tends to drag a little. However, the build-up to the epic conclusion is something that brings up very fond memories of growing up reading this series over 10 years or so and grinning foolishly like a total fanboy at how J.K. Rowling managed to tie the series all together. Two chapters in particular, ""The Princes Tale"" and ""King's Cross"" are so exceptional in giving backstory to Severus Snape and Albus Dumbledore that they are so thrilling to read and uncover. What a grand journey this has been for readers.Rating 4.5/5",20,0.9895,0.071,0.744,0.185,0.5903985507246378,POSITIVE,0.9995
246,2220016109,12/20/2017,4.0,"This review can also be found on my blog here.I can’t believe it’s over, these past two months i have been completely consumed in the wizarding world and now, its over and it feels so finalised! Throughout reading these books i continued to ask myself “why did you not read these books earlier?” but now i am actually happy i waited till now at a time in my life when i can truly understand everything that Harry goes through and pick up on the lessons that you learn throughout. Such a gripping and empowering book that i will probably cherish forever.I think with being her last book, J.K Rowlings writing flourishes here. It still has everything we expect from her, the comradery, love, adventure and humour, but with so much more feeling to it, that in just the way she wrote out certain moments could change my mood. It was incredible. I also found her writing expanding to areas she had only touched on before. Things concerning grief, power struggles and the strains of friendship that i think she worked through really well. Super impressed with the writing in this one.I can’t get over how much I loved this story. the last book ends with them planning a quest to find the Horcruxes and this is exactly what the majority of the story focuses on. It really is the be all end all kind of thing, because if they don’t find them, then all is lost, and you definitely feel that pressure on the trio throughout the book.Many parts were a bit slow and depressing when they felt they had nowhere to turn and didn’t know what to do next, but again, that despair makes it more real for the reader in understanding what they’re going through. So that didn’t bother me too much. However, there were some lovely moments that we get to see of everyone in the order together again, the Weasley family, Harry’s trip down memory lane and of course the DA members coming back a little. J.K Rowling really knows how to tug at your heartstrings and it is no different in this book!The plot is actually so encapsulating, due to it really being the end of Harry’s story and as it progresses you feel it building up and you know the defining moment is coming but you still don’t know what that will be. It’s all just so much to deal with at once and it felt overpowering towards the end of the book. It was perfect though, because i know that is exactly the way Harry feels at the time, and J.K Rowling did that on purpose so we would understand how much of a toll everything is taking on him. SOOOO many emotions guys, i can’t even begin to explain how this book made me feel.As far as “character developments” go i thought there wouldn’t really be more considering this is the seventh and final book, but this is the point in which Harry truly becomes a man and we see how different he really is from not only Voldemort but Dumbledore also. Harry really is a unique and realistic character who i have come to adore. He makes mistakes, he gets confused, he is brave but still terrified of things he has to do and i have come to appreciate it all.We get a lot of Hermione and Ron in this book, being that they are with Harry for the majority of the story on his travels and for the first time we really see a crack in their relationship, but what i love is how J.K Rowling works with this to make them all the better friends. So much love and determination from these two and they really are what makes the book all that more special.One thing i definitely wanted to talk about are the deaths. There is a lot of death in this book. Some big blows and some small but all are very significant to Harry in this battle he is fighting. I think because there is seven books and we get that time to really bond with the secondary characters that when one of them dies, it feels like someone you actually know. This book had me bawling for the last 100 pages and i just couldn’t believe what i was reading. You know someone is a great author when they can do that to you!Lastly, i just want to say how impressed i am that J.K Rowling made it possible to do her traditional end of the book info dump on us in such an extraordinary way in the “Kings Cross” place. What a cheeky author making that possible but I love her all the more for it. Love those conversations, we learn so much!Honestly, such a freaking fantastic series and it all came to a very poetic end, that personally suited me just fine. I adored the story of Harry’s crazy, daring and loving life and i feel like i am apart of it in some way, as is everyone who reads these books and goes on the adventures with Harry. Loved it.",19,0.999,0.064,0.763,0.173,0.5348098929494278,POSITIVE,0.9998
247,1277493681,05/11/2015,5.0,"The bar of expectation has been set phenomenally high for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. And the book not only meets the expectations, but exceeds them.The themes examined in this book are quite mature: how governments twist the truth, how newspapers and media, as the voice of the government, feed misinformation for all sorts of reasons, how trusted adults may have dark pasts and not-so-pure motives. We're past the ""simple"" issues of revenge and love and well into far more complex agendas.Many children's books (fairy tales) have clear sets of morals and well-defined heroes and enemies: the wicked stepmother, the beautiful princess, the knight in shining armor. This final volume is much more grey; the lines of black and white, good and evil, are not so clear-cut in this book. This is probably very unsettling for younger readers who need to feel secure in a world where grown-ups can be trusted. For more mature readers, this is a beautiful example of peeling back the layers of the onion of life. The series began with a very innocent view of the world, from the viewpoint of a young Harry Potter. As he aged and matured, so did our ability to see what was happening, and we saw his attempts to understand the reason for the actions of his teachers, his friends' parents, and other characters in his ever-expanding world.In Deathly Hallows, Harry is now an adult. He has turned 17, age of adulthood for wizards. He is no longer safe with his aunt and uncle, the protective spell now removed. He can take control of his own actions and path in life. As we all know (and maybe even learned the hard way), this is hardly the freedom that teenagers think it will be. That freedom to rule your own life brings the responsibility for how your actions will affect those around you, the ones that you care for. Harry's choices have a huge impact on Hermoine and Ron, and many, many others who valiantly stand by their friend.In one sense, Harry has been set on a path by Dumbledore, and perhaps all that happens is Dumbledore's fault. On the other hand, Harry has free will, and Dumbledore's instructions have always been vague at best. Harry has quite a range of choice in what he does and does not do. Almost every one of those choices are difficult at best.There are meditations here on the meaning of death and life, on the value of sacrifice. Every character has known pain and has made decisions for selfish reasons. There are celebrations of new beginnings, and there are some endings as well. These mediations shows up often in fine literature; this imagery has been around since mankind began civilization and it is an integral part of how our society works. It is central to this Deathly Hollows, and the book wouldn't be nearly as successful if Ms. Rowling didn't address these thoughts.People looking for non-stop high school hijinks and game competitions will be disappointed. This final novel has none of that. In fact, there are long stretches where the characters feel stymied, and it feels like no progress is being made. The book forces the reader to slow down, to think deeply about what is going on, to feel the strain and pressure of achieving extremely difficult goals. There are action sequences and well-described battles, but these are the exception, not the rule. Deathly Hallows is about intense internal struggles and deeply emotional challenges.The vocabulary reflects this as well. This book is not meant to be skimmed or jumped through. The wording and the sentence structure encourage the reader to go slowly, to contemplate, to think about what is being said. While Harry spends weeks contemplating issues and trying to figure out how he feels about an issue, the reader is encouraged to do the same. It's an adventure of self-exploration.As I already mentioned, the bar was set exceedingly high for this book. It was expected to be exactly perfect, a stunning work of literature appropriate for every age group. It was expected to satisfy both those who wanted a blockbuster ""Hollywood Ending"" as well as those who feel realism requires death, destruction, and bleak despair. While it did not quite achieve all of those goals (it came REALLY close), it is an outstanding book which has exposed millions of people to questions and issues they might not have otherwise encountered. It encourages people to think about the world they live in. You cannot ask any book to do much more than that.",19,0.9983,0.09,0.724,0.185,0.5552076960076959,POSITIVE,0.9878
248,1860585077,01/09/2017,5.0,"*spoilers*This is officially my very first time I’ve completely re-read this series and it’s quite possible that I love it even more than I did before. Reading all books back to back (I started the first one in October and finished the last one in January) only made it even more apparent what an incredible saga that Rowling gifted us. All the linked parts, the character development, and just how astonishing it was to see it all unfold. Somehow it still managed to leave me awed even knowing how it all ends. While my opinions of the series as a whole didn’t change (other than the fact that my favorite book is now officially Half-Blood Prince and I’ve gotten over my irritation with Dobby) there is one aspect in these stories that I paid a lot more attention to this go around: Dumbledore and Snape.First and foremost, I’m team Snape (and a Slytherin if you were curious). Yes, I am fully aware that he was a horrible shithead to a bunch of children, primarily Harry, and the only reason was because he loved Harry’s mother and she didn’t love him. Boo-hoo. I’m also aware that he was a Death Eater doing terrible things on behalf of Voldemort before he joined up with Dumbeldore. I’m aware of all these things but I can still appreciate the bravery and risks he took in the name of love, even it was misguided. It doesn’t necessarily make him a hero in my eyes and his actions don’t make up for the wrong he did, but it is still worthy of mention. Don’t agree?hahaha Kidding. But on to an even more controversial topic: Dumbledore was kind of a dick. Sure, at first he’s that kind, fatherly figure that Harry can’t help but look up to. But when year after year at Hogwarts passes and poor young Harry is dealing with shit that he can barely comprehend, does Dumbledore make it a point to educate him on the ways of the wizarding world? Nope. And when we finally realize what’s been going on this entire time? That he’s known from the very beginning that Harry was going to have to die for the “greater good”?!Sure, if he had told Harry at an early age he could have lost his marbles at the prospect of an early death so I understand why he didn’t tell him but I definitely don’t agree with it because he didn’t treat Harry like a pawn; he treated him like he was someone special to him. Think of all the times that Harry was touting Dumbledore’s greatness while from the very beginning he’s known the endgame all along.Leave an infant on a doorstep, don’t even ring the doorbell. They’ll find him in the morning. Know Harry’s living in a goddamn cupboard under the stairs, constantly abused by the Dursley’s–does nothing. Let Snape continue to mistreat him unnecessarily. Blames it on the fact he developed feelings for the reason why he’s lied to Harry his entire life… talk about emotional manipulation. Not letting Harry in on the secret of the horcruxes until after he was doomed to die because his dumbass, for personal advancement reasons, put it on because it was also a Hallow. Dick move, Dumbledore. /rantRowling really achieved greatness with this final installment. Each installment has progressively gotten darker as Harry and all other characters take step after step into adulthood. This world that Rowling has created is both horrible and mesmerizing in equal measure. A world where there are creatures that can suck out your very soul, but also wondrous creatures like unicorns and Hippogriffs. A world where you can be struck down with two simple words, but also where owls deliver your mail and paintings talk. But the most wondrous thing that Rowling accomplished with these stories is just how many lives she transformed, mine included. It’s enough to make anyone believe in magic.",19,-0.9855,0.135,0.764,0.1,0.5872698412698412,POSITIVE,0.9995
249,4818925,08/20/2007,5.0,"IT IS NOT FOR ALL CHILDREN some SHELTERED CHILDREN might not be permitted by parents to read such harsh language and killing scenes.Some CHILDREN might not be educated enough to understand the plot and deep messages this book does have, which are intended for adult readers.Yes, some CHILDREN may be ready for this type of story, but many are not, due to parental restrictions in their lives.I firmly believe if a child has lived through horrid events then they will be able to read this. I guess sometimes it was hard for me to imagine that there was someone writing these remarkable stories. I really started to feel the characters after seeing the movies. I could hear them in my head their accents and everything!I forgot that there was a WOMAN behind the scenes. Someone a lot like me.J.K. Rowling was a single mother of two kids and on welfare! She started the books not really understanding what an impact they would make in people's lives!She never thought her books would be banned and hated my many people.Or that many billions more would LOVE her and her brilliant writing skills.I have learned that we all are magical beings. No matter what religion we are, we have love, bravery and imaginations...we are creative and romantic...There is a story in all of our hearts. I found that I have been fighting DEMENTORS and Voldemort's for a long time. I found that my own life struggles are a lesson for me. A journey I must take sometimes alone and sometimes with friends or family.Before I read Deathly Hallows I understood something, Death is a part of our Lives. We cannot survive one without the other. If we are not born we would not die.We must do both.I knew this before reading the last book.I have the Magic in me to survive death, by walking right into it when the time comes.It will not be a terrible thing, only leaving behind the ones we love and knowing that they will miss us sorely. Knowing that and end of our journey here the end of our story...the book will be replaced on the shelve and maybe not read again for a long time...When someone we love takes a photo of us or a letter we wrote long ago while we lived, and read it and for a moment remember us and we will be alive again in a memory in a heart beat in the tears...We will be once more remembered and for a few moments alive...and then we will rest again...a memory for another day. Inside the hearts of those who love us we will remain alive and warm and LOVED...Our spirit will have long journeyed on to a new place a new time making more friends and families and stories...I love my mind how it is.I might not be societies perfect person but who is?I have flaws.I am moody and emotional. I love too much and give of myself. I am a great friend and mother. A healer and artist and creator of stories and I grow plants and care for animals...I am human.I am me.And J.K.

Because it will add some excitement to the pages of my life-book! I am sure my girls will always remember my nerdish obsession with HARRY POTTER.THIS BOOK: HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS Is not for ALL children under the age of oh let's say 10.It is full of death and killing. Of course it was coming, all this drastic drama, but I really do not see a reason for J.K. Rowling to feel she needed to kill certain people.I will not spoil WHO gets the axe, but I have never cried so much in any of these books!However in LIFE there comes DEATH, and some people must stand up and choose between what is RIGHT and what is EASY!And I will always remember the ones who gave their lives in this book to make the Witch & Wizarding world safe once more!A great read, I am planning to keep this as all the books in my collection for as long as I live.

That said, this is the first time I felt strange after finishing a Harry Potter book. Once I had finished crying, it dawned on me how very unlike the other books it was. Maybe it's because it's the only one I haven't read 2-10 times, but it felt unfamiliar. I think it was probably the lack of Hogwarts.

The Deathly Hallows is the last book in the Harry Potter series and I feel like it was a long time coming: the last two books were pretty slow and unnecessarily long. However, this had more action and I had a nice time reading it (actually, listening to the audiobook, which has great narration).

266,852497588,02/11/2014,2.0,"third time’s the charm? the first time i read the book, i was happy that it was terrible. the second time, disappointed. this time, the book doesn’t do what i wanted it to do and what should happen, but it’s not entirely terrible.1. in half blood prince, dumbledore speaks at length about how evil is self-defeating. i think jkr must have felt a kind of responsibility to make evil seem unattractive (maybe because of how troubled she was that draco was a fan favourite) ergo pureblood obsession leads to becoming insane, poor, ugly, bestial. voldemort is powerful technically but also weak, blind, cowardly, and mad. his defeat is not because harry is particularly able but because of his own failings. one of the most skilled legillimens in the world (he’s been doing this since early childhood, before he knew he was a wizard) has somehow has forgotten what occulmency is and allows harry to see his mind and even his thoughts without realizing this is happening because he’s so out of control. i feel harry being able to read voldemort’s actual thoughts is jkr’s way of showing us that dumbledore’s fanfic of riddle was correct; he’s a 101 study in abnormal psychology whose every move can be predicted because he is such a limited person with such a limited understanding of others. this is just not very satisfying. evil being self-defeating isn’t really a thing, and making the villain of the story pathetic isn’t interesting to read. in the previous book, it was also revealed that voldemort's whole understanding of his mother as the victim of a muggle was incorrect - she was the victim of her pureblood family, and in turn, victimized voldemort's muggle father. jkr gives voldemort no legitimate basis for his prejudice towards muggles whatsoever... which is a choice. i wonder if jkr did this so she could give this plotline to dumbledore's family instead.2. i think jkr's problems with writing voldemort is part of a larger issue she has with depicting slytherin characters with complexity, which is why the inter-house unity plotline was abandoned. it feels a little like jkr exhausted herself by coming up with two slytherins that weren't completely evil - draco, who found the actual business of being in a terrorist group too gory (though i approve of everything she’s done with draco), and snape, who decided terrorism was bad because it threatened the woman he was freakishly obsessed with. i think the closest jkr really gets is with regulus but his narrative is very contained. it's a little annoying to me that voldemort, sirius and phineas nigellus never find out that regulus stole that horcrux. snape being remembered while regulus seems forgotten feels wrong.3. i don’t actually mind the hallows plot in itself. what does bother me is that there hasn’t been really a trace of this before, and that the traces we do have don’t fit (why can a magical eye see through the invisibility cloak it if it’s so unique? how does this concept of mastering wands work - does it apply to when kids disarm each other in classes?) also that this is lore only known to those with wizarding families. voldemort’s failure is precisely because of his muggle background. dumbledore tries to say it's because voldemort sees fairy tales as beneath him, but this doesn’t really fit; hermione didn’t believe it either, and that lack of faith in fairy tales isn’t a moral failing, nor is ignorance of the stories themselves. the idea that riddle wouldn’t care about wizarding lore because he sees it as beneath him also doesn’t seem to fit with him spending five years tracking down the mythical chamber of secrets. really, given that harry has the cloak because of his ancestor, the whole hallows plot is a weirdly elitist kind of argument being made about people who understand wizarding culture because they are embedded in it vs those who don’t. also we don’t need voldemort and harry to be related. it’s odd that jkr kills the voldemort/harry parallels entirely but makes them actually related. 4. the wizards vs other magical beings plot should have started much earlier on in the series. the issues with the goblins in particular could have been brought up in the very first book; jkr gives us a few random facts about goblin rebellions in pretty much every book but nothing that leads to what she’s attempting here. (i also feel that the goblin concept of ownership may be based on something jkr read about indigenous understandings of property rights, and if so, there are some nasty implications there, just as there were when she drew a comparison between werewolves and being hiv positive.) there was a real attempt to build the house elf plotline, but unfortunately, jkr didn’t know how to resolve it.5. in terms of specific character issues, i'm still not okay with harry casually using unforgivable curses. harry not being able to use unforgivable curses is a major plot point in the last two books.... his horror at sectumsempra was true to his character; crucio'ing a death eater for spitting at mcgonagall is not. ron is written in an extremely irritating way; yes, people struggle with being insecure all their lives but no one wants to read about a character's cruel, jealous and petty shit for seven books. ron could have grown out of his insecurities by becoming actually good at something instead of implausibly opening the chamber of secrets, and inexplicably 'winning' hermione. ginny is written very oddly; her obedience to harry is really disturbing given that they'd only been dating for one month when they broke up, and that she doesn't have a significant role against voldemort is poor writing. molly vs bellatrix is also poor writing; once again we have jkr's good woman vs bad woman theme, and it's ugly that sirius' killer (and the longbottoms' torturer) is killed by someone who had no personal grievance with her and also actively disliked sirius. lupin (and tonks! because in the last two books, tonks has just turned into lupin's appendage) dying offpage so that the marauders are all neatly dead and the weasley family can be preserved is also very ugly. re: snape, going with the incel angle was a decidedly weird choice but what makes it really unforgivable is jkr pressing the idea that dumbledore (and harry) believe that snape genuinely loved lily when what she wrote clearly says he didn't. i also don’t see the point in introducing dean or ted tonks at all. dean here is so disconnected from the trio even though he was on the quidditch team, dated ron’s sister, and lived with them for six years. ted tonks should have been cut because how are we to care about tonks' family when jkr hasn't even bothered writing anything re: tonks other than she's obsessed with lupin?6. i’m not really sure what i loved about harry potter when i was in fandom. i know i was incredibly disappointed in what she did in half blood prince, and i had pretty much the same criticisms as i do now, but what was the specific draw for me then? now, what i appreciate about the series is how harry’s grief is so close to the surface.“But it seemed that to Dumbledore, the fact that their families lay side by side in the same graveyard had been an unimportant coincidence, irrelevant, perhaps, to the job he wanted Harry to do.”no one quite gets it. hermione pathologizes and ron ranges from careless to callous. harry is just very alone with the weight of all of it and maybe that’s why he’s remains a compelling character in spite of all the poor choices jkr made.",18,-0.9998,0.219,0.717,0.064,0.5704393622250764,NEGATIVE,0.9997
267,2698902723,02/03/2019,5.0,"“Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living and, above all, pity those who live without love.”Ah, the final book. It’s still always so sad when the Harry Potter binge comes to an end. I’m going to try and keep this review brief, to avoid recycling the same fan girl ramblings from my previous reviews.While this is a five star read I do feel like everyone is a little bit lost without Hogwarts, at least at the beginning. It doesn’t take long for the momentum to pick up but it definitely feels different to the rest.Highlights: Neville. How’s that character development?! What. A. Guy.McGonagall. She’s just a total badass, always has been, and Hogwarts is so lucky to have her. That moment between her, Harry and the Carrows perfectly depicts how much respect we should all show for this woman and I’m so glad it happened.Kreacher! I’d have to put his character development pretty close with Neville’s. He comes so far and his actions in this book just made my heart happy.Snape. Yes, he unnecessarily bullies the kids and that’s not okay but his story, his bravery and sacrifices just break my heart. Snape gets all my love.The major highlight though, is the execution of this as the final book. Everything that was hinted at, all of the questions that had remained unanswered, it all ties in beautifully and leaves me with so much respect for the level of detail and forethought put into this series.My one big gripe - that off the page death! I get it, there’s a lot going on at that point, but you cannot kill off one of the sweetest people to have ever existed, and someone I deem to be a pretty important character, and not take the time to explain that and let us process what this means. This character deserved so much better.And that, my friends, is my ‘brief’ review 🙄Every time I revisit these books I find myself appreciating characters that maybe I’d overlooked previously.

268,149066960,02/18/2011,5.0,"Well ahh, I'm the 26,372nd person to review this, so I guess there's not much I can say that hasn't already been said. So, Harry Potter. I finally finished reading all of them. It took me forever and a day, but I did it! For some reason this one took me a particularly long time. Don't know why. I kept being like, ""*Reads five pages* .... OKAY! Off to do something else."" I guess because it was a little slow starting out. The first half of it was a lot of sitting around in the woods and being like *ARGUE ARGUE ARGUE* But, it got a lot better as it went along. I know J.K. Rowling did have to tie up a lot of things, so that's probably why it was so long and had so much information, etc.Anyway. So I read the second half of it in the car on a 2-hour ride home from Connecticut about a week ago. And toward the end it was getting dark outside, so I had to use my iPod as a flashlight and it was rather difficult and I was getting a headache. But I was like, ""MUST. FINISH."" It was a good ending. Very satisfying. I've heard people complain about the ending being too happy and whatnot, but it wasn't really ... I mean, half the characters died. (Well, okay, not half. But a lot.) It was bittersweet. And heck, after all that crap he went through, HARRY POTTER DESERVES TO BE HAPPY.Blah blah blah. Still wracking my brain for things to say. I don't know. The thing is, the series was a bit ruined for me because I waited so long to read them; hence, I pretty much knew everything that was going to happen and was mentally/emotionally prepared for everything. So it's kind of hard to evaluate.UMMMM well. I know everyone says this but ... oh my gosh, this series has so much detail. As a writer I utterly fail at details. I'm like, ""I should probably explain this more. Nah. I should give this character some kind of backstory. Nah."" Whereas, J.K. Rowling has some crazy detailed history for every single one of her characters. AGGGHHH. How did she write these books in less than a hundred years? There's a purpose for everyone and everything in these books. And evidently, she had the last book planned even when she was writing the first book. A lot of series fall flat on the planning aspect; they seem like the author says to his/herself, ""Meh, I don't have any other ideas so I'll just write some crappy sequel to that other thing I wrote!"" But with Harry Potter, there's a reason for every book, and for everything that happens––even the smallest details. Just .... GAHHH GAHHHHHH HHHAAHGKL;KLDJ. I don't know how to express my awe. It's not fair. I now feel the need to write 100-page outlines for everything I'm writing ... which I guess is a good thing. Anyway, so, the characters. Well, as I said, there's a reason for all of them. And they all have such cool backstories. Except Harry Potter is kind of annoying. And I wish Ginny had been more interesting and that Harry's interest in her hadn't been so random. But, whatevs. I like everyone else. Ron and Hermione are an adorable couple. Voldemort is really creepy (but I love his backstory). Dobby is awesome *cries*. And OHMYGOSH I love Snape. He's so cool. I was the most sad about his death. Especially afterward when you find out his whole backstory. He and Lily had such a sweet relationship. It was so sad. AGGGH. That was the only part that almost made me cry. (Don't get me wrong, a lot of other parts made me sad, it's just that books rarely make me shed actual tears.)Recently I read this thing on Cracked.com about how it would have been cool if it turned out Neville had been the Chosen One all along. Haha. That would've been kind of awesome. But oh well. The ending was still awesome. (This has nothing to do with anything, I just wanted to mention it.)Sorry this review has pretty much no thought or structure to it whatsoever. I'm just not sure how to sum up my thoughts on all seven books. I should read them again sometime to find any cool details I might have missed––now that I know everything that happens, yada yada. Right now I just feel kinda overwhelmed by the series as a whole though, so I probably won't be rereading them for a while. But anyway, they were great.I kind of wonder whether Rowling will ever write anything else. Maybe she's the Harper Lee type and only had one good story to tell. Also I feel like if she writes about anything else, everyone will be like, ""THIS IS NOT AS GOOD AS HARRY POTTER."" But, oh well. I'm sure the Harry Potter legacy will live on. People will keep reading these books to their kids. J.K. Rowling is probably set for life.

I don't really think JK Rowling could have done better. Hedwig, Mad-Eye, Ted, Fred, Lupin, and Tonks will all, forever be missed. But that was what was so brilliant about this book.

The search for horcruxes, a mysterious patronus, many things you never knew about Dumbledore, and a final battle that brings about the deaths of many beloved characters.At the heart of this book is love. Not the least of which is a tragic, brave love, so secret and life-long, from a person who never felt it in return. This princely love broke my heart.Much of this book with its themes of racism (pure bloods versus mud bloods) and power had me thinking of WWII, with the Death Eaters as Nazis and Voldemort as a crazed snake version of their leader (another he-who-should-not-be-named). The courage and selflessness necessary to combat this level of fear and oppression is magical, more than the magic from any wand.I've given this book five stars - is it a perfect book? No. I found the last 4 books in this series to be bloated and in desperate need of editing. Rowling repeats certain words and phrases too much for my taste. I didn't love the epilogue either, which was cheesy and felt rushed.

Here is the vlog: https://youtu.be/mQes3ZwH-o4This was a bit of a slog to get through, initially, but once I got back into the rhythm of it, I felt like I was speeding through great chunks at a time, without really realising how many hours I was sitting there, locked in that position (  Ow, I ache so bad.  ). A note on problematic authors Getting back into this world, initally gave me odd and conflicting feelings, what with everything coming out about the author's hateful opinions, but I tried to distance myself from whatever hateful words the author has proclaimed, trying not to let it ruin my final trip to the wizarding world. As many fans have said, this world really does belong to us now, but with any problematic author, I do find I take it on a case by case basis, and urge you to do that as well, and although I still wanted to read the final installement, I did find myself analysing things a bit more intensely. One of the things that I found bothered me, and was, I feel, out of character for Hermione, was when she over rode Griphook, the Goblin, by basically saying her suffering was equal or greater than his... it's one of those things we've seen many times in society where those more able and privalleged instantly cry out at the ""injustice"", rather than listen, when others opening up their vulnerabilities by speaking of their suffering. I will leave this conversation here for now, and will continue on with my review of the finale in this series.With some of my thoughts on that being said, in a pure enjoyment level though, this was definitely the darkest books out of all 7. I didn't find it as comforting as my previous reads, because the tone (since around book 5) really does drop to a scary level. This was the time I noticed the most changes in characters, because they were pitied against decisions bigger than them, and I saw traits that I hadn't noticed before as well as those that had been there but not in this capacity, such as Ron and his, understandably, frightened doubts, Hermoine's uncertainty and admitting she doesn't always have answers and the fear of the lack of control that creates, and Harry's confusion regarding whether to trust his instinct or deem it as a cleverly constructed trap and the doubts he had on whether he was worthy of taking leadership in such a life changing quest.We didn't slack on deaths in this book, and every time one happened it was another blow that left me in disbelief. I almost had to numb myself some what just so I could get through the next few chapters without sobbing, or in a lot of cases, I just took a lot of breaks. It was  h e a v y .But ultimately, this was such a tumultuous yet gripping and emotional read. One that I am happy to have concluded. I don't usually enjoy a time jump, but because things were answered before this and it gave a beautiful ending to the story, I thoroughly enjoyed it.Although it was an emotional experience, and a journey I went into with different views due to recent news, I'm still glad that overall my final experience to this world, for the first time, was wonderful!

Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows
 for what seemed like the gazillionth time. I didn’t want to write a review. Again. It’s been done and it was a gushing, brimming with love and adulation write-up.Today, I just wanted to make a mini-keepsake. A little something for all my Potterhead friends. Something that encapsulated all the key moments in the books...moments that moved me...moments that made me smirk gleefully..moments that broke my heart (in a nice way, if that’s even possible). So here goes:——————————————————————————————-MOMENT #1:
‘I don’t think you’re a waste of space.’
——————————————————————————————-MOMENT #2:
“Are you planning to follow a career in Magical Law, Miss Granger?’ asked Scrimgeour. ‘No I’m not,’ retorted Hermione. ‘I’m hoping to do some good in the world!’
——————————————————————————————-MOMENT #3:
On this spot, on the night of 31 October 1981, Lily and James Potter lost their lives. Their son, Harry, remains the only wizard ever to have survived the Killing Curse. This house, invisible to Muggles, has been left in it’s ruined state as a monument to the Potters and as a reminder of the violence that tore apart their family.
——————————————————————————————-MOMENT #4:
RON:’He knew what he was doing when he gave me the Deluminator, didn’t he? He - well, he must’ve known I’d run out on you.’HARRY:’No, he must’ve known that you’d always want to come back.'
——————————————————————————————-Moment #5:
‘Dobby has no master!’ squealed the elf. ‘Dobby is a free elf, and Dobby has come to save Harry Potter and his friends!’
——————————————————————————————-Moment #6:
Here lies Dobby, a Free Elf.
——————————————————————————————-Moment #7:
‘The wand chooses the wizard,’ said Ollivander.
——————————————————————————————-Moment #8:
‘PIERTOTUM LOCOMOTOR!’And all along the corridor the statues and suits of armour jumped down from their plinths, and from the echoing crashes from the floors above and below, Harry knew that their fellows throughout the castle had done the same.‘Hogwarts is threatened! Man the boundaries, protect us, do your duty to our school!’
 ——————————————————————————————-Moment #9:
‘No,’ said Ron seriously, ’ I mean we should tell them to get out. We don’t want any more Dobbys, do we? We can’t order them to die for us -‘There was a clatter as the Basilisk fangs cascaded out of Hermione’s arms. Running at Ron, she flung them around his neck and kissed him full on the mouth.
——————————————————————————————-Moment #10:
And Percy was shaking his brother, and Ron was kneeling beside them, and Fred’s eyes stared without seeing, the ghost of his last laugh still etched upon his face.
——————————————————————————————-Moment #11:
- CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE -The Prince’s Tale
——————————————————————————————-Moment #12:
‘Have you grown to care for the boy, after all?’‘For him?’ shouted Snape. ‘Expecto Patronum!’From the tip of his wand burst the silver doe:she landed on the office floor, bounded once across the office and soared out of the window. Dumbledore watched her fly away, and as her silvery glow faded he turned back to Snape, and his eyes were full of tears.‘After all this time?’Always,’ said Snape.
——————————————————————————————-Moment #13:
‘You’ll stay with me?’‘Until the very end,’
——————————————————————————————-Moment #14:
‘Tell me one last thing,’ said Harry. ‘Is this real? Or has this been happening inside my head?’‘Ofcourse it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?’
——————————————————————————————-Moment #15:
‘He is dead!’ Narcissa Malfoy called to the watchers.
——————————————————————————————-Moment #16:
‘I’ll join you when hell freezes over,’ said Neville.‘Dumbledore’s Army!’ he shouted.
——————————————————————————————-Moment #17:
‘NOT MY DAUGHTER, YOU BITCH!’
——————————————————————————————-Moment #18:
‘Avada Kedavra!’
‘Expelliarmus!’——————————————————————————————-Moment #19: (…and I liked the fact that it was appropriately enough, the 19th moment)
The scar had not pained Harry for nineteen years. All was well.

296,4231260888,10/02/2021,4.0,"  “Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and, above all those who live without love.”      “It is a curious thing, Harry, but perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it. Those who, like you, have leadership thrust upon them, and take up the mantle because they must, and find to their own surprise that they wear it well.”  I’ve stated in my Half-Blood Prince review my brief history regarding the series. That I’ve technically started since 2016-2017. This is the first fantasy series I’ve read outside of school so it’s something special to me and these films are my childhood. So, I’ve anticipated this final novel for a long time, and I have to state, man it delivers. I do not know how to really begin this review and where to talk about so I will start with the beginning. The introduction is interesting I think prefer the HBP prologue, but this fits the overall mood. I would just say Dumbledore exploration was never really tapped in the movie and what a shame. The exploration of this character is truly fascinating, it’s like piecing a puzzle you see a lot of pieces and you the reader must form a proper image. You have kept in the mind the biases relaying that information. Dumbledore character has always been somewhat mystic the shrouded with mystery so having a clear understanding of his past wouldn't be right for him. So, this puzzle-like approach to his Origin was the best route Rowling could have taken. They are always a sentiment in fiction that the reader wants to know everything, but I believe it’s more the empathises should be “wants”. I think they some sort of beauty to it “wanting to know more” but in actuality knowing more would probably decrease your interest in the subject. Having enough room to properly speculate I thoroughly enjoy that and it’s up to your interpretation of events. Having to confront the truth about (view spoiler)[ Ariana secret through Aberforth eyes, that whole monologue was just very emotional. This man has one or two chapters at max and gives the man so much more depth than you really expect. Rowling conveys his pain well then you contrast that with Half-Blood Prince Dumbledore drinking the water thinking upon those events beautiful. I do love the message of the heroes we idolised aren’t necessarily all good. They are all flawed in their own ways.  (hide spoiler)] Regarding Snape (view spoiler)[ a reverse of that arc is true. His flashback chapter might be my favourite chapter in the series? I will have to think upon that but what a masterpiece. Snape as a child talking to Lily, he bit awkward he has a very good heart. The people he interacts with, slowly makes him corruptible.I quote from Dune Saga, as this relates to Snape character:“Power attracts pathological personalities. It is not that power corrupts but that it is magnetic to the corruptible.”This quote is very true to Snape character, his idols are noble, but the household of Slytherin and the people he interacts with making him corruptible. Lily and Snape's last conversation, where Lily was wearing a nightgown standing in front of the portrait of the Fat Lady, at the entrance to Gryffindor Tower. This sequence is where that aspect does show, Lily knows Snape isn’t a bad person at this point, but she knows he is dabbling in the dark arts (as he is the half-blood prince) and power is making him corruptible. The disband of their friendship was nothing to do with Mudblood situation but something more complex. Ironically Snape downfall and redemption begins with his interaction with Lily and her unfortunate passing.I will reinstate he is not a good person, but a tragic and fantastic character. I mean Dumbledore said, “You disgust me,” because he wouldn’t care about the death of James and Lily son as long Lily lives. But after some time, he really did care about Harry as a person. The Shift of Snape character can be observed through here most apparently“I have spied for you and lied for you, put myself in mortal danger for you. Everything was supposed to be to keep Lily Potter’s son safe. Now you tell me you have been raising him like a pig for slaughter —” He begins not caring about the existence of Harry and then crying for the boy. It slowly becomes he cares not just because it's Lily Son but because he cares about Harry Potter. In general, I think Snape and Dumbledore are very interesting characters to compare.  (hide spoiler)] One aspect of this novel, that hit or miss for people is the Harry centric nature of it. Much more than the other novels, it captures the sense of isolation thoroughly. If you didn’t care about Harry prior, I can see this novel being tougher for you, because this is very much his journey. One example would be chapter 16 (view spoiler)[ visiting Lily-James Potter tomb, and the former house. It's such a beautiful and reflective moment. Which hits the reader (myself) in the feels  (hide spoiler)] They a lot of Harry questioning his belief.Regarding the Plotting, well this aspect has never been Rowling strongest suit as a writer. Like it usually exists but other aspects are what makes it special I would state the same applies here. The Journey what can be a convinced somewhat simple plot is pretty heart-wrenching. The Trio to me is very special, and they all make this worth experiencing. The amount of character work we get from Hermione is just beautiful. Though one unfortunate aspect is the sole focus on Harry Potter. I like Harry as a character but as the series progresses, they just more plotlines for other people. I somewhat wished we had that Ginny, Neville or Luna POV throughout even in small doses. Because Hogwarts started becoming a character of itself, not just a location. It's somewhat my rambling thoughts but would have loved a more intimate look of its change throughout the novel would have brought something worth exploring. To make it clearer what I am saying the scope of the series becomes larger and larger. So, when the focus is tighter and tighter even though it's brilliant it's just something you wished was explored more in general.In Terms of Prose, they not much to add to the conversation. Though (view spoiler)[ The Tale of the Three Brothers  (hide spoiler)] chapter had some beautiful prose that I recognised. Its captures that fairy tale, folklore style of writing its feels a lot more deliberate than her usual style. Not sure if this is proper articulation of it but has a certain rhythmic feeling to it.Stating what I love about the novel, is almost highlighting the entire novel IMO. I have no clue of the reception of the pacing of the novel but I loved it. (view spoiler)[ Dudley saying ""I don't think you're a waste of space.” Something that just felt so bloody earned. Kreacher tale was tragic and knowing more about the poor elves why he views the world in a certain matter. Remus whole arc about being a father, infiltration of the Muggle-Born Registration Commission, Luna Father chapter, Potterwatch broadcast some of the most emotional aspects of the series. Learning how the events have impacted the wizardry world, the people we care about etc. Just a powerful sequence. Especially because our trio isolation seeing those familiar figures were fantastic. Dobby funeral and the slice of life feeling of those two chapters just processing everything that transpired. Harry growth at that moment. Gringotts being such an awesome chase, already talked about it but the whole Ariana Dumbledore's situation. Seeing Neville after a year and seen how he becomes a man over that duration.Harry seeing his parents etc. Finally, Voldemort defeat.  (hide spoiler)] Some negatives and aspects I just don’t like in general. (view spoiler)[ I don’t like how the trio all become somewhat related near the end. This is probably the one aspect why I wasn’t fully on board with the Ginny-Harry coupling. Because it creates this situation where this trio that was best friends and closer than family to becoming actual family members.  (hide spoiler)] This is more of a preference aspect for me than a critique. Regarding the Hermione and Ron relationship. I do buy it but I'm just not the biggest fan of that development. This has been seeded since very early on from Book 3 you can honestly see the signs so it’s not a jarring development. But again, if this romance must be a thing I kinda hoped the Ginny-Harry Relationship wasn’t a thing because its changes that trio dynamic. The last one would be the ending. Firstly, I enjoy the ending that was provided, (view spoiler)[ Voldemort death was fitting, it made sense. Just other developments afterwards felt a tad rushed and not really touched upon. I somewhat wished they more of a mourning period and celebration, not go full-on Tolkien LOTR. I understand this is Harry story ultimately, but like we spent 7 books in this world, so many amazing arcs and yeah kind of wish Rowling would let it breathe a bit before going to the King Crossing ending. It would have been great if we had like an extra chapter or two after the official last chapter of the series. Regarding the Epilogue it’s not something I love, thematically I understood why it exists. It feels a tad abrupt. Regarding Draco, his storyline is not that great, to me, he is always a character that screams wasted potential. He had that great in the half-blood prince, but here very minor. Slytherin plotline has always been weird to me, just they so much potential that rarely tapped. I can nitpick other things but ultimately the elements I said above and here are what matters to me.  (hide spoiler)] In Conclusion, this is an incredible novel to an amazing series. Some fantastic characters, incredible atmosphere, sparking the imagination of million so forth. Rowling had one hell of time completing this juggernaut of a series. Especially with all the intense pressure, this was the biggest movie of its release and I doubt another book release will have this much attention. I can have my gripes, nit-picks etc. But I truly love this series. It’s the first fantasy series I read outside of school during 2016-2017. Only completing it this year, after reading many more series. It’s a movies series I grew up with though not the books but thank God I took the plunge and read it. In terms of enjoyment this series always going to be like a 10 but I don’t rate books purely upon enjoyment. Anyways saying goodbye to this world is like a goodbye to a friend. Of course, I can always reread this series, but that first time experience is something special. Though nothing lasts forever so goodbye and thankful for this experience.  8.5 or 9/10 not sure 😊 ",15,0.9998,0.061,0.74,0.199,0.5421853131933777,POSITIVE,1.0
297,1622011607,12/26/2016,5.0,"BLOG REVIEW:https://passthefeels.wordpress.com/20...Well, I had written half of this review and it just decided to delete itself, so heres take 2 I guess. It was much more poetic the first time... *fumes*I usually don't know where to start with reviews, however this time I feel both like I'll never be able to start, as much as I feel like I'll never be able to stop.I guess I'll just start by simply saying:
I love Harry Potter.
I would, without a doubt, not be the person I am today without it.I grew up with the films, and read the books later on in life, which I do not regret, as I believe it allowed me to have full understanding and appreciation for the novels, at this age.Anyway, this is not a shrine, it's a review, sooo, here we go.This book was incredible. More so than I ever imagined. I loved it, and it's going straight to the favourites of all time shelf.I don't even really know exactly what to say, all I know is it was amazing from start to finish, but I'll try to form coherent sentences through my shock that I've actually finished reading these now...Looking back on the novel whilst trying to write this review has made me realise how every chapter is like a mini book. Each named appropriately to it's contents, which have taken up little places in my mind, as if they've been filed into categories.From the very beginning, when Harry finally departed from the Dursleys, my heart swelled. Rowling could not have written that scene any better. I just feel it was done perfectly to solidify the way in which they and Harry felt about each other, truly, in the end.I found the entire quest for the horcruxes to be so enthralling. The three friends and their voyage to take down Voldemort, as well as help each other. Especially Hermione and Harry's time in Godric's Hollow, that swelled my heart.The Tale of the Three Brothers. The Deathly Hallows! I have always been fascinated with this, and have never quite fully understood them simply through the film, but reading about it just gave me this whole new insight into the stories and history behind this brilliant idea Rowling had. I absolutely loved this huge aspect of the novel.Severus! The worldly conflict, the never ending debate on whether or not he was a good man... I have finally made up my mind on whether I love him or hate him, and have decided that I love him. Yep. One of the other millions of favourite moments throughout this book has to be the Pensieve scene, surrounding Snapes memories. Harry's journey through Snapes mind was so incredibly interesting, and certainly both made and broke my heart. To finally understand why Snape was the way he was, ahh, just, yes.The Battle of Hogwarts. Do I really need to say more? Wow. The ending, the whole last section was just brilliant. I think it may even be my favourite last part of a book ever. It was executed so well, and tied everything together so well. Once again, the appreciation for Fred and Georges humour, even in times of sorrow, was one of the many highlights of this entire series. As well as Harry, Hermione and Ron's friendship. Their friendship, I believe, is one of the most, if not the most, important aspects of the entire series. I am obsessed with them, in-fact all of the relationships Rowling manages to create are so intricate, and really tug on the heart strings.We got to see the continued relationship between Harry and Dumbledore, which was so nice. I even found myself warming to Kreacher! Oh how unexpected, but lovely.19 years later...Ahhh, I could not deal with this part! It was everything. I feel so lucky to have finally been able to read it. Also, to now be able to continue on with The Cursed Child.Anyway, this is definitely the longest review I have ever done, and I think it's time to stop.If you made it this far, thank you for reading, and I hope (I'm sure) you loved this book as much as I did (or are excited to read it).I'm going to go wipe my tears, watch the Deathly Hallows movies, and fantasise about starting the whole series again... I might just do that. Bye!Order of favourite to least favourite HP book:1. Deathly Hallows2. Half Blood Prince3. Order of the Phoenix4. Philosophers Stone5. Prisoner of Azkaban6. Goblet of Fire7.
