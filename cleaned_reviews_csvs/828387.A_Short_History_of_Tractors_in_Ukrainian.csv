1,942879369,05/20/2014,2.0,"My literary tastes revolve around two extremes - the high brow stuff and utter trash usually called something like ""To Marry a Duke"" and I don't find much enjoyment in the safe, middle of the road, commercial fiction. Either challenge me properly or provide with the cheapest kind of thrills. Knowing that about myself, I don't know what possessed me to suggest this book as our book group read. Not only did I force myself and everybody else to read this questionable work but also now all my recommendations are treated with distrust. See, my book club is not really into your typical book group reads and 'The Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian' has 'book group read' written all over it.And of course, the quirky title! Don't we all love quirky titles! They are so... quirky! Some reviewers mentioned how confusing this title was for them, because, you know, it says 'A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian' and yet it's not! If you are the sort of person who is confused by the fact that a Booker longlisted bestseller called 'Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian' is not in fact a history of tractors written in Ukrainian, then this book will probably be intellectually satisfying for you.It's a rather unimaginative and banal satire on Ukrainian immigrants in UK, a story of a young and pretty gold-digger, an old besotted fool and his two daughters who try to prevent the catastrophe and even resort to putting on hold old grudges, while uniting against this common enemy. The secret to good satire is to make fun of your characters but to do it with affection and affection is sorely missing from Lewicka's narrative. The characters are farcical caricatures who are nothing more than the laziest of stereotypes and copies of cliches the British reader was already familiar with. However, when the narrative switches to flashbacks from Ukraine decades ago, everything is very real and the same characters are supposed to be taken seriously, which produces a rather grotesque effect. There are also characters who are not even given this most basic, two-dimensional personality, they only exist as their name and function - like the completely superfluous narrator's husband.The execution is equally lazy - the style is tedious, it's as if Lewycka used up all her creativity on inventing the pidgin English Valentina, the gold digger, speaks in. What's interesting is that she seems unable to speak in grammatically correct sentences even if she is among other Ukrainians and the assumption is that they are speaking Ukrainian (because why would they be speaking English? This is not a Hollywood film). Of course, Valentina's dialect is quite amusing but completely unrealistic from a linguistical point of view (if you don't understand the most basic English grammar, you won't know words like 'shrivel').As far as books on immigration go, this brings nothing new to the table. It brings back yesterday's bread that is now stale. The only potentially interesting thing about it is the mini-reflection on how our sanctimonious left-wing, liberal views can conveniently disappear if we find our very personal interests threatened. All in all, though, there is nothing to shake us in this book, nothing to challenge us. Nothing to see here. Move along.",75,0.8658,0.086,0.806,0.108,0.4968365472910928,NEGATIVE,1.0
2,27521306,07/17/2008,1.0,"I recently picked this book up used at my local library for $1. The cover burst advertised that it was nominated for a Man Booker Prize, and the back cover copy boasted that it was an international bestseller that was shortlisted for the Orange Prize.My thoughts on that after reading the book: What the fuck?The quick synopsis of the plot is this: Gold-digging Ukrainian immigrant hussy latches on to an elderly Ukrainian widower in England, marries him, and tries to take his money and his house. His two adult daughters (Vera and Nadezhda) try to prevent it from happening. And that's pretty much it. There is an attempt at incorporating many zany characters along the way, and we learn about Vera and Nadezhda's strained relationship, and their relationship with their kooky father. Oh, and every single character is disgusting and hate-able. I almost found myself rooting for the hussy.Man, this book needed an editor, or at least one more (ruthless) revision. But it was nominated for the Booker, so what the hell do I know? What I do know, though, is this manuscript as is would never have made it out alive if presented to my writer's group.For instance, the author doesn't seem to have much confidence in her own writing. Written in the first person of the Nadezhda character, the narrative is constantly interrupted by the character's explanation of things in parenthesis. Even during dialogue! And it is a constant interruption. More than a handful of times I just wanted to scream out, ""Let the fucking characters talk! Stop interrupting!""The other no-no that the author does is to somehow allow her lead first-person narrator to know what someone else is thinking. This is after the old man's young wife is treating him particularly bad:Maybe he would beat her if he could, but he cannot. For the first time he realises how helpless he is. His heart fills with despair.Oh really? How do you know this, Nadezhda? My writer's group would have taken me to task if I had presented them with this.As a writer, you are influenced by many authors and countless books. Sometimes you'll read something so good (think John Irving in his prime) that it inspires you, and shows you just how transcending the written word can be. Then you have a novel like this—which also influences you as a writer. By showing you what not to do.I need to read some Owen Meany now to cleanse myself. I feel so dirty. But what do I know?

3,725978648,09/22/2013,3.0,"There is an episode in the comedy sitcom Mind Your Language, where Jeremy Brown's motley crew of students drawn from all over the world to learn English tell jokes to pass the time. Juan Cervantes, the Spanish bartender, tells a hilarious joke: at the end, he is in stitches, unable to stifle laughter, because the joke is so funny. The problem is, it is wholly in Spanish, so nobody else in the class can understand.This novel left me feeling like one of those class members.This is the story of old Nikolai Mayevskyj (pronounced ""Mayevski""), eccentric immigrant engineer from Ukraine who falls in love at the age of eighty-four with a sex-bomb, Valentina, who is thirty-six. Valentina has the only goal of finding domicile for herself and her ""genius"" son, Stanislav, in the UK: and the recently widowed engineer is an easy target. Nikolai's daughters Vera and Nadehzda (the first-person narrator) are appalled, and set about rescuing their father from this scheming vixen, burying their running feud about their mother's legacy temporarily. In the process, a lot of dirty family laundry is unearthed, a lot of distressing events take place, but true to the tradition of comic literature, things pan out in the end.If one believes the blurbs on the jacket, the novel is ""extremely funny"" (The Times), ""mad and hilarious"" (The Daily Telegraph) and ""...a comic feast, a riotous oil painting of senility, lust and greed"" (Economist). But I found it to be nothing of the sort. The deliberate comic tone of voice that the author adopted was jarring, in view of the fact that extremely serious matters like the abuse of the elderly was being described. You can't laugh such things off.Also, there is the matter of portrayal. All the characters were seriously lacking in sympathy: there is hardly a one there the reader will care to identify with. Many of the conversations (especially where a kind of pidgin English was used to parody the Ukrainians' imperfect grasp of the language) were narrated in a tone of mockery - and when an author mocks her own creations, how can the reader take them seriously?The book Nikolai is writing, A Short History of Tractors in the Ukrainian, is included as a sort of metaphor for the journey (historical, mental and physical) of the East European expatriate engineer, interested only in machines, from the communist East to the capitalist West. Nikolai's reading of excerpts of the book is interspersed with the main narrative throughout the novel, which though informative, failed to meld with the main story. The unspeakable horrors suffered by the family under Stalin and the Nazis somehow fail to make the impact they should, mainly because of the author's insistence on keeping up a comic tone. However, three stars for a worthwhile story, and a social problem well-presented. But one is forced to think Ms. Lewycka would have created more of an impact if the book was written in dead seriousness.

But here it is for those who would like to read it as part of my review: (view spoiler)[""A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian was bestselling author Marina Lewycka's bestselling debut novel which has sold over one million copies worldwide. Lewycka tells the side-splittingly funny story of two feuding sisters, Vera and Nadezhda, who join forces against their father's new, gold-digging girlfriend.'Two years after my mother died, my father fell in love with a glamorous blonde Ukrainian divorcée. He was eighty-four and she was thirty-six.

With her proclivity for green satin underwear and boil-in-the-bag cuisine, she will stop at nothing in her pursuit of Western wealth.But the sisters' campaign to oust Valentina unearths family secrets, uncovers fifty years of Europe's darkest history and sends them back to roots they'd much rather forget . . .'It's rare to find a first novel that gets so much right...Lewycka is a seriously talented comic writer' Time Out'Hugely enjoyable...yields a golden harvest of family truths' Daily Telegraph'Delightful, funny, touching' Spectator (hide spoiler)]COMMENTSThis book was as much a funny, as a sad story about Ukrainian immigrants in Britain. Messy, chaotic lives with a dark, heartbreaking undertone. Refugees after WWII, they were a typical family who must start over in modern England living out the immigrant experience. Part tragedy, part comedy, the story present the typical life of people who plastered a smile on their faces during the day and relived the horror of the war in their nocturnal dreams. Two sisters have to save their octogenarian father, with an extremely stubborn streak, from getting married to a thirty-five year old gold digger after his wife's death two years before. The two sisters do not have a good relationship due to the family history that was not shared between them. One was a war baby and the other a peace baby with a world of untold horror lying between them. But as they start to work together as a team, the healing and understanding comes and the family can find love and support within their own small circle again. Despite the dark memories and family feud raging between the sisters, it was still a warmhearted story. There were moments in the book that I simply allowed the tears to silently run down my face.

8,1238541494,03/27/2015,3.0,"A Short History Of Tractors In Ukrainian is advertised as being an extremely comical take on family drama. The latter I can agree with. The former, maybe not so much. I had a few smiles, sure. But I never laughed out loud, which is my (maybe unnecessarily high standard) definition of a truly humorous novel. It was, however, a portrayal of the ridiculousness of the green card process (if the amount of marriages bought with the sole purpose of citizenship is any indication) and the inherent obstacles in immigrating here that took a comical rather than serious angle, making this, overall, a short, lighthearted read. I say ""overall"" because there were definitely a few tragic, depressingly honest chapters regarding the Mayevskyj Family history. Nikolai and Ludmilla, parents to sisters Nadezhda (our narrator) and Vera (Big Sister), were originally from Ukraine, surviving through wars, communism, concentration camps, Stalin's totalitarian reign, etcetera. Grief and death, separation from family members, living in fear, close ones disappearing in the dark of the night; they endured it all. Later labeled ""War Baby"" by younger sister Nadezhda (""Peace Baby"", of course), was also a victim of these sad circumstances in her earlier years.Since the death of their mother a couple years ago, the two sisters have been feuding regarding the inheritance, barely on talking terms. (Vera convinced their mother on her death bed to alter her will to divide it between the grandaughters rather than her daughters; Vera, of course, has two on Nedezhda's one.) When her father calls to announce that he is getting married to one ""Valentina"", with ""Bottecellian"" breasts, twenty years younger, in need of green card citizenship passage via marriage certificate, Nadezhda is resigned to the fate that their father's well-being is more important the sibling rivalry.She reaches out to Big Sister. The two of them collaborate, investigating, intervening consoling, counseling, as Nikolai can be quite the stubborn old man, set in his ways and sometimes convoluted ideals. The two sisters inevitably bond, making up and becoming far closer the more time they spend together coming to the rescue of their father.As predicted, Valentina is extremely careless with what little finances he has; she demands very specific brand names on the things he is mandated to provide her with, including three vehicles and a specific color pressure cooker. She is obviously seeing other men, but her adultery is something her husband refuses to admit (only indirectly when she has a son that is not his). She also begins emotionally, physically, verbally abusing him. Blinded by three primary things, physical infatuation, his desire to have a son (Standinolov, her son, has come from Ukraine with Valentina), + his perceived obligation to save those from his country (Ukraine is still currently in communism rule, impoverished communities), their father continues alternating, sometimes simultaneously, proclaiming his love for her and/or expressing his fear that she will murder him. Indeed, Valentina is quite the colorful character, initiating numerous hilarious scenarios. Coupled with a slightly senile old man for a husband, two feuding sisters, and their mother, still very alive in spirit, all with colorful personalities of their own, you have a cast of characters made for a comedy show. The title here is actually referring to the work Nikolai penned, completing by the conclusion of the novel. Always having a passion for tractors, especially in relation to his native Ukraine, he often reads from his text to visitors. One of his preferred audience members in Michael, Nadezhda's husband, as he is an engineer. As a nice addition to the novel, Lewycka includes detailed scholarly information regarding the history for Ford's first tractors, the success found by John Deere, & the significance farming technologies had in our world, especially during war times under Stalin's reign.",24,0.8998,0.095,0.794,0.112,0.4480812653699977,NEGATIVE,0.9537

Maybe there was some black comedy element I was missing, but to me I just didn't find an old man being abused, war and people mispronouncing English words amusing.It had an okay pace and style and a collection of interesting themes, but the themes were not developed and the characters were a little two dimensional. I found the nicknames annoying: Big Sis, Bogeynose, Mrs Divorce Expert, Mrs Flog 'em and send 'em home. Okay maybe once this might be funny but constantly using them was just annoying.

11,743599538,10/17/2013,3.0,"A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian made the Booker longlist for 2005, which is quite a feat for a debut novel - and one of the two reasons why I chose to read it. The other one is, of course, its quirky title - I just couldn't pass a book titled like that, even though I profess absolutely no knowledge of even the most rudimentary Ukrainian. My knowledge of tractors is not much better - I'm able to identify one when I see it, but that's pretty much it.A Short History of Tractors... is the story of two British Ukrainian sisters, Vera and Nadezhda, whose life turns upside down when their elderly, widowed father falls in love again - with Valentina, a much younger (and voluptous) Ukrainian woman, whom he intends to marry. Both sisters react with horror to the news that the marriage is only arranged for Valentina to settle permanently in the UK, but their warnings fall on deaf ears - the cheeky bugger is dead set. What follows is a whimsical sequence of events as Nadezhda and Vera try to prevent their father from marrying Valentina, combined revelations about their own family, pieces from the long and troubled history of Ukraine, and their father's life work - the grand history of the Ukrainian tractor. All this sounds fine - and perhaps just isn't for me. The premise - two estranged sisters have to overcome their differences in order to save their senile father from the claws of an opportunistic woman - is captivating, but doesn't quite deliver. None of the characters are particularly interesting or multifaceted: the old man is pointlessly pathetic and helpless, his daughters are too self-absorbed for us to really like them and Valentina is nothing more than a stereotypical gold-digger, and the only real attempt at presenting her culture and ethnicity in the novel is to simplify her sentence structure and have her mispronounce all the English words.A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian also aims to be at least partially a presentation of Ukrainian history - published in a Western country and aimed towards a Western audience, and one which doesn't know much about the country (though with current events taking place there we've seen a sudden and amazing increase in experts on all things Ukraine - most of whom probably couldn't find it on the map a few months before). I'm not a Westerner and I don't live in a Western society, and I know where Ukraine is and even a little bit about its history - and this is why I was disappointed to see such an interesting subject to be basically brushed over, and learned nothing new. The part about the tractor seems to have no real relevance to the plot or the text altogether, except for Ms. Lewycka wanting to put it in there for some reason.To sum it up: this isn't a bad book - it's certainly readable and can be entertaining - but it's not what I'd categorize as Booker material, so I'm not surprised that it didn't make the shortlist. Still, it is a debut novel and shows some potential - I'm willing to give Ms. Lewycka another go, and read one of her later novels. A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian can provide for a few hours of pleasurable reading to pass the time on the bus or the metro, but those seeking an entry window to the history of Ukraine or human drama with more depth than a puddle would be better served elsewhere.

There was no good reason for my hesitance – the book has glowing reviews and was shortlisted for the Orange Prize – for some reason it just didn’t appeal to me. You know the phrase ‘don’t judge a book by its cover’? Well I do this, all the time, and I think that was the reason behind my mental block. My mind could not make the link between the words 'history', 'tractors', 'Ukrainian' and the comedy that the blurb on the back promised.I know now that I was wrong. This is a well-written, very funny story about a sad situation and some serious concepts. Told by the character of Nadezhda, this is the tale of her father’s second marriage to the much-younger Valentina. In the book’s opening words (so much better than mine): 'Two years after my mother died, my father fell in love with a glamorous blonde Ukrainian divorcee. He was eighty-four and she was thirty-six. She exploded into our lives like a fluffy pink grenade, churning up the murky water, bringing to the surface a sludge of sloughed-off memories, giving the family ghosts a kick up the backside.’The author has an ear for the peculiarity of English as a second language and, in the character of Valentina, has created one of the most amusing villains ever. Into this larger-than-life character are poured all sorts of wonderful insults and bare-faced gold-digging that would put this country’s Wags to shame. Nadezhda’s father is well-developed as a character as well, having the stubbornness familiar to old men everywhere, backed with a horrific personal history. He relates his slant on some of his past with his book, A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian, passages of which intersperse the main story.Sadly, some of the deeper meaning is inevitably lost, falling victim to the comedy situations and emotional development, so that the conclusion is something of an anti-climax. I also felt that the narrator’s character remained something of a mystery to me, despite her revealing her family’s secrets she didn’t really share too much of her own feelings.But these are minor quibbles with a very high-quality book, which should be recommended to any chick-lit-lovers who think that funny must automatically mean fluffy.

14,6904435,09/27/2007,5.0,"I was so happy to finally get a copy of this book, after coming across it in little Cosmos bookshop in St. Kilda about 2 years ago, even though I couldn't get an edition with the nicer tractor cover. I just find it tacky to print the first two sentences on the front cover, even though it is a catchy beginning.It was certainly not quite what I was expecting - because it was nominated for the Man Booker Prize last year, I guess I was expecting something a bit heavier, more depressing. But this book is hilarious. It's heavily ironic, surprisingly dialogue-based, yet so much is revealed in subtle ways.Nadezhda (Nadia for short) and her Big Sis, Vera, lost their mother two years ago and have been fighting ever since over the will. Now they are brought together by a common goal: to prevent their 84 year old father, Nikolai, from marrying a Ukrainian gold digger with big boobs. Their words, not mine. Nadia's story is interspersed with excerpts from her father's work on tractors (he was an engineer), and the tale of her grandparents, parents, the war and how they came to be in England.This story is so neatly balanced between the humour and farce of the present ""situation"" and the scary, desperate past. The past sections are not told in a morbid fashion, though. It's hard to put my finger on what it is exactly, but the narrative has that almost stale taste you acquire when telling a story not your own: Nadia was the Peace baby, Vera the War baby, and Big Sis is very tight-lipped. Nadia has to piece together the past, and Vera's account doesn't always match their father's.Another thing I loved was the familiarity of the English world: although I have never been, I found great heart in the fact that the text had not been altered for a North American readership.

Much of my family comes from the Ukraine, in one form or another. my father's mother is Ukrainian, my grandfather is from Cossac stock... but the major part of my family are Ukrainian Jews, by way of Russia. And as Ukrainian culturally Russian Jews... Well, let's just say that the major Ukrainian national heroes are our giant traumatic monsters. I'm looking at you, Bogdan Khmelnitski.So when I read about the plight of Ukraine, all I can think of is 'yeah, and guess whom you took it all out on'. And the father of the family is horrifically anti-Russian, including anti-Russian language, which, you know, probably isn't helping. And then the author goes and uses a metaphor along the lines of ""Snow [...] settled like the pillows of innocent children on the slopes of Babi Yar.""Er. Uh. Just... Babi Yar. Really. Next time let's find a Polish book talking about the virgin forests of Auschwitz.There are other reasons, too. This book is trying too hard to be cutesy, including over things that really don't lend themselves to cutesy treatment. Abuse, haha. It might have been meant ironically, of course, but the irony didn't come through. it felt more like a farce or a tragedy than a satire, in a lot of ways. The style itself didn't really do me much good. And the characters were one and all extremely unsympathetic.It also bothered me, quite a bit, that the entire dialogue was in broken, choppy English. Even when, presumably, the people speaking would be doing so in Ukrainian and would have no reason whatsoever to sound like they're two days off the boat. I mean, are we really expected to think that the father and Valentina would be yelling in English at each other?On the other hand, I can't deny that the book is readable. it's not trying to be abstruse, it flows pretty decently, it took me relatively little time, and as a read was fairly enjoyable.

So, out of curiosity I took a look at the reviews on Goodreads and... surprise: many reviews were quite negative. This may be explained by the fact that behind the lightness of the book hides a very serious subtext: the author, who was born of Ukrainian parents in a German refugee camp understands history. The Ukrainian political situation and history are very well analyzed (albeit indirectly, through dialogue--btw, the author has a great gift for dialogue). Although this is a first novel (written by a mature writer, and this shows), the structure of the novel is flawless, reminding me at times of the great Russian novels of the past, in which suspense is very well calibrated and the dramatic tension culminates in scenes where all the characters are present (usually at a dinner, a party or a gathering).",13,0.987,0.06,0.713,0.227,0.5370370370370371,POSITIVE,0.9999

Whilst the last c.30% at least has episodes of silly farce, a lot of what went before didn't seem a likely winner of the verbosely-named Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse Prize for Comic Fiction, nor something to be festooned in quotes including ""extremely funny"" and ""hilarious"". If it weren't that many of the journalists who wrote these things were probably in, or nearing, midlife, I'd blame my age: a narrator in her forties worried by an eightysomething parent's marriage to a gold-digger who becomes violent and insulting... Are you actually trying to make me worry about stuff that might happen in the near future that I didn't already? There's some mysterious formula that allows humorous writers to use stereotypes and make them funny, and possibly give the characters a certain depth as well. Lewycka hasn't quite found it - whilst I've seen plenty worse, a lot of these people felt two-dimensional, as if they didn't really have life away from the purposes of the plot. A few more engaging supporting characters turned up in the second half (Laura Carter; Dubrov) as if the author had been warming up. It was at least better than Almost English, another Booker-longlisted light semi-comic novel about a female-dominated East European family in England - my main memory of that after a couple of years is of cringing.It's great that Lewycka sets her books in places that aren't normally the settings for novels, unless they consciously want to be kitchen-sink-drama: Peterborough, Doncaster... the sort of small cities where, cumulatively, an awful lot of people live, whilst in novel-world you could forgiven for thinking that most of the population outside London were just waxworks. It's not consciously gritty but has a real mundanity, like a more reference-packed, less deliberately heart-wringing (and therefore more interesting) equivalent of what publishers' marketing depts call 'commercial women's fiction'. And whilst this wasn't quite what I'd hoped, I wouldn't mind reading Lewycka again, especially Two Caravans.So that writing new reviews didn't devour so much of my time and energy, I've decided for the moment to read mostly light stuff or books by authors I'd already written about on GR - and most of that fiction. (There's nothing like non-fiction for making me want to say EVERYTHING and strain the word-limit.)--------------------Quotes may take up space, but not as much time as analysis...Much of the interest and depth came from reflections on the narrator's Ukrainian family background. (Near the beginning, the long lists to emphasise the parents' interests & character were the only other stylistically interesting paragraphs; otherwise it's on the subject of Ukraine and Ukraininanness that make the writing come alive.)Ukraina: he sighs, breathing in the remembered scent of mown hay and cherry blossom.

Then: ‘Maybe it was what turned me into the woman in the fur coat.’The English people believe in fairness. Fair play. Like cricket.’ (What does she know about cricket?) ‘They play by the rules.

They like to see the big shot get his come-uppance.’ ‘On the contrary, they have a perfectly preserved class system, in which everyone knows where they belong.’There are ten years between Vera and me – ten years that gave me the Beatles, the demonstrations against the Vietnam War, the student uprising of 1968, and the birth of feminism, which taught me to see all women as sisters – all women except my sister, that is.[This is, I think, one of the biggest cultural divides of the twentieth century between close generations - another being people born later in the century who had the internet as kids and teenagers v. those who only used it as adults.

And of course, there is the delicious language plus funny dialogues and quips, which make me sad for reading it in Romanian, but, even in translation, it sounds incredibly well.

Ukrainian tractors don't sound like a good topic for a highly enjoyable reading experience. Yet it is! While a history of tractors features in the narrative as a sub-stream, the story really is about family - history and complex relationships across generations and cultures. All those elements are packaged in a vivid, yet easy-going language, filled with humour and gentle satire.The story is set in the Ukrainian immigrant community in England and centres around Nicolai, a 84 year old widower who has set his eyes on a thirty-something, full-bosomed blonde Valentina, a would-like-to-be immigrant. His intention to marry her gets his two daughters onto the scene, anxious to stop such a mismatch. Despite their intense efforts and intrigues, however, their attempt to obstruct doesn't succeed. ""She exploded into our lives like a fluffy pink grenade..."" Written from the perspective of Nadia, the younger of the two daughters, and through her discussions with ""Big Sis"" Vera, the reader follows the upheavals that this new reality in their fathers' life creates. Suspicions are rife that Valentina has plans beyond looking after a new husband and that Nicolai is being exploited in more ways than one. The sisters themselves carry baggage from the past that they need to put aside or resolve in order to show a united front to their father's situation. In the process, events from the family history come to light that explain to some degree their different approaches to the problem at hand and different relationship each has had with their father and their late mother.At one level Lewycka's novel is just a fun read, a family saga that shines with lively dialogue and witty comments on the reality of the lives of the central characters. At another level, she seamlessly integrates her reflections on aging and the needs and vulnerabilities of seniors and the challenges these present for the next generation to handle. Finally, through flashbacks into Nikolai's life, the author provides the reader with insights into the family's background that makes the characters into who they have become. Nicolai and Valentina in particular come to live in the story and one can find parallels to people we all know. All the parts are expertly joined so that these elements don't feel like overwhelming the primary storyline. A highly recommended book.",8,0.8932,0.063,0.851,0.086,0.4641439393939393,POSITIVE,0.9998

Nadia and Vera are children of Ukrainian immigrants to the UK, actually immigrants themselves (although Nadia may have been born in the UK, I'm not clear). Their mother has passed away and their mid-80s father has become engaged to a Ukrainian who they suspect is after his money. And he really doesn't have very much money. He is fascinated by ""...the relationship between mechanical engineering as applied to tractors and the psychological engineering advocated by Stalin, as applied to the human soul,"" and is working on a book. Through his book, you get his view of Ukraine, of war and of politics, and through the stories he and Nadia's older sister tell, you learn quite a bit about their early history.Through the contrast between Valentina and the family, you also see the misconceptions both countries have of each other, and the changes between various sociopolitical systems in the Ukraine. I'm not sure it is ""extremely funny"" or ""mad and hilarious"" as advertised on the cover blurbs, in fact that is the issue most reviewers seem to have - false advertising.

38,2235173000,12/31/2017,4.0,"Tractors plow the field of broken dreamsLife should make some sense, but for a lot of people, it doesn't. Fate blows so strongly that they are pinned down or sent flying across the world to land in situations that never get clarified. Some people struggle to bring order into their lives or to act in rational ways, but others just go with the flow, living for the moment, never worried about `the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune'. Nadia, daughter of Ukrainian refugees in England, tries to deal with a cynical, materialistic sister at the same time as her aged father, more than a little wacky, decides to marry a money-grubbing bombshell from the old country who needs a residence visa as well. She's 48 years younger than he, but what the hell, true love will conquer all. Ah, but is it true love ? Yeah, right. On one level, this excellent novel is the story of the huge mess the old man creates and how Nadia and her instrumental older sister manage to pry the two `lovers' apart. Though comic elements do run through the book, A SHORT HISTORY OF TRACTORS IN UKRAINIAN is not really about humor. It's about family relationships---how people in a single family can be utterly different and utterly self-serving and yet certain events may still bring them together. It's about the downside of immigration too. People leave their old countries but bring so much baggage with them to the new one. While finding a new and better life may be the primary motive for leaving, often immigrants suffer loss of values, plunging headlong into the consumerist whirlpool with nothing to hold onto, not having a clue how to manage. Lewycka writes specifically about immigrants from the former Soviet Union, coming from decades of unbroken suffering of wars, famines, persecution, oppression, and injustice, entering the more fortunate, orderly and affluent societies of the West---where life for them remains chaotic because of their not knowing the rules, being prey to members of their own community, afraid or unable to ask, proud of living in an ""orderly society"" but personally out of order. Even though the already-deceased mother had tried valiantly to reproduce European peasant life (though she was an educated person) in England, things fell apart as soon as she died. Running throughout the book, like a bass chord, is the actual history of tractors in Ukraine, written by the old man whose life has been utter chaos. Tractors serve as symbols of order and progress, just as he writes the book to try to bring order into his own life. Tractors cut lines in fields, tame nature for good purposes----logic and science in opposition to the jumble recent history made in the lives of Ukrainians. In the previous lives of the Mayevskyj family nothing made sense; they faced war, prison, torture, exile, and forced labor, with no control over their own lives. The younger daughter, Nadia, growing up in England, has a life more tractor-like, but longs to know what came before, senses the old tragedies lurking. The older one, with dark memories of the past, tries to repress the past, never think of it. The appearance of Valentina, the lady with green satin bras and fluffy slippers, acts as a catalyst in Nadia's voyage of self-discovery. In addition to the different levels of meaning found in the novel, there are some great characters, especially Valentina, the blonde bombshell from Ukraine, and the old father. I felt strongly all the way through that the author definitely knew what she wrote about.

39,2034319355,06/19/2017,4.0,"Bottom Line First:Marina Lewycka's A short History of Tractors in the Ukrainian is an interesting variation on the immigrant story. It has a reputation as a funny book. I find it hard to laugh at a story about a family that barely survived the German occupation of the Ukraine. The surviving father has brought a younger, obviously dishonest abuser into the family house. Meantime the emotionally damaged daughters struggle to protect not so much their father but their mother's memory while barely able to relate to each other. This is a complex story handling history, politics and psychology all woven into a meaningful and occasionally entertaining read. This is not a light comedy. This is a mostly serious story, tinged with the ridiculous. It is good story telling.The father around whom this story revolves is an elderly Ukrainian World War II survivor, an engineer who could have been a contender and is now a befuddle old widower with a confusing passion for a low class, buxom Ukrainian schemer. His two adult daughters recognize that this woman is a threat to their father and a disgrace to the memory and artifacts of their now dead mother.There are family secrets. One may explain the cold practicality of the older sister. The younger sister has accomplished a P.HD and a good marriage but retains the insecurities of an immigrant and her conflicting social, socialistic attitudes.One is tempted to call this `chick lit' and shrug it off as more complaining by women about breast obsessed men. It even has the predictable women uniting to deal with lingering health issues. But Ms Lewycka goes beyond these cliched trappings to discuss the real horrors of surviving less famous aspects of German occupation. The father is a fool but he is also a good engineer. He has more than a fixation on a woman who snared him with the promise of sex only to become a physical threat to his life.The risks and problems of deporting a dangerous alien from England and the attendant bureaucracy is believable and provide additional suspense about the outcome.The final resolution is unexpected and rewarding.

I would describe her behaviour as abusive (she is violent, locks him in his room, is verbally abusive and so forth). His two daughters have to step in to help him secure a divorce and get her out of his life. These two who previously were at loggerheads and didn't get on at all, become closer in the process. Along the way the younger of the two, Nadia, discovers much of the family history, which includes time spent in a ""Correction Camp"" where what happened was evidently so horrible that it is not related (her sister, Vera, declines to tell her). I strongly suspect that if this were about a widow who was so mistreated it would *not* be described as ""hilarious"".

43,17621865,03/12/2008,3.0,"We have a family friend who smuggled cameras into Soviet Russia. He was a mathemetician or engineer at MIT at the time, something like that, and he and his teachers heard their colleagues in Russia were being blacklisted under Brezhnev, and that being blacklisted meant not working, and that not working meant being on the street, and that being on the street meant being shipped to a labor camp. So under who knows what excuse, these MIT nerds flew to Moscow—multiple times—with American-made cameras around their necks, gave them to Soviet nerds for them to sell on the black market—each camera could be worth a year’s pay—and thus saved their lives.This family friend is fairly ordinary. He’s quite smart and has travelled a great deal, but his wikipedia entry wouldn’t be any longer than yours or mine. And that’s what makes the bit above, and the two books under review here, stay with me: good stories always seems to come out of a combination of ordinary characters and huge backgrounds.David Bezmozgis is a Torontan but from Riga, Latvia. That is, the Soviet Union. He has published the story collection Natasha, a debut doubtless to earn comparisons—well here, I’m doing it—to Aleksandar Hemon, another English-as-a-second-language stunner adopted by New Yorker types as both a curiosity and, like, lover almost. But Bezmozgis, like Hemon, is a pretty ordinary guy by any measure other than circumstance. Same goes for the Bermans, the characters at the center of Natasha. They are Russian Jews. The father is a masseur, the mother a housewife. The son, who narrates each story through his advancing ages, loves a pet in one story, an athlete in another, a teenaged girl in a third. But against the background of flight from a killing-empire, against his parents’ and Jews’ memory and hope, and against acclimation to Canadian/American opportunities and demands, the characters’ stories project much grander shapes.Bezmozgis tells these sorts of stories successfully by exploiting tricks in structure—positioning the small, personal elements next to the transcendent ones. The story “An Animal to the Memory” works well in this respect. Bezmozgis writes it such that a character’s very personalized rage is confronted, story-wise, by his principal’s teaching on the Holocaust. Watching Bezmozgis fit the elements of person and history together and capping them with a last, cathartic line (”Now, Berman, he said, now maybe you understand what it means to be a Jew.”) is the primary thrill of the collection Natasha.Another immigrant tale is A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian, the new debut novel by erstwhile sociologist Marina Lewycka. Different in setting, style, and tone from Natasha, Lewycka’s novel nevertheless ploughs similar turf, namely, how do the ordinary products of extraordinary circumstance deal with ordinary problems? Lewycka’s characters are, like her, of a Ukrainian family living in England and dealing with the challenge of elder care. Nadia is a professor, her sister Vera a hard-edged divorcee, and their widower father a mess. He has fallen in love with a bosomy youngish Ukrainian mother, whom he imports and supports to his own financial and near-physical ruin. Nadia and Vera see the scam but can hardly do anything about it without destroying their father.Again, a seemingly inward-facing crisis has its sources in big-h History. Their father loves this woman who ruins him almost simply because he can let her, because he can finally be wasteful and self-centered after a life of scrimping and fear and misdirection in Soviet Ukraine. It’s a poor decision on his part, but we understand it, even if his children don’t:We arrive well before one o’clock, hoping to catch her, but she has already gone out. The house looks neglected, dispirited. When my mother was here there were always fresh flowers, a clean tablecloth, the smell of good cooking. Now there are no flowers, but used cups, piles of papers, books, things that have not been put away.Nadia chalks up the mess of her father’s life to depression, but only initially. As she learns more, his sins of necessity, of survival against a regime that hardly wanted him, come to the fore, and the story becomes more compelling, if also sadder. Lewycka’s writing, on its own, isn’t terribly engaging, and her insistence on forcing the story-telling entirely into dialogue is a certain weakness, but her ability to place the structure of the common, important issue of caring for one’s parents within the structure of the immigration tale will win her many doting readers.Our family friend is still ordinary, by the way. He went into business briefly with my stepfather and has started or invested in various companies with varying success. I rather hope the same for Bezmozgis and Lewycka. Unless you’re Joseph Roth or Graham Greene, books of this type are notoriously difficult to follow up, at least not without degrading the endeavour into a pulpy little-man-vs.-the-world formula. I wonder even if we’ll see another book of fiction from the sociologist Lewycka. But Tractors and Bezmozgis’ Natasha, like those cameras, will be gifts that last us long enough.",5,0.9957,0.094,0.743,0.162,0.4548513708513709,POSITIVE,0.9947

By the second chapter it is doubtful that the characters will find a happy ending to this foolish series of events. The narrator of the story, the younger daughter, raises the possibility that perhaps her father should have his “bit of fun” and openly admits that his new lady-friends is more likely to car for him in his old age than she or her sister will. Although the narrator manages to infuse her account of events with humour, it barely distracts from the elephant in the room – this is a very unhappy and dysfunctional family. Much like family relationships in real life, many of the interactions in this novel are strained. The interpersonal conflicts of old are still prevalent and hang in the air like a bad smell.

But no such resolution was reached. At the end of the day I don’t know what to make of this novel. The writing was proficient, as were the characters.

Two years after the death of his wife, Ludmilla, eighty-four year old Nikolai Mayevskyj announces to his youngest daughter, Nadezhda (Nadia) that he is going to marry Valentina, a thirty-six year old Ukrainian divorcee with a teenaged son. As Nadia tries to reason with her determined father, she realises that if she is to prevent him being fleeced by this unscrupulous (bottle-)blonde bombshell, she will need to join forces with Vera, the older sister from whom she has been estranged since they disagreed over their mother’s will. In the process of trying to oust Valentina from their lives and have her deported, much of the family’s history is dredged up and Nadia discovers that what she has been told as a child was not necessarily accurate. This is a rollicking ride that encompasses boil-in-the-bag suppers, an undriveable Rolls Royce, a tomcat named Lady Di, a portable photocopier, a baby of unknown paternity, yoga, sheltered housing and some green satin underwear. Nikolai’s theory on the integral role of tractors in the development of Great Depression, Fascism in Germany and Communism in Russia will provide food for thought.

ASHTU may have dethroned The Glass Bead Game as the most tedious thing I have ever read, and TGBG was at least vaguely nourishing. Imagine that annoying person who sits near you at work telling you a story of at-best middling interest in minute detail over the course of about 5 hours. That's how ASHTU reads: things happen in it that could be interesting or funny, but in Lewycka's telling, they just aren't. There's the odd glimmer of microwaved apples and gloop-stuck jam jars here and there, but they're buried in such an entombing mass of desiccated minutiae and formulaism.Worse still, everyone except the father is painted in such a negative light by the first-person narrator - who herself, in consequence, comes across worst of all. Even when a bartender recurrs after a gap of a few weeks, he's ""really let himself go"". Engage negativity pump: spray liberally.I got the sense that this was all based on real-life events, which could have made a good tale, but that Lewycka (and her editor) had been incapable culling the boring stuff or writing well for anything more than a couple of sentences at a time.

56,1946034101,03/19/2017,3.0,"Ostensibly a relatively light and comical story about an elderly Ukrainian engineer Kolya living in the UK who marries a glamorous younger Ukrainian divorcee Valentina and the attempts of his daughters (Nadezhda the Sociology lecturing narrator and the 10 year elder right wing and fierce Vera) to save him from a relationship which turns from farcical to threatening as Valentina and her son get more and more demanding and dissatisfied as they realise Kolya is not rich. Eventually the succeed in getting him to file for divorce, having the immigration authorities refuse to extend Valentina's stay and having the divorce granted at no costs. Valentina (who has a number of affairs) has a baby girl of uncertain parentage (but not Kolya) and is taken back to Ukraine by her first husband (who granted her a divorce thinking she would be better in England). Real story though is intercut with excerpts from the book Kolya is writing (which gives the book its title) and the narrator (born in 1947 in the UK) gradual uncovering and understanding of some of the traumas faced by her family in the war. Through this we explore both her (lack of) relationship with Vera (peace baby to war baby and how this affected their individual characters and belief systems) and the tragic history of the Ukraine. Much better story than Two Caravans and one which works both as a narrative and as a meditation. ",4,-0.9099,0.128,0.787,0.085,0.4779365079365079,POSITIVE,0.976

72,475078144,12/11/2012,2.0,"Ex Bookworms group review:I am quite late with my review and it’s not because I didn’t finish reading the book in time. In fact, I finished the book half way through March. It isn’t that I’ve left it too long and can’t remember the book. The reason for the late review is that I can’t really decide what to say. I’m not sure what I think of this book.On the surface, it’s a family saga, complete with all the domestic trivia (Toshiba Apples sounds like my kind of recipe!), maybe (dare I say it), something of a soap. In fact, from time to time as I read it, I thought about it as a stage play or a TV show. The characters seemed to me the sort of visual caricatures necessary in that sort of production – the busty blonde with her green satin bra, the impotent old man in his pyjamas, the chain smoking, hard bitten divorcee. I read on the cover that the book was supposed to be “hilarious” (I think that was the word, I can’t find the book at the moment) but I thought it was sadder than it was funny, yet it somehow missed its potential to be the sort of comedy that leaves you with a lump in your throat and a broken heart (The last episode of The Office was a fine example of this). Yet, in spite of these reservations, I enjoyed reading the book, and I thought there was more to it than a soap and there were quite a lot of interesting observations in it, and it made me think about some things. For instance, how humans prey upon each other, even victims on other victims. There are a few examples of this – Valentina preys on Nikolai, maybe Vera preys just a little bit on her mother, father and sister (for material things) and the very much darker example in the camp where Vera is forced to steal cigarettes for another inmate, and then shopped for it. Also, how misunderstandings arise – Nadia feels that family secrets exclude her, when they are clearly meant to protect her. I thought about how it actually feels to be an immigrant. I knew very little about Ukraine before, and don’t know much now, but it seems that first they lost their country, if not their identity, to the USSR, and later had to move to a completely different country. I wondered what that might be like and how I might cope under similar circumstances. If I was forced to leave England, which I love, where would I go, what would I miss, and what would I try to remember (or try to forget)? I also wondered what Marina Lewycka’s political views might be. There was a persistent thread about Vera confusing Nadia’s occupation of sociologist with social worker, yet I thought what was really at issue in the book was socialism (or communism, perhaps). There are many instances in the book where socialism, which is a fine theory, is a failure – such as the suffering it caused in Ukraine, the fact that Valentina was so desperate to have all the material trappings (fine cars, fine clothes, education for her son) that those in power in the USSR were so criticised for having, and for depriving everyone else of. Another example is the shallowness of Nadia’s socialism when faced with the question of Valentina, how rapidly she stopped seeing Valentina as someone just like them, trying to win a better life for her and her son, instead seeing her as a weapon of mass destruction so far as the family were concerned (weren’t her superior breasts somewhere described as weapons? Twin nuclear warheads, or such like? She very quickly turned into the “flog ‘em and deport ‘em” (again, this might not be the exact term) that Vera had been all the time. Valentina wasn’t all bad, she worked hard, and in some senses, she was honest, I don’t think she ever claimed to love Nikolai but saw it as a sort of trade – he would supply her with the material things she needed and she would do the boil in the bag cooking and presumably give him access to the superior breasts. It wasn’t really her fault that Nikolai still had romantic and sexual fantasies that he was no longer capable of consummating (how sad old age is). Despite Valentina’s cruelty to him, wasn’t he happier when she was around? What do we know? I wondered how much of this book was autobiographical because obviously Marina Lewycka was from the Ukraine herself. I don’t know whether her father is still alive, but if so, I doubt he is very pleased as Nikolai is terribly stereotypical and it is hard to feel much sympathy for him. Obviously he is quite intelligent and had a good knowledge of Ukraine’s history. I actually thought the tractor bits were quite enlightening and it was clever how it was all related to the history of Ukraine and, in fact, the world.I thought some parts were actually quite moving. Vera was put in an entirely different light when you understood some (but not all) of what had happened to her. It made her divorce, for whatever reason, more poignant, because she was driven by a need for security. I know this is sacrilege, but sometimes I am quite bored by the Holocaust, but actually, this book made me think about it more than some other books which are much more direct about the impact it has had on people’s lives. The part about a war baby and peace baby really struck me, as did the statement that the two sisters lived in the same house but in different countries. All in all, I thought this was an interesting book, though I think it could have been a better one. I think I am right in saying, though, that it is Marina Lewycka’s first book, and if it is, then I think she definitely shows promise!",3,0.9792,0.109,0.765,0.126,0.4701243894993896,NEGATIVE,0.9999
73,255434855,01/03/2012,5.0,"A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian is a hilarious, witty and moving novel with something for everyone - eastern Europeans can recognize themselves in the characters, while Westerners can get a grasp of the expression ‘this deep Slavic soul’.A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian is, however, not tragic, the way most books on Eastern Europe tend to be. The bitterly painful reflections on Stalinism, communism, dissident camps and broken dreams are tangled in a comic feast, full of eccentric rather than depressed types. Writer Marina Lewycka, Ukrainian descent, was born in a refugee camp in Germany, at the end of World War II, and raised in England.Obviously, both her ‘parallel’ life between Eastern and Western Europe and my eastern European background helped for the strong impact which the book had on me.Some parts of it reminded me of my childhood, others of stories my grandparents have told me from the time they’d been young. It was painfully close and nostalgic at the same time!Lewycka's reflections on the importance eastern Europeans give to food storage brought memories of a manufacture taking place in our house every summer, as well as in every house in our neighborhood, and in every neighborhood in the country, and probably in the neighboring countries too.*Because eastern Europeans feel strongly about their food and its preservation.* Food storage is regarded as a condition for the family’s physical survival. A matter of life and death!An excerpt:‘My mother had a pantry under the stairs stocked from floor to ceiling with tins of fish, meat, tomatoes, fruit, vegetables and puddings, packets of sugar (granulated, caster, icing and Demerara), flour (plain, self-raising and wholemeal), rice (pudding and long-grain), pasta (macaroni, twirls and vermicelli), lentils, buckwheat, split peas, oatmeal, bottles of oil (vegetable, sunflower and olive), pickles (tomato, cucumber, beetroot), boxes of cereals (mainly Shredded Wheat), packets of biscuits (mainly chocolate digestives) and slabs of chocolate. On the floor, in bottles and demi-johns, were gallons of a thick, mauve liquor made from plums, brown sugar and cloves, a glass of which was guaranteed to render even the most hardened alcoholic (and there were plenty of those in the Ukrainian community) comatose for up to three hours. Upstairs under the beds in sliding boxes were kept preserves (mainly plum) and jars of home-made jam (plum, strawberry, raspberry, blackcurrant and quince in all combinations). In the potting-sheds and garage, cardboard fruit-boxes were stacked with the latest crop of apples, Bramleys, Beauty of Bath and Grieves, all separately wrapped in newspaper, exuding their fruity perfume. By next spring, their skins would be waxy, and the fruit inside shrivelled, but they were still good for Apfelstrudel and Blini. (The windfalls and damaged fruit had been picked out, cut up, and stewed as they fell.) Nets of carrots and potatoes, still preserved in their coat of clayey soil, bundles of onions and garlic, hung in the cool dark of the outhouse. When my parents bought a freezer, in 1979, the peas, beans, asparagus and soft fruits soon piled up in plastic ice-cream tubs, each one labelled, dated and rotated. Even dill and parsley were rolled in little plastic bundles and stored away for use, so that there was no longer any season of the year when there was scarcity. When I teased her about these supplies, enough to feed an army, she would wag her finger at me and say, ‘It’s in case your Tony Benn ever comes to power.’ My mother had known ideology, and she had known hunger. When she was twenty-one, Stalin had discovered he could use famine as a political weapon against the Ukrainian kulaks. She knew-and this knowledge never left her throughout her fifty years of life in England, and then seeped from her into the hearts of her children-she knew for certain that behind the piled-high shelves and abundantly stocked counters of Tesco and the Co-op, hunger still prowls with his skeletal frame and gaping eyes, waiting to grab you the moment you are off your guard. Waiting to grab you and shove you on a train, or on to a cart, or into that crowd of running fleeing people, and send you off on another journey where the destination is always death. The only way to outwit hunger is to save and accumulate, so that there is always something tucked away, a little something to buy him off with.’There is a popular belief in Eastern Europe that throwing bread (even moldy one) is a sin. According to a proverb: ‘No one is bigger than bread’. Meanwhile, Westerners say: ‘The bread of life’, meaning that what is needed for a full life is spiritual food. **I try not to blame the past for all strange eastern Europeans’ affinities, but when it comes to food, I’m sort of willing to do so. Or at least partly. Not enough time has passed yet for eastern Europeans to forget hunger, food stores with only basic products on the shelves, the empty shops in the 1990s and the two-mile queues for bread in the mornings.As much as A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian is concerned, it is not a clash between Eastern and Western Europe. To me, it is a comical, but truthful picture of the eastern Europeans and their mentality (that sometimes is a result of circumstances, not choices).",3,-0.9311,0.061,0.894,0.045,0.4874404761904761,POSITIVE,0.9961
74,574167871,03/29/2013,3.0,"“A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian”by Marina LewyckaWere we to spend 30 to 40 years of our lives without meeting a single Ukrainian, and be unaware that their communities are dotted about the country, the revelation of their existence would come as little surprise. We've heard tell of Somali social clubs going back a century, personally we know shed-loads of Poles, we sit next to Brazilians on the bus or train every day. The UK is a peculiar sort of place. Funny, too. Its native humour is interlaced with the self-parodies of the Pakistani, Yahudi, Italian, Chinese and German types who over the years have made it their home. Such diversity began long long before the post-war immigration boom, by which time the UK already had its panoply of national stereo-goons: the Welsh teachers, Canadian adventurers, Irish nurses, Australian sheep farmers, English toffs, Caribbean sailors and Scottish housekeepers. So if now we've got Ukrainians too, it figures.When people say, as they do, there's something very English about... and then go on to yak about something that is not at all English indeed, we nod and accept these as facts because so often there's truth in them. There's something very English, we say, about the Turkish kebabs on every high street, just as there's something terribly English about curry. There's something quite English about trusting a plumber because he's Polish, well they do work harder and invite you to haggle if you think they're overcharging. There's something absolutely English about the rise and fall of the Asian mini-mart; and then campaigns to save our Chinese laundries, Italian ice-cream parlours and French onion sellers are just about English as you can get. Though the English invented class snobbery, there's something utterly English about the young aristocratic lady in Downton marrying the Sinn Fein chauffeur.Therefore, to say there's something very Engish about “A Short History of Tractors In Ukrainian” is not to annex beetroot soup, fur-lined caps or Natashas with embossed fingernails for the British Empire. It's to say that this story of Ukrainians in Peterborough is an archetype in a post-modern world of which the UK has become capital. Of course, apart from the Crimean War (1853-5) a while ago there was little to connect Britain with the former Soviet Republic, and what is least English about the book is how the Mayevskyj family became slave workers under the Third Reich, then refugees after World War Two. The British were not overly concerned in the tragedies that befell former provinces of the Romanov empire, preferring to mop up after the Ottomans. Things began to change after the fall of Poland in 1939. In the seven decades since, it's fair to say that population-wise Britain has become the most European of all EU members, leaving aside its aloofness from the Euro project. What distinguishes the UK is not simply the sheer number of emigrés it has absorbed, but their diversity and the endurance of their cultural values. With alacrity, the UK celebrates its very own Hungarian bean-fests and Romanian Independence days.“A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian” is the story of how a septuagenarian engineer, Nicolai Mayevskyj, betroths a thirty-something Russian divorcée from the Ukraine, Valentina, and what his daughters Vera and Nadezhda - our narrtor – go through. It's partially a comic novel with the line “I have a cunning plan” - Baldrick's catchphrase from “Black Adder” - repeated no less than three times. The fun-poking at Nokolai's one-foot-in-the-grave search for companionship and Valentina's boil-in-the-bag modernity is interspersed with chunks of family history, sibling rivalry between Vera and Nadezhda, and memories of their dead mother. Actually, though the writing never ceases to be light, it is seldom lightweight. Through the medium of English and English slapstick, things Ukrainian and Russian are presented effortlessly and with charm. Whenever the action descends into parody and farce - over Pappa's “squishy-squashy” impotence for instance - the narrative takes a sudden twist and we're treated to a chapter from his on-going manuscript history of Ukrainian tractors.Marina Lewycka's use of tense is subtly done. Most of the action is told in present tenses, which gives the story-telling a button-holed, in-your-face quality. Some writers, Andrew Miller for example, carry the use of present tenses to extremes. Lewycka, however, frequently reverts to past tense narrative, sometimes even in the same scene, and once again the effect looks effortless. I had only a few quibbles with the text; sometimes there were double line-breaks between paragraphs in the same scene and I couldn't see why. Also, as with the Baldrick line, there is occasional over-use of repetition: “Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells” pops up two or three times more often than originality demands. And occasionally you get lines which could only be of benefit to non-native speakers, for example: “Now he is spent up – he has no money left.”This is an easy and rewarding read which leaves me feeling intrigued and keen to read on. If I ever come across the volume advertised on the back cover - “Caravans” - I'd certainly consider buying it, if only to see if Lewycka extends her reach, or branches out beyond the world of Ukrainian emigrés.",3,0.9362,0.043,0.89,0.067,0.2761597542242704,POSITIVE,0.9909

78,971701236,06/19/2014,4.0,"I picked up Marina Lewycka's ""A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian"" almost by accident. The title attracted my attention so I picked it up and began reading. After reading the first three sentences, I was sold. They are: ""Two years after my mother died, my father fell in love with a glamorous blond Ukrainian divorcee. He was eighty-four and she was thirty-six. She exploded into our lives like a fluffy pink grenade, churning up the murky water, bringing to the surface sludge of sloughed-off memories, giving the family ghosts a kick up the backside."" The concern I have with books that begin so well is the difficulty the remainder has in living up to such promise. I am happy to report that Ukrainian Tractors lived up to the promise of its opening paragraph.The opening sentences sum up the story. Nikolai, his wife and two children Vera and Nadezhda (Nadia) were Ukrainian refugees who, at the conclusion of the Second World War make their way to Peterborough, England. Vera was born before the war and has memories of the families' travails in German work camps. She is the ""war baby."" Vera is the basic domineering know-it-all older sister. Nadia is the peace baby, a liberal sociology lecturer with a penchant for buying her clothes used at the local Oxfam (charity outlet). Nadia and Vera have not talked since their mother's funeral. Nikolai picks up he phone one day and announces to Nadia that he is about to take a new bride. Valentina is a young, buxom bottle-blonde Ukrainian whose U.K. residency visa is about to expire. As expected, Vera and Nadia call a truce in order to prevent the marriage and protect their father from a fate they consider worse than death. Nikolai, of course, cannot help but contemplate blissful evenings in the warm embrace of his well-endowed faux-blonde soon to be illegal alien while he writes his book, a history of the tractor, the farm implement that changed the world.Valentina makes for a worthy adversary and seems to best Vera and Nadia every step of the way. The comedy of the book turns a bit dark, however, as Nikolai's age and infirmities facilitate Valentina's increasing dominance over him. Her mental and physical abuse of Nikolai becomes apparent. At the same time, Lewycka takes us on a trip through the family's past. In the meantime, family ghosts and secrets begin to emerge. Root causes of the family's deep-rooted antagonism begin to reveal themselves as the story progresses. Events race on to a not altogether surprising conclusion.I very much enjoyed ""A Short History of tractors In Ukrainian"". I was impressed by the manner in which Lewycka fleshed out the characters. Anyone who has been responsible for the care and feeding of an aging parent or grandparent will recognize Nikolai. One's pride is the last thing to go sometimes and when we see events beat the pride out of our loved ones we can almost see them shrink before our eyes. The two sisters also had a strong air of reality about them. I've seen each type in real life and I think Lewycka captures their essences well. Last but not least we have the Ukrainian bombshell, Valentina. By the end of the book I had no small amount of sympathy for Valentina. I could admire her work effort and her desire to make a better life for herself and her son despite her poor treatment of Nikolai. This is no easy task for a writer to accomplish. At the same time, her grasping nature, her dolled-up appearance, and her belief that ready-made food products were the western equivalent of high cuisine were downright hilarious at times.There were a couple of spots where I thought the story dragged a bit or where some of the actions of the characters did not quite ring true. Some of the subsidiary characters seems a bit lifeless compared to Valentina and Nikolai. However, those relatively minor flaws were swept up in a story that was both charming and thoughtful.",3,0.997,0.067,0.773,0.161,0.4515503777268482,NEGATIVE,0.5369
79,383035326,08/02/2012,1.0,"I tried really hard to read this book but , in the end , gave up. When I was a teenager I really liked reading science fictlion. I also read Joseph Heller, JD Salinger etc . But i never understood the idea of the literary novel. As I grew older and my life became busier I stopped reading novels. It felt like such a passive way to interact with the world. About ten years ago, when work had come to take up almost all of my thinking time, I needed to find a way to clear it out of my head. I started to read novels again. I would read to fall asleep and felt like I could read anything. It didn't have to be good, it was enough that a book would keep me going to the end of a page so that I would fall asleep. I loved the feeling of drifting into sleep in the middle of someone else's world.Then came this book. I'd seen it in so many airport bookshops so I thought it might be just right for my very limited reading needs. I can say this book changed my life. Before this book I could read anything. Nothing was so badly written, so dull, so frustratingly bad that I would give up on it. Not until this book! I really did try with this. Night after night I read, hoping that very soon it would stop irritating me and just let me read a paragraph or two without thinking, "" How did this ever get published?""After a few weeks I had to admit defeat. This book was unique, it was a first, but it did change my reading habits. I wouldn't say my efforts toread this made me more discriminating in my reading habits, but it did weaken my resolve. And as time passed and I began to find more books that utterly defeated me, I learned to work at reading. My youthful ideas about the passivity of reading were modified. I did find more books that were so bad that I gave up on them, but I found others that , with a bit of effort on my part, I could finish. Even some that, with a bit of work, i could enjoy, That, I began to realise, was the secret of the literary novel. The literay novel generally lacked a clear story line and presented as self consciously hard to read , but if you could persist, you could be rewarded by the mental challenge required to uncover the, sometimes interesting ideas behind the writing. Fair enough if you are in the mood for a mental challenge.Back tothe tractors then. Despite being largely responsible for my awakening to reading as a chalkenge and the world of literary fiction, this book is not literature. It is just plain bad, uninspiring and dull. I still don't know why, apart from having some kind of vague interest in tractors, you might want toread this. Except, if you are like me and unable to distinguish between good books that somehow hide the story so you have to work to find it and bad books that just hide the story because the writing and the ideas that inspire it, are so insipid and worthless that the book should never have been written, never mind published.Read this if you, like me, think reading should always be enjoyable.

I actually picked it up mainly for that reason.It was ... OK. But certainly not Booker or Orange prize material -- what were they thinking when they shortlisted it? It's billed on the cover as ""hilarious ... amazing ... extraordinary"" and it isn't any of those things. I did smile a few times but never laughed out loud. To be fair I think the blurb does Lewycka a disservice -- the black comedy is obviously intended to make some deeper points, which seem to have passed some readers by completely (the ones who said ""I didn't bother reading the bits about tractors/the historical bits because they were irrelevant""). They are clearly there for a reason, or several reasons. One aspect is the fact that Nikolai and the ghastly Valentina reflect two very different waves of migration. Then there's the animosity between sisters Nadezhda and Vera, caused at least in part by Vera's traumatic wartime experiences which Nadezhda does not understand or appreciate. And there is some insight into the experiences that forged the characters of the family.But it didn't really work for me -- it fell between too many stools. For black humour to work as humour, pathos, and serious message simultaneously, the characters have to be deeper and less ""cardboard cut-out"" than these. Valentina is obviously intended to be an outrageous stereotype, but if she had been less outrageous it would have been easier to perceive that she is a victim of change too. Some of the exposition was clumsy, and the style could be irritating -- it drove me mad when conversations (presumably in Ukraininan) between Nikolai and Valentina were written in broken English. The main characters seemed to exist in a bubble, with the sisters' husbands and children floating about on the periphery of the story, not developed at all.

Valentina enters their lives with a whirlwind of trouble, accusations and domestic issues that the old man is no match for.Rather quickly it turns out that Valentina comes with her completely own agenda and she and her supposedly prodigy son turns out to be more than what the father expected and he is in no way capable of standing his ground.I felt for the old man who in his naivety actually thought that the young blond woman with the very big boobs would actually want a intimate relationship with him and that she wanted more than just getting into the West, that she also actually wanted to take care of him while he grew older and more feeble.I really liked this book while I was reading it. I was completely drawn in from the very beginning and really felt for these sisters trying to protect their father from this golddigger, still trying to come to terms with the death of their mother and also working on their relationships with each other which has been rather estranged after some inheritance issues after their mother's dead.It's a book about relationships - between fathers and daughters, parents and children, sisters, between new wives and 'old' daughters. And I thought the author did a remarkable job with these complex issues while at the same time keeping the book very light and easy to read. It felt so easy and went by so fast that you almost end up questioning whether it was as good as you felt while reading it or if it was just too breezy.All the cover blurbs are stressing the fact that this is a funny, enjoyable comic feast - but to me, it felt a lot more tragi-comic than comic.In the end however, I liked it a lot and I'm looking forward to reading more by this author.And don't even get me started on the father's book about tractors in Ukraina!",3,0.9489,0.033,0.884,0.084,0.4603549783549786,POSITIVE,0.7924

A Short History of Tractors in Ukranian   is a book about first and second generation immigrants, of the fight of the rest to belong to the West, the craving for all that it offers, with its consumerism, its capitalism and it's fair judiciary, sound political regimes within the bounds of a solid legal system.But this is also a book of the tale of two sisters. And that doesn't hit you till the end- of how the entire story was leading to that- the tale of the two sisters. On the surface, it's a tale of love where there is a loneliness, the hypocrisy of the human nature and the simple need for companionship, however harsh, however toxic.The bluntness throughout the text came as a pleasant, unexpected surprise; there was little left to the imagination and little that wasn't revealed. And that is what makes this story palatable and palpable. Yet, there are things not revealed in the plainest terms. And that works because sometimes, ""it's better not to know things.""Interspersed with little chunks of prose from the actual book on the history of tractors being written within the book, there is a pronounced technical and engineering tilt to it. Not in a capacity to numb, but adding context, setting the mood of much of what the characters grew up with.Like most books concerning non-native English speakers, the prose is simple and brusque, but never stilted.

There are some very amusing descriptions in the book, particularly involving these two characters.As well as hearing details of the battle against Valentina from the narrator Nadezhda we also learn something of the families history and their reasons behind leaving the Ukraine, which is both sorrowful and believable.

At the beginning of the story things were quite comedic. I laughed at the absurdity of an eccentric 84 year old widower marrying a 36 year old, much to the horror of his 2 daughters, who, by the way, don't get on. It became interesting when Nadia (daughter #2 and storyteller) found her morals being challenged. Although the story keeps a fairly light tone throughout, things did take a darker turn as the marriage quickly deteriorated and things became a bit nasty.The morality particularly interested me. It's easy to have lofty opinions, however, when a situation unfolds that affects you, can you maintain your moral high stance, or do sacrifice your beliefs in order to get what you want? Unfortunately, after developing the point, it isn't really followed through - there is no real guilt or even reflection on how her actions sit with her morals. The family backstory which comes to light as the sisters become closer helps illuminate each persons motivations. None of the main protagonists are painted as black or white, each person is a shade of grey, and you can mostly understand the reasons why each of them act the way they do. At the end there is a sort of bombshell regarding events during the war, but the facts are just explained, then the sisters sort of go on as before (although friends by now), and then the story ends. Finally, can someone more intelligent that I can explain the relevance of the father writing his book on tractors? Is it to escape the reality of his current situation?

Its central plot revolves around two grown-up daughters dealing with the increasing chaos caused by the marriage of their widowed, 84-year old Pappa, Nikolai Mayevskyj, to a thirty-six year old big-breasted Ukrainian gold digger with a teenage son. The Mayevskyj family immigrated from Ukraine at the end of WWII and daughters Nadia and Vera have spent most of their lives in the U.K. They have families of their own now and this second marriage of their eccentric father to a newly arrived immigrant divorcee disrupts their lives and forces Nadia to look at her family's past history.""A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian"" is a vehicle with room to show us much: the imperfect yet strong bonds of families, the long-term misunderstandings that can exist between siblings, why family history is sometimes left untold, and the embarrassment and bravery of being who we are in any culture at any time. Marina Lewycka gets at how messy family life can be, especially when families have to adapt to and survive novel circumstances during times of war and peace. The cast of characters is marvelous and the reader can pass her own judgments on who is acting honorably at any time.  The title takes its name from a book that Nikolai is working on in the novel. He was trained in Ukraine as an engineer and worked on developing tractors for a time during WWII. Machinery, in the shape of Russian airplanes, tanks, and German airplanes, serve as a means to show the dark past of the Mayevskyjs and some of the horrors of the war. However, ultimately, the tractor is an optimistic symbol and Nikolai writes: ""Never allow technology to be your master, and never use it to gain mastery over others.""",2,0.7457,0.082,0.817,0.101,0.4347362514029181,POSITIVE,0.9999

This group whose members protest topless, ""now has chapters in nine countries, on four continents...calls its tactics “sextremism” and its hundreds of mostly volunteer members “shock troops” — frontline soldiers in a global war against patriarchy, and for women’s rights. Its sworn enemies are dictatorship, organized religion and sexual exploitation.""The story focuses on one very pretty young woman Sasha Shevensko who explains her involvement: “I decided for myself to be a woman, to be a girl who will open eyes for other women, for other girls,” she said. “Because I know myself — Ukrainian girls are stupid. We don’t have sexual education in schools. In universities, we don’t have feminist education. We don’t know even what feminism is.”Were more of that attitude around, the villainess in A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian would not be so keen on getting out of Ukraine and to the UK where she entraps an elderly Ukrainian widower to the dismay of his fully-assimilated daughters.Lewycka's novel is extremely funny, and, while there is ugliness under the surface, the reader only glimpses it. I have no idea if Lewycka has had any contact with Femen--she's more than a generation older--but I'm sure she would appreciate the way they use convention and shock to get their message across.For more about books and writing: Not So Solitary a Pleasure: A Blog about Books. http://notsolitaryapleasure.blogspot.ca",2,-0.9426,0.117,0.823,0.061,0.5719095719095719,NEGATIVE,0.5591

I think if there had been just a little bit more of that, then I might have put the book down, because I was looking for a lighthearted read for once! However, the comedy outweighed that thankfully, and I found myself laughing silently and shaking my head at all the mad situations poor Nikolai got himself into with the gold-digging, voluptuous Valentina.

[Suki, in winter, is a lap cat] The next day, I call this book “Excellent.” The main character is English born of Ukranian parents. She, Nadia, has a distant and sometimes hostile relationship with her older sister Vera, who was born during WWII and who therefore has more memories of their family during hardships and difficult previous years. Nadia is jealous; Vera is resentful.With their much-loved mother dead 2 years, their father now takes up with a 36-year old Ukranian woman, a buxom, bleached-blonde looking for legal citizenship (marriage), money, and as many status symbols as she can get. Their father is 84 and foolishly falls for every ploy that flouncy Valentina presents. The two sisters now slowly come together to prevent their father from marrying the slovenly schemer. It was, at times, hilarious despite the serious issues. The broken English arguments and culture differences made the best laughs. Peripheral characters add humor and surprise.As Nadia gradually uncovers the real past (different from gentle family stories) she understands why she and Vera grew apart. They face their father’s foibles, admire his talents, [his latest book is the novel’s title] and have a good look at “old age” as he lives it. Each character is a realistic mix of strong and weak; no one is a stereotype nor a complete villain. This is the author’s first novel and it’s a wonderful achievement to be so amusing - a nice mix of entertainment and wisdom. ",2,0.9698,0.098,0.721,0.181,0.5061904761904762,POSITIVE,0.9999

However, they are forced to work together when their father announces plans to marry a much younger Ukrainian woman.The characters are all very interesting; Nadezhda and Vera are complete opposites, but I enjoyed seeing them united in order to see off a common enemy - their new stepmother, Valentina. Valentina was probably my favourite character: Lewycka wrote so that you could go from hating her to loving her to feeling bad for her in just a few chapters. For me, while she is very cruel to her new husband, it is made known that she has done everything - married a much older man whom she has nothing in common with, moved to a country on the other side of Europe, taken on multiple jobs - in order to further the life of her son Stanislav. The ending wound things up a little too neatly - Valentina and Stanislav being reunited with their husband/father and returning to Ukraine, Nikolai moving to a residential home, Nadezhda and Vera becoming friends again - but I must say I actually still quite enjoyed it.",2,0.7261,0.089,0.797,0.115,0.4465778474399164,POSITIVE,0.9999

It is hard to maintain a fixed understanding of each of the characters as the reader’s perspective, influenced by the observations and opinions of the narrator, develops as more is revealed about a character’s history and their reactions to different situations.Even the novel’s antagonist, the gold digging and abusive Valentina, is not without her sympathetic moments. She has a idealised view of Britain which has clearly been manipulated by Western propaganda, and she lashes out whenever her surroundings or people fail to live up to these expectations. The reader too must also be aware that the narrator is biased against Valentina from the outset. It is not until Nadezhda learns about her own family’s migration from Ukraine to Britain that it becomes possible to see much of Valentina’s ruthlessness deriving from a desire for a better life for her and her son.",2,0.8919,0.081,0.797,0.122,0.5478888888888889,POSITIVE,0.8995

If Kingsley Amis had been from a Ukrainian immigrant family and had less of an edge, he might have written something like this. A warring - although the level of warring seems quite tame - pair of daughters has to come together to save their widowed, eccentric father from a gold-digging, Ukrainian-illegal sexpot. Lots of crazy things happen along the way and most of the book is very light. The author tries to add some depth by invoking a dark family past, but that effort isn't very successful. She's best with the witty banter and creation of the turns of plot. If you know Ukrainian culture (and I do), you can quibble about some leaps of faith. There is also a little too much effort to make the narrator a sympathetic, winning figure. It would have been better had the narrator possessed a few real flaws.

The beginning caught me, but the middle dragged--it was a repetitive cycle of frustration, but I pushed through because I had to see how it all ended up and at the end I got it. The repetitive cycle of frustration was a part of the journey, the uncomfortable feelings about the characters' personalities was a necessary part of the picture, and in the end, you get it. The book is about sisters and really more broadly, about the small finite history and journey of a single family and how it is different for each person in it, yet affects the family as a whole. We all have a family story, and each person in the family remembers and experiences it differently, leading to such a complex effect on the dynamic of the family it's impossible to unravel, and even harder to move past.

It’s also about the desire to escape persecution, restriction, and poverty. Some of the story is set in the present, while the rest is the narrator (the younger sister) relating her parents’ and sister’s history in Ukraine before and during the second world war.I didn’t love this, to be honest. I did think the parallels between Valentina and Nikolay and his family’s escape or departure from Ukraine were interesting, in that both were looking for a better life. I would have liked to see more of Nikolay’s story from his perspective, though, rather than from the perspective of the daughter who hadn’t been born yet. I understand why Lewycka told the story from Nadezhda’s perspective, though: through her discovery of hidden history, the reader uncovers it also. I just don’t think there was enough of that history to make this a really gripping book for me.I do think the different perspectives of the sisters was interesting. Vera, the older sister, experienced the hardships during the war, so had a much more cynical outlook than Nadezhda, which sparked tensions between the sisters. It was an interesting look at how the need to survive trauma shapes you in different ways than not having to deal with that does.I liked that Lewycka didn’t demonise Valentina. She’s not a pleasant person, but she’s seeking a better life in her own way, even if that involves cheating and lying.There were some funny moments and some more poignant moments here, but, over all, it didn’t capture my heart as I hoped.

207,3990063201,05/08/2021,2.0,"There are some books that fit a particular cultural moment and, when that moment ends, so too does the book. Not all books are built for posterity. ‘A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian’ is one of them. In 2005, when COVID, Trump, Brexit, and even the financial crisis were all future problems, this book was probably a fitting testament to the end of the nineties (and the end of the end of history, did they but know it). Before austerity rammed home the economic legacy of Thatcher, it was fine to treat her as a long-departed bogeyman with a predominantly comic relief function. You had to search into the past for the real shit, which is why the protagonists of the book are two sisters in their sixties, dealing with the sundown love affair their eighty-year-old father is having with a thirty-six year old immigrant. It feels churlish to dump on this book in some respects because the author was born in a refugee camp. Undoubtedly some of the biographical elements of the main character’s parents are drawn from life, and they're the strongest parts, if the most obvious. However, the crux of the story is Nikolai falling into the snare of Valentina, a Ukrainian woman who marries him for UK citizenship. The pratfalling that ensues with Nadezhda and her sister Vera attempting to subvert the course of this marriage, divorce, and all Valentina’s related machinations is absurdist to the point of farce. Even though it’s written in English, it reads like it was translated from Ukrainian. Every so often the first-person narrator refers to herself in the third person, for no reason. The ‘tractor’ element was pure gimmick. Every so often there’s an extract from Nikolai’s ‘book’ about the history of tractors, but they’re all dull and do nothing to advance the plot or illustrate character.

We also get an insight as to how two sisters from the same family (albeit divided by about ten years) can have a totally different view, not only of the world, but also of the past and truth behind family secrets and what made their parents the people they became and how this affected their relationships with them.It all sounds a bit bleak but it is written is such a way that makes it very readable and amusing throughout without ever being laugh out loud funny.About half way through I began to find the havoc the interloper was reeking quite tedious but the pace of the tale soon moved on through a number of twists and turns.

211,885520505,03/18/2014,1.0,"As Romeo and Juliet found to their cost, marriage is never just about two people falling in love, it is about families.I have been very enthusiastically urged to read this book for years; it’s so hilarious, it’s so crazy, it’s so fun! It’s always been in the back of my mind to read this, but one of those ones you never actually get to. Finally, it was selected for my book club and I was really looking forward to finding a fun, kooky story to enjoy. Instead I was treated to some of the worst, irredeemable characters I have ever read and a great glimpse into families at their nastiest and most toxic. When their elderly father announces he’s going to marry a woman at least half his age from Ukraine, sisters Vera and Nadia put aside their feud to unite against a common enemy: Valentina, the woman trying to marry her way into the UK. As we delve further and further into Vera and Nadia’s attempts to have Valentina deported, we descend further into the depths of insanity and depravity which is the very foundations of the novel. I found it very difficult to like a single character in the novel; all their interactions revolve around this dispute, and as is always the custom with family feuds, there is much bitterness spoken by all. Unfortunately, we don’t see the characters in any other scenario in the novel and therefore only know them by their bitterness which was the main reason for my strong dislike of them. Even Nadia, the narrator, does not interact with her husband or daughter unless it directly relates to her family – her husband Mike is forced to entertain her father and listen to his babbling and appears to serve no other purpose in her life than that of convenience. It is my father’s great regret that both his children were daughters. Inferior intellectually, yet not flirtatious and feminine, as women should be, but strident, self-willed, disrespectful creatures. What a misfortune for a man. He has never tried to conceal his disappointment. The father is also very unlikeable; a strong misogynist who won’t listen to the sound reasoning of his daughters, even after Valentina becomes physically and emotionally abusive and dismisses them anytime they say something he disagrees with. While ordinarily, a frail elderly man being abused and denied basic human rights like access to a toilet would incite outrage and pity, yet I could feel none for a man so prone to childish temper tantrums and acts of selfishness. His childish and selfish ways become even less tolerable when we learn more about his history and discover that he has many times causes great pain – including torture – to family members in order to get things his way. I did not once feel like the girls were helping their father out of love and devotion, but were instead feeling a sense of obligation and a desire to protect their potential inheritance. The most disappointing character for me was Valentina. She is in no way more 2-Dimensional than any of the other characters in the novel, nor less prone to resorting to nastiness and backstabbing. My disappointment in particular relation to Valentina stems from the representation of immigrants seeking a new, better life in a different country. Valentina is the stereotypical evil step mother – she doesn’t love or care for her husband, she favours her own child over the step children and is only concerned with her own advancement. Her description is the epitome of eurotrash; big breasts (the main draw for Nadia’s father), constant bed hopping for a new sugar daddy, and obsessed with labels to the point of preferring a Rolls Royce that serves no greater purpose than lawn ornament over a fully functional, cheap car. While there is no obligation for the author to present immigrants in a positive light, I felt especially conscious of how Valentina was presented in light of the constant debate here in Australia and overseas about accepting immigrants and refugees into the country, especially when the author herself migrated to UK. There is very little attempt at explaining why Valentina is so desperate to get into the country that she will marry an old man, especially when the actions of breaking the law and several acts of adultery could so easily see her deported. I had thought that the title, A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian, was merely a quirky and odd sounding title. In fact, it refers to the book that Nadia’s father is writing, a strong passion of his from his days as an engineer, and parts of the book are interspersed throughout the novel. I felt that these could have been blended a little better with the story, or perhaps related back to it in terms of themes and metaphors better than it did. I think I may have been able to enjoy them a little more had the rest of the story not been quite so nasty and therefore in such high contrast. Instead, I was finding myself so stressed and irritated by the characters that it detracted from my potential enjoyment of the history of the tractor. And so I leave you with this thought, dear reader. Use the technology which the engineer has developed, but use it with a humble and questioning spirit. Never allow technology to be your master, and never use it to gain mastery over others. The resolution of the various conflicts within the family felt like a complete contrast to the rest of the novel. By the time the situation with Valentina has been favourably resolved, the two sisters seem to have come to terms with her, as well as settling the fight between the two that was years in the making. These resolutions and peace treaties did not flow naturally and it felt very out of character for everyone to suddenly and calmly drop their grievances after so much fighting.In the end, I found very little, if anything at all, to enjoy about this book and I wish I could undo my decision to read it. I would rather think of it much more fondly with a sense of ‘to read at some point in time’ with a sense of wistful excitement of potential enjoyment that I’d felt for it a few weeks ago.

The tone is kind of similar to White Teeth, I think- generally I like British humor but neither of these books made me laugh out loud. The humor’s sardonic, making the best of a bad situation, but not joyful. Maybe it’d help to hear it read aloud, but in my head only the negative comes across. Although, I try to entertain myself by making jokes about my own circumstances, so you’d think I’d enjoy novels like this more than I have. Anyway, I learned about the history of Ukraine and the use and development of tractors throughout wartime and peacetime, which is more interesting than I’d thought. And I liked the snippets of Ukrainian and Russian culture and language. I can’t relate well to any of the main characters- they’re of a significantly older generation with family problems I haven’t had. But I like Nadezhda’s honesty and self-deprecation and how in the end there are no villains and everyone is human and there’s some sympathy and mutual understanding and even admiration, even though their actions can be infuriating. I’m in no hurry to seek out more books by the author, but this was worthwhile.",0,0.9817,0.127,0.631,0.242,0.4973333333333334,NEGATIVE,0.9996

It is clever, warm, funny, well-written and very observant.

In this way, it reminded me of a favourite book of mine about this period of history, Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close by Jonathan Safran Foer (which appeared after this I think.)I loved the contrast between the sisters too.I liked some elements of how Valentina was described however some of it seemed really stereotypical and a bit dated.

For it's only when you get to your destination that you discover the road doesn't end here after all.”I picked this book for three reasons really. Firstly that it is on the 1001 books before you die list, secondly because it was described as being 'extremely funny' and thirdly because it was about about an ethnic minority trying to settle in Britain which seems very apt with what is going on in the Mediterranean at present.The novel revolves around a recent arrival in Britain from the Ukraine. Her name is Valentina and to get a British passport, she is prepared to marry a recently widowed elderly man, Nikolai, himself an Ukrainian immigrant if a long standing one. For her it is a marriage of convenience as for she has no affection for the old man for she is still young and virile whereas the old male is infirm and impotent. Marriage would also provide the opportunity of a university education for her accompanying teenage sonValentina in many respects is not a sponger and in fact she works hard if illegally in an old people's home but she then spends most of her nights with another Englishman so is portrayed as manipulative. She dislikes housework and cooking but thinks everything Western is better so loves shopping. The only two people who can stop her getting her own way are Nikolai's two daughters, like their father Ukrainian immigrants who have long since become law-abiding British citizens. Despite their best efforts their father marries Valentina. The new wife bullies her elderly husband both physically and psychologically until the two daughters finally convince their father to petition for divorce.The younger daughter, Nadezhda, was born at the end of WWII unlike her sister Vera who was born at the beginning. Nadezhda reminisces about Ukraine and ponders the country's tragic history: the famine, Nazi occupation, Stalin's purges whereas Vera prefers to try and bury the past. These tragic real events are in stark contrast with the fictional and somewhat grotesque main plot. Lewycka succeeds in creating some comic situations but the characters are all mere caricatures. Valentina's enormous breasts, her passion for green satin underwear and her dislike of cooking are all mentioned a number of times and so heavily exploited. She is more a mannequin than someone real. The old man is almost always seen in pyjamas or naked, as a symbol of the impotence of old age. Interspersed throughout the novel Nikolai reads aloud from the manuscript that he is writing about the history of tractors, hence the title of the novel.I found this an amusing novel, (I smiled on occasions rather than laughed out loud), and a mildly interesting diversion but probably not one that will live long in the memory and as such it was a bit of a disappointment.",0,0.9583,0.079,0.805,0.116,0.4246194083694083,NEGATIVE,0.6394

So I had to ask myself what is it about this book that appealed so much to me?I thinks it's because the characters and their behavior are familiar no matter what country you're in or from. The father acts exactly like many fathers do. Marry again, someone younger, delude himself a bit that maybe a little bit of action will come his way. Ultimately pouring his time and effort into something that didn't involve anyone in the family - writing about a piece of farm equipment as his way of both coping and validating his existence. Kind of the garage or man cave equivalent of escaping from reality and complications from the women in his life.The daughters up in arms about the new wife, her motivations, suddenly defensive of a father they left a long ways behind them. Even working to overcome their hostilities toward each other to present a united front and coordinate tactics designed to circumvent the intentions of both the father and his new ""paramour"". Neither of them particularly interested in the needs or the loneliness of their father in the fight to protect him from a woman they feel is there to take him for his money while earning legal status in the country. I feel the book is pretty realistic in it's portrayal of the characters. It demonstrates their motivations without lengthy descriptions or back stories. It shows how they never listened to their father or considered that he was aware of the new woman's motivations. The larger tragedy here was his obvious and unaddressed loneliness.It is faster paced than I expected and had some pretty funny lines like, ""Valentina’s superior breasts are evidently for display purposes only."" While you wouldn't want any of them for your relatives, you likely have a few. You know, the ones that come out to see what they can get after someone dies, the ones who gossip and instigate unrest within the family, the ones who create drama from dust, the ones you don't even know until some tragedy befalls the clan.I don't need to like the characters to appreciate the writing. I'm not sure it's the author's role to make us like the characters, especially when they aren't intended to be liked.In all, for me, it was more humorous than uncomfortable.

She proceeds to treat him with anything but love and eventually his two adult daughters step in to get rid of her. I found it impossible to laugh at the idea of an old man reduced to living in one room of his house, soiling himself with fear and generally being treated like crap by a greedy woman using and abusing him. The undertones of commentary about life in Russia in the old days and the fear people had of authority were lost on me and I cringed for the old man I wanted to reach into the pages and rip the throat of Valentina (the scheming tart) open. The relationship between the sisters – the War Baby and the Peace Baby is interesting but also rather frustrating. The older sister was born during WWII and the second sister once the family had settled in Britain. Sadly, even they treat each other in a way that made me feel uncomfortable. 2 years before the book starts the older sister cons the dying mother to leave her more money that the younger sister. This for me in unforgivable and I found it hard to get past it. Everything she said and did from there on in was tainted for me. My inability to get over the issues of mistreatment and abuse is maybe more of a comment on me than on the book.

I can see why it might seem so in print, but in the audiobook they were quite well-defined (quibble though that Vera and Valentina were kind of similar sounding names, so I got them a bit confused at times). Since we see the action through the point-of-view of the younger daughter Nadia, naturally we're going to find the sister she dislikes (or at least resents) offputting; at least until the full story comes out later in the book. Nadia is a bit of a put-upon mouse at first, but comes into her own as well. Valentina may be scheming and materialistic, but a golden opportunity was thrust at her, so no surprise she took it! Their father did, indeed, put himself into the mess, but he did so much for the family over the years (as becomes evident later), that I could forgive him a well-intentioned idea (""rescuing"" a Ukrainian woman and her son) gone horribly wrong. The book's not perfect - for one thing, I found the War years details clunkily done, awkward to get through. No spoiler, but the later developments were a bit much also: one key player comes to England as part of a long-term conference/training scheme ... yet speaks no English! Still, the farce helps balance out the more serious details of the family's painful past.I'm not certain I would be giving the print version such a high rating, but the narrator hit a home run with the material as far as I'm concerned. Loathsome though Valentina behaved throughout, I looked forward to her scenes as Thomas laid on the Ukrainian accent and broken English for maximum comic effect.

I was taken in by the clever title and the glowing reviews: international bestseller, translated into 27 langauges, listings for several prizes, recommended by Margaret Drabble. This book certainly has its moments. It is set among the British-Ukrainian community of Petersborough (how's *that* for local color?). The novel focuses on the relationship between two adult daughters and their elderly widowed father. Their life is disrupted when he announces that he is getting married to Valentina, a 36-year-old blonde, buxom Ukrainian woman, who is clearly just trying to get a British passport. They try to block the marriage, but their father is determined and Valentina proves to be more of a challenge than they expected. Through the course of the novel the two estranged sisters are united by this common enemy, and the younger sister (a left-wing teacher of sociology at the local polytechnic) learns more about her family history. In a broader scope, the novel tells the story of the Ukraine. The father (and his departed wife) represent the older Ukraine, the generation that suffered through revolution and war. The older sister was born during World War II and experienced some of this suffering before coming to the US. The younger sister belongs to the post-war generation and has no direct connection to this older Ukraine. Both sisters reflect different ways of being British.

It's not a bad book, and the writing lets you be in the place and time the author is talking about; I also am impressed by the way Lewycka is able to keep the focus on a combination of the way Valentina disrupts the family and the family history, and not get bogged down in details of the narrator's home life and work life; and yet, I think if there had been a little more of that, I might have felt more connected to Nadezhda than I did. Also, and I probably don't need to mention this since it's rather par for the course for the human race, but the speciesism in the book is annoying.

Nadia's father is maneuvered into marrying a voluptuous, large-breasted Ukranian, Valentina who seeking to escape to the west and live off his money. Of course things do not work out, and the book spends most its time with how the sisters try to dislodge Valentina.

The story also takes a number of flashbacks, to when Nikolai (their father) and Ludmilla (their mother) were younger and enduring horrific treatment in the second World War. In my opinion, it is their father Nikolai which makes the novel so great. I did actually find him funny, although it must be a matter of personal taste as I have read many reviews on here which didn't. I loved his dramatic political opinions and eccentric, almost arrogant views of him ""saving"" Valentina. He is a coward, but the author makes no pretenses of this, and he essentially becomes the anti-hero of the novel. I was also intrigued by the different ideologies expressed in the book- Vera being a typical right-wing Conservative and Nadia being a left-wing liberal- and the way these were contrasted with the typical opposing ideologies of WWII- the extremes of fascist right and communist left.

272,3713004061,12/24/2020,4.0,"How I laughedReading some of the reviews here, this book appears to have upset quite a few people. People seem to think that either it trivialises the abuse of old people … or that the tractor story is irrelevant … or that the characters are unlikable or vacuous or just plain nasty, or – and this seems to be the main criticism – that it is a comic novel that just isn’t funny.To take the last point first: I disagree. I giggled a lot reading this, something I don’t often do, less than I used to, anyway. (Which says more about me, and less about any possible deterioration in the quality of comic fiction, for which I indeed have no evidence, but do know that my sense of humour isn’t what it used to be – LOL, er, not). It. Was. Funny. I laughed at Vera’s hoighty-toitiness, cleverly and wittily contrasted with Nadia’s self-mockery. I laughed out loud at the bitch fight between Nadia and Valentina (the green satin bra symbolising the narrator’s searingly honest breast envy, and humour can be rooted in self-hatred, often is, in fact. It is sad that women are judged on the size of their breasts, but it is also ridiculously funny, in a way, because breast size patently is not related to worth (only to self-worth). No, breast size is only related to, well, the size of your breasts). I giggled every time the words “Crap car” cropped up, because it reminded me of how gauche phrasing by children (or, in this case, foreign people trying to sound like natives, so in both cases, people unexpert in a language) can become catchphrases in families, and how natural it is for people to use humour as a way of bonding. (The crap car was an old Rover, but, like many other things that did not meet with Valentina’s comically and unrealistically high expectations, came to be dismissed with a cursory, snide, funny comment). Much of the humour indeed is derived from Valentina’s brutal honesty, which contrasts so starkly with the indirect way in which the English middle classes communicate. Valentina is so outrageous because she is so different – the irony being that the sisters, who are her complicit adversaries, share her nationality (and Ukrainian language), but virtually none of her traits, having lived in England virtually all of their lives.Beneath, and in some cases behind the comedy, is tragedy (also not an uncommon source of comic material). The tractor story of the title for me is there to show how great and successful a nation the Ukraine could have been, if successive (foreign grown) dictatorships hadn’t so hideously and disastrously intervened. The Ukraine was – and I believe still is – a rich, blessed, agricultural grain belt, and could, with its talented engineering history, if it had been left to its own devices, not only have easily looked after its own food production, but also become prosperous by exporting agricultural know-how and hardware to the rest of the world. Instead, patents were stolen, money for investment was lacking, and dreadful and murderous dictators forged other diabolical plans for themselves and at everyone else’s expense, which stole the potential for self-determination from millions of good, able, worthy, honest people. The greater horrors here were of course perpetrated by Stalin and Hitler, and if there is a grudge in this book, it is the idea that Brits have no idea about suffering under foreign occupation, and so tend to feel little sympathy for those that do. (“ ‘We’ defended ourselves, fought them on the beaches.” Etc, etc. “Yeah? You personally did that? Or are you just lucky that someone else did it, to a considerable extent, for you – Churchill’s main aim in WW2 was to make sure that the Eastern front and the Soviets took the brunt of the military horror (and the casualties), to avoid a repeat of the WW1 trenches he had witnessed, which were, admittedly, a nadir of human history, worse even than Stalingrad, which most historians view as the turning point of WW2, won, of course by the Soviets)? And what about that other nadir of military – and any other sort of – history that were the concentration camps (one of which the family in the novel survived, but at huge emotional cost)? Nope, thought so, not a single Brit was an inmate there. Reviewers who here brush this blackest piece of all European history aside with a flippant shrug should spend a day in the Holocaust Museum in Berlin, or Dachau, or Auschwitz, of course.Next point: I don’t think that the novel trivializes the abuse of old people. The sisters, although keen to save their father, repeatedly say that they are saving him less from Valentina, and more from his own folly and vanity. And I think that they are right. He, Nikolai, has put himself in this situation. He made the choices. I personally am a little sick of the argument that people are always victims. What has become of agency, and taking responsibility for our actions?As to the characters being nasty or vacuous, well, nastiness can be funny, very funny. Valentina is nasty because circumstances made her so. I laughed at her coarse language, at her absurd demands and her gobsmacking presumptuousness and outrageous sense of entitlement. I laughed at Vera’s airs and graces and at Nadia’s self-flagellation and political volte-faces. (When worlds fall apart, and liberals admit to themselves that immigration for all is fine – until it affects you – well, that is funny, or rather, Nadia’s depiction of herself is: especially when she suddenly realises that she is assuming what had hitherto been her elder sister Vera’s role of “Mrs. Flog-’em-and-send-’em-home”.Which brings me to my final point about why I liked this book. It takes a burning and seriously important and controversial issue of our times – immigration – and gleans humour from it, and, here’s the point, doesn’t trivialise it. Neither, though, does it really come up with solutions to it. (I mean, seriously, this is a comic novel. Is it supposed to solve global problems, as well as make us laugh?).

Always was, always will be. Nature seeks to redress imbalances; poor people will always gravitate to richer areas (leaving aside the morality of that). It. Happens. And as long as it does, cases will have to be looked at individually, blanket judgements about who should stay and who should go, based on race or nationality (as was so often the case during the war, the life and fucking death basis of decisions, are pointless (as well as monstrously unjust.
