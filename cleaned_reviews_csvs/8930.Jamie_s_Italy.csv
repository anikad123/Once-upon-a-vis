1,104229512,05/25/2010,4.0,"My grandparents came from Sicily and most of the dishes in this book are the dishes I grew up cooking and eating. These are the dishes I just throw together from habit not from a recipe. But there were two recipes in this book that I decided to try and they were both OUTRAGEOUSLY delicious! They were so good that I could not believe that I cooked them. The first one I tried was the pasta with anchovies in tomato sauce. It took 3 different pans but it was simple to prepare and had me almost howling with pleasure. Then I tried the bruschette with eggplant and mint. OMG!!! So simple, so delicious. This will be a recipe that I prepare weekly this summer.I've only seen Jamie Oliver on television one time so I was not that familar with him or his cooking...but now I am sold, I am a fan. I really like the layout of this book, I like his philosophy on cooking, and I like the simplicity of his style.Funny story to go along with this review. One day my sister said she didn't understand why anyone would want to go out to eat Italian food, because she said, you eat it so often at home why would you want to eat it at a resturarnt?! She really didn't understand that not everyone eats this food on an almost daily basis. lolSome family favorites featured in this cookbook are 1. caponata....this is the bread and butter or chips and salsa of the Scilian diet. No family get together is complete without it; 2. pasta alla Norma...I didn't know this dish had a name. It's just always been pasta with eggplant at my house...but a rose is still rose; and 3. my favorite ribollita...again another dish I did not know the name of, I make this without the fennel and use (veggie for me) Italian sausage instead. It's a wonderful dish that really hits the spot on a cold rainy spring day.If you are looking for a cookbook full of authentic real life recipes, this is it! If you are looking for a cookbook with dishes full of the WOW factor, this is it too. I'm picking up another Jamie Oliver at the library tonight.",3,0.9937,0.016,0.852,0.132,0.5691391941391942,POSITIVE,0.9995
2,46319579,02/14/2009,5.0,"This is one of my favorite cookbooks, surprisingly written by a non-Italian. Jamie Oliver immerses himself in the Italian culture and brings out the best parts of their cooking...simply prepared foods made with the best and freshest ingredients.

I mean, once you've got your bearings in the kitchen, you can probably sort it out, but if you're a new cook you might be intimidated by this ""cooking by feel"" method. However, I mainly checked this one out of the library for the amazing-looking Italian pizzas, and I'm looking forward to trying some of his unusual ingredient pairings. Plus baking your own pizza is cheap yet impressive. (Just gotta find me a damn marble slab... gah!)Oh: If you like Jamie, I would also highly recommend his iPhone/iPod Touch app. It's only $4.99, and totally worth it for the videos that'll teach you how to not be afraid of buying (and eating) fish, and how to work your knife skills, and that kind of thing, along with some of his fast, fresh recipes.

I previewed this via the library and fortunately so, because I already have most of these recipes, or close enough. But if this will be your first, second, or third Italian book, it could still be quite worthwhile and the instructions are straightforward with plenty of photos. It does seem to be about 50% Sicilian, which isn't what everyone expects from an Italian cookbook. A recipe for fresh tuna meatballs in tomato sauce inspired me to check this book out, but the dish is also on his website. The other new ideas were roasted squash with cinnamon and chile and a sort of spumoni rice pudding. A $35 cover price requires a little more, however. Some of the photos will be offputting to some.

I'd also highly recommend it as this is from a chef who is not only trained in the Italian way of cooking by Italians, but wrote the book, and discovered many of the recipes, because he went to Italy and bothered to look beyond pizza and pasta (though both are included) and talk to people at markets, in their homes, and in small local places.

I must admit that even though I can see the effort put into the recipes, not a lot of them are of my taste, but that's a personal preference. I loved the stories told in the book, as well as the general tips on Italian cooking. To me, those stories and tips were of more merit than the recipes themselves. The photos are gorgeous, and the dishes look well put together. The only true downside I found was the inconsistency of measurements. A lot of others have mentioned that Oliver uses a lot of non-specific measurements, which can be hard to understand. One recipe asked for a glass of wine, and even though I understand how much liquid this would be - roughly, I admit - it would have been better to write it out, in my honest opinion.",0,0.9887,0.025,0.731,0.244,0.5527777777777778,POSITIVE,0.9998
