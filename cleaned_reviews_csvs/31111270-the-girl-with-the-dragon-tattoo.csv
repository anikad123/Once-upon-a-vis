2,63222455,07/12/2009,1.0,"I really don't understand the critical orgasms over this book. Amazon pushed it on me for weeks, and the minute I stepped into Borders an employee ran over and recommended it. Thinking, this really better be the best book I've ever read, I took it up to the checkstand, where the register guy asked: ""Did one of our employees recommend this?"" Um, yeah. And Amazon, too. So of course I asked him why. ""Oh,"" he replied, ""we've been told to recommend it this week."" That should have tipped me off right there: recommendations handed down by management. Pfft. I hesitate to suggest a conspiracy, but - did someone end up with too many of these in a warehouse in Duluth? Did Oprah make a bet with someone that she could pull strings and make the most boring book in the world a best seller?But I am suckered in by numerous good reviews and a fairly interesting book jacket description, so I buy it and take it with me on a trip camping with my family. Of course it totally sucks. I'm kicking myself because I feel like I really should have known. But the reviews - ALL the reviews - are absolutely positive from generally reliable sources, so I just DO. NOT. UNDERSTAND.Here's why I don't like it: I am about a third of the way into it, and literally hundreds of characters have been introduced. NOT ONE of them has done anything interesting, so I am finding it nearly impossible to keep them straight. I am the type that will be more or less satisfied reading the back of a cereal box, but this is BAD. I mean bad. The mystery is dull. The who done it is more like a who cares. The two primary characters are so far not very likable at all - in fact, the review descriptions are more interesting than the book descriptions of them. I'm betting part of the problem is the translation, presumably - but god, there is just some boring writing in here, too. ""He went to the store. He bought milk. He was cold. He went home."" - BOR-RING! I am not really exaggerating, either. Actual content:""He put on a pot of coffee and made himself two sandwiches. He had not eaten a proper meal all day, but he was strangely uninterested in food. he offered the cat a piece of sausage and some liverwurst. After drinking the coffee, he took the cigarettes out of his jacket pocket and opened the pack.""Again, I'm willing to give the author the benefit of the doubt with the translating, but I wouldn't have gotten out of high school writing with that kind of boring and utterly pointless description. It sets the tone of ""lonely dude being lonely"" but really: two sandwiches? why two? sausage and liverwurst - fascinating.That's really just a page I opened to randomly - there is much worse. I am truly bitterly resentful of every minute I am stuck on the side of this mountain without a good book to read. I'm ready to browse the mini mart down the way and read the real estate magazines instead. Why have all the reviewers and Amazon steered me SO WRONG???I am not trying to insult anyone's taste - so please don't get mad about my opinion. But if you love this book, please - tell me WHY.

I could talk about this book all day without breathing pauses and I’d still not finish everything I want to say about it.
4.45/5 ⭐ for this one because I couldn't convince myself to give it 5 stars, no idea why though.Full review on my Blog: The Dacian She-Wolf 🐺



“I’d reckon you’d bite off my hand if I laid a finger on you”.

As Dragan Armansky felt in that particular moment about Lisbeth Salander, I felt that about her the whole book. And I must say that I liked feeling that way about her. That means that she has some sort of wilderness in her personality that makes her so interesting, not only as a character but also as a possible real-life person.The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo made me ascend through different stages while reading it. I rarely find a book like this one, to make me feel all sorts of feelings towards it, from all the levels of human sensitivity in thinking. If I’d have to layer the stages of my process of reading this book, probably it would go like this:1)	Level 1: Confusion 	I was extremely confused with the beginning. I think I had to read it at least five times to actually get a grip of the story in the beginning. Maybe it is because I was briefly introduced in the middle of a scene with unknown characters and undiscovered plot. I don’t know, but I had a hard time with it anyway.2)	Level 2: Boredom 	I’ve had a hard time convincing myself that this book deserves to be read because of the epic state of boredom that I encountered. I spent two hours reading without stopping only to find out I’ve made only 4% progress (yes, I read it on my tablet because I don’t have enough finances to buy all the books I want and also survive as a student who is away from home and also likes to eat). I kept asking myself what was this bug of boredom that I had and then…it hit me. TOO MUCH ECONOMIC TALK. As a student at the Academy of Economic Studies, my interest should’ve been aroused. Even more – as I study Business Administration, all the business talk should be some delicious dessert for me. But NA-AH. I am bored enough by the countless hours of business terminology, ideology and any other –ology that shit implies, I don’t need to read about it in my spare time too. But hey, why not creeping some of that ish in my casual reading to keep the brain on its right track of self-destruction, ceteris paribus?3)	Level 3: Spark of interest 	After about 100 pages (I reckon even more) something started working for me. The mystery started to crawl at the surface so I could see and touch it and also expect more and more. Then, the author added some interesting family dirt (that I absolutely love, don’t judge me, I have a weird family too, amazingly weird, if I may add, but still weird) and also some World War 2 references (all these besides the actual mystery of Harriet Vagner’s disappearance and also possible murder). I don’t know what happened from that moment on, but it started being good. Like really good. It’s just…you can feel the mystery, especially because the book gives you almost 0.1 details about the possible murder. Your inner Miss Marple must be intrigued. Mine was for sure. 4)	Level 4: Outrage and disgust  	Since now, I haven’t talked much about the eponym of the book, right? Well, let me talk then. 
Lisbeth Salander
. And the surely nauseous manner in which she was treated. How do you expect anyone with at least a bit of empathy and humanity not to be OUTRAGED and DISGUSTED by the rape scenes which Lisbeth has been put through? It is absolutely indisputable, morally wrong and socially disgraceful. I am going to be very mean and very direct and I am going to ask a question: What level of psychical constipation do you need to have to pursue such an abominable act? Yeah, those passages made me very sick. And very sad. Truly. I felt nauseous after all. But then…5)	Level 5: ‘She’s a f-ing genius-arse boss and I’m here for it’ 	Lisbeth Salander is a bloody queen and you can’t make me change my mind even with an AK-47 glued on my temple. She’s ice cold, but she’s breathing fire. She’s the fool of the village, but she’s the hero of the nation. She’s invisible, but she’s not transparent. The way she seems not to care about anything that may interfere with her principles and also the way she cares about things but never speak them up is just so her, so part of the true individual she is, even though she might look unrealistic constructed. You do you, girl. You do you.The fact that, until the middle of the book, Salander and Blomkvist didn’t meet and also ‘the girl with the dragon tattoo’ was reduced only to a few scenes made me question my reading choice. I was on board only for Salander, because she captured my interest from the first time she appeared in scene. But then, Pippi Longstocking and Kalle Blomkvist merged together and gave life to this fabulous Swedish detective dream team and I was down for it. Talking about the characters of the book, the female characters were such badass women it felt so good reading about them (super businesswomen taking over multinational companies? Yeah, okay, sign me up). I couldn’t feel any real connection towards the male characters however, except for Mikael Blomkvist. Even though he is a lousy father and husband and he has some shaky ethics in life, he is definitely a good man by his nature. Yes, he has his own issues, but who doesn’t? Yes, he was having a not so secret love affair with his best friend and business partner, Erika Berger, but as long as they didn’t make a secret out of it and people in their lives accepted it, I can’t say that it is that punishable. And, also, because we are still on the topic: Erika Berger. I absolutely loved her. She is a witty businesswoman, with a lot of gut and a lot of cold blood to make decisions and to run her own world. She’s a strong woman who makes her own living out of her own life and enjoys it as it is, never letting anyone getting to her with some second-hand crap.But. The most important character of all, the one that I absolutely loved beyond any other character is…ladies and gentlemen…*drum rolls*…yes, you're right, Lisbeth Salander! I can’t tell you why I feel this way about Salander, but she was my absolute favourite since the very first moment I met her. The passive way that she adopted, the cold feelings that she spread, the taciturn nature and her absolutely killer mind just had me on board. Everyone saw Salander as a victim of society, but I felt that was wrong. I have never had that feeling about her. She always inspired me survival. She was a fighter by nature and fighters always survive. And this is how Salander made her way through life. Also, let’s be honest now, she has a killer T-Shirt taste, like seriously badass (see ‘Armageddon was yesterday, today we have a serious problem’ and ‘I can be a regular bitch. Just try me’).In conclusion, this book gave me such a hard time I cannot explain, but it was also a really good book that I might consider as one of my own personal favourites. Also, as a side note: has anyone notice how much coffee do those people drink?? Or is just me?All in all people, good reading!

5,72364343,09/24/2009,4.0,"Women are raised to routinely fear rape.“If you go at night, take a friend.” “Check under the car and in your backseat before you get in.” “I’m just saying it’s a good idea to know where the exits are.” “I got you this whistle for your keychain, you know, just so you have it.” “You were an hour later than I thought you’d be! We called the police!” “Oh, that’s pepper spray; I keep it with me just in case.” “I just make sure I get my keys out and check for other weapons if I’m getting off work late.” “Is this weird? I live alone and I’m going running, so if I don’t call you by 11:15, call the police, okay?”A woman who fights back – no, a woman who argues at all – does so knowing it will probably make her a social pariah. “She’s just one of those women who makes life hell . . . like a Hillary Clinton type.” “You’re different; you’re not a ball buster like some girls.” “You know that rape accusations can destroy a man’s life, right? And when she said it, did you see how she looked? I mean . . .” “All girls do is complain and nag. Not you, of course – most girls.” “But it is really women who are the privileged ones to be covered and cared for by the man; all of the responsibility for decisions are on him.” “He didn’t mean it the way it sounded, so you'll just regret it if you tell him he's wrong.” “She never understood me, and now she’s making all of these claims and trying to take practically half of my paycheck. I think she was just in it for the money in the first place.” “All I said was she has a nice rack; what a bitch.” “That’s just life; make the best of it.” And there is good reason we are raised to fear rape, and raised not to fight back: survival. Women know that if we walk alone in the dark, statistically there is a good chance we will get raped. If we go to the wrong party, we’ll be raped. If we misread that boy next door and his swellness is a con, rape. And when a person is in a position of being systematically controlled, it often does cause more physical or emotional damage to fight back. It’s not right, but it is realistic. It seems to me like it is the equivalent of every man being raised that if he leaves the house at the wrong time, he might encounter a woman who will strip him naked, hold him down, and knee him in the balls while she masturbates. And then in this alternate universe, these boys find out, as they grow up, that most of the men they know have had that happen to them. And I’m not trying to minimize sexual assault experiences that involve little or no physical injury, nor am I trying to minimize sexual assaults against men: no one has the right to touch another person’s body without permission. I’m talking about the way women are raised to think of daily life. Women are not raised to be afraid we’re going to get a super hot BJ that we didn’t realize we wanted, which is sometimes how I feel people talk about rape accusations. We are raised to encounter our daily lives knowing that, even if violence wasn't in our past, violence probably is in our future. And every time someone says, “Don’t go alone,” it is a little reminder that a lot of men hate us.I have to say, though, that while I think it is realistic to say that women are raised to fear rape and to incorporate that fear of rape into our daily routine, and that sometimes fighting back makes things more dangerous, I do not believe it is effective to live in fear or to encourage women to live in fear or not defend ourselves. I think that perpetuates an idea that women are powerless, which then encourages women to freeze up when encountered with violence or even conflict. I think trusting our instincts and learning martial arts is probably more productive. And teaching men not to rape.That seems like the approach this book takes, though it more directly simply reflects, with appropriate outrage, on the levels of male contempt for women. And I think in that way, in the way it is directed to men, it is about how gross contempt for women is, whether it takes the form of self-absorption or sadism.This book is smart. It is symmetrical in its execution in many ways: in starting and ending with Blomkvist’s corporate corruption story, and in the way it shows men and women accused of race whoring, men and women subjected to violence. The juxtaposition of (view spoiler)[Salander’s rape with Blomkvist’s consensual sexual encounter with Cicilia (hide spoiler)] is really well played. It is viscerally grotesque in the contrast, and it highlights the theme of consent. It was physically difficult for me to read, especially in the contrast, and I thought that made it very effective.Salander’s character, too, is smart. She is both the outcast that women are when we fight back, and she is something of the misunderstood-bad-boy hero turned girl. I liked that. When she (view spoiler)[saves Blomkvist, it is all really vivid and heroic, but still corporeal and disgusting. I liked that Blomkvist couldn’t take charge because he was in too much shock, and that she truly saved his life (hide spoiler)]. It bothers me when a storyteller starts to let a girl save a guy, but really she only tosses him the gun to save himself. Salander gets some real action and some real credit, and it is satisfying. Ultimately, it is pretty clear, but not laughing in your face, just resigned, Larsson knows (view spoiler)[Blomkvist is a self-serving ass, too. It was so smart at the end when Blomkvist runs into his nemesis with a girl Salander’s age on his arm, and Blomkvist so despises him for it. I like how in the end our hero really isn’t our hero. He really has only used Salander, and how far is that from hating women? It is certainly not respectful (hide spoiler)]. The hatred we condemn in this book, though, manifests as violence, and I can get behind featuring that and then fading out to Cicilia’s father condemning her as a whore and Blomkvist’s blissful self-absorption. It is a meaningful gradation. But, it is important that (view spoiler)[Blomkvist isn’t the ideal model of men being friends with women because he would be too specific – because there probably isn’t an ideal model. Larsson doesn’t justify Blomkvist’s assholery, but he is not so in love with his hero that he can’t acknowledge it (hide spoiler)]. And, aren’t we all assholes to each other a lot of the time? But not all of us get off on kneeing each other in the balls.This struck me as a very masculine translation of male hatred of women and the way women navigate a world that tells us every time we turn a corner that it hates us. It seems like men either have considered what life would be like if they had been trained to fear leaving the house after dark, or they haven’t. And in my experience, it is difficult for men to understand a woman’s words if she tries to describe it, so I think it is important to have a man tell a story this way. I do see how the graphic descriptions of sadistic violence against women might allow a sadistic audience to read only for that, but the fact that Larsson balances this with graphic violence against men neutralizes the gender-hatred aspect of that to me. And if you are reading these books for the violence, see a psychiatrist, but I don’t think it is productive to censor descriptions of violence just because someone fucked up might get off on them. And if you think these descriptions are fantastical exaggerations, go spend some time at your local women’s shelter. Unfortunately, I think you will find you are wrong. And I don't think it does anybody any good to be afraid to tell these stories.I hated the writing in this book a lot. Like, I hated it a lot. It both hit a lot of pet peeves of mine and it was just objectively bad in a lot of places. I don’t have a problem with books being badly written if the writing doesn’t get in the way of a good story, but here the writing was waiving its hands in my face the whole time trying to get me to lose the story. The sandwiches! OH TEH SANDWICHES! I wonder how much tourism for Sweden Larsson drummed up by the sandwich descriptions. I hope none because gag. I can see how he created the effect of an investigatory report through the writing, so, I think it is intentionally the way it is, but it was a choice I did not enjoy at all. So, overall this was a very unpleasant book to read, but it was smart, and its smartness outweighed its unpleasantness in my evaluation.It is always kind of a funny experience to read your own words as someone else would write them. In every Willa Cather novel I have read, there has been a moment where I’ve read something and thought, “I just said that last week!!!” It was funny in Girl with the Dragon Tattoo: I wanted to high five Salander all the time because I would think her dialogue right before I read it. I imagine everyone in the world has told me to read this book because of the times I say, “Oh, another man who hates women.” Or that it is bullshit to say someone had a violent childhood, so of course he had to be violent against women as an adult. So, it was funny to read somebody else say those words. At the same time, Salander felt like a man recording the facts of what he saw a woman do and say once, not like a living, breathing human character. That doesn’t take away from the smartness of the book, but it is another reason my actual enjoyment factor was low.Also, I had to go buy pickles yesterday because reading about so many of them gave me a craving. I hope Larsson’s estate got some sponsorship money from the sandwich and pickle lobbies. ",384,-0.9993,0.174,0.71,0.115,0.5278216931216932,NEGATIVE,0.9997

The entire book sets you up to think that the alleged killing/s were perpetrated by one or more people for complicated reasons. Spoiler: They're not. A murderer, at the climax, reveals, ""I like killing [people]."" That's the motive. That's it. 2. The title character has her macabre past detailed at length. The salient facts to the case - how did she come into possession of her detective-ing skills? - is left out entirely. Her emotional life is ignored until it's needed for a little plot development and then ignored again for a gazillion pages. She makes Kinsey Milhoney look like a guru of emotional awareness and self-knowledge.3. When a MAJOR DEVELOPMENT happens in the case, like, THE MAJOR DEVELOPMENT, we the readers hear about its resolution third hand. A reunion occurs and we are not privvy to it, even though it's REALLY IMPORTANT. That is LAME.4. Stop with the Mac commericials aleady.

7,82081764,12/26/2009,3.0,"After having leaped onto the bandwagon with the rest of everyone, I feel a certain amount of pretentious indie pride saying that I wasn't as awed by this book as everyone else apparently was. Which is not to say that the book wasn't enjoyable and exciting; it just didn't knock my socks off whilst simultaneously blowing my mind and rocking my world. (that sounds like either some great song lyrics or a very complicated sexual maneuver. Let's go with the first option.)So, the good stuff: the main story - a disgraced journalist is hired by a rich old man to write a book about said man's crazy rich family, while secretly working to discover truth behind the disappearance and supposed murder of the man's granddaughter. Also in play is Lisbeth Salander, a freelance investigator who also happens to be one of the best hackers in Sweden. She also happens to be made of awesome, but I'll get to that later. The journalist is investigating a supposed murder (a body was never found, so no one even knows what happened to the girl), so violence is expected. I just wasn't quite prepared for just how intensely graphic the violence is. There's a lot of stuff dealing with assault, rape, and murder of various women. There is also a lot of sex in the book, and the stuff that gets described in the most detail is definitely not consensual and will probably make you very uncomfortable. You've been warned. The investigation itself is pretty fascinating, implausible as it is that some random guy investigating a disappearance that took place 40 years ago was able to find out completely new leads that weren't found by the police or the girl's grandfather (who's been obsessing about the case since forever), but I digress. The family itself is equal parts interesting, creepy, and frustrating. It's not until the journalist (Blomkvist) teams up with Lisbeth that things get really interesting, and they made such a fun team I wanted them to get their own detective show. The book deals mainly with crimes against women and those who commit them. Larsson obviously feels very passionately about this subject, as well as what should be done with the men who assault women. Without giving anything away, rest assured that every bad guy rapist/murderer/whatever gets a large helping of tasty justice. And now for the bad stuff: -There's a lot of nattering on about business and computers and journalism and more business stuff that either bored me or went over my head completely. -Larsson cannot seem to decide whether he wants to refer to people by their last name or their first name, so he switches back and forth and it is confusing. -A family tree is provided at the beginning of the book, since the family the journalist is investigating (the Vangers) is pretty big, but I never had much trouble keeping everyone straight. A map of the island the family compound is located on would have been much more helpful, since I never really figured out the geography of the place. -Pointless details. I don't need to know what the characters ate for every single meal, I don't need to know exactly what model of computer/motorcycle/car a character uses, and I definitely don't need to know what each character is wearing at every moment of the day. Larsson is especially guilty of this when Lisbeth is concerned - I guess he decided we wouldn't understand what a unique counterculture tough chick she is unless we know that she's always wearing leather jackets, boots, torn jeans, and black t-shirts with angry slogans. (yes, Larsson actually tells us what each of Lisbeth's t-shirts says.) Listen, Stieg: Lisbeth is awesome. She is wonderfully defined simply through her own actions and thoughts - we don't even need the other characters constantly reminding us how antisocial and tough and uncommunicative and badass she is. Believe me, we can see that. Show don't tell etc. To sum up, I'm going to give the last word to the book itself, and quote a sentence that's actually a character talking about a book featured towards the end of the story - but it could easily describe Larsson's book:""It was uneven stylistically, and in places the writing was actually rather poor - there had been no time for any fine polishing - but the book was animated by a fury that no reader could help but notice."" That, in a nutshell, was how I felt about The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.UPDATE: I just watched the film version of this book (the original Swedish one, thank you verra much), and am adding this to my ""the movie is better"" shelf. Not that the book isn't good; it's just that the movie streamlines the story and gets rid of everything I complained about earlier in this review. In the movie, all the minor characters and business-drama babble has been eliminated, Erika and Mikael's weird three-way relationship is thankfully unmentioned, Mikael never boffs Cecilia Vanger, and Noomi Rapace is so fucking cool as Lisbeth I can't even handle it. I'm also pretty sure they took some stuff from The Girl Who Played With Fire and put it in the movie, because there's some stuff about Lisbeth's past that I don't remember from the book. UPDATE UPDATE: Having now seen the American remake, and re-watched the Swedish version, I have come to a following decision. While the American version is, in a technical sense, a better movie (Fincher is a much better director - for just one example, the scene where Henrik Vanger explains the circumstances of Harriet's disappearance is a masterful example of show-don't-tell), I dislike the changes they made to the ending, and I simply cannot accept Rooney Mara as Lisbeth. Although I'm proud of Fincher & Co. for making her look and act as weird as the character should, something about her portrayal still wasn't right. If you're interested, this article explains pretty much every complaint I have about American Lisbeth.",317,0.9389,0.12,0.742,0.138,0.5286818884164018,NEGATIVE,0.9895

Although, now I have to switch from dvd to blu-ray! I also have a couple of different copies of the books! Lisbeth Salander is just freaking awesome.

There are other things going on in the book but the main story line is about an uncle wanting to find out what happened to his niece, Harriet. He ends up hiring Mikael Blomkvist to find out what happened. Then Mikael gets lucky to have Lisbeth help him. Do these two find out some secrets! Mikael almost gets killed a time or two. Makes you wonder what all they are hiding! And of course, it's a big ole nasty secret. Why am I not surprised. It was just as hard to read about the second time around. Of course, there were other scenes that I had to skim through again, but I digress. If you haven't wandered into the world that is Lisbeth Salander, what are you waiting for? And try and watch the movie trilogy. They used to have it on Netflix, that is where I originally watched them and then went straight to Amazon to buy them. Yes, they are that good as well as the books. Happy Reading!Mel ❤️",293,0.9674,0.093,0.74,0.168,0.6546466973886329,POSITIVE,0.9983
9,54461951,04/30/2009,4.0,"The original Swedish title of this book is ""Men Who Hate Women."" If you ask me, it suits this story much better than catchier but less relevant ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,"" because it is in fact about men doing all kinds of horrid things to women. So here is the first warning to you, if you don't handle violence against women and children well, skip this novel. It's hard to give a short synopsis of the book. ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" starts off as an investigation of a 40-year old disappearance of a teenage heiress, but gradually morphs into a tale of serial murder and corporate trickery spanning several continents and later takes in complicated international financial fraud and the buried evil past of a wealthy Swedish industrial family.I found this book extremely engaging and full of action and came to regret many times that I had an audio version instead of a regular paper book. I also enjoyed immensely the amount details about everything - the publishing business, twisted Swedish family, corporate crime, history and political order of Sweden, etc. I am guessing if you don't care to read about any of this subjects, this book is not for you, because it is packed with this information.My only qualm about this book, a small one, was the characterization. The character of Mikael Blomkvist smelled of a male wish fulfillment fantasy, the one where a man is adored by all women, gets laid all the time and always gets lauded for his stellar bedroom skills. Lisbeth Salander also felt a little shaky and I thought Asberger's decease didn't quite account for her strange personality. I thought her antisocial behavior was inconsistent. This however didn't spoil my reading experience. I am eager to move on to ""The Girl Who Played with Fire"" and see what Mikael and Lisbeth are up to next.

10,3054888726,01/05/2020,5.0,"2019 review: An aging industrialist is looking to solve the riddle of a lifetime, looking to uncover a mystery from decades ago. He takes on a journalist with a honourable heart, and a record of trying to take on the dark-side of corporate Sweden; and then there's the diminutive, asocial, delinquent and frankly dangerous girl with a tattoo; chance, fate, destiny who knows, but somehow these two very determined and very stubborn people are brought together with this mystery to solve.On third(!) reading. I found this still the greatest modern crime fiction I've ever read. Some of the most complex and multi-faceted characterisations ever printed; simply one of the most assured, dynamic and breath taking debuts of a female character... Lizbeth, who is an astoundingly real and beautiful creation; the story itself may have a bit too much detail for some, but Blomkvist is an investigative journalist and we get so much payback for the initial first 100-pages+ financial shenanigans' detail, as the book progresses. And on a personal note the uncompromising overview on how many men and society itself treat women is integral; it is so important and essential to this read, and is done in such a way that it is not rammed down our throats; and I love even more the totally uncompromising, there are no grey areas' view of Lizbeth on this issue too. For me, this will always be such an immensely satisfying read :)My 2009 review: 'The best crime story I have ever read.

Aided by a tattooed, antisocial hacker named Lisabeth Salander, Blomkvist unearths horrible skeletons lurking in the Vanger family closet...For a few years now, I've been avoiding The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Since so many people told me I just had to read it, many of them non-readers, I assumed it was a lot of over-hyped, dumbed-down crap. Well, I may have been wrong. All hype aside, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a damn good book and I feel it goes beyond just being a mystery.Larsson creates some memorable characters. We've got Mikael Blomkvist, the tarnished journalist, Lisabeth Salander, bad ass hacker, for the leads, both multidimensional characters. Neither are by any means perfect but I liked them just the same. The Vanger family and the staff of the Millennium aren't as well drawn as the leads but Ericka Berger and some of the Vangers are good characters in their own right.I'll be honest. It took a little while for me to get moving but I was enthralled pretty early on. You wouldn't have thought I'd be that interesting in what could have been a tedious subject to read about, namely researching family archives for hints. Somehow Larsson managed to grab me, though.There isn't a lot of violence but what there is is pretty brutal. The hacking was pretty well done and not completely unbelievable. I guess what really sold the book for me was that I really believed in the characters. Both of them are pretty flawed but completely believable.I'd be lying if I said I didn't have a some complaints. Aside from the pace, I felt like Larsson threw in some needless details. I didn't need to know the brands of a lot of products or what the characters were eating. I also thought that Mikael Blomkvist being a sort of James Bond in regard to the ladies was a tad unbelievable. Honestly, those are my only two complaints I can think of at the moment.The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo deserves a lot of the hype it gets. Now go out and read it if you haven't already!Edit: I'm marking this down because I'm reading In the Woods and enjoying it more than I enjoyed this.

13,631531159,06/02/2013,4.0,"Män Som Hatar Kvinnor = Men Who Hate Women = The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Millennium, #1), Stieg LarssonThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, is a psychological thriller novel by Swedish author and journalist Stieg Larsson (1954–2004), which was published posthumously in 2005 to become an international bestseller. It is the first book of the Millennium series. In December 2002, Mikael Blomkvist, publisher of the Swedish political magazine Millennium, loses a libel case involving allegations about billionaire industrialist Hans-Erik Wennerström. Blomkvist is sentenced to three months (deferred) in prison, and ordered to pay hefty damages and costs. Soon afterwards, he is invited to meet Henrik Vanger, the retired CEO of the Vanger Corporation, unaware that Vanger has checked into his personal and professional history; the investigation of Blomkvist's circumstances has been carried out by Lisbeth Salander, a brilliant but deeply troubled researcher and computer hacker. Vanger promises to provide Blomkvist with evidence against Wennerström in return for discovering what happened to Vanger's grandniece, Harriet, who disappeared in 1966 during a family gathering at the Vanger estate on Hedeby Island, when the island was temporarily cut off from the mainland by a traffic accident on the bridge. Blomkvist moves to the island and begins to research the Vanger family history and Harriet's disappearance. As he does so, he meets most of the remaining Vanger clan, including Harriet's brother Martin, current CEO of the company; Isabella, Martin and Harriet's mother; and Cecilia, a headmistress who was Harriet's younger aunt and friend. Meanwhile, Salander's legal guardian Holger Palmgrem suffers a stroke, and is replaced by Nils Bjurman, who uses his position to extort sexual acts from her and eventually rapes her. After using a hidden camera to record her assault, Salander takes her revenge, torturing Bjurman and threatening to ruin him unless he gives her full control of her life and finances. She then uses a tattoo machine to brand him as a rapist. ...عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «دختری با نشان اژدها»؛ «دختری با خالکوبی اژدها»؛ «دختری که رازی کهنه را آشکار کرد»؛ عنوان سوئدی: «مردانی که از زنان نفرت دارند»؛ نویسنده: استیگ لارسن (لارسون)؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش روز بیست و هفتم ماه جولای سال 2012میلادیعنوان: دختری با خالکوبی اژدها - کتاب اول؛ نویسنده: استیگ لارسن (لارسون)؛ مترجم اصغر اندرودی؛ کرج، در دانش، 1389؛ در 620ص؛ شابک9789641741299؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان سوئد - سده 20معنوان: دختری با خالکوبی اژدها؛ نویسنده: استیگ لارسن (لارسون)؛ مترجم: شیما دلدوزی؛ تهران، نشر گستر، 1389؛ در 508ص؛ شابک9786005883244؛ عنوان: دختری با نشان اژدها؛ نویسنده: استیگ لارسن (لارسون)؛ مترجم: شرکت رایان فراسو؛ تهران، سروش گستر، 1390؛ در 485ص؛ شابک9786006369020؛ عنوان: دختری با نشان اژدها؛ نویسنده: استیگ لارسن (لارسون)؛ مترجم: علی منصوری؛ قم، بهمن آرا، 1391؛ در 715ص؛ شابک9786006013091؛ عنوان: دختری با نشان اژدها؛ نویسنده: استیگ لارسن (لارسون)؛ مترجم: آزاده حیدریان؛ تهران، چکاوک پگاه، 1393؛ در 670ص؛ شابک9786006013091؛ عنوان: دختری که رازی کهنه را آشکار کرد - کتاب اول؛ نویسنده: استیگ لارسن (لارسون)؛ مترجم: میترا کیوان مهر؛ تهران، نشر قطره، 1394؛ در704ص؛ شابک 9786001196324؛رمان «مردانی که از زنان نفرت دارند»؛ رمانی دلهره‌ آور، و جنایی است؛ که توسط نویسنده و روزنامه‌ نگار «سوئدی»، «استیگ لارسن» نوشته شده، و نخستین کتاب از سری سه‌ گانه ی «هزاره» است، که در سال 2005میلادی، یک سال پس از درگذشت ناگهانی نویسنده اش، در «سوئد» منتشر گردید؛ داستان با جریانی مرموز و دل انگیز آغاز می‌شود؛ «هنریک ونگر» صنعتگری بازنشسته و هشتاد ساله، «میکائیل بلومکویست» را، که پژوهشگر، روزنامه‌ نگار، و ویراستار مجله‌ ای به نام «هزاره» است، و به تازگی پرونده‌ ای را در شرایط بسیار بد، از دست داده، برای پژوهش درباره ی ناپدید شدن خواهرزاده ی خویش «هریئت»، که چهل سال پیش ناپدید شده، استخدام می‌کند؛ «ونگر» پیش از استخدام «بلومکویست» پیشینه ی شخصی و حرفه‌ ای او را بررسی کرده؛ «هریئت» از جزیره‌ ای، که بیشتر آن، مال خانواده ی «ونگر» بوده، ناپدید شده؛ «بلومکویست» با وجود تردیدی که داشت، پس از آنکه «هنریک ونگر» به او، بیش از دو میلیون «کرونور» را پیشنهاد کرد، در قبال نوشتن کتاب تاریخ خانوادگی «ونگر»ها، کار روی پرونده را پذیرفت؛ «ونگر» باور داشت «هریئت»، که سی و شش سال پیش ناپدید شده، توسط یکی از اعضای خانواده ی‌ خودش به قتل رسیده؛ او به «بلومکویست» گفت: «من از بیشتر اعضای خانواده خود بیزار هستم، چون بیشتر آن‌ها دزد، خسیس، قلدر و بی کفایت هستند»؛ پس از این ماجرا «بلومکویست» به جزیره میرود، و پژوهش خود را درباره ی خانواده «ونگر»، و ناپدید شدن «هریئت» در آنجا آغاز میکند؛ اما ... ادامه ی ماجرا؛تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 17/07/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 01/07/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی",202,-0.9953,0.088,0.893,0.019,0.4184210526315789,POSITIVE,0.5738
14,101753841,05/07/2010,2.0,"He slapped her hard. Salander opened her eyes wide, but before she could react, he grabbed her by the shoulder and threw her on to the bed. The violence caught her by surprise. When she tried to turn over, he pressed her down on the bed and straddled her.That's just to give you a little taste of what one is dealing with by picking up this book. If you can handle that and the previous x amount of paragraphs and the following x amount of paragraphs, you're golden. If that sort of makes that thing in your throat rise up a little bit and make your mouth taste sour, you might reconsider reading this book.Carry on.I wasn't going to read this book, ever. But then I saw the theater up the street from me (a cool one that plays those indie and art films, and their popcorn is always sort of either stale or slightly burnt, and the employees all have an air of snootiness - it's one of my favorite places in town) is showing the foreign movie. My first thought was, ""When did they make a movie of this book?"" My second thought was, ""Dammit. I sort of want to see that movie."" My third thought was, ""Sonsofbitches. I can't see it until I read it."" (Yes, I'm hard on myself, thanks.) So last weekend when we went out of town I decided it was the best time to purchase it and read it. The mini-break was going to entail my boyfriend spending hours playing guitars with his brother and then later with his BFF, and his brother's fiance and his BFF's wife were all conveniently elsewhere for the most part, so I had the fantastic opportunity to tag along and not have to do a damn thing. I sat on the couch/futon/floor and read. I read a freaking lot. This was the book I had along to read.It passed the time. It didn't bore me. It held my attention.And... that's about it.It didn't turn my world upside down, or even teeter it necessarily. This is what I like to refer to as a nice popcorn read. I didn't have to give it a lot of thought, the story sort of did the work for me, I was just an innocent and willing bystander. I actually got a little annoyed the few times when it felt like I was beginning to have to work. Like figuring out who the hell Larsson was talking about at any given moment - he was apparently one of those authors who liked to use a character's first name in one sentence and then refer to the same character by their last name in the next sentence. What's up with that? Make a freaking decision and stick with it. Eventually I stopped caring so much.My biggest annoyance with the book (and likely to be the most offense to lovers of this book who stumble across my humble review here) was not the violence and the rape; it actually was Lisbeth Salander. The female protagonist. Okay, so she's cool. I get that. She's Hotty-McHotterson, all corporate and world-weary and a computer hacker to boot. She's pierced and inked, and for some reason this is such a source of fascination for Larsson (and apparently everyone who reads this book). Every time Salander comes into the story there is a mention about her piercings, her surly attitude, her tough clothes, her tattoos. At one point another character counts her tattoos. Six. Six. This apparently contributes to some point Larsson was trying to make that Salander is a social freak, but he's still clearly obsessed with the image of her. For the record, numerous piercings, surly attitudes, tough clothes and six tattoos sums up just about every female I know. It's not all that bizarre. This is, after all, the 21st century. Anyone who lived through the 80s/90s either embodies all of those things or at least doesn't bat an eyelash at those things in others. Maybe it's different in Sweden. Maybe they're just now getting the whole dyed-hair-pierced-faces-crazy-tattoos craze there. Wow. Way to go, Sweden. Maybe if you all hadn't spent the last 30 years listening to ABBA and Europe obsessively, you might actually not find kick-ass girls in boots all that magical.All of these unfair generalizations aside, I can honestly say that I read this book and I'm not all that excited about it. I'm not dying to read the next one, but I'm sure I will eventually (probably if they make a movie of it too). I'm certainly not waiting with bated breath for the third book in the trilogy to come out. I guess I'm just not that fascinated by Salander in particular, so I don't really care what happens to her next. Maybe the movie will make me feel differently. We'll see.ETA (01/14/12): I have since read The Girl Who Played with Fire which I enjoyed more than this first book, though my impression of Lisbeth hadn't changed that much. I have also seen the Hollywood version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo which I liked more than the book because the performances were fantastic, Fincher is a wonderful director, and I felt like the characters could breathe which is something I felt they were unable to do in the book because they were so constricted and pigeon-holed.",174,0.9945,0.08,0.79,0.13,0.4282156540777231,NEGATIVE,0.985
15,191414825,07/28/2011,4.0,"Larsson takes what seemed at the outset to be a juicy 'locked-island-mystery plot' and turns it first into an insightful family saga and then into a scathing political and social commentary that forces us to think about such a wide variety of themes and aspects that we normally refuse to accept as part of society. It takes an author like Larsson to shove it in our faces in all its stinking ugliness for us to stop turning the blind eye at these atrocities.Do not mistake this for a mere fictional work with imagined crimes. It has firm foundations in reality. In my opinion, the whole plot is a thin wrap-sheet thrown around the brutal truths of real crimes. Larsson has extensive knowledge of the most heinous crimes and he has written extensively about them for his entire professional career. This expertise shows through in his description of such acts of unimaginable cruelty with an almost nonchalant objectivity, with a careless leaving out of the gory details and focus on the trivial aspects of the act that sends shivers down our spine.Larsson uses his investigative style of presentation and his two main characters and an extremely dysfunctional family to work in an amazing variety of potent themes into his first book. I cannot wait to see what he’ll do in the second one. Some of the themes explored in detail are:Online PrivacyThis is not part of the plot but Larsson seems to be sending out a warning about how deadly information can be in the wrong hands and how easily accessible any private info about you stored in digital form is. You are exposed and absolutely naked to a determined digital assault and there is nothing you can do about it. Of course in the novel it is never misused but the threat is always hanging in the air - if an uneducated girl and her friends can get the most private information about the most protected individuals in the country, what kind of a world are we heading into? And is it really bad? Food for thought...FeminismNo matter which way you look at it, this work will have to defined as one of the most wrathful outcries against society's attitude towards women. The entire story is about the enormous acts of cruelty committed against women and the absolute indifference to it by everyone who is supposed to care. It is also about the different responses that these women have in such an uncaring society. Which brings us to the most important theme of the book in my opinion:Morality and Allocation of BlameThe book is truly about three paths that a victim can take after an abused childhood.One of the characters suffers abuse and decides to become an abuser himself and embrace it as a fact of lifeThe second one suffers abuse and decides to run away from that life and live faraway and sheltered. No attempt is made to punish the abuser or to report it.The third character too suffers abuse but decides to confront it and return it with a vengeance. No violence or abuse is tolerated and any reaction is justified for this character.The fourth is the invisible character of what we expect a person to do in such a situation - report it, seek help from the authorities who are supposed to protect them. The society around and the grim reality that prompted the book gives the outcome to this course of action.Now the key point to me was that Larsson does not condemn any of them - he makes different characters speak in defense for each of these responses and lets us wonder about which course can ever be called right. in the end he manages to condemn both the society as a whole as well as us, the individuals who allow the society to be so. A caricature of morality.Law, Crime & BDSMLarsson's extensive knowledge about the worst forms of crime and the procedure of law allows him to give a gruesome reality to what we usually consider to be just sadistic fiction. He convinces the reader that it is real and all around us if we only cared enough to look.Nazi History, Military Training, Religious Extremism & Apologetics These are also touched upon at various points in the books and provides a background, especially of Swedish Nazism, from which the excuses for all the real crimes in the books could spring from.Journalistic (Professional) EthicsThis too is quite obviously one of the favorite topics for Larsson and it forms a strong undercurrent throughout the book and comes to a head with the firm conviction of the lead character that he is finally a corrupt journalist. He is reassured that he has done the right thing by choosing between being a professional and being a human being. But we as the readers, the character and the author, all know that this is not remotely convincing. Justice was meted out selectively and subjectively in the end and even though it feels right, that is only because of personal knowledge. Is that enough?Financial & Economic Commentary, Industrial Espionage and Hacker-loreLarge parts of the book goes into great detail about industrial politics and machinations and is sometimes quite boring to be frank, but it adds credence to the plot and has to be borne out. The elaborate hacker methodology too is a drag at times but remains mostly interesting and strangely disturbing.The financial interplay and the economic commentary sounds a bit forced but Larsson still manages to give out some forceful ideas such as:“We’re experiencing the largest single drop in the history of the Swedish stock exchange—and you think that’s nonsense?”“You have to distinguish between two things—the Swedish economy and the Swedish stock market. The Swedish economy is the sum of all the goods and services that are produced in this country every day. There are telephones from Ericsson, cars from Volvo, chickens from Scan, and shipments from Kiruna to Skövde.That’s the Swedish economy, and it’s just as strong or weak today as it was a week ago.” He paused for effect and took a sip of water.“The Stock Exchange is something very different. There is no economy and no production of goods and services. There are only fantasies in which people from one hour to the next decide that this or that company is worth so many billions, more or less. It doesn’t have a thing to do with reality or with the Swedish economy.”“So you’re saying that it doesn’t matter if the Stock Exchange drops like a rock?”“No, it doesn’t matter at all,” Blomkvist said in a voice so weary and resigned that he sounded like some sort of oracle.His words would be quoted many times over the following year.Family & IncestWhat it means to be a family and the inevitable nature of family relationships too seem to haunt Larsson and he gives free reign to his fears and troubles about family life, incest, indifference and corporate life affecting personal relations. He also asks the question of whether we can ever truly judge a person based on corporate success without knowing his relationships with his family and his personal life.There are probably other important ones that I have failed to mention but these were, in my opinion, the things that the book was meant to shine a torchlight on.On The CharactersI found this in an interview with Larsson and it captures the enigma of the two amazing main characters:“I considered Pippi Longstocking,” he said, referring to the most famous creation of the Swedish children’s author Astrid Lindgren, a girl so strong she could carry a horse. “What would she be like today? What would she be like as an adult? What would you call a person like that, a sociopath? Hyperactive? Wrong. She simply sees society in a different light. I’ll make her 25 years old and an outcast. She has no friends and is deficient in social skills. That was my original thought.” That thought evolved into Larsson’s formidable heroine, Lisbeth Salander.But he felt Salander needed a counterweight if his story was to be a success. Once again he turned to one of Lindgren’s characters, this time to Kalle Blomkvist, boy detective. “Only now he’s 45 years old and a journalist [called Mikael Blomkvist]. An altruistic know-it-all who publishes a magazine called Millennium. The story will revolve around the people who work there.”
Personal Impressions
While I loved the book wholeheartedly, I still had a few unfavorable impressions:Some of the side characters are a bit sketchy not fully realized. Especially some of the family members including Martin who did not get a gradual transition that a character like him deserved for maximum impact.The stylistically simple nature of the chapters and the book structure too takes away from the sophistication of the detail and plot. A bit more variety in the technique than a simple shift-of-perspective would have been better and less obvious. Also the tension eases off at all the wrong moments, primarily because Larsson has given a portent of things to come later too easily for a whodunnit. The pace too is not consistent and we spend a lot of time seeing scenery and almost every chapter opens with making coffee or with long uneventful walks.In the end, the reader does not get the pleasure of a proper whodunnit as there were no hidden clues spread across the book and in spite of homages throughout the book to masters of crime and mystery fiction, Larsson at some point decided to make his book not fit to the thrill of that genre and moved instead to far more sinister territories.The last section of the book felt much like a filler and had way too much detail and predictable action and could just as well have been left to the reader's imagination. The long winding down has put me off from any tension that would have made me run for the second book immediately. Now that everything is calm and quiet in the Millennium world, I too can take an idyllic break from it all...A good editor and more time to polish would have made this into a definite modern masterpiece, which I strongly suspect it to be already. But in spite of the flaws we still have an opus and some unforgettable characters that will stay with us for a long time to come.

18,252535702,12/28/2011,3.0,"Thanks to the slew of Swedish and Hollywood movies, everyone knows that  The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a story of a kickass hacker Lisbeth Salander who has the eponymous tattoo and a knack for solving decades-old murders. Well, not exactly. Lisbeth is awesome and badass, no doubt there, but this book is so much more than just her story, and focusing solely on that undermines the message Stieg Larsson was sending. The original Swedish title is  Men Who Hate Women and it is precisely what the story is about. (*)   * I am pretty sure it received its Book Witness Protection Program name change treatment to avoid being seen as ""that feminist crap"" in the English-speaking society. Where ""feminist"" sadly may still be viewed as an insult. Apparently a teenage Larsson witnessed and failed to stop rape of a young woman. He was so affected by it that he wrote his magnum opus to make amends for the witnessed atrocity. Thus we have Men Who Hate Women, which is a short description of the focus of his entire Millenium series. Larsson speaks up - angrily, loudly, with conviction - on behalf of not just Salander but all women who have been marginalized, dismissed, paternalised, silenced, treated as inferior, treated as property, overlooked, infantilized, sexualized, assaulted, and murdered.Larsson, like his protagonist Blomkvist, was an investigative journalist who specialized in airing out stuff that many ""higher-ups"" would want to see left alone. (**)  ** To quote Terry Pratchett (all bow to his genius), ""It's not worth doing something unless someone, somewhere, would much rather you weren't doing it."" This book is an angry and poignant social commentary on the right-wing extremism, prejudice, Nazi leanings, and of course misogyny that still permeate even the quintessential European paradise country of Sweden. Larsson condemns all this, and in his journalism-like style does not hold back the slightest bit. And it is often an uncomfortable read as we see and recognize all those little societal bits and conventions that make these prejudices and even violence possible.Larsson may not be the most skillful writer, his prose may suffer from long-windedness and overabundance of details (seriously, at times it reads like a cross between a diary and a shopping catalog), but he has strong opinions on painful subjects and is not afraid to let them be known. He had this attitude both in his journalism and his fiction, and I applaud him for that.  3 stars only because of weak prose, but full marks for content.——————Also posted on my blog.",150,-0.997,0.209,0.713,0.078,0.578888888888889,NEGATIVE,0.998
19,38206165,11/20/2008,5.0,"One of the best thrillers I've ever read. Great story, great characters, very intelligent and thoughtful. Writing is nothing special but it doesn't need to be.___________________________________________I finally saw the movie a couple of days ago, and I'm a bit conflicted. On the plus side, it conveys the feel of the book very well, and several of the main characters are excellently realized. I particularly liked Lisbeth, who was just perfect. But they have taken some enormous liberties with the story. For example, Erika, who in the book is a central figure, has almost disappeared. So if you're a purist, you might want to avoid this, but in the end I decided I liked it. I guess it's just a bit too long, and cuts were necessary.___________________________________________I just read the following passage in Precious Williams's review of this book, but I have seen at least half a dozen similar ones:The constant references to sandwiches (you get the impression the Swedes eat at least an entire loaf of bread every day), coffee (how on earth do they manage to sleep?) and breasts became tedious very rapidly.I can stay silent no longer. Precious and others, I lived in Sweden for most of the 80s, and I can tell that you Stieg Larsson wasn't making it up:1. Sandwiches. Yes, you're right: Swedes love sandwiches. There's a widespread belief that eating bread is good for you. When I was there, I caught the tailend of a popular campaign by the Ministry of Health, whose tagline was Ät 6-8 skivor bröd om dagen - eat 6-8 slices of bread a day. Moreover, Swedish bread is delicious. I'm thinking about kruskalimpa and rågrut right now and my mouth is watering. If they were on sale here, I'd definitely eat more sandwiches.2. Coffee. Swedes used to drink more coffee per capita than any other county in the world, though I understand that they've now slipped a couple of places. It's powerful stuff too, but you get used to it. Fun facts: Swedish has a verb fika, meaning ""to drink coffee"" and a noun, påtår, meaning ""a second cup of coffee"". You know, the old Eskimo/snow thing.3. Breasts. Topless sunbathing is popular in Sweden, and Swedes are in general extremely relaxed about nudity. Swedish men have pretty much the same interests as men everywhere else in the world. If I were drunk I'd probably recount an anecdote or two at this point, but as it is I'm afraid you'll just have to take my word for it.",150,0.9982,0.032,0.754,0.214,0.5779075091575091,POSITIVE,0.9998

22,53705085,04/23/2009,1.0,"Not sure what all the hype was about. The first 1/3 of the book showed promise. Two seperate characters who will soon cross paths. Kind of classic mystery story telling. But then it has some moments of perversity that didn't really need to be in the story. Kind of creepy and weird. I guess there is not a lot to do in Sweden.  The second part they are together on an island trying to solve a mystery that was never really engaging. They had to find out what happened to a girl forty years ago. Wow! Exciting stuff. Oh and some family members were part of the Nazi party sixty years ago. Uh ok. Not sure why that is relevant but every good mystery needs a Nazi or two I'm sure. The story brings out more sexual darkness (I can see the tourist ads now for Sweden) and disolves into a weird sexual torture/homosexual/incest tale. No Beastiality? C'mon! I feel cheated! The last 1/3 of the book was never really needed because the mystery is over and it basically takes the author 100 pages to wrap it up. Oh and we find out his longtime lover is into B&D and S&M. Why this is important? I have no idea. But it was important to Stieg. I like to call him Stieg because, even though he is dead, I feel that we are on a first name basis after the author uses ""buttplug"" in his book. It was not that great of a book. I am shocked at all the great reviews. A girlfriend of mine agreed with all the problems I had with the book yet she still loved it. This seems to be the case with many book groups. Why? I don't understand admitting the book is crap but still loving it. The end results were not remotely believable. A woman comes off a sheep ranch where she has been living for the last forty years and immediately takes over a fortune 500 type company. Uh, ok? Characters were either tossed aside quickly (then why have them?) or never developed. Another reviewer mentioned the product placement. I did find it strange that the author seemed to have a Mac fetish among many others. Also, his main character is the self appointed moral watchdog of companies (because capitalism is evil I guess) yet can't keep his zipper zipped. This book did not encourage me to visit Sweden any time soon. Also, as an Elvis fan, I did not appreciate the last line in the book.  I just saw the Swedish film adaptation of the book and I actually enjoyed it. This was the first time I have ever said, ""The film was better than the book.""

Filled with interesting characters, exciting scenes and this just flows very well. Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander are two of the most interesting characters in recent fiction. Larsson’s great achievement, though, is not just in their creation, but in the dynamic chemistry he has fused between them.One of the best accolades that can be given a work is that it was hard to put down, and that most definitely applies here.

27,258107580,01/07/2012,5.0,"5 stars to Stieg Larsson's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. You heard all the hype about the author who died and his books weren't published. You heard that they were translated into English. You heard they were great and both Sweden and Hollywood were making a movie of it. Well, it's all true. So is the fact that this is a must read for every mystery fan!
Story
So many plots, so little time. Basically, the primary plot is about a missing girl. A relative wants to find out what happened that mysterious day decades ago. Enter a flawed newspaper report. Enter a troubled hacker. Enter a few romances. Mischief. Confusion. Alliances. Enemies. And none of that includes the rather extensive family of the missing girl -- some who believe she died, some who couldn't even care more. The story weaves in and out telling the various plights of the hacker, the newspaper man and the family with secrets. It comes together in an explosive way -- every plot twist imaginable all combined into one. The description of the death scenes are so vivid that feel like you are there! By the end, I wanted to meet these people... and so will you.
Strengths
1. The characters are just a force not to be reckoned with. You will have strong feelings towards ALL of them.2. The plot and the way in which Larsson weaves the sub-plots together. It's genius and it's captivating.
Weaknesses
1. Really none... it's not for the easy reader or one who wants a straightforward, simple story. You have to want the complexity.
Final Thoughts
Get it now. Don't watch the movie. Maybe learn Swedish so you can read the story in it's written language. But to be honest, the translation hardly misses a beat.

29,2326910979,03/23/2018,4.0,"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo ranks high among mysteries in my book. It did take me awhile to get into the story, but once I did, I became engrossed in the mystery and wanted to continue reading to find out “who did it?!” and “what actually happened?” For almost the first half of the book, there were two separate but simultaneous stories and I was curious as to how they’d intertwine, which they did, for (approximately) the second half of the book. Mikael Bloomkvist, a recently convicted journalist, is hired to investigate a wealthy family’s mystery. Mikael hires Lisbeth Salander, a young and unlikely assistant, to help him. I liked both of them. I’ll leave the details of the mystery itself out to avoid sharing any extra information. While the book is not new, I went into reading it pretty blindly, which I don’t think was a bad idea. The one complaint I have is the noticeable amount of language regarding the characters’ food intake: “She fixed coffee.” “They ate sandwiches.” Yes, while sometimes appropriate, this book seemed to include these details on an almost daily basis. Characters do, like humans in real life, need to eat regularly — I get it.

30,65990535,08/03/2009,1.0,"I have so many negative thoughts about this book. So here's a list of complaints:a.) Either this was very poorly translated or very poorly written. I've heard arguments for both. Tons of unnecessary details (all the coffee stops!), repetition of things we already know, paragraphs about nothing just petering out. Even at times when I was enjoying the plot, I felt as though I had to fight my way through dull writing.b.) For as dull as it is in most parts, this book is waaaay too over the top in others. Butt plugs?! What is my reaction to that even supposed to be? (For the curious: it was a big old WTF face.) While I think there is a place for graphic rape and torture scenes (more in film than in books, because it's not as hard to convey intent in a multi-dimensional visual format), I didn't see the need for them here. Salander being the survivor of rape and perpetrator of revenge did not make me root for her here -- as it might have in a film -- because it was only a tangential and forgotten part of the story, rather than being necessary to it. We don't see her dealing with the aftereffects of her abuse at all; she's not fundamentally changed because of it, aside from taking her revenge. Which leads me to:c.) Salander's supposed to be this amazingly kickass character that I'll just automatically love, right? Umm, no. Aside from knowing that she's a good investigator, sexual but detached, has Asperger's and is kind of ruthless, I felt like she could have been anyone. Really. I looked for some piece of insight or indication that she is a dynamic character that would make me like her, but it never happened. Dressing her up like a punk in a sea of suits is not enough characterization. Perhaps in further books and with time, I'd feel attached to her like I've felt to other mystery series characters, but I'm not really tempted to read on. d.) The only reason I was invested in the mystery of Harriet Vanger's disappearance is because I thought she'd been murdered. When it turned out she was still alive and had skipped town, I wanted to throw the damn book at a wall. e.) How freaking over the top was it for the murderer to have a Hostel-style torture chamber right in his house? Does anyone find this seriously scary, instead of laughably stupid? Moreover, does this sort of thing exist outside the world of comic book super villains? Better make sure THAT room's locked when company comes over.I enjoyed this book so little that after the solution to the Harriet mystery wrapped up, I just skimmed to the end. I have no idea what happened with the Wennerstrom affair, nor do I particularly care. I'm assuming that Blomqvist got some scandalous scoop and super busted him, because that's what happens in utterly predictable books like this one.",96,-0.9822,0.155,0.734,0.111,0.5868091998704243,NEGATIVE,1.0
31,62036754,07/03/2009,5.0,"In 1966 sixteen-year-old Harriet Vanger, daughter of the CEO of the large family-run Vanger Corporation, goes missing from her family's island community and is never seen again. Not even a body is found, and her great uncle, Henrik Vanger, has explored every possible lead to discover what happened to his one and only favourite family member.Over the last forty years her disappearance has become Henrik's obsession, and he's positive someone in the family murdered her - but they never found a motive, and without one he doesn't know who to suspect. Now, in 2005, Henrik has little time left as he grows old and plenty of money to indulge in his obsession one last time.Mikael Blomkvist is a forty-something financial journalist and editor of Millennium magazine, a magazine he co-founded which prides itself on investigative journalism. But Blomkvist and the magazine have just suffered their first big blow: he's been convicted of libel against one of the biggest business entrepreneurs in Sweden, Hans-Erik Wennerström.Wanting to keep a low profile and pretend he's been fired from the magazine in order to try and save it from further attack by Wennerström, Henrik Vanger's proposition comes at an ideal time. Mikael's father once worked for the Vanger Corporation, and Harriet herself had babysat little Mikael a few times. Henrik offers Blomkvist a year-long contract with the pretext of writing a history of the family - an autobiography of Henrik - while his real mission is to discover what happened to Harriet.After some convincing, Blomkvist takes the job - but when he discovers the first new evidence since the tragedy occurred, he realises he needs help - and who better to go to than the private investigator who did such a good job on Blomkvist when Henrik hired her? Lisbeth Salander is a quiet, secretive young woman who excels at what she does because she's also a genius hacker. With a troubled past and a dicey present, her trust in Blomkvist takes her by surprise. The two team up to discover the truth about Harriet, and to take Wennerström down.Thanks to a friend of mine, who also recommended this to me, I knew the English translation of the original title before I started reading this, which is Men Who Hate Women. This is actually very interesting and worth mentioning. It's certainly an apt title; perhaps not obvious at first, after a while it becomes a very clear theme. It may also give it away a bit. But I can also understand why they went with a very different title for the English translation. Lisbeth is ""the girl with the dragon tattoo"" - among other tattoos and piercings - and she is one of two main characters. The second book's English title is ""The girl who played with fire"", so you can see they're going with their own theme here.More importantly, though, such a title is more appealing to an English-language audience. Titles, like covers, that feature girls or women - or wives - are popular and sell well. This is an intriguing title, and doesn't give away the genre. When this book first came out, the hardcover was marketed to a literary crowd. This is the mass market paperback edition, and with a quote from Harlan Coben on the cover along with the style of cover itself (and the long, narrow format), it is more clearly pitched at the Mystery mob (hence why both my parents-in-law read this before I did).It is a mystery, and a thriller at times, and a detective book - but it's also a political and economic commentary, has one of the more original and daring heroines of the genre, and is invigorating in its details. I don't read many mystery novels, because (ironically), I find them boring. Aside from a quiet patch at about the two-quarter mark, I never found this book boring, even though not a whole lot happens until the last third.Both Blomkvist and Salander are engaging protagonists, for very different reasons. Things happen to them that will make you upset and angry, especially Salander, whose side story holds you enthralled and revolted at the same time, as does the truth about Harriet - but there's nothing gratuitous here, or unnecessarily included or described: it's all relevant.The pacing is superb (yes, even with that ""quiet patch""), and the plotting cleverly controlled. The cold of Sweden - at times down to -35F (which makes the 44F of Shiver seem somewhat laughable) - was vividly realised, as was the setting of Hedeby Island. I would have liked to ""see"" more of Sweden - everything was terribly familiar - but a mystery book isn't really the place for that.This is a very mature book, with themes that make you despair yet are handled so compassionately that you are never alienated. I also enjoyed the economic side of the other plot line, and Blomkvist's words towards the end were very apt considering the recent problems with the American stock exchange and subsequent recession, when he's asked by a TV host about ""the fact that Sweden's economy was now headed for a crash."" He calls it nonsense, and goes on to explain something which I think we all tend to forget:""You have to distinguish between two things - the Swedish economy and the Swedish stock market. The Swedish economy is the sum of all the goods and services that are produced in this country every day. There are telephones from Ericsson, cars from Volvo, chickens from Scan, and shipments from Kiruna to Skövde. That's the Swedish economy, and it's just as strong or weak today as it was a week ago. ... The Stock Exchange is something very different. There is no economy and no production of goods and services. There are only fantasies in which people from one hour to the next decide that this or that company is worth so many billions, more or less. It doesn't have a thing to do with reality or with the Swedish economy."" (p819)Sure that's a simplistic way of putting it, but his description of the Stock Exchange pretty neatly sums up the way I've always perceived it - and scorned it. So I enjoyed this exchange, and the whole Wennerström sub plot, as much as the mystery about Harriet itself.The other side of the commentary that's strong and interesting is the issue of journalistic responsibility, and ethics. Decisions are made at the end that are highly questionable, but there are no easy answers - Blomkvist is the voice of our conscience here, and yet you can see the other side too. I don't envy him his position!I have no complaints with this book, but I have one to the publisher: I really hate the new, narrow format of mass market paperbacks. (Thankfully, only a few books get printed like this.) They're just so tall and ... skinny. It certainly doesn't save any paper, and makes me feel like I'm falling off the edge of the page at the end of each line, which barely fits five words. I don't care for the larger typeface and roomy layout either - I like tighter lines and smaller fonts, personally.

I have watched the movie ages ago but luckily, I confuse it with another so I remembered nothing useful about the plot. After my friend insisted I read it and lent me his copy, I finally gave it a shot. And I'm glad I did. It turned out to be much better than I expected and I certainly get its fame now.I won't be reviewing this book. With 70k+ reviews, mine is hardly needed. But I still like to mention a few things.First, I loved the message. Larsson doesn't shy away from making his point. This book was written in 2005 while sexual harassment and gender-based violence were starting to get more spotlight in literature and around the world, you rarely came across books with such a clear message. I really think the title should've stayed ""Men Who Hate Women"". Sure, this one will grab more readers but the Swedish title describes this book much better.Another thing I enjoyed was the mystery. Once Blomkvist and Salander started working together, the book got really gripping. The side story about Millenium was also interesting but my favorite part was uncovering the mystery. I admired Lisbeth as a character but I hope we'll be told later how she started hacking, especially since she's very skilled at it. The book wasn't without its flaws, however. My complaints can be summed up into two points:1- The story took too long to start. The random (or what felt like random at the time) perspectives at the start didn't help. I was very lost at first and I still think we had too much information to process at the beginning since the three plots were very detached. Yet I wouldn't have minded if it wasn't for point 2.2- The details. We had an insane level of details. It was way too much. It felt like Larsson narrated every single thing the characters did. And I'm talking about those tiny details. Like holding a cup or flipping a page or I don't have the book now to find quotes but those minuscule details no one cares about nor are they important to the story. And there was also graphic description of some messed up stuff (and didn’t really serve the plot). I honestly started glossing over them because they were abundant. If Larsson had been more to the point, it would've been better. It also took our main characters 300 pages to meet which was way too long since the plot only really started them. I also couldn't put the book down once this happened. I'm glad I finally read the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, it's a fine mystery. I had a few criticisms but overall very much enjoyed the story and found the characters well-written. I believe I will be reading the sequels, if not anytime soon.",89,0.994,0.085,0.746,0.169,0.5417556102900928,NEGATIVE,0.9974

Instead, he works to find what happened to Harriet Vanger, the young niece of a wealthy CEO.

I don't know, because I couldn't bear to finish this. It usually takes me about a day to read a book. It took me an entire month to slog through less than 300 pages of Larsson's bullshit. His writing is simultaneously ridonkulously sensational (chapter after chapter of escalatingly SHOCKING! sex acts) and brain-numbingly boring. Page after page of stilted, unbelievably dialog. Constant info dumps in place of action or dialog. Larsson repeats himself on pretty much ever page; nothing is hinted at or unsaid, everything is reiterated. Blomkvist and Salander make no sense as human beings; in 250 pages, I knew more about their computers than I did their inner lives or even, how they talked.

Sadly there will only ever be three as Larsson passed away in 2004.The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is a tale of personal and corporate corruption in Sweden, complete with a serial psycho-killer (or is there more than one?) and a mystery. What happened to Harriet Vanger, a member of the large and powerful Vanger family, 40 years ago? Her uncle, Henrik, in his 80s now and with time running short, wants to make one last effort to find out. He hires Mikael Blomqvist, a journalist, publisher of a magazine and recently convicted of libel, to find out. The girl of the title, Lisbeth Salander, has other tattoos as well as assorted piercings. She is a young woman of extraordinary investigative and computer skills, a troubled personal history, and a willingness to do whatever is needed to accomplish her goals. Together the two set out to find the truth. This is a fast-paced, exciting story. The characters are well-drawn and interesting, although I find the casualness of many about some aspects of personal behavior discomfiting. That is secondary to the story.

But it made me think back to this book, which constantly refers to stats about violence against women in Sweden. Something is seriously up in Sweden. Gives me the creeps even more than Swtizerland.**Wow. 500+ pages and entertaining right up to the last sentence? Lingers in the mind long after the book is finished? Geez. I didn't think it could be done in today's fiction world, except books for the morons who feel the need to ""research"" The da Vinci Code. Time to create a new shelf for this one, entitled: kicked ass. There are several mysteries going on in this novel, from the strange disappearance of a young girl decades ago, to financial scandals in the curious backdrop of Sweden. Definitely original. The characters are fascinating and the story, engrossing. The book gets four stars for keeping me massively entertained for the better part of the week, but it loses a star for some small issues that drove me so nuts that they are worth mentioning:1) All financial terms are reported in the Swedish kroner, which is fair considering that it's a Swedish book. However, the translator could have at least added the equivalent of Euros or Pounds or Dollars so that the majority of readers -- that is, people not familiar with the value of the Swedish currency -- don't have to go on xe.com to try to figure out just how much money we're talking about. 2) Uhhhh ... can we have an American translation, please? I TEACH ESL FROM BRITISH TEXTBOOKS, AND I STILL HAD TO TEXT MY BRITISH FRIEND AND ASK FOR DEFINITIONS. One word: Haberdashery? FABRIC STORE!!! Yeah. 3) The family tree in the first few pages helps, but the character names and places are so close that they're endlessly confusing if you're not Swedish: Henrik, Harold (who live in Hedeby near Hedestad, by the way), Harriet, Berger the lover and Birger the crazy relative, Gustav, Gregor, Gerda, Gottfried .... ARHGHG. Drove me nuts! 4) The codes in Harriet's notebook and the mystery of why Cecilia Vanger appears in every photograph = predictable. That being said, the rest of the book is such a nightmare explosion of ""who the hell saw that coming?!"" that it makes up for it. 5) ""Left-wing media liberal"" + ""socialist/communist"" Swedish dude (just quoting FOX News here) = our author, who saturates the novel with his politics. I'm a liberal, so I don't care, but when characters become the mouthpiece for your political views, you lose creativity points with me. On the whole? A great guilty-please/summer-read.

44,311672578,04/13/2012,3.0,"A good book that got screwed up due to poor writingKeeping in mind that the only crime/mystery novels I have read are novels by Dan Brown and novels dealing with financial matters are the ones by Jeffrey Archer, on this basis I can say that this book was a cross between their book but not at par with either, inferior to both. The premise of the story is not so simple:Meet Mikael Blomkvist, a journalist of financial sectors, but today his accusations against industrialist Hans-Erik Wennerstrom are proved to be false hence he is fined and sentenced three months in prison for libelling.Trying to get away from his publication house for some time, he lands up at Hedeby island, with Henrik Vanger, retired CEO of Vanger corporation. Henrik asks him to solve the mystery behind murder of her niece, Harriet Vanger. Murder was committed some 36 years ago on same island where entire Vanger family was present on some occasion and island was temporarily cut off from the world due to accident on bridge, the only connecting link. So the island is isolated and there is chaos on island due to accident, and in midst of this Harriet disappears, body never found, considered dead. So what unfolds is a locked-room murder mystery.Did I miss something? Yes, Lisbeth Salander.Cold, calculated and the girl with the dragon tattoo. She works as personal investigator at a security firm, her story moves parallel to the Blomkvist’s story until she is hired as detective alongside Blomkvist.Positive aspects of the story:Let me confess that this is one of the best murder mystery novel I have ever read (though I am not a fan of this genre). At no point I could guess who is the murderer, because there is no hint but when it is disclosed, it perfectly fits with the story. What makes this story even more interesting is that murder was committed 36 years ago, some people present on that day are already dead and some are too old.The characters are excellently portrayed and plus point of the story. Larsson uses subplot to develop characters over pages and pages before jumping into action. Therefore I connected with their thoughts and decisions, except Lisbeth. She has been shown differently and this makes her an interesting character, she downplays emotion and makes unpredictable moves.What went wrong with such a good story that I rated it only 3 stars.I have heard people say that bad translation can ruin a good story. Well, this sets a perfect example in that case. I’m sure, if Steig Larsson could write such a good story then his prose in English would have been readable and interesting enough. What I’m trying to say is, Reg Keeland (the translator) f**ked up this amazing 5 star novel to a 3 star read. I know that I love sleeping but falling asleep at the climax of the story means seriously bad writing.Another thing that this book needs other than good translator is a good editor. There is so much unnecessary excessive detailing of electronic gadgets, let me give you example, Lisbeth’s laptop get run over by a vehicle and now she needs to buy a new one, so here the author goes on to give entire configuration of the laptop that was damaged and again the entire configuration of the laptop she is eyeing to buy. One more, one more, Blomkvist relocates to new house and is taking electronic items out of his bag, here each time he takes out a item, the author write about it with its BRAND NAME, Sony laptop, Sanyo sound recorder, this scanner, that portable printer.And yes, how can I forget all those coffee and sandwich(es). Throughout the entire story, the only things that the characters drank and ate were coffee and sandwich, coffee and sandwich, coffee and sandwich, coffee and sandwich.Last thing that I didn’t liked was the wrap-up of subplot after the central story has already ended. After the story ended, the author goes on further 50 pages or so to put an end to Wennerstrom affair, which is highly unreadable.One thing more is that this was published as trilogy, so even when the main characters life is on line and the situation is supposed to be highly tensed, it isn’t because I know that the main characters will survive because there are two books remaining ahead. Themes explored:This book is originally named- Men who hate Women, and there are many theme explored with abuse of women (in Sweden), like rape, incest, BDSM etc. Many more themes have been explored explicitly in this brilliant review by Riku.",71,-0.9541,0.146,0.724,0.129,0.5459862134862136,NEGATIVE,0.6316

About 3-4 years ago I tried to start this but the beginning just bored me intensely so I quit but damn I wish I didn't.This ended up being SO good. I haven't been this invested or sold on a book in so long! I read 841 pages in 5 days and that's with me watching 2 seasons of Grey's Anatomy in the same time period. I absolutely flew through this book and have already begun reading the second book because I just need more.The plot is actually why I picked this book up when I did. Long story short, I was in the mood for mystery books and I was in a short supply so I had to choose this one! I loved the mystery, the intricacy, the intensity and the chaos and honestly I just loved the entire plot. It was everything I needed, I loved the setting, the writing was so so riveting, I just adored this book from page 1 to page 841.Characters though. Blomkvist is someone I really grew to just love. I loved his attitude and his intensity and his desire to do good and his emotions. Larsson wrote him so well and fleshed him out perfectly. I love his lifestyle and his personality and I feel like I know him so well now even though I don't remember this happening.And Salander, I love her deeply. I will admit she did things I didn't fully agree with, nor understand. But they were so in character for her that I didn't really care in the end. She's such a strong independent character but is also so incredibly childish and broken sometimes that it hurts your heart. The end of the book, literally the last 2 pages, broke my heart for her just a little bit because we saw one instance of emotion from her and it turned out so poorly.So yeah I mean I loved this? Like deeply. Something like 75% of the people I'm friends with on here gave this a 3 star or less and I just can't understand where they saw flaws when I did not. I will say there were like 3 things that did bother me but they did not hugely impact my overall feelings about the book.

“Would you like to meet a corporate legend?”“Does he bite?”“Not on Saturdays!”
Meet Henrik Vanger. An old business magnate who’s been out of the picture for over two decades and who is obsessed with the disappearance of his beloved niece. It’s been decades and the investigations have turned up zilch. Adding to his misery is a yearly gift on his birthday, just like his Harriet used to give him. Someone seems to be taunting him through the gifts.
Harriet Vanger seemed to have dissolved into thin air, and Henrik Vanger’s years of torment had begun. 

 “An unloved girl with an odd behavior. And she always got revenge! In short, she was anything but easy to handle.” 
Meet Lisbeth Salander. An oddity. A cold and mentally challenged young girl who digs up dirt on people for a living. She has a thing for leather jackets (now I do too) and she does some major butt kicking.
“It would be deplorable if the special interests had the power to silence those voices in the media that they find uncomfortable.”
Meet Mikael “Kalle” Blomkvist. An honest financial investigative reporter who’s just been charged and convicted with Libel and faces severe fines and a short jail term, his career looking bleak, if not over.Spurred on by Mikael’s bad run in with the law, Henrik decides to look into his credentials and sets things in motion by hiring Lisbeth to dig up dirt on him. Satisfied with what turns up, Henrik decides to hire Blomkvist to look into the disappearance of Harriet Vanger.Henrik goads him in a legal contract for a year with the offerings Blomkvist wants most.
“Vanger was a practised manipulator—how else had he become one of Sweden’s leading industrialists” 
What starts as a simple formality of looking into the past with no hopes or expectations of finding anything, soon turns up something in form of pictures.
 “In her face can be read…what? Sorrow, shock, fury? Harriet lowers her eyes. Harriet is gone.” 
 What looks like a simple disappearance, soon turns into something much more sinister. With Blomkvist turning up shreds of evidence after evidence, he happens upon Lis and is required to join forces with her.""Good morning, Fröken Salander,"" he greeted her cheerfully. ""It was a late night, I see. Can I come in?""Let the games begin!!This book that comes off across as an investigation into a simple case of disappearance is anything but that. The author creates a very brilliant cover for what is really at the heart of this book and what really is at the heart of this book, is not a pretty picture!!It has some really good dialogue that actually show us the ugly image in the mirror that we so conveniently turn a blind eye to.
“Because it’s so easy,” he said. “Women disappear all the time. Nobody misses them""
The characters are brilliantly shaped and especially that of Froken Salander. She is the most badass girl I have ever read and the best part is how her character curve builds up all through the book and right until the very last sentence. The author keeps her true to her initial image even as he builds her up. ""She wanted to hear him say that he liked her for who she was. That she was someone special in his world and in his life. She wanted him to give her some gesture of love, not just of friendship and companionship.""""What a pathetic fool you are, Salander"" she said out loud to herself.As the book proceeds, there are shocking discoveries made and it becomes apparent that Kalle Blomkvist is clearly out of his depth.“You are a very ordinary little person, Mikael. You would not be able to understand the godlike feeling of having absolute control over someone’s life and death.”Blomkvist faced certain death if not for the Kickass leather jacket clad tattoo wearing delinquent that is Lis.“If I’d waited for the police, you wouldn’t have survived. I wasn’t going to let that motherfucker kill you.”Now to be honest, I always knew where the book was headed and I clearly saw the culprits since after the first quarter of the book. It did manage to pull a small twist on me but after that again I knew what was coming. The suspense actually did not work for me. But other than that I loved how this book was written. A lot of things were dumbed down and explain for better understanding of the readers. Since it is a translation I cannot really say but I would venture that the prose was good too since the translation came of brilliantly.The book never managed to lose steam and is very well paced. It never drags and it does a great job telling a story that is so close to the reality. Also it brings all the issues to a close and does not leave the reader hanging. I completely loved this book and could not put it down despite trying several times and will soon be picking up the second installment bcz I would love to read more of Salander, who is  “an information junkie with a delinquent child’s take on morals and ethics.”However, despite everything the book throws at you and the ugly picture that it paints, I felt a certain thing in my heart and I was mighty glad when the beloved Lis put it in memorable words. It is my personal opinion that I share with Lis and stand by it.“Bitch,” she said. “Who?” “Harriet Fucking Vanger.” Well, you said it, girl. You said it!In the end, I would like to dedicate this review to my friend Sal, who was visibly excited about me reading this book and practically couldn’t wait for me to finish it and has been goading me into picking up the next book.

47,1382253869,09/03/2015,3.0,"We shall begin with a quote from page 630 of the mass market paperback:""Berger thought that the book was the best thing Blomkvist had ever written. It was uneven stylistically, and in places the writing was actually rather poor - there had been no time for any fine polishing - but the book was animated by a fury that no reader could help but notice.""That quote explains perfectly how I feel about this book. An unpolished translation of an unedited book that the world collectively lost their shit over. It goes without saying, if you want insta-success, you need to die (or fake your death, but more on that later) and leave behind a)secret paintings b) proof of sexual escapades with some celebrity c) a buncha manuscripts no one knew you were working on. The author died on November 1st 2004 and the first publication of this book was on January 1st, 2005. They really shoved this novel out, don'tcha think? Shortly after Stieg Larsson passed away, three completed novels were found. Those novels were then published. I don't know about the rest of the series, but this joker is most definitely a first draft. Superfluous detail like character histories that take up whole pages only for that character to never be heard from again, meandering chapters that bring up stuff never again touched upon, page after page of coffee (thanks a heap to Tobin for pointing that shit out because after he mentioned it, I realized there's nary a chapter without someone starting, drinking, or tossing out a pot of coffee). Larsson bit the big one after climbing seven flights of stairs because the elevator in his office building was broken. That's sad, because I would have liked to have read a streamlined version of this book. Which brings me to my next point...The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is actually two books. You have one book that's really quite interesting. This first book gives us the reason everyone lost their shit over it: Lisbeth Salander. Strong women like her are hard to find, and when you do find them, they are without hangups. Salander is fucked up, but keeps on doing her thing. Every scene with her in it is great. Unfortunately, she's strapped to the helm of a truly by-the-numbers cold-case thriller. I like that there's no damsel-in-distress moment in this book, but other than that, this plot and payoff have been done ad nauseam. Which brings me to book two...A financial thriller with a heavy dose of journalistic integrity morals. I don't give a fuck about that part of the story, so I choose not to comment on it, other than to say, Wennerström was never a threat. All that shit happened on the back burner, and it felt like the novel slogged trying to tie up a fuck load of loose strings that I couldn't be bothered to care about. This is, by far, the worst translation I've ever read. There are several places where the translator gave not a single fuck and just threw in what he thought the author might have meant. This is another problem with publishing posthumously. I almost want to read the original Swedish text to see what the author actually wrote. And because it's bound to come up if I don't cite my reasoning behind why I think the translator just gave up at certain parts, I provide the jury with two examples:Example #1:""an apology of a desk""Perhaps the author meant: ""a sorry excuse for a desk""Example #2:""a common and garden bastard""Perhaps the author meant:""a garden variety bastard""Oh, and I see why Daniel Craig was cast as Blomkvist for the 'Murican version of this book's adaptation. Like Craig's other popular character, James Bond, Blomkvist gets more strange than Wilt Chamberlain. Dude fucks all three of the main females in this book. The only reason he didn't fuck Harriet Vanger was because... oops, sorry can't tell you because spoilers!Anyfart, the only way I'll be reading the rest of these doorstops is if someone can assure me we find out more about Salander's past. I'd be willing to slog through another 2,000 pages just to find out more about her. She's the only reason I gave this tired, bloated, posthumously-published-and-unpolished novel three stars instead of two. Because I like her. The rest of the book? Meh.One final bit that's sure to pis some people off:I'm a conspiracy theorist at heart, and I kinda think Larsson faked his death. He was receiving death threats before he died of a heart attack and had been in hiding. What better way to disappear than to have the proceeds from a book to start a new life with. I'm sure Larsson, Tupac, and Elvis are all riding around the Swiss Alps on golden snow mobiles, drinking Orphan Tear vodka, and fucking busty Yetis. In summation: Fuck 50% of this book.

Moving on, this book surpassed all my expectations, I’ve heard nothing but great things about this book but I was still skeptical till I read it.There is absolutely nothing about this book that I don’t like, there was never a boring moment. I love that this book covers lot of extensive topics, when I picked this book, I thought it was going to be just about a murder mystery but the book covers more than that. There is journalism, hacking, dysfunctional family, conspiracies, romance, friendship you name it. I love the writing style adapted by the author, and a special thank you to the translator cause without him I wouldn’t have enjoyed the writing as much as I did and finally to the narrator for doing such an amazing job, he did all the voices and the Sweden accent was superb. The author use comprehensible words and the book is written in third person multiple POV.I adore the depictions of Sweden and all the Sweden names used in the book, I suddenly want to visit there, but would hate to meet a Vanger.CharactersMikael Blomkvist is one of the MC, he is a 42 years old journalist and co owner of millennia a magazine. He is honest, loyal, ethical and kind. I love that he is not prejudicial and is dedicated. His relationship with Salander is one of my favourite thing in the book. Lisbeth Salander  is a 24 year old anorexia, socially awkward, genius. She is also a hacker and has a photographic memory. She has lots of piercings and tattoos, the book is named after her. Her outfit of choice is a t shirt, jeans and leather jacket. Due to her size and cloth choice, she looks like a teenager and people tend to judge her a lot. There is still some stuffs that I don’t know about her, hopefully book two will cover that.The other characters include Erica Berger, the co owner of millennia and Blomkvist’s best friend. The Vanger clan  aka baggage people, Wennerstrom, Armansky and many more.PlotHarriet Vanger disappeared 36 years ago, no body, no one called for ransom. Every year her uncle Henrik Vanger, former CEO of the Vanger corporation gets a present on his birthday, the exact present she used to give him before she disappeared. PI, Police and every method money can buy has been tried but to no avail.Blomkvist was hired by Henrik to find out whatever he can about the Harriet case. Blomkvist hired Salander as his research assistant, what they found was never what they expected, it wasn’t even in their wildest imagination.",62,0.9977,0.071,0.728,0.201,0.5377076411960132,POSITIVE,0.9897

Even though I'm not much into crime fiction, the ""Millennium"" trilogy is the exception that blows me away and leaves me with my arms high up in the air (and that says a lot for this series!).

50,68728894,08/24/2009,4.0,"I’ve been hearing a lot about how good the Swedish mystery writers are, and if this book is any indication, I’m moving to Stockholm and learning the language because I want to get close to the source. I’m usually wary when the hype around a book reaches huge proportions and this novel has been a worldwide phenomenon even before I started seeing it all over the bookstores here in America. But this is one example of when the furor is justified.There are two main characters. Mikael Blomkvist, a veteran financial reporter, and Lisbeth Salander, an anti-social punk with a part-time job as a researcher at a security firm.When the book begins, Blomkvist has just lost a libel case where he had written about criminal wrong doing by a prominent industrialist, Hans-Erik Wennerström. With his reputation in ruins and the magazine he co-owns on the brink of collapse, Blomkvist is summoned to Hedeby Island by Henrik Vanger, the patriarch of a wealthy family. Henrik wants to commission Blomkvist to write a family history, but that’s just a cover story. Henrik’s niece, Harriet, vanished while on Hedeby Island in the early 1960s during a day when the island was cut off from the mainland due to a massive traffic accident on its only bridge. It's the ultimate locked room (or locked island) mystery. Over 30 years of investigation have convinced Henrik that Harriet was murdered, very possibly by someone in the Vanger family, and he wants Blomkvist to comb through the massive amount of material he’s collected and see if he can find anything new about the case.Blomkvist is hesitant, but Henrik not only offers to help cover his financial problems due to the libel case and with the failing magazine, he also claims to have evidence that would prove that Wennerström is a criminal and will help clear Blomkvist’s reputation. Blomkvist agrees and moves to Hedeby Island to begin the research.As this is going on, a parallel story revolving around Lisbeth Salander is also being told. Salander is so anti-social that she can barely function in society and has to endure legal guardianship by the state since it decided that she’s incapable of managing her own life. However, Salander is really a brilliant researcher and computer genius who just can't stand people. Originally hired by Henrik Vanger to vet Blomkvist, Salander becomes intrigued with Blomkvist’s libel case and begins checking out Wennerström on her own. However, changes in her legal status concerning her guardianship soon present her with severe problems in her own life.There were several things I loved about this book, and one of them is the leisurely pace it has for the first half. Most of this portion consists of Blomkvist sitting in a cabin on Hedeby Island reading about Harriet while Salander is in a desperate struggle to reassert some independence against her new guardian. The key part of the mystery about Harriet really doesn’t pick up until the second half of the novel, but it didn’t bother me a bit. I was so caught up in the story that I was perfectly happy to let it unfold as slowly as it wanted.I also loved the characters. Blomkvist is a great reporter and a very decent man, but he can also be selfish and a bit of a shit. The book doesn’t pull any punches in indicating that he isn’t a good father and is a bit too casual in his relationships with women. Salander is unfriendly and lacks any social graces at all so she should be unpleasant to read about. But even before the book engages your sympathy for her due to an extremely bad situation she finds herself in, I couldn’t help but like the damaged girl who has such an anti-authority streak that she refuses to ask for help from the police or lawyers when she has every right and reason to. She’d rather handle her problems herself than engage an authority figure, and she’s got a mean streak.Another thing I liked is that even though this was written before the worldwide 2008 financial implosion, the author Stieg Larsson, who was a financial reporter in Sweden, uses the subplot about Wennerström to illustrate how he felt that financial reporters were entirely too close to the financial bigwigs and no real investigative reporting was being done. Recent revelations about guys like Bernie Madoff makes it clear that Larsson was ringing an alarm bell. Too bad no one listened.Fair warning for those considering reading. The original Swedish title of this book is Men Who Hate Women, and you’ll see why if you read it. Although not overly explicit, there are several segments dealing with rape and sexual assault.Larsson apparently wrote mysteries as a hobby and had completed three but hadn’t tried to publish them until shortly before his death a few years ago. I’m already bummed that there are only going to be two more of these terrific books by him to read.",60,-0.8044,0.124,0.754,0.122,0.5275671253349824,POSITIVE,0.8986

52,2612985698,12/07/2018,5.0,"I believe i have subconsciously avoided this series for a long time due to its popularity. This may sound a little like a paradox; a book raved about and read by millions must be good and worthy of my time but i remember when The Girl on the Train was the next big thing and millions jumped on the bandwagon singing its praises. I personally didn’t rate it very highly and now tend to stay clear of what i call ‘Supermarket Books’.I recently saw The Girl in the Spiders Web, which was a pretty decent film so i thought i’d finally give the main series ago and found all three of the Larsson books in a charity shop. I can confirm it isn’t your average James Patterson thriller, all title and zero substance. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is in a class of its own.Mikael Blomkvist, recently disgraced in court by a libel charge, is hired by the head of the great Vanger Family, Henrik Vanger (who i imagined as Donald Sutherland in his John Paul Getty role) to investigate the disappearance of his niece several decades before. It’s a cold case but Henrik has faith that Mikael will uncover something meaningful. Lisbeth Salander, our tattooed heroine, is a computer hacker supreme with the mindset of a vigilante and when she isn’t being completely bad ass she works as a private investigator. One of her assignments is Mikael Blomkvist, who she inevitably teams up with.As a whodunnit mystery it’s fantastic. The pacing of the investigation is brilliant, with just enough snippets of information gradually uncovered to keep you hooked and guessing until the end. Even though she is the title character Lisbeth isn’t overly used and appears less than Mikael. This keeps her character fresh and when she does show up you pay attention. A bit too much sex for my literary tastes but the majority of the characters are sleazy so it’s expected. ",57,0.9961,0.024,0.788,0.188,0.5049607843137255,POSITIVE,0.8108
53,1311985167,06/19/2015,5.0,"My second time around with Lisbeth and Blomkvist. Someone should do a study some day about why we are pulled to certain books at certain times - the way our body pulls us toward a banana when it's running low on potassium. One of the things I loved about Larsson when I first read him (and why I return to him) is this kind of artlessness that he has about writing. There's a naturalness to the way he tells the story as if the important thing is giving you the facts as expediently as possible. Of course, the facts of the story also include what he thinks is interesting about the characters thoughts, feelings, personal history. You get drawn in by this sense that author is being guided in his narration by an instinct, a scent for what is interesting to him (which he assumes will probably be interesting to you as well) and also by what you sense as his delight in discovering the very thing he's writing about as he is writing it. After he died, his life-long partner wrote that Larsson wrote his trilogy as a hobby. He was bored and wanted something fun to do. Can you imagine? I think that's why I am so attracted to his books and why I go back to them as a source of inspiration for my own writing. How beautiful to write with the passion and interest that a hobby draws from us. Yes, literature and art give meaning to our lives and there are serious messages in Larsson's books and tons of darkness. But I think his inventiveness with plot, his ability to mix reality with fiction, his creation of characters we will never forget starts with the playfulness and joy of a man finally finding a little bit of time to be alone with his hobby.

55,554811260,03/07/2013,1.0,"Rating: zeroThe Publisher Says: Mikael Blomkvist, a once-respected financial journalist, watches his professional life rapidly crumble around him. Prospects appear bleak until an unexpected (and unsettling) offer to resurrect his name is extended by an old-school titan of Swedish industry. The catch—and there's always a catch—is that Blomkvist must first spend a year researching a mysterious disappearance that has remained unsolved for nearly four decades. With few other options, he accepts and enlists the help of investigator Lisbeth Salander, a misunderstood genius with a cache of authority issues. Little is as it seems in Larsson's novel, but there is at least one constant: you really don't want to mess with the girl with the dragon tattoo.My Review: I did not like this book. Many of the things that are so praised about it, for example Lisbeth's survival and empowerment are rancid. Here:Much stronger boys in her class soon learned that it could be quite unpleasant to fight with that skinny girl. Unlike other girls in the class, she never backed down, and she would not for a second hesitate to use her fists or any weapon at hand to protect herself. She went around with the attitude that she would rather be beaten to death than take any shit.Okay, so there's my first issue...a little girl gets picked on and has to hold her own. I don't think that's fun reading because I wasn't protected from bullies as a blind (my astigmatism is very bad) fat kid. Later I turned into the bullier. It's unpleasant to read about.Then there's the book's attitude towards life in general:I’ve had many enemies over the years. If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s never engage in a fight you’re sure to lose. On the other hand, never let anyone who has insulted you get away with it. Bide your time and strike back when you’re in a position of strength—even if you no longer need to strike back.An eye for an eye leaves the whole goddamned world blind, to paraphrase several sources.Lisbeth's horrific experiences and her scars of all sorts aren't the only unpleasant realities of her life:Her voice was as rough as sandpaper. As long as Blomkvist lived, he would never forget her face as she went on the attack. Her teeth were bared like a beast of prey. Her eyes were glittering, black as coal. She moved with the lightning speed of a tarantula and seemed totally focus on her prey as she swung the club again, striking Martin in the ribs.Her behavior is understandable. Her motives are crystal-clear. I think it's repugnant. I think the author's tone isn't in the least indicative of a woman's seizing the power the world did its goddamnedest to rip away from her. It is instead prurient, verging on pornographic, and not the good kind.",48,-0.9969,0.189,0.74,0.071,0.5198067632850241,NEGATIVE,1.0
56,3759254690,01/09/2021,5.0,"Stieg Larsson wrote exceptional characterizations, which shattered the glass ceiling of my understanding of what a female heroine can take. In essence, he took a couple of pre-existing Swedish fictional characters, Kalle Blomkvist and Pippi Longstocking (both by the author Astrid Lindgren), and brutally modernized them. He made Lisbeth Salander, his heroine, a gritty, super-intelligent, firecracker of a lead. She dominated the series even though the story started with Mikhael Blomkvist, an investigative reporter caught in a series of intrigues. Rather than Mikhael remain the book's main star, he becomes Lisbeth's partner and then eventually her sidekick. While he is sensuous, calm, and by-the-book, she has a knife-edge fragility and outsized personal strength honed by years of trauma, rejection, loss, and victimization. Lisbeth absorbed the worst of misogyny before turning the tables to become what misogynists fear most: a strong, brilliant, independent, fierce woman.My copy of his debut is dog-eared and torn from rereading. I devoured it to understand better how to make a character come alive. I am sure I will reread it again this year. His two sequels don't seem as polished, but he had died before he could re-edit them (as most writers would so early in the process). It's a shame. If you haven't yet, check this book out.

The English/American version is very good too, and I think the best thing would be to combine casts (although I can TOTALLY understand why Noomi refused to do the second adaptation when they asked her).3.5 stars""It was uneven stylistically, and in places the writing was actually rather poor -- there had been no time for any fine polishing -- but the book was animated by a fury that no reader could help but notice.""This line from the epilogue leaped out at me as one of the best ways to explain this book itself. Makes me wonder if Larsson had a premonition about his manuscript. As I mentioned in an update, I have to agree with what most people have said about this book: it drags in the beginning and takes forever to set things up and get moving, but once it does it's a pretty good ride. Also: I HIGHLY recommend the audio, read by Simon Vance. If not for him, I doubt I would have read this for another ten years. One thing I really feel the need to point out is how absolutely misleading the English title for this book is. Personally, I don't see Lisbeth as the main focus of this novel-- sure, she and Mikael are the co-protagonists, but the book doesn't revolve solely around her. The Swedish title is literally ""Men Who Hate Women"", which makes MUCH more sense and is something readers ought to keep in in the back of their mind as they read this. Lisbeth and Mikael are themselves both great, flawed characters, but the original title is essentially handing you the theme of the whole book rather than focusing on one individual character.Although, what an individual she is. Lisbeth may be the smartest literary heroine I've read, and she's absolutely fascinating. I know next to nothing about hacking (or journalism or finance, for that matter), but she gave me such an adrenaline rush because of the high she got out of doing her job to the best of her ability. Otherwise, I feel like I can relate to her on some levels. She broke my heart with her optimism by the end of the novel, and I was coolly in tune with her standoffish attitude in the earlier pages. I've got both follow-up books on the shelf upstairs, but I think I'll look into the audio first; Larsson has (had?) a very dry style, and if the others take awhile to set things up like this one did, I'll be glad for the audio. I do feel like things could have been sped up a bit in the beginning, edited better and whatnot, and Mikael seemed a bit inconsistent earlier in the book. The second half of the book is so strong, though, that it pushed a lot of my qualms aside in favor of hearing the rest of the story unravel.And as far as the murder-mystery stitched into the middle, no, technically I did NOT guess the culprit on the first shot (big surprise, I'm terrible at that).

At other times it was, frankly, quite dull and wordy.I do wonder why it has become so popular, and been translated into so many languages. Perhaps it is because of the current predilection for Scandinavian detective thrillers. This one has 2 distinct threads. One is a devious (and rather nasty) story of a missing/murdered girl; an unsolved cold-case. The other plot is about Industrial corruption. Unusually, the former plot is solved about three quarters of the way through, and it is then difficult to retain the suspense to the end of the novel. Larsson does this quite neatly by detailing complicated computer transactions and manoeuvres by the central character, who is a delinquent maverick young woman.Since it is the first of a trilogy, I am interested to see where the action will take us next time.

I re-read this book and love it even more the second time! Now that I know what to expect I skipped the (view spoiler)[ rape scene, which is too vivid and graphic and disgusting and just ew! but somehow necessary  (hide spoiler)] My friends asked me why would I re-read if I was disgusted by that scene. The answer is simple: Women, rarely get revenge IRL. I loved how the bad guys in this book got what was coming for them. When Lisbeth gets her revenge I feel like I'm vicariously getting mine. I love it.Lisbeth is a force of nature, a complex character like no other, one of my favorite heroines ever. I love how she had her own moral code and stick to it. She's extremely smart and could use her hacking talent to do very bad things, but she doesn't. She just wants to be left alone. Not everyone accepts Lisbeth the way she is, she looks weak and weird and people will try to bully her and abuse her, but she doesn't care. She has tricks under her sleeve.The rest of the characters are all bizarre, but somehow believable and interesting. Blomksvit and Erika Berger, a married woman, have a relationship ... and the husband knows! It's just an open marriage, but nobody gets hurt.  I'll say The girl with the dragon tattoo is an ode to diversity. I love it and the movie was amazing! Rooney Mara was robbed her Oscar. I heard because Meryl streep won instead, but watch that movie and you'll see how Rooney was robbed big time.As a mystery I wouldn't say it's the best. I guessed early how Harriet's ""body"" has vanished, and narrowed down the suspects to two. What I couldn't guess was the kind of tricky story that was behind the family drama.

Resume normal reading when Armansky appears because he'll introduce the heroine. * Keep the family tree at hand so you don't get confused. * Get ready to feel disgusted.

I thought ""lost in translation"" meant the author's writing style was lost in translation, not the entire novel's plotline, not to mention decent pacing, any or all character development, and my interest. Half of the story is characters making coffee. No one on the planet drinks that much coffee without the other half of the novel being about people pooping. Character needs to talk to someone? They're going to get coffee. Meeting in the office? Let's describe the coffee cart! Minor plot development? Put the kettle on, I need to stare dejectedly into black liquid while I tell you about it. Coffee is a diuretic, people. Trust me, I live in Los Angeles. Do you ever wonder why Starbucks is the only public place left where you can still use the bathroom without needing a token or a key taped to a giant spoon/placard/trinket? There aren't enough tokens on the planet to counter the effects of so many venti non-fat soy lattes. I'm secretly convinced that if you stake out your local joint often enough as a ""wannabe writer"" you can get an ""Easy Pass"" for that line. Or you're asked to contribute toilet paper.For mostly being about coffee, this book was infuriatingly long for no reason other than to give inane and unimportant backstory about things that don't end up mattering in the first place because *SPOILER ALERT* the ending of this novel is easier to guess than the ending of ""Junie B Jones Goes to Field Day"".

The main character whose name I can't be bothered to spell right, so let's just call him Daniel Craig, he's going to release an awesome ""HA IN YOUR FACE WEINNERSTURMENSAUSAGESS COMPANY!"" article that totally proves he's been right all along, and makes him a hero, and saves everyone in the company, and puts all the bad guys in jail! And then, in the novel... Daniel Craig releases an awesome ""IN YOUR FACE"" article that makes him a hero and puts all the bad guys in jail. I felt like I was watching Matlock with my mother. JUNIE B. JONES GOES TO FIELD DAY EVERYONE. SHE GOES. THE END. BUT BEFORE SHE GOES WE'RE GOING TO DESCRIBE HER LUNCH EVERYDAY IN EXCRUCIATING DETAIL, THEN NEVER BRING IT UP AGAIN.Seriously, I don't know why I read about the tech specs of Lisbeth's iBook processor. I can't fathom why I dredged through pointless drivel about the network of companies owned by WEINNERSTRUMENSAUSAGES (that's the name I've given them because I seriously CANNOT PICK UP THIS BOOK AGAIN to look at what it really is, and also because whenever we're drinking coffee in this book it's accompanied by a horrible sounding sandwich that's usually made of a combination of liver, rye, liver sausage, pickles, sausage, or liver-flavored rye bread. So obviously, and because I skimmed most of the pointless decription of the evil-Wennerwhatever companies various worldwide holdings, we're renaming them and it should have to do with meat products).Wow that was a long... well, whatever these: ""(...)"" are called.Where were we? Oh yeah, I can't fathom why I dredged through pointless drivel about WINNERSTRUMENSAUSAGES when none of it was relevant to the actual take down of the company via Daniel Craig's ""HA IN YOUR FACE"" article, besides giving the author and excuse to dress Lisbeth up in wigs and give her fake boobs. Multiple pages devoted to backstory upon backstory of Vanger family history when we only meet 3 characters more than once, none of them are interesting or move the plot forward, and the ""GASP!

My family.""Translated from Swedish by Reg Keeland ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson"" is a crime sensation since the day it was released. The story starts when Mikael Blomkvist - an investigative journalist - is invited by the head of one of the Swedish's wealthiest families to investigate a family tragedy that happened nearly forty years ago. Harriet Vanger - the niece of Henrik Vanger - disappeared forty years ago and to this day the disappearance remains a mystery. Mikael Blomkvist along with his prodigy partner, Lisbeth Salander, sets on an investigative journey that will lead them to the dark corners of human mind filled with corruption, lust and anger.The thing with big books is that they tend to be on a slower side in the beginning but if you're someone who reads big books constantly then you'd know they have so much to offer once you're past that initial phase. Same is the case with this one, I have seen people mentioning that they had a hard time getting into the book but for me it was an instant page turner the moment I picked it up. I don't know why but something about this story wouldn't let me stop reading it. I realize that, yes, the story is slow in the beginning but I will urge you to bear with it if you wanna witness one of the greatest crime novels ever written. As the book was originally published in Swedish and we know a lot can be lost in translation but I never felt anything like that when I was reading it. I don't know what qualifies for a good writing, whether it's poetic prose or something else but for me the writing is good as long as it is easy to read and has a flow and this book doesn't lack in any of those.Lisbeth Salander who is one the protagonists of this thriller is one the most profoundly written character you'll ever find on paper. Even after being socially awkward and having no empathy, she'll make you fall in love with her which shows the ingenuity of her character. After having read so many ""supposed strong female protagonists"" in books, the respect for Lisbeth has only increased in my eyes because in my opinion, that is how you write a strong female lead.Like Salander, the plot of this book is also multi-layered which Larsson peels off at the right moments to keep you at the edge of your seat till the ending. As for a story that is laced with the theme of sleuth, this book doesn't over emphasizes on shocking the audience but rather relies on revealing the dark side of human nature and for that alone, it deserves an applaud.

He gets help in this work from a hacker, Lisbeth Salander, and there's some hope this case will get him something to fight against Hans-Erik Wenneström, a somewhat shady businessman, in the end. But there's a lot of monsters in this family's closets, some of which are quite not dead yet, and danger lies very close to them...I have seen bits of both film versions of this book, so some of it was already familiar, and I had sneaked a look at the end, so much I knew but it still was a ride that impressed me. Like with some other books, things really start moving around the middle, and the Wenneström case bookends the story neatly (he used to (view spoiler)[work for the Vangers, but had to leave after causing much trouble; the information bait wasn't really of use, but certainly motivated the pair in finishing him (hide spoiler)]). There is a number of men that fit with the original title of the book, ""Men Who Hate Women"", like certain Vanger men ((view spoiler)[especially Martin, Gottfried, and Harald, but no doubt also at least Birger (hide spoiler)]), Wenneström, Lisbeth's father, and the one who replaced Lisbeth's (view spoiler)[previous carer, who got his punsihment - Mr Bjurman (hide spoiler)]. But another group which balanced these are men like Mikael (who while good in bed with *many* women never gets pushy in getting them there), Erika's husband, Holger Palmgren (you wish he'd have had more time and health), and Lisbeth's employer, Dragan Armanski.The climax of the book is quite short (about 20 pages), and the signs of its approach (the threats) happen very near it, so it was not hard for me to keep reading - I read way more than usually do with these kinds of books. And the latter Wenneström bookend had me (view spoiler)[grinning quite a lot (hide spoiler)]. A good story with well-done ending is always a good sign for me.

The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is an outstanding and thoughtful mystery-thriller story. Stieg Larsson creates a shrewd and wry couple working a serial killer cold case: a fearless, womanizing journalist and a hardened trust-no-one punk hacker. Loved them! There is an artlessness to Larsson’s writing, the way he tells his story so easily, that draws the reader and I couldn't let it be. A delightful reading!

There is a quality to his writing I cannot exactly place, but it is backed up by a unique storyline.One character that fascinated me was Lisbeth Salander. Other characters often described her as a creature, or having an animalistic, unusual appearance. It was not just her physical presence that intrigued me, but her mental capabilities. She possessed a surly strength and complete disregard to society's traditions and rules. I want to read the next two books in the series so that I can see how Salander deals with her current predicament and how she will change as a person, for better or worse.None of the other characters stood out to me, but I am curious to see where Blomkvist, Berger, and maybe even the Vanger family end up in the next couple books. I was hesitant to start this series because the hype surrounding it reminded me of Dan Brown novels, which I do not find phenomenal.

***Movie Update: I just saw the movie today and I have to say that it was so much better than the book! The pacing was great, the actress who played Lisbeth Salander nailed the role and all the Financial Journalism nonsense was obliterated. Even the Blomkvist-Cecilia love affair was not seen. The movie has awesome camera shots and it was a very good adaptation of the book. Even made the book amazing in my eyes. Now I'm really confused why I don't think that the book was awesome when I read it. Well I'll just blame it on the author's writing. I'll caution on some disturbing rape scenes, nudity, foul language and violence on women though. (R-18 and not for sensitive audience.)*** Book Review:Caution: The book contains rape, incest and misogyny, if you don't like to read a book that sick and disturbing don't read this. Review may contain spoilers. Pros:1. The book is a mystery/crime/suspense/thriller ergo a breath of fresh air for a reader of paranormal, fantasy and romance genres.2. The book has an interesting heroine in the name of ""Lisbeth Salander"" who was four feet 11, antisocial, anorexic and has no boobs, but inspite of that was an exceptional hacker with a photographic memory. Not to mention she got piercings and tattoos that's why she's so bad ass. (She's the girl with the dragon tattoo so to speak.)3. Cool thing was the murderer uses Bible verses and then parodied it into his crimes.4. The book also talks about hacking and you will also learn a thing or two about poisons.Cons:1. I hated books that have slow pace and definitely this book was slow as a slug. The action sets in only on the second half of the book.2. Pointless, pointless details! The author would describe clothes, sandwiches, and writes just anything the character was doing (drinking coffee, jogging or reading a particular book).3. The casual sex! Blomkvist would have sex with Berger and then later on would also have sex with Cecilia and then much later on would have sex with Lisbeth. Surprisingly no one got Syphilis at the end.4. The book talks a lot about Financial Journalism wherein from the first chapter had irritated me because I don't have a f****** clue what they're talking about and I don't even care about Financial Journalism that it really makes me bored to sleepiness (I even skimmed on the epilogue because I really don't give a damn). 5. Plot too many (to put it simply).6. Rape scenes of Lisbeth was SICK!7. Predictable and cliche: - Blomkvist go to Martin's House - Martin locked Blomkvist on the basement - Martin was the murderer. - Just as about the murderer would kill Blomkvist, Lisbeth came. - Blomkvist was saved of course. - Martin escaped. - Lisbeth followed Martin's car on the road using her motorcycle. - Martin's car was hit by the truck (talk about ANTICLIMACTIC!)8. The Mystery ended with this: Gottfried was a sick murderer, he loves killing women, he taught his son Martin about it too. Martin also loves killing women too. Gottfried rapes her daughter Harriet. Harriet killed his father. Martin witnessed the incident. Martin rapes her sister. Harriet cannot tell anyone about it because Martin would tell everyone that she kills their father. Harriet was not murdered when she disappeared on Hedesby Island, she only escapes, she was alive and she was living on Australia using Anita's identity. (I was disappointed by it because I was really expecting she was murdered and the murderer was a genius to hide the evidence, but it was just Harriet escaping WTF!) ___________________________________________________________________I'm so happy I've found a copy on Booksale for only Php130.00!",25,-0.9971,0.188,0.702,0.11,0.5562190476190475,NEGATIVE,0.9957

77,3643671244,11/13/2020,5.0,"A Surprise Book Group ChoiceOur book group chose to read Stieg Larsson's popular novel, ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo."" Several other of the many reader reviewers of this title appear to have come to the book in the same way. I had grown bored when I watched the DVD based on the novel and thus had little expectation for the book. Our book group usually does not choose thrillers. But I was surprised because the novel is indeed a page-turner. I couldn't put it down.There are at least three interrelated stories in this yarn of a book which is primarily set in Sweden early in the 21st Century. The two major characters are Michael Blomkvist, a liberal financial journalist who aims to expose corruption in large companies and Lisabeth Salander, the title character, a gifted but troubled young woman of 24 who is under the guardianship of the state but who is a whiz with computers and at investigation. As it progresses, much of the book involves the unlikely professional and personal relationships that develop between Blomkwist and Salander.As the book opens, Blomkvist has just been sentenced to a short prison term for libeling a major industrial tycoon named Wennerstrom. (Libel laws obviously are much more stringent in Sweden than in the United States where this scenario whould have been most unlikely.) At the trial, for reasons that stay obscure for much of the book, Blomkvist declines to defend the accusations he had leveled against Wennestrom and loses his case and his reputation. He and Salander investigate the case further as the book proceeds.The other mystery plot is much more interesting and well- developed. When he loses his libel case, Blomkvist is summoned to a remote island in northern Sweden by an aging industrialist named Vanger. Vanger offers to pay Blomkvist a substantial sum to investigate the disappearance of his young niece Harriet in 1965, nearly 40 years earlier. At that time, Harriet was a girl of 16. She disappeared mysteriously after a festival, when the attention of the island residents was diverted by an automobile crash on a bridge leading to the mainland. Vanger has spent much of his life, since Harriet's disappearance investigating how she died and who killed her. He has had no success. Blomkvist reluctantly becomes involved. As the story progresses, Salander comes to assist him in this investigation and in the separate investigation of Wennerstrom.The story of Vanger is complex, chilling, and tawdry. It basically involves the entire Vanger family, many of whose members live on the island and dislike each other intensely. The investigation of Harriet and her fate take up most of the book.The story is for the most part well-paced and carefully constructed. There is a large group of characters, including Blomkvist's married lady friend, the various Vangers, the Vanger's lawyer, and especially Salander.As the book develops, the scene shifts from one character and place to another. Tension builds throughout, and the story can be readily followed with its twists and turns without getting confused. There are some chillingly evil scenes in this book.The pace of the book flags towards the end. The Vanger-Harriet part of the story resolves substantially before the book concludes, and the focus of the story returns to Wennerstrom and his claimed financial manipulations and corruptions. This portion of the story is much less interesting than the companion story, and it drags on too long. It seemed to me anticlimactic. The Wennerstrom story and the Vagner-Harriet story both form the occasion for a good deal of preaching on the subjects of sexual exploitation and abuse and large capitalistic corruption and irresponsibility. Ordinarily, I am wary of books with these kinds of ideological preoccupations. But in this case the themes were integrated convincingly into the story the author had to tell. Thus, these themes did not interfere with my enjoyment of the book. I did not find the novel ideologically driven.This was a long, riveting book, which I took up half-heartedly but found I could not put down. I am not sure that the remainder of the trilogy is for me, but I found this book fascinating and well-worth the attention both that I gave it and that the book has received.Robin Friedman",24,-0.4142,0.09,0.823,0.087,0.470740405866988,POSITIVE,0.6674

I have heard about the Millennium series and have added them on my to-read from long time, many time I got from library but didn’t actually read due to unknown reason. Before reading this I didn’t even watch the movie too. As I said earlier I always like mystery the most, but how about mystery added with psychology, sadists, an extra degree of violence co-related with bible.

She supports herself by doing deep background investigations for Dragan Armansky, who, in turn, worries the anorexic-looking Lisbeth Salander is ""the perfect victim for anyone who wished her ill."" Salander may look fourteen and stubbornly shun social norms, but she possesses the inner strength of a determined survivor. She sees more than her word processor page in black and white and despises the users and abusers of this world. She won't hesitate to exact her own unique brand of retribution against small-potatoes bullies, sick predators, and corrupt magnates alike, she avoid social contact. Her encounters with their guardian were totally spine chilling and riveting. On the other hand we have, Mikael Blomkvist who has just been convicted of libeling a financier and is facing a fine and three months in jail. Blomkvist, after a Salander-completed background check, is summoned to a meeting with semi-retired industrialist Henrik Vanger whose far-flung empire is wholly family owned. Vanger has brooded for 36 years about the fate of his great niece, Harriet. Blomkvist is expected to live for a year on the island where many Vanger family members still reside and where Harriet was last seen. Under the cover story that he is writing a family history, Blomkvist is to investigate which family member might have done away with the teenager.  While this two stories were moving totally different, I was sure about one thing their paths will cross for sure but didn’t know where how when, one thing that make The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is totally out of box is that - shocking sexual violence primarily against women but not excluding men. Salander and Blomkvist both confront prima facie evidence of such crimes. Rape, child abuse, family issues, family politics, exploitation of women, in all sections of society, rich, poor, even at orphanage was told; several cuts are there and each one is deeply plotted. At times, it feels the book is reaching toward end, but then it takes the U-turn. Last 200 pages has been immensely loveable, I loved it, I totally devoured it. After completing book, I watched the movie have to say I didn’t enjoy it much, I felt many characters are missed. This is the book which is truly something not to be missed, and will not soon be forgotten. I would love to continue the series. And it can be explained as Posthumous debuts are a rarity. In the last, I would say the book lived upto its hype. So, I ll sign off by 5/5.",25,0.8268,0.106,0.777,0.117,0.4925106192711826,POSITIVE,0.8883
79,186025273,07/18/2011,4.0,"Hard to grade this one- where as most of it was totally amazing, there is the beginning and the end that pulls it down for me because really, the best part of the story is when the protags were chasing down a killer- which only happens in the middle of the story, oddly enough. (The beginning and ending is almost another story all together!) Bestselling The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo begins with investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist being hung out to dry for a piece he wrote that went horribly wrong. Through much of the beginning and to a lesser extent, the ending when Blomkvist gets his revenge for the happenings in the beginning, my eyes began to cross at the seemingly pointless blahdy blah blah of Larrson explaining how Blomkvist got into his current predicament. But really it was Blomkvist's desire to hide away from his circumstances that made him accept a job offer from eccentric former captain of industry, Henrik Vanger- a frail old man haunted by the disappearance of a long gone relative- that brings us to the exciting part. So I guess I can make the bridge as to why it began the way it did.Meanwhile we get to meet Lisbeth Salander, a brilliant but socially awkward researcher for a private investigator, who just happens to be assigned the task of investigating Blomkvist for the Vanger family. She’s secretive, sullen, punked out, and- of course- tatooed , but she does a helluva job. However, she finds herself distracted from her assignment when her guardianship is changed and taken over by a loathsome individual. (An individual on whom she exacts some spectacular revenge! At this point in the novel, I literally sat up, bug-eyed then dug in and didn’t look up till my eyelids refused to stay open late into the night!)Indeed it was this insight into her character the ignites the novel and doesn’t let up until the ending, especially when she eventually joins Blomkvist covertly re-investigating the mystery surrounding Vanger's beloved niece's death under the guise of writing his familys’ checkered history. Murder, intrigue, sex and violence- what more can you ask for in a mystery-thriller? It’s no surprise this little beauty been hitting the must read/bestseller lists for forever now. (Btw, this part of the story totally reminded me of a Criminal Minds episode, one of my favorite shows!)Through his body of work, Larsson brutally exposes obvious purveying attitudes of violence toward women and antisemitism... attitudes being swept under the carpet of Swedish society. I love how he boldly empowers Lisabeth in a way few women would have the intelligence and courage to pull off, yet wraps her in a vulnerability that many woman can relate to. The second protag, Blomkvist, is a man-ho to be sure, but something about his innate nobility makes him extremely likeable too.

80,1215518389,03/01/2015,5.0,"Wow.Usually, I try to avoid books which have received a massive hype, since I've never before really liked any of them, but after several recommendations and my own growing interest in the character of Lisbeth Salander (who I have heard a lot of before), I decided to buy ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" and give the book a chance. Well, after finishing this first book in the series, the paperback editions of the second and third book are already placed on my shelves, so ... yes, you can guess that I enjoyed it immensely.Most things about this book which might be criticized or praised have already been stated in other reviews, so I don't think it would make any apparent difference if I repeated those aspects in my review. Stieg Larsson's down-to-earth writing style was sometimes irritating to read because of a lack of emotional binding which Larsson was not able to fully create. However, I started to like Lisbeth Salander early on and became very interested in the fates of other characters, Mikael Blomkvist and Erika Berger in particular, but also realistically portrayed characters such as Henrik or Cecilia Vanger.The best thing about this book was the mystery, its background and the consequences arising from the huge reveal. If you haven't read the book before and start reading it, don't even try to guess the mystery's solution. For me, it was unpredictable and shattering at the same time. As soon as I began to realize how shocking the reveal was about to become, I couldn't put this pageturner down again.After the huge turning point, more than one hundred pages were necessary to finish the story, which Larsson might have done differently in my opinion, since the ending was a lot slower to read than the climax, but I'm not disappointed at all. And the most important thing - Lisbeth Salander is one of the most impressive characters I've ever encountered. I've read some reviews complaining about the lack of a matching family tree and/or map of the fictional Hedeby island where most of the action takes place. Fortunately, both were provided in my edition, so I was always able to follow the story's locational course. In general, you shouldn't expect to find any plot holes in this first part of the ""Millennium"" trilogy. It sometimes becomes boring (mostly during the first hundred pages which provide a lot of necessary information, but never truly interesting or stunning stuff), it sometimes becomes too fast-paced, but never do any of the incidents in this book lack a logical explanation.There is a lot of graphic violence in this book, but if you love a well-written crime/mystery/thriller book with excellently developed characters and an intense back story which will leave you speechless and shocked, then I can't recommend reading it enough.Now on to the second book in the series.

The book that prompted a complete stranger to approach me while I was reading it, hold up his identical copy, and say, ""I met three other people today who were reading this""? Seriously?I'm not saying it's bad. It's not. This is a book about a petite asocial hacker girl, a mystery, and a bunch of Swedes who enjoy open sandwiches and having sex with each other. Salander is a reasonable and likeable secondary protagonist, insofar as she is just alien enough to be intriguing without being offputting. She doesn't, you know, eat babies. Though I suppose she might taze one. One she didn't like. She's also all semi-superheroic, so, you know, yay. Blomkvist and the rest are tasteful, adequate, and fairly dull. Kind of like Ikea! **looks up and sees feet resting on an Ikea coffee table, right next to an Ikea lamp, and an Ikea mug**Now, the bad. Structurally, this novel is moronic. It's like Larsson, a Swedish business journalist, started writing a novel about hideously complicated financial fraud and the daring, handsome, sexually irresistible Swedish business journalist who brings down those nasty pinstriped gangster behemoths and makes the world safe... to invest! Except 50 pages in or so he himself was so mind-numbingly bored that he stopped the financial nonsense and bent the story into a more conventional murder mystery... only to pick up the financial nonsense in a protracted denouement. I fail to see how this can be blamed on translation.What you *might* be able to blame on our poor translator friend Reg Keeland are lines like these:""We have to play it by ear, and right now it's time to retreat.""She reluctantly admitted that there was a depressing logic to what he said. [end chapter:] (p. 68)""She moved with the lightning speed of a tarantula...""

As the story unraveled, twisted and turned I was left completely addicted and I desperately needed to know what was going to happen! I had no clue that the mystery was going to end up the way it did, it was a pretty big shocker! The story did get a lot darker as it went on but I found myself becoming more intrigued and obsessed with the storyline.

This book isn't exactly child friendly. I guess it's safe to say that all I happened to recall in bits and bobs rereading this was the killer, the horrifying mutilation of the victims, the 'weird' sex life of Blomkvist and lastly Salanders interesting choice of apparel. But what my teenage self couldn't understand was how well written this was; the nuances, the character building, details and all the foreshadowing. Ah it was perfection truly, although I do wish I could read this in it's original Swedish. I can only imagine how great it'd be if the english translation was this clear and straight forward. Now.. for the complainers:YES this is a 'big' book and YES holding it up for long will give you a nice little wrist workout but... bear patience, the story is original, a bit scary and overall just a thrill to read. Fans of mysteries, crime and dysfunctional relationships will love this to bits.The only negative I have to say about this would probably have to be the title change.

However, I found Lisbeth Salander to be a very interesting character, and I think I will definitely read the next instalment when it is translated. On a silly note, I found the Swedish names quite difficult ... some were very similar and I found that I had to go back to check that the same person hadn't cropped up in the story elsewhere (eg Burman and Bjurman!)All in all, a good read, but not quite up to expectations!",24,0.9214,0.063,0.794,0.143,0.4631481481481481,NEGATIVE,0.9995

I liked that each storyline was vaguely connected but that while not necessarily related, Salander's storyline established her history, personality, and potential.After that wrapped up, she was able to progress as a person emotionally as well as professionally and I think she had a great storyline. Blomkvist was more of the static character but he was multifaceted too at least.You know, i did read this because as I'm musing on the characters I remember as a high schooler being so interested in the action and kick-assery, that i couldn't believe my dad read it and was focusing more on the characters, but throughout the years for some reason Salander was a favorite character study of his Anyway - I think the Swedes have a certain distinct style of writing thrillers and mysteries that also incorporates a little more horror and grotesque that most other cultures. I read The Wolf and the Watchman maybe last year and the absolute horror story involved reminded me of the hatred and violence in this book.Totally love it, and I also was really glad for some reason that - now bear with me - anytime a Nazi pops up they are usually the criminal, but while the Nazi in this book was obviously a shithead - he wasn't one of the main antagonists, more like some crazy old guy.I had no freaking idea who the real criminal(s) were.

86,1779206508,12/02/2016,5.0,"As best I can remember this is the first translated novel I’ve read and I opened it wondering if a given style actually could be translated effectively. It was a non-issue, as Larsson had a straight ahead, no frills narrative. That settled, I started looking--involuntarily, almost subconsciously--for comparisons. The novel opened on a single, particularly-interesting aspect of greater mystery before expanding outward, similar to the way John Dickson Carr used to set up his stories. This is not that. Then with each character introduction we got entire backstories, reminiscent of the paperback originals John D. MacDonald wrote in the 50s. Not that either. It turns out it only felt like the entire backstory. There were many facets left to reveal as Dragon Tattoo became its own thing. Of course the novel had its own identity all along; the other perceptions were mine alone.The story opens as recently disgraced financial journalist Mikael Blomkvist is hired by Swedish industrialist Henrik Vanger to solve the disappearance and presumed murder of his brother’s granddaughter, whom he loved as if his own daughter, thirty-six years earlier. The driving force behind the arrangement is time: Vanger has little left and Blomkvist has nothing but, as his loss of credibility currently prohibits him from working with any effectiveness at his profession. Unknown to Blomkvist, before being offered the assignment he had been thoroughly investigated by a freelance researcher for a prestigious security firm, Lisbeth Salander, for whom the novel is titled. We follow both characters. They each have particular talents, and Salander specifically has endured some extreme hardships.Time is also applicable when describing the book itself. It is well over 600 hundred pages and the story covers more than a year. This is not a detriment. Larsson makes each scene feel like just another day in the lives of his characters, and this continues to hold as extraordinary things begin to happen, some of which will include violent confrontations and harrowing experiences. He neither builds toward each act nor floods the aftermath with relief. Instead he allows only as much emotion as the viewpoint character is feeling and no more--an effect that makes it feel as if these events were actually happening across the street from our homes rather than in a dramatic presentation. This lack of structural manipulation also permits him to expose the killer with a good quarter of the book left. By then the reader has been conditioned. We gladly come along as other elements in the story are leisurely closed out. It’s just the next day in their lives.Which makes it all the more sad that Stieg Larsson did not live to enjoy his worldwide success. He died shortly after delivering three completed manuscripts, of which this is the first. I’m grateful that it was three and not one. Perhaps the publishing model is different in his country but I can’t imagine an American publisher printing a single book; they would want the prospect of slowly building the readership with later additions to the inventory and access to the writer for publicity. I’ve only read the first of Larsson’s work but I feel safe in saying that the world is better for the existence of all three.",23,0.9556,0.078,0.802,0.12,0.4798627925746571,NEGATIVE,0.9947
87,103043950,05/16/2010,5.0,"Upon a recommendation from Mr. Scott Mosier (not directly, obviously), I decided to embrace the culture of Sweden and pick up Stieg Larsson's blockbuster, ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo."" Before this book, my three biggest exposures to Sweden were Mats Sundin, the Swedish Chef from The Muppets and Drew Barrymore's character from Wayne's World - not exactly a broad spectrum of Swedish culture.I loved this book. Loved it. It might have something to do with the incredibly LOW expectations that I had going in. For whatever reason, I refused to buy into the hype - only because the hype was so huge. I haven't exactly had a great track record when it comes to ""blockbuster"" books but I did my best to keep an open mind. I'm not particularly coming off as a snob - the amount of books I've read will clear that up - I just have been let down in the past. Most of the praise has been directed towards ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" herself, Lizbeth Salender. I can understand it, she's a very strong female lead and I enjoyed her throughly but to me, she's pretty much on equal footing with Blomkvist. The two make a terrific team, it'd be hard to imagine one without the other. The fact that it's a trilogy is a little confusing to me - things are wrapped up pretty clearly at the end of this book. There are a few things left unanswered - but nothing major. That being said, I'm pretty happy that I get a chance to read about these characters two more times. There's talk about farming out the characters to another writer once the trilogy is over as Larsson passed away in 2004 - but I don't see the point.*** Not everything needs to go on forever. That being said, that's easy for me to say when I've only read the first book.***Update: Unless you've been been on Mars, in a cave, with your eyes shut and your fingers in your ears, you'd know that they released a fourth book but another author - The Girl in the Spider's Web",23,0.9957,0.035,0.791,0.174,0.5360185185185183,POSITIVE,0.9897
88,1023307144,08/10/2014,1.0,"**ETA: If you haven't yet read this book, this review might be a tad confusing. The first half of this review is done tongue-planted-firmly-in-cheek, lightly mocking Larsson's tedious writing style. ***It was late and I needed to find a book to read.Tomorrow I was due for a long, boring car ride and needed something to pass the time. I perused the books on my shelf. There were countless of paperbacks: trashy bodice rippers and old-time historical romances, mixed in with a plethora of newer Harlequin Presents and Science Fiction anthologies. There was “UC Davis’s Book of Dogs: A Complete Medical Reference for Dogs and Puppies” or “The Seven Language Dictionary” (with French, German, Hebrew, Russian, Spanish, Portuguese and Italian words translated into English). There lay a copy of Anne Tyler’s “Breathing Lessons,” for which she had won a Pulitzer Prize. Next to it was “If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B Movie Actor,” by the renowned thespian Bruce Campbell. Of course I might yet again read ""The Best of H.P. Lovecraft: Bloodcurdling Tales of Horror and the Macabre.” No? Perhaps then Paulina Simons’ “The Bronze Horseman,” a thick 800+ page epic in World War II Russia with even a Q & A reading section at the end.Hmm? No. None of them would do. I would require audio for this lengthy trip and knew that thanks to the mighty technical wizards at Apple, I would be in good hands. I sat on my faux-leather Staples chair at my scuffed, pressed-board desk and turned on my ancient HP desktop with a flickering 15"" Dell flat-monitor. I perused the web with my cordless Microsoft mouse and wireless keypad. While the mouse took AA batteries, inconveniently the keyboard took AAA which I did not always keep in stock.I connected my three-year-old metallic green 16 GB iPod to my iTunes account to look for something I could listen to on a long monotonous road trip. My iPod had a capacity for up to 4,000 songs and up to 24 hours of audio playback on a single charge. It had a 1.54-inch (diagonal) color TFT display with 240-by-240-pixel resolution (220 pixels per inch). Support for AAC, Protected AAC (iTunes Store), MP3, MP3 VBR, Audible, Apple Lossless, AIFF, and WAV audio formats. It had only come with a one-year limited warranty. I had not taken advantage of the extended warranty and was worried something might go astray.I had wanted to use my husband’s newer iPod, the Apple iPod nano 16GB Green (7th Generation) with a 2.5-inch Multi-Touch color display with 240-by-432 pixel resolution. This was only 5.4-mm thin making it the thinnest iPod ever and had easy-to-use controls to quickly adjust volume, or play, pause, and change songs. Accessible to Bluetooth 4.0 and weighing in at only 1.1 ounces and 3.8 x 3 x 1.9 inches model, it was compatible with MD478LL/A Windows XP (SP3);Windows Vista; Windows 7;Mac OS X 10.6.8 or later.Unfortunately since I could not find the specialized adapter for that particular iPod, I was forced to use the older model. I logged into my iTunes account and downloaded Steig Larsson’s “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo” onto my older, yet still efficient, iPod.The iPod had been developed in 2000 but not placed on the market until 2001. I was born in 1977 so I would have been 23 or 24 back then. Now, the time was late summer of 2014, and since I was born in autumn of 1977 I would be 37 in two months. I grew up in Port Jefferson Station, NY but was born in the neighboring village of Port Jefferson as Port Jefferson Station had no hospitals, while Port Jefferson had two: Mather Hospital and St. Charles. I was born in St. Charles Hospital, as Mather Hospital did not tend to natal needs (neither pre- nor post-), and is now renowned for both its cardiac and bariatric surgery centers (fortunate, no?)Incidentally, an American Rock Star named Elvis Aaron Presley donated some funds to St. Charles Hospital’s many years back, as attributed to him on a 1x4-inch plaque located on the wall near the back elevator. (I would insert a joke here, but Larsson’s writing doesn’t allow for much humor. He was very serious. Before I ever saw a picture of him, I knew he’d be a dough-faced man-boy, with steel rimmed glasses.) Port Jefferson was called Drowned Meadow back in the days of the American Revolution. It lies on the Long Island Sound, and on a clear day you can see Connecticut several miles across the water. The Port Jefferson, NY/Bridgeport, CT Ferry line has hundreds of travelers each day, thousands more during the busy summer season. My parents once took the ferry from Port Jefferson to Bridgeport soon after they married. They were married in 1976. As I was born in 1977, that would have made me negative 18 months old at the time. I don’t remember much of it. Anyway--NO! I can’t do it! I did not like this book enough to get that snarky about it. It bored me. And then angered me, and then bored me, and then angered me because it was boring me. I’m not that talented a reviewer to skewer a book I hate by launching into an insightful parody.I will however launch into an inciteful tirade!I found BR Meyer’s “A Reader’s Manifesto an Attack on the Growing Pretentiousness in the American Literary Prose” to be a useful gauge in analyzing the Girl w/ the Dragon Tattoo. No, TGwtDT was not published in the US, but it did become a blockbuster-literary-phenom here, so I feel using that book is appropriate. What differentiates books like “The Girl with a Dragon Tattoo” from other lengthy blockbusters like, say Gone Girl is that the former takes itself much too earnestly to be appreciated. TGwtDT is a bestseller, yes, but it deals with a serious topic that NO OTHER BOOK has touched: violence against women!I read a review of TGwtDT that derided readers who complained the book was too slow, and chided readers for not knowing how to skim over the unimportant parts! That’s how REAL readers read, don’t you know! Look, I’m no speed-reader, but I’m a believer in that words have meanings. They exist for a reason. If I skim a lot, it’s a sign that the author has lost my interest. This belief seems to be confusing for some. Like the literary critics in Meyer’s manifesto write: “‘If anyone has earned the right to bore us for our own good, it’s [NAME REDACTED],” writes Salon Martha Russo. “Since [HE] is smarter than we are,” intones John Leonard in the New York Review of Books, “trust [HIM].”Such is the early 21st century mindset about LITTER-A-CHORE.Since I do not own the physical version of TGwtDT, and don't intend to everagain listen to the audio, I cannot quote verbatim from his book. So I will borrow from Myer’s manifesto when he criticizes Cormac McCarthy’s tiresome writing from one of McCarthy's later works: “He ate the last of the eggs and wiped the plate with the tortilla and ate the tortilla and drank the last of the coffee and wiped his mouth and looked up and thanked her.”Replace eggs and tortilla with sandwiches and bread and add in even more copious amounts of coffee, and there you have about 10%-15% of Larsson’s book. It’s tedious.As TGwtDT deals with rape and murder, it’s not unusual that there would be explicit scenes depicting this. (view spoiler)[ Lisbeth Salander is raped by her social worker two various times, one orally in his office and the second time anally in his home after he has tied her to his bed. (hide spoiler)] These scenes are written in a slightly horrific, yet detached manner. It’s not these scenes that I question; it’s the revenge scene that follows. (view spoiler)[ Lisbeth turns the tables on the social worker when she returns to his home, ‘promising’ another night of sex for pay, then tazes him, ties him to his bed and rapes him. But the way the scene is written is done in an oddly titillating manner. Lisbeth stands at the foot of the bed, dressed all in black, wielding a whip, with her dyed-black hair, tattoos and piercings giving her a dark dominatrix look as the man struggles against his bonds and ball-gag. Lisbeth proceeds to rape him with an anal plug without the use of lubrication. She then tortures him by tattooing a message across his abdomen. Lisbeth finally ends his torture by showing the man a video that she recorded from the previous encounter when he had raped her. For an hour and a half she forces him to watch this! Frightening stuff, one would think, but the way it’s written is done in such a kinky manner, that I—a long time reader of subtle kink—can spot it when I see it.  (hide spoiler)] This scene is supposed to be critical to the novel as it shows the true nature of Lisbeth and the depths she is capable of. (view spoiler)[But to me, it reads as a writer’s fantasy of being dominated by a tough woman. It's more like, “Yes, I am a bad, bad, evil man. I am a filthy dirty man, and I must be punished. I understand you will stick painful things up my bum without lube. Oh, it hurts, oh it’s painful...but…now…I am in a quiet, almost hypnotized state of ecstasy at your masterful female dominance. Oh…yes I will do whatever you say. I will be your slave.” (hide spoiler)]Many years ago I read Jane De Lynn’s Some Do where a similar scene is portrayed. (view spoiler)[After a friend is brutally raped and dies as a consequence, several women avenge that savagery by raping her attacker. However in Some Do, the scene was disturbing. The man is assaulted in his office, blindfolded and gagged, and there is not even a sniff of subtly or eroticism; it was pure female anger at masculine ""oppression,"" replete with horror and a lust for vengeance. (hide spoiler)] Some Do was written by an American woman in the 1970s and TGwtDT was written by a Swedish man in the 2000s and there was just a vast difference in the way the parallel scenes were depicted. One was written with a raw anger beneath it, filled with a sentiment of “We’re not taking this anymore! We will fight back and hurt you worse if you hurt us!”Larsson, it seems, wrote his book as an aggrieved male figure for all the violence committed against woman by men as a dark-revenge fantasy. (view spoiler)[The initial rapes of Lisbeth were crude, but didn’t disturb me. That sort of sexual violence is de riguer in murder-mystery books, sad to say. But it was Lisbeth’s scene where I had my “epiphany.”  (hide spoiler)] As a person, I can’t judge Larsson, but as a reader judging an author, I certainly can. His character of Lisbeth is not a true woman: she is an amalgam of all that is cool and “ballsy” about women in media: a cartoon/manga/movie/porn version of what a “kick-ass woman” is. Ironic that in a book originally titled ""Men Who Hate Women"" Larsson used a female protagonist who is a caricaturized version of post-modern ideal femininity to conquer all the bad evil men. (Or perhaps Larsson WAS so smart he knew exactly what he was doing? Maybe. Even so, I didn’t care.)Eh, if you’re going to market a mass-murder/rapist book as feminist theory, at least make it a teeny bit based in realism. And interesting.And I apologize to Dan Brown for all the mean things I said about him. I won’t take them back, because they’re true! But in the literary sense, I should have kept it all in perspective. There’s being a hack who knows he’s a hack, and then there’s being a hack that’s pawned off as some literary genius. And then there’s the fact that he died relatively young, so like Kurt Cobain, no one can EVER complain about Larsson’s talent. Ok, that last part WAS cruel. But I won’t take that back, either.Awful, awful and boring. ½ star ",17,-0.9998,0.167,0.78,0.053,0.4507809171115623,NEGATIVE,0.9996

Audio Review Note: While well narrated by Simon Vance, even he couldn’t save the first part; however, he was very entertaining for the rest and does a good job differentiating the voices. ★★★★✩ I have made several aborted attempts to read this international bestseller without success, so finally, when it became Book of the Month in one of my GoodReads groups, I decided to listen to it on audio. 
Ha!
 I still ended up referring to the paperback copy so often that now I feel as if I’ve read the book twice. There were Vanger Family Tree flowcharts, time lines, chronological order lists, and back and forth emails that do not transfer well to audio, IMHO. In addition, the difficulty I had in getting into the story was not only with the foreign names and characters; there were the corporate world vernaculars and political implications that bogged the first part down for me. I had to really concentrate on this story and I didn’t find the beginning very exciting. GoodReads friends told me I had to persevere through the first part to get to the great middle. And, they were right. There is a great mystery in the middle of this book.Stockholm, Sweden

Warning: There was a brutality toward one of the characters that I wasn’t expecting, but luckily it was short-lived – and she gets delicious revenge! The protagonist, Mikael Blomkvist, while not 100% loveable, is well-developed with a realism that is rings true. I certainly was cheering for spell-binding outcast, Lisbeth Salander, all the way. I’m glad I stuck with this mystery and I will definitely go on with the Millennium series. Why not? I have all the paperbacks and my library has all the audiobooks. Plus, I want to see what happens to these characters!

I'm very happy I read THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO, because it's very good. It's richly populated with distinct and memorable characters and it has a driving narrative style that left me never wanting to stop reading for the night. That's a rare talent for a writer to have, and even some great writers do not have it, the gift of being able to compel readers to turn just one more page. The titular girl, Lisbeth Salander, is a fascinating construct, a character with mysteries of her own beyond that of the plot, and she is an intriguing creation, one who as a fictional human being resists sentimental responses yet as a fictional device demands them. Both her personality and her intellectual gifts as depicted engage the reader intensely, and she is well matched with the investigative reporter Mikhael Blomvitz, a linkage which, while quite different in the details, reminds one of those between Archie Stout and Nero Wolfe or John Watson and Sherlock Holmes. Individually, each might be insufficient to the tasks of the plots or to the requirements of literature, but in combination is made a thing greater than the sum of its elements. The mystery at the heart of this book is far-fetched yet ultimately satisfyingly authentic, and the great twin drivers of exciting fiction, resolution and revenge, are effectively utilized.

The multi-layering that exists within this book is clever and is also one of the reasons why I think it grabbed my attention; there are lots of stuff that are happening at the same, more like several plot-lines, and all of them made the book even more interesting and compulsively readable. The main characters, Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander, are crafted and painted in a professional manner. The author has established their character with uniqueness, weaknesses and strengths, and with each chapter you can see how these characters have evolved in very remarkable ways.This is a fun, 100% addictive crime book that will lead you into the abyss of insanity, corruption, and human-monstrosity.

95,57058721,05/23/2009,5.0,"August 2019: Not quite sure what I want to say this go-round. I hate reviewing favorite books. There's something about the headspace you get in when you're reading one. It's just so passive and full of unthinking pleasure. I just let books happen to me when I'm like that. And I don't want to talk about it okay! It's private.I loved this book back when I first read it, and then again when I re-read it a couple years later, and now I love it again on this third read. Lisbeth Salander is just such a great character, complex and thorny, and very human. The world of finance and murder Larsson brings to life is weirdly fascinating. And it's got a great mystery/thriller plot mixed in with all the rest of the stuff. Blomkvist, I like, but I would also want to punch him a little if I met him in real life, so there's some nice cognitive dissonance in there as well. (He's a kind man with an appealing sense for justice, and he's very good at what he does, but oh my god he just sees a lady and needs to have sex with her, all the time and I do not understand him in that way at all. Although one of the things I like most in this book is that Lisbeth comes on to him, not the other way around; he's perfectly content to keep their relationship professional.)I enjoy the movie adaptations (and one of the comic adaptations; the other is an abomination) but there's no substitute for Stieg Larsson's phenomenal gift for cramming gobs of details into his story, and still keeping it interesting. Starting the second book re-read today, which is why I'm finally writing this ""review.""February 2012: This is my second time through the Millennium trilogy, so I'm going to try and keep this review short and to the point.Everybody and their mother knows the story by now, or at least they should. Mikael Blomkvist, disgraced journalist, is hired by one of the richest men in Sweden to find out what happened to his sixteen year old niece, Harriet Vanger, who was murdered over forty years before. Lisbeth Salander, a socially introverted, genius hacker, collides with Blomkvist, and the two form an unlikely partnership. I first read the books back in February 2010, and since then I've seen both film adaptations (Swedish and American) multiple times. I am so familiar with the story by now that I've internalized it. I am completely unable to be objective -- as if I ever was able in the first place -- Salander and Blomkvist are real people as far as I'm concerned, and I think it's a damn shame we won't ever get to hear any more from them past book three.For those of you who haven’t heard plot details — where have you been? — I’m not going to say any more about the plot because part of the joy the first time is the discovery of all the twists and turns. What I am going to say is that even though Larsson’s writing may not be stellar*, his imagination more than makes up for it. Lisbeth Salander is one of my favorite characters in literature, ever, and the ways in which he makes use of her to say his peace about the rights of the dispossessed — specifically the rights of women in male-dominated cultures, and the marginalization of the mentally ill and those that are perceived to be sexually or socially deviant — ultimately elevates the trilogy beyond mere thriller/mystery status. It’s the reason I can sit here and read it (or watch it) multiple times and still the story will have lost none of its power, despite the fact that I already know all the answers to whatever mysteries it contains.*For instance, lots of people become annoyed when he starts describing in detail meals characters eat, or actions they take that are seemingly irrelevant. I happen to find this quirk of his endearing, and all of those ""irrelevant"" details are a part of what I love about his books.Part of what fascinates me about The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo as a first novel in a series is that Larsson kind of sneaks up on you with the point of it. You could very easily read the book and then assume that sequels will follow the pattern set up by the first one, and would focus on Salander and Blomkvist as a team who will solve mysteries like it in the future. Instead, Larsson mainly uses the story of the Vangers as an extended ""meet-cute"" for Salander and Blomkist, and to set up Salander as the protagonist. Her story is the real center of the trilogy. This book is as much about setting up the next two books as it's about itself. Larsson wasn't interested in creating a series of grocery-store mysteries. He was interested in delving into the nitty gritty of Salander's life, and all the meaty stuff comes directly from it. She is the mystery and the challenge, not some murderer du jour.The last thing I want to say is that it puzzles me when people express their disdain for this series by saying it's misogynist. I have to wonder just exactly what kind of reading comprehension those people were taught in school, because these books are the very opposite of misogynist. Just because a story features misogyny as a theme, and characters who act in misogynistic or sexist ways, does not mean that story is espousing those misogynistic viewpoints. I can definitely understand people who simply object to the level of violence and dark sexuality that the book contains, but as far as I'm concerned, all that violence has a very salient point at the end of it.And now I've gone and lied to you about this being a short review. Whatever, I'm going to go make an omelet. - - -February 2010: Wow, this was awesome. On top of having a plot that's a weird mash-up between violent crime (think Law & Order: SVU), corrupt family saga, Raymond Chandler-esque mysteries (The Big Sleep comes immediately to mind), and high-tech thriller (ala Neal Stephenson and William Gibson), The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo has two of the most well-rounded, interesting, and original characters I've ever read in a thriller. Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist are flawed but likable, and the secrets they uncover are disgusting, riveting, and scary. It is large book that reads very quickly.The title of the book in the original Swedish translates roughly as Men Who Hate Women, but the English title is just as apt. It's a pity that Stieg Larsson died before being able to complete more than three manuscripts out of a planned ten. Wikipedia tells me that an unfinished fourth manuscript exists, along with synopses for the fifth and sixth, so it sucks that he's dead (not only for him, because he's not alive anymore), but because I WANT TO READ THEM.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this book to anyone.

I just think that lists and people who make them are cool!I liked the book in the beginning because it felt unique and fascinating. Then I got close to its half and it got full of drama. Useless boring drama. And I’m talking mostly about Mikael and Cecilia (I guess that’s her name. Damn you Swedish names!! I’m having a tough time remembering you!). The drama I actually fell into was Lisbeth’s. Speaking of my dear Lisbeth, she is one of the best (if not the best) female characters I’ve ever met so far. One, she’s a freakin’ genius. Two, I love her looks. Three, she’s badass. I liked her even more after (view spoiler)[she castrated the bitch who was raping her. And beat the sh*t out of that damn psycho rapist.  (hide spoiler)] I love you Lisbeth!Back to my point. It’s not a perfect book; I would remove certain parts from it. That’s why I’m taking one star from the rating. BUT! lol wtfBUT it’s f*cking amazing. Stieg Larsson is sick and I need to read more of his books. Crazy Swedish people. I’m so glad I didn’t wait for the movie to be out before starting this.

I promised myself that I will watch it and check out pictures for the movie after I’m done with the book. I’m proud to say that I did it.

I hope they choose a badass actress. Thoughts after watching the trailer▪ Daniel Craig is actually a very good choice.▪ Lisbeth's image in the movie is waaaay creepier than what I had in mind. That’s probably why I can’t stop staring at her pictures.▪ Bleached eyebrows. Damn, why didn’t I think of that?▪ Loved the trailer.

97,2199483874,11/29/2017,5.0,"Warning: There is a graphic portrayal of rape.As a person who has been sexually harassed since I was a child, this book was extremely cathartic. I am officially in love with the character of  Lisbeth Salander.What I liked about this book1.	It’s dark, gritty and the violence is not romanticised. I’ve read my fair share of adult books and I’ve found a certain romanticism regarding violence against women. The act is depicted as something based off lust, and sometimes, fake love, but rarely about power. It’s uncommon to read a book written by a man where the violence is raw and un-romanticised so the true horror of such an act is put forward. It was refreshing, to say the least. 2.	The characters.One of the strong aspects of this book are the characters, their secrets and their interactions. Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander are fascinating characters who play off each other in the best way. Even the secondary characters hold their own, and I can find nothing to criticise regarding character growth and their relationships.3.	The story.It’s riveting. Truly, the mystery made me turn the page until I read every last word. Maybe I saw some things coming and maybe a few incidents were predictable, but the overall story was one brilliant detective story with twist after twist to keep you guessing. 4.	The writing.I cannot help but praise the writing. I confess that this is one of the few books where the first few pages cemented the 5 star rating in my head as we went forward. I already knew that this book would have a glowing review from me. It was up to Larsson to lose the perfect score I already gave him. Not once did my mental rating waver. The writing is impeccable. This man was meant to be a storyteller. Personally, there’s nothing better than intelligent writing. 5.	Subject matterI was impressed with the knowledge Larsson shared regarding quite a few topics. I was even more impressed that he took the time to discuss these topics. Besides the obvious murder-mystery and thriller aspect of the book, there were quite a lot of discussions of law, the economy, company and journalistic ethics and online privacy. However, my favourite topic (which should come as no surprise) is that he tackled the question of misogyny and feminism. Larsson clearly condemns misogynistic behaviour, but at the same time, he uses it for entertainment. After all, this entire book was about violence against women.

98,1379217227,01/31/2018,4.0,"I have had this book sitting on my shelf for years, and never got round to reading it. I even dnf’ed it when I was around 13, as it just went straight over my head! I think it was one I was too young for, as there are some fairly complex financial passages in this, because now at 18, I was thoroughly engrossed in this. It isn't a new favourite, and I'm honestly not sure how to rate this at the moment, but it was a very entertaining read.This book has such a vivid, complex plot, where nothing is ever as it seems. We follow Mikael Blomkvist, a journalist who has just been convicted of the libel of the boss of a major corporation. This aspect is quite minor in the grand scheme of things, as it very quickly turns into the mystery of an old disappearance and a race to flee a sadistic serial killer. The financial aspects are quite prominent and took a lot of work to understand, but they fit well within the story. Nobody can be trusted in this, and we doubt the word of characters who would not normally be suspected. Even so, I found myself very surprised by the conclusions.Lisbeth Salander is an iconic character and I can very much understand why. She is an intelligent, no nonsense hacker who relies solely upon herself and can be brutal when she needs to be. I pitied her and how the authorities had treated her, leading to her deep distrust of the police and officials. This mistrust leads to some frustrating decisions in the book. Some of the things that happen to her in this book are absolutely sickening and should carry a heavy trigger warning for those sensitive, and I can honestly say this might be the most uncomfortable I’ve ever felt reading a book. Her relationships with others are fascinating, especially with Armansky, her boss, and Palmgren, her guardian, who both seem like very good people.Mikael Blomkvist is just as complex and dynamic, but I have to admit I just don’t like him. He’s a cheat, he plays with women’s feelings and has no regard for hurting them, he’s an awful father and seems far more devoted to brutal journalism than compassion for those he researches. His relationship with Salander seems quite exploitative. I do appreciate him for being a flawed character, however, and his was an interesting perspective to read from. I found him harder to identify with as he’s a lot older than me, additionally.Shoutout to the Vanger family for being one of the most interesting collections of people I’ve read about, but who would take a very long time to discuss! All I’ll say is there are some despicable sections to this family, and expect to see fascism, murder, pettiness, pity and strength.",16,0.7552,0.133,0.713,0.154,0.5865379283026342,NEGATIVE,0.9857
99,272315304,02/04/2012,4.0,"Interesting book, unusual style. It tells me that we have had quite a loss in Stieg Larsson's death. Larsson was a journalist who, as I understand it wrote his novels at home as relaxation. Three were left complete and have been published since his death. I've read that he left another partly completed and outlines and notes for 2 others. This book puts me a little in mind of an older style of writing that was more common maybe 5o+ years ago. The early part of the book introduces us to the players and their circumstances. It sets up the two somewhat interlocking stories (they aren't really ""interlocking"" but they are connected through the players). One story sort of frames the other giving us the rational for Mikael to get involved. Salander is then brought on board as a consequence of these two overlapping situations. My early take? I found the first half or so of the novel a bit slow moving and my interest wandered just a bit. I almost skimmed a part of it, but stayed with it picking up all the story about these background and early events. I've seen others who also said that the book starts out slowly. But stay with it. As Andy Griffith said about the opening of Hamlet ""now all do remember that 'cause you will need it later"". The book sort of ""breaks open about at or just past the halfway mark and things start to come to light and come together.

(What bad girl thing? I do not have a bad girl thing.)-- Also, based on the Nordic-type people I know, I bet this little excerpt is a good example of the author's humour buried under the clunk-ass translation: 'That morning he had also had an invitation to celebrate Christmas Eve with the Beckmans in Saltsjöbaden [Moi is ignorant of city's location and also cannot spell it:]. He said no, but thank you, certain that there was a limit to Beckman's indulgence and quite sure that he had no ambition to find out what that limit might be.' (Erika Berger/Beckman and Blomkvist have been lovers for twenty years.) [Ah, apparently Saltsjöbaden is a resort on the Baltic Sea. My, it looks fancy.

I of course loved LISBETH, and am pining for the sequel to freakin' show up in my mailbox already so I can devour it. I should write up a more formal review -- these are basically notes I made as I went along. I liked it a lot! (duh OBVIOUSLY) Many of the Swedish cultural and historical references totally baffled me -- footnotes would've been nice, or even just an appendix explaining some references. ""Reg"" the translator apparently hand-drew a very nice map, which Vintage didn't include (WTF) so I had to print it out and stick it into my own copy. The style was weirdly clipped -- not a lot of time spent on description of places or people -- while tiresomely prolix in other places (did we REALLY need all those emails near the end?). I think the book could've been trimmed by 200 pp or so easily, but at the same time I enjoyed reading something more discursive with a lot of setup that wasn't slavishly following the 'HOOK your reader within TWO PARAGRAPHS by their EYEBALLS!!!111' ubiquitous writing ""advice"" everywhere nowadays. I'd love to read it in the original sometime, sigh. It was mainly a good fast ride, at least on the surface, altho parts of it still oddly stick in my mind:The book is very much about systemic evil -- the structure of capitalism itself; the historic references to genocide; the way Salander is at the mercy of her guardians, misunderstood and underestimated and abused by courts and clinics and foster families. Sweden, the cliche of the socialist 'nanny state,' is actually dark and dangerous as the fairy-tale forests. Lots of reviewers complained that the framing story of Blomkvist taking on financial corruption was pointless but I think it's included for thematic reasons -- not just to set up the plot of why he would take the detective/researching job, but as an illustration of how things work. This is a novel by an investigative journalist supposedly about how heroic investigative journalism brings down powerful rich criminal organizations which corrupt the system, only he can't do it: Lisbeth is outside the social structures, so she breaks the law and brings the swindler to justice, like an avenging angel. It's the same way she deals with her guardian/abuser, and the murderer. She's the only one who can enact justice because she's outside society and the law, as a rejected, isolated, discarded misfit. She's a self-made Fury. The murderer himself is set firmly within the patriarchal capitalist system as both the CEO of a huge corporation and scion of a completely fucked-up family -- that he's _also_ taught to be a serial killer by his father in abusing his sister is icing on the psychocake. Can I just say how happy I am not to see yet another genius Bach-happy overly cultured pretentious serial killer? (looking at YOU, Hannibal) altho I think this one was still fairly unrealistic given the actual psychopathology....but what the hell, it's a novel. Even the Nazis are brought in -- not so much for shock value but to point out that there were political parties in Sweden (and other countries, of course) which supported them and their ideas long after WWII, and even oh-so-charming Henrik (who actually got on my nerves) admits he succumbed to the lure of the propaganda. No one is innocent. Critics say the book is about how awful men are, or how all the men in the book suck except Blomkvist, which isn't true: Henrik clearly loves Harriet and Erika's husband, while offstage, seems like a good man; Blomkvist himself objectifies women somewhat by sleeping around and the bit at the end about how he judges himself as a bad father (paralleling Gottfried as the ultimate bad parent and Henrik as the good foster-father) is really touching. The hacker Plague and Salander's first guardian also obviously care for and help her. It's about the system, and how systematized socialized misogyny warps everyone trapped within it. I liked how the women wind up in charge at the end -- Erika runs the magazine, Harriet is now restored as the rightful CEO, and of course Salander has all that money. Maybe they'll be able to make some changes.This makes the book sound terribly dry and dull, like a thesis, which of course it isn't. I really liked the absolutely cold, isolated atmosphere Blomkvist is stuck in -- it was described without a lot of fuss but built up very strikingly over pages and pages. I enjoyed the old-fashioned detective work involving the photographs, making a mini-film of Harriet, trying to see what she saw, hunting down the other photographers....(I could practically see that sequence as I was reading it, I bet it'd make a great interlude in the film.) But of course, the main reason I picked the novel up and why I personally think everyone is raving about it is LISBETH, LISBETH, LISBETH. I adored her. She's like the brutal fucked-up 'perfect victim' of the system gone through hell and back to take her revenge as a fallen angel -- and yet she's a real person with too many noserings who never cleans her apartment and binges on pizza. I loved that she was a hacker and had terrible social skills and made people think she was mentally slow and couldn't trust anyone. She's truly vibrant. I loved how flawed she was, too: how she had no sympathy for Martin being abused himself, how she walks away from Blomkvist at the end, the fantastic trap she set for her guardian rather than relying on anybody else. Why would she?If it hadn't been for her I would never have finished this book (well, I probably wouldn't have picked it up at all, but enough people said 'YOU WILL LOVE HER' and they were right). It's way too long -- so much time is spent on trivial little details it was far too easy to skim; I actually hate family sagas; I didn't find a lot of the other characters compelling (I did love Erika -- and Cecilia -- and Isabella was terribly chilling even tho we didn't see much of her); the resolution of both mysteries actually felt somewhat anti-climactic; I prefer novels with more visual detail -- and so on and on. None of it matters, because there is LISBETH. Of course I also loved the Lisbeth/Mikael show and no doubt if I were in fandom I would 'ship' them and write terrible fanfic about it.

And it's not even about the content, because the book is devilishly interesting, it's the style in which the author presented the material.There is no point in describing the essence of the plot - only the lazy didn't hear about this book or even movies (by the way, the Swedish version is better by leaps and bounds), so I better get at it from another side. I want to talk about how the author translated the most common things into a fascinating study of a puzzle which makes human nature. A piece here or there, a fragment in the corner of the table and in the center, and from a gray blurry mass appears a subtle, incredibly complex and eye-catching image - a girl with a dragon tattoo.The interesting fact is that there's not as much of Lisbeth in the book as you'd think the titular character would deserve. Her paragraphs were dosed in such way that it seemed the author was luring you in, making you strive for more. It's sad to realize that the finale to this story (if we ever get one) will be written by different hands, because Stieg Larsson truly was an extremely talented author.`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````Есть книги, для которых нужно созреть.

107,3589407860,10/22/2020,2.0,"It might have been because of all the hype surrounding this book, but I was slightly underwhelmed.The novel is structured like a matryoshka, which is rather neat: Plot A is introduced (Wennerström), Plot B is introduced (Harriet), Plot C is introduced (Harriet’s List); then Plot C is resolved, Plot B is resolved, Plot A is resolved. Does that count as a spoiler? Who cares, everyone and their mother has read this by now.My issues, however, stem directly from said structure. There is a solid mystery thriller in the middle, but it is sandwiched between an overly drawn out beginning and end. Plot A is a bit meh but then Plot B comes along and things start to get interesting. By the time you make it to Plot C, you’re in for a ride. But then Plot C is resolved and after all the fun you think “Oh yeah, I guess we have to go back to solving Plot B now.” It’s alright, but not half as fun as C. And once that is done it’s time to close the circle and wrap up Plot A, but at this point I really didn’t care and just wanted it to be over. It was The Scouring of the Shire all over again. The writing doesn’t contain a drop of literature, which is what made the first and third acts so thanklessly hard to get through. It’s as dry and detailed as an insurance policy. This is clearly the work of a journalist and not of a writer, and I actually admire it as such. Not that we should take the plot to be remotely true (the third act was downright fantasy), but like Dickens and Hugo, Larsson uses the novel medium to raise awareness about real-life problems while entertaining his readers. And it's certainly interesting as journalism (it made me look up info on several things), but as a novel? Not what I'm looking for.I have been pondering a lot on the popularity of Lisbeth Salander. I mean, at this point in time she is larger than life. But having finally read the book I think she’s cool but not someone I’d consider a fictional legend. Larsson set out to write a feminist hero, and she comes very much across as a man’s idea of a feminist hero. And that’s not a bad thing! Larsson, by all accounts, was a manly man (his pastimes included beer and football), so the result of him writing a badass vigilante like Salander is a lot more efficient that if he’d, say, tried to write a more conventionally female character (oh wait, he did, literally every other female character - they suck). A fortuitous decision, in any case, it clearly clicked with many people. As for me, I’m glad to have made the acquaintance, but I don’t feel like I was missing out on that much.",15,0.9987,0.027,0.747,0.226,0.3711874999999999,NEGATIVE,1.0

I think the one Patricia Cornwall (Cornwell?) I read was an utter waste of time. I have no interest in books with flimsy characters who do brutal things to characters purely for plot reasons. It's really nothing more than a kind of torture porn, and I don't really understand the popularity of serial killers in books or movies. But occassionally, a murder myster/cop book will pop up that is so good, with characters so rich, and by an author who takes the content seriously and with respect, that it defies the rules of the genre. Mystic River is one example. The Long Goodbye is another. Homicide - though nonfiction - is a masterpiece.The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is trash.The characters are paper thin. The plot is so contrived. The weight of the horror is so heavy, and dealt with so superficially that I'm not sure this guy ever even thought that rape was anything but a word that could be tossed around lightly. And he only has three or four rapists running around. The story goes on long after I had lost interest, and it took me a while to realize that was because the author had created a horrific serial rapist/murderer merely as a plot point, so that he could get back to the real villian of the piece: a stock market speculator. Seriously.Not that he ever creates that villain as anything more than a straw man. He exists solely so his main protaganist can write a book that not only drags the villain down, but puts plenty of money in his pocket, and revolutionizes the way the media handles financial news, proving the protaganist was always right, even in the face of grumpy old journalists.Um... what?This #$%^ing sucked.",15,-0.9895,0.161,0.781,0.058,0.5343501984126984,NEGATIVE,1.0

There is a lot of this type of narrative in the book, and I found it to be boring because of it. Larsson just tells, tells, tells without creating any narrative technique or showing any talent for eloquence. Maybe it's the fault of the translator or maybe it's meant to mimic Salandar's lack of sociability, but either way it sure was bland. It came off as perfunctory and lacked any subtlety. In listening to this, I thought it was about to be over multiple times, only to find that the denouement lasts THREE discs.

114,2125775261,03/05/2019,3.0,"Dual plotline mystery-thriller set in Sweden in 2002. The first plotline revolves around Mikael Blomkvist, a journalist with a specialty in exposing financial fraud, who has been convicted in the wake of a libel suit. He needs to keep a low profile while his magazine recovers from the blow. The second major plotline relates to the hiring of Blomkvist by Henrik Vanger, an octogenarian executive of a family-owned Swedish corporation, to investigate the disappearance and suspected murder of his great niece, Harriet, in 1966 under mysterious circumstances. A substantial sub-plot concerns Lisbeth Salander, an intelligent emotionally-damaged 25-year-old computer hacker, who conducts private investigations for an electronic security company. This unlikely pair teams up to solve both the financial and murder mysteries. Once the groundwork is laid, this novel becomes a plot-driven page-turner. It is filled with the requisite darkness typical of many thrillers such as sadism, grisly descriptions of murder victims, psychopathic behavior, rape, and assault. I found it an interesting mix of unusual suspects, family secrets, financial corruption, magazine operations, and computer technology. I thought the middle portion was most intriguing, as Blomkvist and Salander dig into the past and assemble the puzzle pieces. The characters could have benefitted from a bit more depth, particularly regarding their inner thoughts and motivations. The “whodunnit” was more convincing than the “whydunnit.” The author diverts attention from the main story on several occasions, taking the reader down a few blind alleys that, in my opinion, were not required and made this book unnecessarily lengthy. I like to read books that have become sensations, usually many years after their publication. I can see the attraction of the eccentric and damaged computer geek (she of the dragon tattoo) in an “odd couple” pairing with the sexually promiscuous but generally well-intentioned journalist. I am not particularly keen on thrillers, so I probably wasn’t the best audience, but I think fans of the genre will appreciate it. ",14,-0.2689,0.103,0.803,0.094,0.4247289972899729,POSITIVE,0.6998

I'd be breaking her trust""The girl with the dragon tattoo deals with a lot of issues, all can be summed under two major themes, which are:First, Financial corruption. Mikael Blomkvist is a well-known financial journalist. He publishes a story on one's of Sweden's large businessmen but he failed to stand on a solid prove, so he was found guilty and was convicted of libel. Wennerstrom is a symbol of corrupt businessmen, who intended to make profits out of illegal ways exploiting eastern European countries urge to recover after the cold war. "" The Wennerstrom empire of obscure companies was linked to the heart of the international Mafia arms dealing and money laundering for south america drug cartels to prostitution in New York and even indirectly for child sex trade in Mexico""The second theme deals more with a social crisis ""Violence against women"" . Larsson wrote a statistic in the beginning of each part and chapter and then he set an example through two of his female characters , through whom the reader came to live their misery. 46% of the women in sweden have been subjected to violence by a man  18% of women in Sweden have at one time been threatened by a man 13% of the women in Sweden have been subjected to aggravated sexual assault outside of a sexual relationship 92% of women in Sweden who have been subjected to sexual assault have not reported the most recent violent incident to the police. I was curious to know the percentage in the middle east & I was quite shocked According to WHO : 45.6% of females in Africa had experienced abuse. Southeast Asia followed with 40.2%To your information, Sweden occupied the 6th rank in ""The best countries to be women list"" Whilst the worst countries are AfghanistanCongoIraqNepalSudan GuatemalaMali Pakistan And the list goes on & onNow let's get back to the novel. After failing to expose wennertrom's, Blomkvist had no choice but to leave his life in stockholman and his post in Millennium magazine to move to Hedeby, a quite village.Despite being crushed, he Concentrates all his efforts on solving an old mystery of a 16-year old girl who disappeared in a long time ago. However, his battle with wennerstrom isn't over. To tell you truth, Historical mystery is really my thing. How not especially if Agatha Christie is one of my favorite writers. Overall, I enjoyed the whole process of investigations and was satisfied after the mystery was solved.To a great extent, I was convinced that larsson's characters' are so realIt was very slow till the first quarter but then I got hooked in the novel till the last pageThere are two things that I didn't like: First ,one can't deny that it was too long. Details, details and way more detailsSecond, I was extremely annoyed by the ""Casual sex"" in this novel. Is it very common in Sweden to have sex with 95% of the people you meet in your life.

“Everyone has secrets. It’s just a matter of finding out what they are.”
This was probably the most disturbing book I've ever read. This makes Gillian Flynn's psychotic thrillers look like bedtime stories. I would rather meet Carrie White with a chainsaw in the middle of a dark road than cross the path of Lisbeth Salander.I debated whether I should give this five stars because of the purely genius writing and masterfully crafted characters and plot - I'm not exaggerating when I say that Larsson is one of the BEST writers I've ever come across - or one star, because this book was so dark and sick I was left wondering why I was still reading it at times. I finished it, thinking: was this a disgusting piece of literature that I would never touch again? Or was it a deeply disturbing, psychological thriller that oh so cleverly played with the reader's mind and left you feeling a little bit sick after you'd finished it?The answer is both. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a genius thriller that tackles screwed-up topics. It reads like a diary, switching POVs often and pulling us into the corrupt lives of Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist. Blomkvist is a disgraced journalist who gets hired by the wealthy Henrik Vanger to solve the case of Harriet Vanger, who was murdered nearly four decades ago. Blomkvist enlists Lisbeth Salander to help him with the case, a brilliant young woman with a haunted past who may be the best investigator in Sweden.The atmosphere was perfectly fitting for a long-buried mystery - a biting cold winter in Sweden at the huge, wealthy estate of the Vangers with sleepless nights and cups of coffee. As Blomkvist became engrossed in the mystery of Harriet Vanger, digging up old clues about her disappearance and investigating each of the Vanger family members, he found his relationship with Lisbeth becoming more and more tangled. And on top of that, someone seemed to be after him - someone who didn't want him bringing the truth to light.I wasn't kidding when I said this book was disturbing. The characters were utterly corrupt and unnerving - beneath their outside image, they were all deeply unhealthy, bitter individuals. This book also dealt with a lot of sexual assault against women. One scene in particular was so disgusting it made me feel sick. In between chapters, statistics were included about women in Sweden experiencing sexual assault.The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a book as disturbed as its main characters. The whole time I felt like I was reading a long, exciting, well-written news article about a topic so revolting I could neither look away nor turn the pages fast enough.

In book 1, Salander who is now 24 helps Blomkvist solve a mystery about a woman who disappeared. In books 2 and 3, Salander has a variety of problems resulting from “special section” activities. A number of interesting characters are involved. Some are helpful and others try to hurt Salander.ABOUT THE TITLES:The primary theme for the books is “Men Who Hate Women,” which is the Swedish title for the first book. I much prefer the Swedish title over the English-language title. The tattoo title feels superficial and meaningless when compared to the Swedish title. The titles in order are:The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo (Swedish Title: Men Who Hate Women)The Girl Who Played With Fire (Swedish Title: same)The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet’s Nest (Swedish Title: The Air Castle Blows Up) The Air Castle in Swedish means a complex structure based on nothing.REVIEWER’S OPINION OF ALL THREE BOOKS:I want happy endings when I read books, and I was definitely satisfied and happy at the ends of books 1 and 3. I know I will continue to think about Salander and this story well into the future. Book 1 can be read as a stand-alone, but I wanted more Salander so I bought book 2. Book 2 stops in the middle of the story which is ok as long as you get book 3 to keep reading right away. I loved the three books. This is not a predictable, run-of-the-mill mystery thriller. There are a wide range of characters and plot intricacies that are wonderfully well done. I was so taken with these books that I bought the audio versions AND the paper versions for books 2 and 3. I’ve never done that before. That way I could continue with the story when I was driving and doing kitchen work. I would switch to the hard copy when sitting.In the first book, Salander felt like a modern day replacement for Sherlock Holmes, but very different. They both are brilliant in their special skills, and draw my admiration. However, Salander is gritty, edgy, and anti-authority. She despises the police and refuses to allow them to have information about anything. There was a lot of action with Salander in the last half of the first book. I loved reading about her. I was hoping to see a lot of action with Salander in books 2 and 3 – seeing her solve other mysteries and doing damage to bad guys. But that didn’t happen. Books 2 and 3 are more about other characters doing things – murders, cover-ups, and investigating – but it was all surrounding and relating to Salander. She had less action than I wanted in the last two books. But still, I fully enjoyed books 2 and 3.The English-language film of the first book will be in theaters in 2011. Daniel Craig will play journalist Mikael Blomkvist. Unfortunately, as with most movies, there’s no way it will be as rich as the books.ABOUT THE AUTHOR:Steig Larsson wrote these three books, submitted them to a publisher, and then died before they were published. He had written half of a fourth book which I believe his girlfriend may be finishing. He had an outline and planned to write several more in the series. I am sad for the loss of the author and for the loss of his further writing.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------REVIEW OF BOOK 1: THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO.REVIEWER’S OPINION:I listened to the audiobook version and sometimes found it difficult to keep the names straight. The narrator is good, but there are so many Swedish names (people and towns) that are hard to follow if you’re not used to it. I recommend reading the book (not the audiobook) and taking a few notes with names. I can’t remember if it was the first third or more, but it was slow. It was also setting things up. There is a lot of “telling” about things happening in the past. The second half is more action and “showing.” If you look “Inside the Book” on Amazon, there is a Vanger Family Tree which is helpful. The last half was fantastic and definitely worth the read. I was surprised, amazed, and couldn’t put it down. It’s creative and excellent. Caution for sensitive readers: there is unsettling rear-door rape and torture.THE MAIN CHARACTER:Salander is haunting, intriguing, and powerful in unexpected ways. She has a terrifying capacity for ruthlessness. She is 24, 4 feet 11, weighs 90 pounds, has tattoos, and looks like a punk teenager. Some of her personality traits appear similar to Asperger’s syndrome, but she is sociable if she wants to be. She is one of the best computer hackers in the country. Her mother’s in an institution. Salander is a ward of the State with a guardian controlling her finances. The State believes she is mentally incompetent. She doesn’t care what they think as long as she can get her money when needed, and they “leave her alone.” She becomes the top investigator for a private investigating firm.STORY BRIEF:Book 1 includes three stories. (1) Salander has problems with guardians and being a ward of the State. (2) Blomkvist is a journalist who printed an article about Wennerstrom, is sued for libel, and will be going to jail for three months. (3) Blomkvist is hired to investigate the disappearance of Harriet Vanger, which happened 37 years ago. Blomkvist learns about Salander and hires her to help investigate Harriet’s disappearance which has something to do with a serial killer.DATA:Audiobook length: 16 hours. Swearing language: moderate to strong. Sexual content: a few scenes, some rape, language mild. Setting: 2003 mostly Sweden. Original Swedish copyright: 2005. Genre: mystery suspense thriller.

133,2279787031,11/01/2018,4.0,"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is the first book in the Millennium series written by Stieg Larsson and centered on Mikael Blomkvist, a journalist, publisher, and part owner of the monthly political magazine Millennium and Lisbeth Salander, a freelance surveillance agent and researcher specializing in investigating people on behalf of Milton Security.Mikael Blomkvist is a publisher of the Swedish political magazine Millennium, loses a libel case involving allegations about billionaire industrialist Hans-Erik Wennerström. Mikael Blomkvist is sentenced to three months in prison, which was deferred, and ordered to pay hefty damages and costs. Soon afterwards, he is invited to meet Henrik Vanger, the retired CEO of the Vanger Corporation, unaware that Henrik Vanger has checked into his personal and professional history. Lisbeth Salander, a brilliant but deeply troubled researcher and computer hacker, has carried out the investigation of Mikael Blomkvist's circumstances.Henrik Vanger promises to provide Mikael Blomkvist with evidence against Hans-Erik Wennerström in return for discovering what happened to his grandniece, Harriet Vagner, who disappeared in 1966. Henrik Vanger believes a member of the family murdered her. Harriet Vanger disappeared during a family gathering at the Vanger estate on Hedeby Island, when the island was temporarily cut off from the mainland by a traffic accident on the bridge.Mikael Blomkvist moves to the island and begins to research the Vanger family history and the disappearance of Harriet Vagner. As he does, he meets most of the remaining Vanger clan, including Martin Vanger, current CEO of the Vanger Corporation, Isabella Vanger, mother of Martin and Harriet Vanger, and Cecilia Vanger, a headmistress who was Harriet Vanger's younger aunt and friend, though Cecilia's sister Anita Vanger was closer both in age and friendship to the missing girl.Despite all expectation to the contrary, Mikael Blomkvist identifies new evidence into the disappearance of Harriet Vagner. One clue is a pair of photographs, detailing her sudden discomfort at the sight of a young man in a prep school blazer. Another lies in her journal, which contains a set of five names and five-digit numbers believed to be old telephone numbers.However, Pernilla Abrahamsson, his daughter, identifies them as passages from the Book of Leviticus. They describe rules about the treatment and punishment of women, and Mikael Blomkvist correlates one of them with the grotesque murder of a Vanger Corporation secretary in 1949. Mikael Blomkvist realizes that he may be on the trail of a serial killer, and the scope of the resulting research makes him request a research assistant – Lisbeth Salander.Lisbeth Salander is a computer hacker with a photographic memory and the titular girl. She was ruled legally incompetent as a child and is under the care of a legal guardian, Holger Palmgren. When he had a stroke, Nils Bjurman, who uses his position to extort sexual favors from her and eventually rapes her, replaces Holger Palmgren. After using a hidden camera to record her assault, Lisbeth Salander takes her revenge, torturing Holger Bjurman and threatening to ruin him unless he gives her full control of her life and finances. Lisbeth Salander then uses a tattoo machine to brand him as a rapist.When Mikael Blomkvist sees the report she prepared for Henrik Vanger, he realises that Lisbeth Salander has hacked into his computer. He confronts her and asks her to help him with the investigation, to which she agrees. The two eventually become lovers, but Lisbeth Salander continues to keep him at an emotional distance. Together, they continue their investigation and their suspicions are heightened when a local cat is left dismembered on Mikael Blomkvist's porch, and when he is fired upon from a distance during an afternoon jog.The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is written rather well. It is a wonderful psychological thriller novel set in Sweden. It started and ended rather slow, but the middle of the book was quite invigorating. The novel perks up as their investigation gains speed, through it was quite difficult determining who's who in the Vanger family tree as there are various cousins, nephews, half-siblings, and the like that seem to populate the family.The last third (thematically) of the narrative seemed to slow down and to really concluded the narrative that started at the beginning with Mikael Blomkvist's dealings with Hans-Erik Wennerström, while not as interesting as the Vanger case, it made a rather nice conclusion, despite it being a tad more boring. I am not sure, if it is the writing or the translation to blame, but this last part was a tad of struggle to finish. Finally, the characters seemed to be subdued or shallow, again not sure if it was the writing or translation or if it is the Swedish culture, but the characterization should be more in depth.All in all, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is written extremely well and is a strong start to what would hopefully be a wonderful series, which I plan to continue in the very near future.",10,-0.9943,0.138,0.772,0.09,0.4575385934819897,NEGATIVE,0.5803

136,33963654,09/27/2008,4.0,"I work in a bookstore and this arrived as an ARC several days before the promotional material, and thusly the hype surrounding it, arrived. I had no idea upon grabbing it that it was to become of falls ""hot new reads."" That's my story and I'm sticking with it.The back story is this: Stieg Larsson, political journalist and activist in Sweden, completed a trilogy (with The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo being the first), which were eventually sold to a publisher. Shortly before the publication of the book, Larsson died of a massive heart attack in 2004. Rumours of his death as not being natural have been swirling, which perhaps have lent greater mystique to the series. The books were published to great acclaim and became international bestsellers. The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo was released in the U.S. in September, 2008.Mikael Blomkvist, a middle-aged journalist/activist, has been found guilty of libel for a piece he wrote against Hans-Erik Wennerström, a corrupt Swedish industrialist. Blomkvist, known for his insightfully and well researched pieces, leaves his old life defeated and broken. He is contacted by Henrik Vanger, an aging patriarch of a well-connected family to help him with one thing: Solve a 40 year old mystery of the possible murder and kidnapping of the patriarch's beloved niece while working under the guise of researching the Vanger family history. In return, Vanger will hand over evidence to Blomkvist that will nail Wennerström to the wall for good.What follows is a twisting, complex and at times horrifying, thriller that scourges to the bottom of human nature. As Blomkvist continues to dig into the history of the Vangers, and discovering what actually happened on that fateful day in 1964, the more of the family horrors began to surface. There is a reason why the book was originally published in Sweden under the title, ""Men Who Hate Women."" Larsson is graphic in his descriptions and at times, the brutality of what he describes is off-putting. One one level, are we really all that innocent or are we just oblivious to what happens around us? Are some family histories better left buried or will redemption come if they are unearthed? One would like to think that not all humans can be as bad as apparently some of the Vanger (and other minor characters laced neatly through the book) can be, but on the other, we hear and see about these horrors in our daily news consumption.Larsson addresses many themes in his novel, good versus evil, love and redemption, self-sacrifice and luck versus chance and fate. Lisbeth Salander, the girl with the dragon tattoo, has been discussed as an unforgeable character and enlightened character who works with Blomkvist on researching the mystery. What has happened to her, in her life, is as equally shocking and despairing as what occurred within the Vanger family - but Salander is not a victim and she despises those who, in her mind, who are regardless of situation and circumstance. She is a woman whom on some level we all want to be and yet on another, repulse from. The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo will pull you in and and keep you hooked until the very last page. Some of the same reviews mentioned early stated that they found the ending incomplete and wholly unsatisfying. On one hand, I can see why that would think that, Larsson's intention for a trilogy (hopefully the next two books will be available in the U.S.) leaves a lot of things unsettled and unfinished. But do not let that dissuade you from reading this novel, it will make you think, act, hope and hug your loved ones close to you. ",10,0.8024,0.089,0.808,0.103,0.4584941249226964,NEGATIVE,0.8435
137,102663346,05/13/2010,3.0,"My thoughts on this book are scattered, despite several hours, make that 24 hours of ruminating over it. It isn’t particularly interesting, I guessed the who done it theme within 70 pages, but it isn’t put downable either. It took me a week to finish because I kept picking it up, reading about 75 pages, growing tired as nothing truly exciting ever happens, casting it aside, but feeling guilty about neglecting it, wondering if it would ever reach a break neck pace, and then succumbing to guilt and would begin reading it yet again. It never does change pace, it simply remains consistent in describing the day to day, or week to week happenings of these strangely perverse characters’ lives and the circumstances in which they find themselves. One thing this book did accomplish was to allow me to finally grasp what I don’t like about a majority of adult fiction. The characters are aloof. Even if the characters are colorfully described, as these characters certainly were, I never forgot that I was reading. I never immersed myself in their lives and traveled their journey alongside them as though I was experiencing everything with them. I was aware of ever turn of the page. No matter how well written a book is, as this one is, if I can’t forget myself, I can rate it more than three stars.Stieg Larsson has also proven that female YA authors aren’t the only writers that fall prey to writing wish fulfillment. Mikael was a Gary Stu personified. Here we have a character that is renowned for his moral dealings in the literary world and yet he has had a 20 year affair with his married colleague while he was also married. I must have missed where adultery was the definition of morals. And this moral writing guru is convicted of libel because he failed to check his sources. Shouldn’t an accomplished writer know better? Furthermore, his wang is irresistible to every female character mentioned in this book below the age of 80, even the autistic savant/hacker/bi-sexual. LOL, men. But what really took the cake was the fact that Mikael, a financial journalist, is the one who solves a 40 year old murder case that confounded experts for nearly half a century. Please.I can’t really mention Lisbeth as I don’t truly understand her. She is a strange bird, but I liked her, of reasons I can’t explain. She is an interesting freak show. I have only two qualms with her character. I couldn’t believe that she was autistic, nor could I believe that she would have willingly put herself in the situation she finds herself in with her guardian. Neither contributed to her character development or the development of the plot and I felt as though both mentions were added for shock value purposes. After the above comments, it will probably seem as though I didn’t like the book, but I am glad that I read it. There is something bizarrely enthralling about it that I can’t quite put my finger on. I suppose it’s the mundane mentions of some truly obscene characters. I just don’t know. I suspect it’s a Swedish thing as I felt the same way about Let the Right One In. Wish fulfillment and predictable plot aside, this book is written well. I can’t imagine continuing on with the series, but this was a worthy investment of a few hours nonetheless.",10,-0.0985,0.11,0.773,0.116,0.4192755825734549,NEGATIVE,0.9998
138,74073505,10/10/2009,1.0,"Larsson's plot exists as a series of distinct strands. I intially was interested in the Salander plotline and assumed, based upon the title of the book, that it would play a major role. In reality Salander is a plot piece, not a character. She exists to hack computers and do busywork that the male lead cannot be bothered to do. For a book that gives the appearance of adovcating women's rights Larsson has done an exceptional job of portraying women as reflections of men. Salander, Berger, Harriet and the minor female cast are acted upon by males and respond but their responses never appear to have any impact upon the male charatcers.Perhaps this was Larsson attempting to make a comment about women being exploited in contemporary society, the crime statistics would attest to this. However, if that was the case his attempt failed.The Harriet plotline was weak and illogical from beginning to end. From the first page I assumed that the person sending the flowers was in fact the supposed victim. It took 400 pages of nonsensical rambling plot for my intial thought to be proved accurate. The decision to hire a financial journalist to investigate a supposed murder is never properly explained. Also it is completely unbelievable that although repeatedly stated that anyone with any degree of contact with Henrik knows of his obession with Harriets disappearance yet, in 30 years Anita never told Harriet that Henrik assumed she was dead. The incest storyline seemed needless and the resulting coverup of Martins crimes was nonsensical. The crimes could have been revealed without revealing the incest were it not for the fact that Salander destroyed the evidence of Martin's crimes for no apparent reason. Even after that the photographs and the torture chamber remained as evidence.The Wennerstrom plotline dominated the opening and closing sections of the book but hardly rated a mention in the central portion. This uneven pacing gave the appearance that Wennerstrom was a contrivance that existed merely to give Blomkvist a (ultimately baseless) reason to take the Harriet case. The fact that the entire plotline could be solved by a handy piece of hacking demonstrates the weakness of the premise. The fact that the premise required Wennerstrom to be a complete idiot (depsite the fact he has apparently been getting away with his crimes for many, many years) was similarly discouraging.The 'global financial crisis' should establish a sense of realism within the Wennerstrom plotline and the crime statistics should do so with the Salander or Harriet plotlines but in actuality not one of Larsson constructs feels even vaguely realistic. Each appears to have been set up in order to precipitate the next whilst holding no intrinsic value. The overall effect is the impression of a solid novel but when considered beyond face value you are left with the feeling that it was all smoke and mirrors and wondering what the point was.

And I wish Goodreads had a special star for 'disturbing & bizarre'! And I wish a female reader who had given this 5 stars can tell me, ""why on earth she did that!"" I get it, people have a strange curiosity towards crime & violence. Mr. Freud may have a theory written, or even if there isn't, it can be explained by the fame of books/movies about serial killers like Erzsebet Bathory, Jack the Ripper...

I'm guessing both. Many repetitions! (spoilers perhaps) *This book contains some of the creepiest things I've read in the novel murder, Nazism, sexual sadism, creepy freakish serial killers, casual sex with crazy twists, incest, rape, really please... I think selection of one or two of the above will do to sell a novel. I admire writers with talents to come up with challenging characters. I just don't get the same spark with this author. Then, I just don't get the name of the book!!! Firstly she is branded by the author. No one is the story calls her ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" as a pet name or something, then Lisbeth Salander only gets active in the main plot after 3/4 of the novel. In the middle, Larsson tries to tell her story but I just couldn't get the connection. I was annoyed. Then all these ""ooh""s and ""aah""'s about Lisbeth Salander being a amazing character, please... She is badly written. What makes her unique is her tatoos, tough clothes, numerous piercings etc etc. Hello, it's call branding! I personally feel Larsson had tried to make Salander ""a social freak"".There's more to characterization than outer appearance. She is a unique character, I completely agree but if someone wants to compliment a character who gets social out-cast treatment but is amazingly talented; then should have changed the name of the book. May be to ""The Girl with the Photographic Memory"" or something. Finally I HATED the way the novel ended. I really did. The crimes here are despicable to be wiped under the carpet.

This is my first 5-star mystery/crime thriller for this year.I believe I have had been putting The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo off for a lot many years but when one of my friends got on my nerves (LOL), I had to read and I am so freaking glad I did.This is an INTELLECTUAL story and not one story but a web of stories interwoven.Personally, I think the book shouldn’t be named “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo” because ‘The Girl’ here is just a part of the narrative, obviously a substantial part but this book SO MUCH MORE than that!!I was ashamed of myself when I was not able to comprehend the first fifty pages because I was like- What is this corporate crap?? But then it flowed so naturally that I was struggling to spare time because I didn’t want to do anything else but delve into it! I finally found myself glued to this book somewhere in the middle when it actually started to get interesting.So without much ado, I would maybe try to summarise it because it’s too much to be put in a few words--Harriet Vanger, niece of Henrik Vanger, CEO of Vanger Industries disappears out of the blue. Henrik hires Mikael Blomkvist, a reputable Stockholm financial journalist in Millenium, to solve the case.- Lisbeth Salander, a brainy sleuth and a hacker who lends a hand in solving Harriet’s mystery with Mikael. (She’s an amazing character... ‘S.M.A.R.T’)- Mikael along with his co-owner and occasional lover Erika Berger is already struggling with his corporate affairs with Wennerström and deeply desires to unmask his corrupt practices.All of this plus a lot of men-who-hate-women stuff covers the whole narrative.This book should be on your TBR as number one read when it comes to Crime fiction or Crime thrillers and anyone who is sensitive to barbarism or violence should try to avoid or not mind the particular part BUT DO READ IT!

141,97193276,04/05/2010,4.0,"Lisbeth Salander, the girl of the title, is kick ass. And kind of scary. I don't think I'd be friends with her, but I would respect her and never, ever, piss her off. She makes this book worth reading, despite all its other faults. This is not great literature, it's a mess of a book with elements that made me cringe, but I couldn't put it down because of Lisbeth.She almost takes too long to come into the story. Larsson makes us wait, and he almost lost me by starting out not with Lisbeth, but with a framing story about Mikael Blomkvist. Mikael is a reporter on trial for libel against a prominent businessman, and we get to learn a plethora of mind-numbingly dull details about financial shenanigans. For anyone thinking about reading this, don't sweat these details, just skim all this intro stuff quickly to get the basic idea. You won't miss anything.Add to that a thicket of interchangeable (to me, anyways) Swedish names, an intergenerational family with too many members to keep track of that plays a central role, and details about how many cupboards there are in the kitchen that I didn't need to know (although it's cute that the author thinks I might want to know, maybe it's a Swedish thing?) and you have a book crying out for an editor. But I'm glad I persevered.Lisbeth Salander is completely asocial, a computer genius, bisexual, and SO not afraid to use violence. She's a ward of the state with a mysterious past. Just like Mikael Blomkvist, who she joins forces with, we grow fascinated with her, and her ferocity. She's like Dirty Harry, she lives by her own code, which is not necessarily within the law. Something happened to her in her childhood, something evil, but what? WHAT??? I couldn't turn pages fast enough, and then I dived straight into the second book, to find out more. The other mystery, about the disappearance of a young woman years ago, was interesting, too, but took a disquieting turn toward the end that I found overly sensationalized.One last note: This book is not for anyone squeamish about violence towards women. I do NOT want to see the movie they recently made based on it, I had enough trouble reading certain sections, I don't want to see them depicted on screen.

142,2338808381,03/24/2018,3.0,"Other reviewers have noted the clunky writing style: many basic mistakes for fiction writing. At one point, he even describes the main character, Lisbeth Salander, assembling a bed from Ikea, incorporating the exact Ikea instructions, point by point, in his book.Another example that comes to mind: a mysterious person travels by train from north Sweden to Stockholm. Once in his hotel room, the author describes the stranger laying out his neck ties on his bed and describes them in detail. He also gives an account of what's in the room's mini-bar. A basic guideline for modern fiction writing: try to include facts that tell you something useful or interesting about a major character and/or that moves the plot forward. Train ride good. Irrelevant details about the hotel room, bad.....delete.As an author, I wondered what happened to the editing process. I finally tracked down an essay by his Swedish editor. (I'm afraid I don't have a link for it). She explained that the author wrote the entire trilogy before submitting any of it to her. She had not seen any of his writing before that, except for his political magazine, which is very different than fiction writing. Once submitted, the editor immediately saw numerous problems. But the author resisted any editing. (Not unusual for first time authors). Very soon after, Larsson, encountering an out of order elevator in his office building in Stockholm, decided to climb several levels of stairs which triggered a fatal heart attack. (The journalist character in the books, Mikael Blomkvist, is based on the author, including his horrible health habits). The editor decided to honor Larsson's ""wishes"" and not edit the books. Personally, I find this puzzling, as there are many obvious fixes that could only improve the books without undermining what Larsson was trying to do.So why such large sales of badly-written books? I think, without question, it's the appeal of the Lisbeth Salander character.",10,0.1053,0.047,0.903,0.051,0.5052944188428059,NEGATIVE,1.0

I read it on two flights, and on both, flight attendants tapped me on the shoulder to say ""Isn't it great?! I'm on the third one now."" It was a very odd experience, as people rarely seem to acknowledge what I'm reading. I don't think I've read a book that was this much in the zeitgeist in years. It was the closest I've come to a mass experience involving a book. So that was interesting.As for the book itself, it was...okay. I really enjoyed the early Lisbeth Salander sections. She's such a great Tarantino-esque female character (even as she later falls into the dreadful male fantasy aspects of the novel). Once she was more actively integrated into the story, the book really took off. As many people have noted, the beginning of the book was interminable, and the end was also surprisingly drawn out. It was like one of those movies that ends five times. But in between, I have to admit, it was a page-turner. Supremely creepy and very well-plotted. Was there too much coffee drinking? Yes. Was sex for Blomqvist always bizarrely consequence-free? Yes. Was the book still enjoyable? Yes. Am I dying to read the next installment? No. I can't entirely say why, but it wasn't the kind of reading experience that left me hungry for the next book in the series.

This book is dark and twisted and incredibly complex.The story starts simply enough, a journalist, Mikael Blomkvist, recently accused of libel is higher by an aging millionaire, Henrik Vagner, to investigate a forty-year-old murder.  With the help of genius hacker Lisbeth Salander, Mikael starts looking into the many secrets of the Vagner family. There they discover conspiracies spanning generations and secrets that are better left buried.Every time Blomkvist and Salander discovered something new about the Vanger's I thought that it simply could not get worse. But, of course, there was always more, always a darker truth.Even the characters were extremely dark, especially Lisbeth, a survivor of rape and abuse. She was a dark, and bitter, and intelligent, and sympathetic. Although despite the title, this is more so Blomkvist's story than hers, Lisbeth is the one that sets it all in motion. It is she who gets all the pieces to move and finally makes the breakthrough to find out just what happened to Harriet Vanger all those years ago.I can't say anything more without revealing important details. Just know that the book has many small, interconnecting plot lines, very complex and flawed character, complicated romances, and a great mystery. I can say no more without spoiling you.In the end, I only wish that the book would have kept its original title when it got translated into English. The Swedish title, Men Who Hate Women, is much more fitting to the topics discussed in this novel. While The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, does have a certain appeal, I think the Swedish title makes a greater statement.",11,0.8977,0.086,0.784,0.131,0.583917748917749,POSITIVE,0.9995
145,3183400072,02/09/2020,5.0,"This book is the first of the famous (and very read) Millennium trilogy. The millennium has nothing to do with it, in the sense that Millennium is the name of the magazine specialized in journalistic investigations with a social and economic background, above all major scandals, involving well-known personalities. The protagonist, or rather, the co-protagonist, is the editor-in-chief of the magazine, Mikael Blomkvist; the other co-protagonist is Lisbeth Salander, an unconventional girl who in transverse ways is in the position of knowing and helping Mikael. In this first investigation, Mikael, who is back from a libel trial in which he was convicted, accepts a somewhat anomalous assignment compared to his journalistic activity, that is, to try to solve an unsolved case of 30 years before. The client is a very wealthy old man who, before his life ends, decides to try everything possible to find out what happened to his favorite granddaughter many years before. This is where Lisbeth comes into play, almost by chance, with her computer skills and competences, to help Mikael to arrive at the truly unexpected discovery that will conclude the investigation. I love Scandinavian writers and knowing that Stieg Larsson will never write any more books hurts me. His writing is ideal for this type of story, a bit technological, a bit sociological and very thrilling: dark, full of expectations, with sudden twists and turns, interspersed with pieces of daily life suddenly interrupted by unexpected events. The ending is truly unforgettable and luckily I had already bought the second and third volumes, if not I don't know how I could have resisted.",10,0.9803,0.031,0.834,0.136,0.526388888888889,POSITIVE,0.9999

wrong
... (refer to the horrible Flickan under gatan for more on how you should not do it).Or the book is not really all that good.It's kind of long. Unnecessarily complex. Does not have one believable character (and no, Lisbeth is not the most unlikely, the author's alter ego - you know the do-gooder that all women want to bed (and get to too, their men are so smitten so they cannot help but to be OK with that) - holds that record.)And it has a most unsatisfying end, calling for even further suspension of disbelief, just when you thought you had given all there is to give.It gets an ""OK"" rating, because it is, but books in this genre that are ""OK"" are a dime a dozen...The movies are actually a step up (even if the Swedish version leans heavily on Noomi Rapace's portrayal of Lisbeth - the other actors must have been the targets of a very cruel joke by the director), so I would suggest either one of them instead.",10,-0.564,0.071,0.874,0.055,0.5215909090909091,NEGATIVE,1.0
147,160416616,04/11/2011,2.0,"Boy, does this book need an editor. There's actually a pretty good mystery here, but it's buried under layers of tedious exposition, unnecessary description, and especially Stieg Larsson's transparent Mary Sue-ism. For those who aren't familiar with the term, a ""Mary Sue"" is a derogatory term in fan fiction for a character that is just a little too good to be true, and who is clearly an avatar of the writer. A Mary Sue character's painfully obvious purpose is fantasy fulfillment for said writer. In this case, the late Stieg Larsson, a middle aged Swedish magazine writer, has penned a novel about...a middle-aged Swedish magazine writer. Every woman in the book, including the title character, wants to sleep with him, because he's such a nice, mellow, undemanding guy. He solves a mystery that no one else could. After he solves the mystery, he spends a completely unnecessary 100+ more pages getting his revenge against people who were mean to him at the beginning of the book. And so on. All that said, once the story actually gets going, it's interesting enough to keep you reading. I did finish it, but I doubt that I'll be reading the next two. I'll take a friend's advice and just watch the movies on Netflix. ",9,0.9354,0.066,0.792,0.141,0.5592013888888888,NEGATIVE,1.0
