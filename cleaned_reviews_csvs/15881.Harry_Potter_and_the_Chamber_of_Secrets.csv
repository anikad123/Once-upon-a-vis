Gotta get through this one so that my daughter can start it next. <3*********************""It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.""What can I say that hasn't been said before about this series? What words can do this book justice? I've felt at a loss on how to explain my feelings for these books as I've read them. I didn't experience them as a child and therefore my experience is clearly different than most others on here, but in some ways I think it's just as magical to read these for the first time as an adult as it was for everyone who devoured these as they were published in their childhood. I have kids, so I was constantly wondering how my 5 year old will accept these books when she's a bit older and tried to view the story through her eyes. The holidays are always a busy, stressful time for us. All of our family is a hefty distance to travel to and, on top of that, we're moving into our new place this month. All I could think about was how desperately I wanted to escape all of my adult responsibilities for just a bit each day, and this was the perfect book to do so with. No matter your age, the magical world of Hogwarts is truly spectacular; the characters are such that they stay with you even after the final page is turned and the writing takes you back to a place you weren't sure existed for us old farts anymore. If you have been hiding under a rock for the past 20 years like I have, I highly encourage you pick these books up and get swept away like I did. Time is a precious commodity these days, and you couldn't spend it in a better way than with these precious kiddos.",535,0.9887,0.051,0.796,0.153,0.581114478114478,POSITIVE,0.9971
2,463025498,11/25/2012,5.0,"I love this book, of course I do, but the fact remains that this book prominently featured two of my most hated Harry Potter characters. Ginny Weasley and Dobby. There, I said it. I hate them both. In my Harry Potter hate list, Ginny and Dobby probably rank somewhere below Umbridge and Peter Pettigrew. Yeah, you heard me. I hate them that much.The reason I hate Ginny is---well, never mind. I don't want to start another shipping war here, the last one was terrible enough, so let the reason for my hatred be implicit and unsaid. Dobby is freaking annoying, yo. All his eagerness and shit - and yeah, I know what happens in the end. Doesn't matter. I still hate Dobby. Dobby is the equivalent of fingernails on chalkboard for me. If he had been my elf, I'd have given him a sock already so he could his whimpering, sniveling ass out of my life. He means well, I know he does, it's just that he's such a frustratingly well-meaning bumbling idiot.
“You know what, Harry? If he doesn’t stop trying to save your life he’s going to kill you.”
Aaaaaaaand one final note.
“Ginny!” said Mr. Weasley, flabbergasted. “Haven’t I taught you anything. What have I always told you? Never trust anything that can think for itself if you can’t see where it keeps its brain?""
No particular reason I included that, except for the fact that it reminded me of my ex-boyfriend :3",515,-0.9974,0.284,0.639,0.077,0.7619047619047621,NEGATIVE,1.0

4,3219138936,03/23/2020,3.0,"This was a cute middle grade book. Even though it was slow, I liked it a little more than the first book since at this point the world has already been established and now we get to see more of the characters and the setting. Ron and his family, especially the twins, are endearing. I also thought it was interesting seeing Harry’s internal struggle with whether he was truly Gryffindor or Slytherin, and the payoff later on about how it is our choices that show what we truly are. I didn’t like how the mystery was conveniently solved, the monologue of explanation from the villain at the end, and how Hermione was literally petrified throughout most of the book just so that she wouldn’t have figured everything out right away.

6,1595711302,03/30/2016,5.0,"Re-read audio 2017 ♥Okay, I'm going to do a little *spoilery* in this review so those of you that haven't read the book then you might just want to look at the pictures. I have picked a ton of pictures from the book but believe me, there are plenty more beautiful ones in the book. Plus, if your a Harry Potter fan you will be getting the book anyway if you haven't already!So poor Harry is stuck back with the Dursley's on Privet Drive. And even though Harry is a relative, they still treat him like poo because he's magical. Ewwwwww. Harry is depressed because he has be cut off from talking to his friends or getting any kind of correspondence. Even poor Hedwig has been locked in her cage and hasn't been able to fly around. CRUEL! But Harry can't use magic inside the muggle world. Then Harry meets Doby - the little house-elf that is waiting for him in his room. It turns out that Doby has been intercepting his correspondence because he fears for Harry's life and doesn't want him to return to Hogwarts. So Doby causes some problems at the house that get Harry in trouble. I had to add this cute little picture of Doby running off, look at his little butt. lol ↓Then one night, Ron, George and Fred pull up outside Harry's window in their dads flying car to save Harry. It's pretty funny how they get it all going but that is okay as long as Harry gets away from his evil relatives. Of course, Mrs. Weasley is not pleased when they get back home. The sneaking out part didn't work very well, but she welcomed Harry with open arms and he stayed with them until it was time for them all to go back to school. I love that picture of the Weasley house =) Life at The Burrow was as different as possible from life in Privet Drive. The Dursleys liked everything neat and ordered; the Weasleys' house burst with the strange and unexpected. Harry got a shock the first time he looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantlepiece and it shouted, 'Tuck your shirt in, scruffy!' The ghoul in the attic howled and dropped pipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet, and small explosions from Fred and George's bedroom were considered perfectly normal. What Harry found most unusual about life at Ron's, however, wasn't the talking mirror or the clanking ghoul: it was the fact that everybody there seemed to like himPoor sweet Harry and I would love to live with the Weasleys' for a bit =) Look at cute, fat little Scabbers ↓The kids are going to meet Hermione to get some shopping done. But ole Harry takes a wrong turn down the chimney hole and ends up in some creepy shop. He hides and gets to hear some things Malfoy and his father are talking about.Finally Harry makes it out of the store and Hagrid finds him and gets him to the right place with his friends. Then Ron and Harry are blocked from getting on the train soooooo back to stealing the flying car. AND of course they get into trouble when they get to Hogwarts but it wasn't anything too bad. Snape looked as though Christmas had been cancelled. He cleared his throat and said. 'Professor Dumbledore, these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry, caused serious damage to an old and valuable tree . . . surely acts of this nature . . . 'It will be for Professor McGonagall to decide on these boys' punishments, Severus,' said Dumbledore calmly. 'They are in her house and are therefore her responsibility.' He turned to Professor McGonagall. 'I must go back to the feast, Minerva, I've got to give out a few notices. Come, Severus, there's a delicious-looking custard tart I want to sample.'There is a new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor named Gideroy Lockhart. He's a bit off but still . . . Anyway things are not right at Hogwarts. (are they ever?) And Harry and the gang must figure out what's going on. Poor ole Hagrid gets sent off to Azkaban for something he didn't do! Malfoy is a jerk, as if we didn't know that. lol Harry and Ron go out in the woods to meet Aragog the spider that is friends of Hagrid to find out some truth behind some stuff. Comes to find out there is this diary of a person named Tom Riddle. I'm not telling you who this person really is but they are the one causing all kinds of trouble for a lot of people. In the end Harry has to end up fighting a Basilisk to set things right. He has the help of the sorting hat for reasons, Dumbledore's Phoenix and a sword. Oh happy day! There is loads more to the book then the things I have described but you can just read it and if you haven't, why haven't you? Harry Potter rocks and always will. There is another happy ending for sweet Doby! ♥Harry gives Dobby his stinky sock so this releases Doby. He now has his freedom from the evil Lucius Malfoy! Woot! 'Come, Dobby, I said, Come!'But Dobby didn't move. He was holding up Harry's disgusting, slimy sock, and looking at it as though it were a priceless treasure. 'Master has given Dobby a sock,' said the elf in wonderment. 'Master gave it to Dobby.''What's that?' spat Mr. Malfoy. 'What did you say?''Dobby has got a sock,' said Dobby in disbelief. 'Master threw it, and Dobby caught it, and Dobby-Dobby is free.'Lucius Malfoy stood frozen, staring at the elf. Then he lunged for Harry. 'You've lost me my servant, boy!'But Dobby shouted, 'You shall not harm Harry Potter!'There was a loud bang, and Mr. Malfoy was thrown backwards. He crashed down the stairs, three at a time, landing in a crumbled heap on the landing below. He got up, his face livid, and pulled out his wand, but Dobby raised a long threatening finger. 'You shall go now,' he said fiercely, pointing down at Mr. Malfoy. 'You shall not touch Harry Potter. You shall go now.'Lucius Malfoy had no choice. With a last, incensed stare at the pair of them, he swung his cloak around him ad hurried out of sight.This book is wonderful, it always has been and always will, and the graphics in this book make it even better. ♥MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading List",306,0.996,0.097,0.763,0.141,0.5954524480687271,NEGATIVE,0.9694
7,2048866437,07/04/2017,5.0,"”It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.”And here I go with another one of my short “My thoughts about this book” reviews. I can’t believe that I forgot so many things. Like for instance the fact that Dumbledore actually was a Transfiguration teacher before he became headmaster. Kinda suitable that this is McGonagall’s role now. ;-) 1.) ”Harry Potter asks if he can help Dobby … Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir, but of your goodness, Dobby never knew…”Aww Dobby! It was so good to see him again! He’s really one of the best HP characters ever and this even though he made it kind of tough to like him. *lol* Well, at least at the beginning. Poor Harry! XD2.) ”Your sons flew that car to Harry’s house and back last night!” shouted Mrs Weasley. “What have you got to say about that, eh?”“Did you really?” said Mr Weasley eagerly. “Did it go all right? I-I mean,” he faltered, as sparks flew from Mrs Weasley’s eyes, “that-that was very wrong, boys – very wrong indeed …”I’ll always love how Mr Weasley is more interested in finding out if the car flew well than in his kids actually flying the car! *lol* Also Molly Weasley giving him hell for not reacting the way a responsible parent is supposed to is just epic! Haha! Those two. You can see they have a great marriage! ;-P3.) ”Mr Weasley had a cut lip and Mr Malfoy had been hit in the eye by an Encyclopedia of Toadstools.”How could I forget that Mr Weasley threw himself at Malfoy? One of the best things in this book ever! Not that I support violence (I’m a pacifist) but even I can’t help appreciating that Lucius Malfoy for once, actually had his ass handed to him. XD 4.) ”That vanishing cabinet was extremely valuable!” he was saying gleefully to Mrs Norris. “We’ll have Peeves out this time, my sweet.”How come I never noticed this before?! The foreboding!!! OMG! Like damn, there are so many things that are mentioned only briefly and rather casually and then when you continue to read the series they reappear with a vengeance! O_o With every book I read I’m more and more awed by J.K Rowling’s genius! 5.) ”Homework: compose a poem about my defeat of the Wagga Wagga werewolf! Signed copies of Magical Me to the author of the best one!”Gilderoy Lockhart is so full of himself! I swear he must have been the worst DADA teacher they ever had. And they had many over the years which even Dumbledore can’t deny. Loved that bit at the ending when he said he’d have to write an ad because they “seem to run through them”. *lol*6.) ”You are Muggle-born?”“Half-blood, sir,” said Riddle. “Muggle father, witch mother.”There definitely was a history lesson hidden in there. It’s fascinating how Riddle of all people could be a half-blood and then go against Muggle born wizards! I’m sure J.K. Rowling thought about World War II when she wrote this, because all the pure-blood and half-blood etc. stuff reminds me of a very dark chapter in German history… >_<7.) ”But why’s she got to go to the library?”“Because that’s what Hermione does,” said Ron, shrugging. “When in doubt, go to the library.”Did anyone notice how well Ron knows Hermione? And how often he defended her in this book? I mean he actually would have fought Malfoy with his bare hands if Harry and Dean would have allowed it! It’s so obvious that Ron cares about her deeply! To vomit snails without complaining about it should count as the ultimate indication of eternal love and affection! *LOL*8.) ”Of course,” she said, and Harry, amazed, saw a tear glistening in her beady eye.McGonagall losing it was another great moment in this book! When you least expect it she always shows some kindness and heart and to be honest this never ceases to amaze me! XD She’s a great teacher and I’m not surprised that she always takes over when Dumbledore isn’t around. 9.) ”You’re in luck,” said Harry, forcing Lockhart to his feet at wandpoint. “We think we know where it is. And what’s inside it. Let’s go.”I just love Harry, okay?! *lol* For such a young kid he certainly has a lot of guts and courage! The way he dealt with Lockhart? I think not even an adult wizard could have done it any better. XD The sheer audacity to demand aid from him like that. YES! Haha! <310.) (view spoiler)[”Voldemort put a bit of himself in me?” Harry said, thunderstruck.”I CAN’T BELIEVE ROWLING ALREADY MENTIONED THIS IN BOOK TWO!!! I mean Harry quite literally said that Voldemort put a bit of himself in him!!! A part of his soul!!! It’s so obvious that Harry is a Horcrux!!! GAH!!! It’s all there and I never saw it!!! That’s just brilliant! Dumbledore must have known all along! I really need to reread the entire series because I can’t remember if he already knew it right from the beginning or if it was just a theory at first.  (hide spoiler)]I can’t wait to read “The Prisoner of Azkaban”! I’m afraid it might have to wait until next year though! So many books, so little time! ;-) ______________________________As always I loved this! <3And boy there were so many hints! The foreboding is real in this one! *lol*Also I kinda like that every book ends with the school year and that there’s no cliff-hanger! I never thought about this but HP is so successful and this even though there are never cliff-hangers. XD (Well, at least not in the strict sense...)Must be magic! ;-P______________________________I’m already reading 6 books,
BUT
this is Harry Potterand it’s autumn close to Halloweenand I just need another comfort read? *lol* Plus 2 of my six books will be finished soon so this means that I’ll be down to 5 again which is my usual amount. XDLook at me being all reasonable and responsible. Haha! ;-PBut honestly, do I even need a reason to read Harry Potter? No, HP can be read anytime! =))",298,0.9995,0.073,0.73,0.197,0.5727650639543843,POSITIVE,0.9974
8,1820638045,11/24/2016,5.0,"ENGLISH (Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets) / ITALIANOBedtime reading for my daughter (and second reading for me). It is once again exciting to wander across the Hogwarts halls, observing the mysterious facts that involve the protagonists, just like we were there too. This is Rowling's rare gift: making sure that we see through the eyes of Harry, Ron and Hermione.The summer holidays have passed, and the new school year is about to start at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry's power is still immature, but Dumbledore's teaching is adamant:«It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities» This time, our young wizards are struggling with the new professor of defense against the dark arts, the dork and vein Gilderoy Lockhart, called to replace Professor Quirrell (died in the previous adventure). However, the joyful atmosphere is soon ruined: strange events begin to happen...Far be it from me to spoiler something of this mystery-fantasy. J.K. Rowling gives us another masterpiece to live, rather than to read. Actually, I do not know if my daughter was more pleased than me to hear this novel, or if I was happier than her to read it and literally interpret it (I even modulated the voices of the different characters). Any excuse to read Harry Potter.Vote: 9Lettura serale per mia figlia (e seconda rilettura per me). E' ancora una volta emozionante vagare per le sale di Hogwarts e osservare i fatti misteriosi che coinvolgono i protagonisti, proprio come se fossimo lì anche noi. Questo è il raro dono della Rowling. Fare in modo che vediamo con gli occhi di Harry, Ron ed Hermione.Trascorse le vacanze estive, alla scuola di magia e stregoneria di Hogwarts sta per iniziare il nuovo anno. Il potere di Harry è ancora immaturo, ma l'insegnamento di Silente è categorico:«Sono le scelte che facciamo, Harry, che dimostrano quel che siamo veramente, molto più delle nostre capacità» Stavolta, i nostri giovani maghi sono alle prese con il nuovo insegnante di difesa dalle arti oscure, il Professor Gilderoy Lockhart, tanto imbranato quanto vanitoso, chiamato a sostituire il Professor Quirrell, deceduto nella precedente avventura. L'atmosfera gioiosa è presto rovinata, però: strani eventi cominciano ad accadere, associati ad una certa camera dei segreti...Lungi da me spoilerare qualcosa di questo fantasy del mistero. J.K. Rowling ci regala un'altro capolavoro da vivere, più che da leggere. A conti fatti, non so se sia stata più contenta mia figlia di sentirselo raccontare, o se sia stato più contento io di leggerlo e letteralmente interpretarlo (ho perfino modulato le voci dei diversi personaggi).

The magical wizarding world of Harry, his friends, and the folks at Hogwart's is just FUN to read about. I am in LOVE with Fawkes the phoenix and I adore Dumbledore...And now I am so worried something bad is going to happen to one of them over the course of the remaining books. And, yes, I know it's probably made you gasp in shock that - in addition to never having read the books before now - I have also never seen any of the movies...and I truly have no idea what happens throughout the remainder of the series. I guess it IS possible to blissfully ignore spoilers for over two decades...unless we are talking about Game of Thrones. Good luck making it a fucking day with all the assholes posting every single scene on Twitter. Not that I'm on Twitter...But I digress.

13,730487563,09/29/2013,5.0,"Welcome to my re-read of the magical series “Harry Potter”. 🤓⚡️My journey this time around is a hybrid of reading the books, listening to a fun (adult) podcast and watching the movies. ❤️📚🎧🎬 ⚠️Spoiler Warning: stop reading now, if you’re unfamiliar with the world of Hogwarts.⚠️Personal Opinion Note: I’m terribly sad for you, if you’ve never read the books (or at least watched the movies). 😉📚🎧🎬I’ll be updating this review as I progress through the series, so, be prepared for a long review. 🤗📚Chapter 1: The Worst BirthdaysThe Dursley’s have not changed. They’re still terrible muggles. Harry has not heard from anyone all summer. Uncle Vernon’s boss is coming to dinner and Harry’s been told to stay upstairs and not make a sound.📚Chapter 2: Dobby’s WarningDobby the house elf really makes a bad first impression. Dobby had been taking all of Harry’s letters all summer, in hopes that Harry wouldn’t want to go back to school. Dobby does a spell and Harry gets the blame, soon after a letter arrives from the ministry of magic giving Harry a warning. Uncle Vernon puts bars on his window and says he can’t go back to Hogwarts.📚Chapter 3: The BurrowThe Weasley’s really are the best! Them showing up in a flying car to rescue Harry is the best scene ever. Harry tells them about Dobby. Fred and George tell him house elves usually belong to rich wizard families. Harry believes Malfoy sent him. Ron is embarrassed by his home, but Harry thinks it’s brilliant.📚Chapter 4: At Flourish and BlottsI love that Hagrid breaks up a fight between two grown wizards! Harry and the Weasley’s head to Diagon Alley to gather school supplies. Gilderoy Lockhart is signing books and announces that he’ll be the new defense against the dark arts teacher. Mr. Weasley gets into a rumble with Mr. Malfoy.📚Chapter 5: The Whomping WillowThat’s one mean tree!! Harry and Ron are unable to get through platform 9 3/4. So, they fly the car, along the train, to Hogwarts. But the crash the car into a very old and angry tree when they arrive. Ron breaks his wand. 🎧Podcast: Binge Mode: Chapters 1-5***Warning: podcast has adult content***Ummm… did you read that warning? If you’re easily offended by things like: swears, wanking jokes, milf’s, etc. etc. do not listen to this podcast. To all my fellow heathens out there, this is not only entertaining- but also very spot on!📚Chapter 6: Gilderoy LockhartOooooo…. Weasley got a Howler!! Needless to say, Mrs. Weasley was none-to-pleased with the car disappearing from the station. Lockhart takes his moment to brag more, but only proves he has no idea what he’s doing. Ron’s wand is malfunctioning. Harry’s got a fan in a first year named Colin. 📚Chapter 7: Mudbloods and MurmursPoor Ron can’t catch a break with that wand. He tried to curse Malfoy for calling Hermione “mudblood” and it backfired, resulting in him puking slugs. Speaking of Malfoy, his father bought his way onto the Slytherin Quidditch team. Harry hears a chilling voice.📚Chapter 8: The Deathday PartyHarry is nice to everyone, even ghosts. Nearly Headless Nick invites Harry to his deathday party. He foregoes the Halloween feast, to attend. Rotten food, cold room, screeching music… not exactly a warm blooded good time. While leaving the party, Harry heard the voice again. This time he follows it to find a message scrolled on a wall, about the chamber of secrets. 📚Chapter 9: The Writing on the WallFilch’s cat got frozen, aka petrified. Professor Binn’s explains the history of the chamber of secrets, which supposedly contains a Slytherin monster that would wipe out all non-pure-blood wizards. The trio speculate that Malfoy may be the heir of Slytherin.📚Chapter 10: The Rogue Bludger Freaking Lockhart… such a dumb dumb!! First Quidditch game against Slytherin and a bludger is targeting Harry. He end up with a broken arm, which Lockhart tries to fish, resulting in the removal of Harry’s bones. As he sits in the hospital, Harry overhears the Colin was petrified as well.🎧Podcast: Binge Mode: Chapters 6-10***Warning: podcast has adult content***I love the why? why? why? We all think it and none of us know. It’s all very intriguing! Like Tom’s trophy still being displayed at Hogwarts… why?? Given who he is and what he’s done, you’d think that thing would be hidden or destroyed.📚Chapter 11: The Dueling ClubPolyjuice Potion in Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom. Hermione’s working on the potion. The whole school has heard about Colin. Lockhart starts dueling club, to keep everyone safe. Harry and Malfoy are matched up. Malfoy congers a snake and Harry speaks parseltongue in front of everyone. Another student and ghost are petrified.📚Chapter 12: The Polyjuice PotionHarry’s called to Dumbledore’s office, where he meets Fawkes the pheonix. The trio takes the polyjuice potion, Harry/Ron become Crabbe/Goyle, pointlessly, as they discovered nothing. Hermione became a cat.📚Chapter 13: The Very Secret DiaryHarry and Ron find a diary with TM Riddle on it. Ron remembers the name from a trophy. Harry discovers the diary writes back and allows him inside memories. He sees why Hagrid was expelled.📚Chapter 14: Cornelius FudgeHarry’s room was broken into and the diary stolen. Quidditch is cancelled and everyone is told the school is on lockdown. The Minister of Magic shows up to take Hagrid to Azkaban (wizard jail) and calls for Dumbledore to step down as head master.🎧Podcast: Binge Mode: Chapters 11-14***Warning: podcast has adult content***It’s really funny how they point out things, like Ginny being upset, so Fred and George scare her… Dumbledore asking Harry point blank if he has anything to tell him and he chooses not to. Truth. Hurts. 📚Chapter 15: Aragog Per Hagrid’s request, Harry and Ron follow spiders into the forest. They find Hagrid’s friend spider, Aragog, who is the size of a horse. The spider tells his family to eat them, but the old flying car rescued them in time.📚Chapter 16: The Chamber of SecretsGinny is still acting strange. The boys visit petrified Hermione, to find a note in her frozen hand, which identifies the monster as a type of snake. They run to tell, but overhear that Ginny was taken. They go into the pipes to find her.📚Chapter 17: The Heir of Slytherin Harry find Ginny in the chamber, with a ghostly Tom Riddle nearby. Tom shares about Ginny and his diary and his identity… Voldemort. Dumbledore’s bird Fawkes appears, carrying the sorting hat. Harry uses a sword from the hat, to kill the snake, gets bit, uses the snake fang to destroy the diary, causing Tom to disappear.📚Chapter 18: Dobby’s RewardHarry talks to Dumbledore about Voldemort. Mr. Malfoy shows up with Dobby on his heals. Harry confronts him about slipping Riddles diary to Ginny. He slips a sock into it and chucks it to Mr. Malfoy. He unknowingly freed Dobby. Lockhart and his wiped memory are no longer an issue. All the petrified get woken up. Gryffindor wins the house cup.🎧Podcast: Binge Mode: Chapters 15-18***Warning: podcast has adult content***They covered so much- but these last chapters covered a ton too! Main points: Why doesn’t Harry replace Ron’s wand for him? He has the money! But treats from the cart will have to do… lol…. Why does the school take so long to wake the petrified? Like those are the only Mandrakes in the world…. Dumbledore assures Harry he’s a true Gryffindor, because of his CHOICE to be in Gryffindor. 🎬Movie #2I wish they had depicted the fist fight between Mr. Malfoy and Mr. Weasley in the movie. But alas, it was left out. But there was a lot still there, that I loved seeing come to life. Travel by floo powder…. the Mandrakes…. Harry going into the diary. I also love how Ron’s voice cracks all the time. It’s really great.🎧Podcast: Binge Mode: Movie***Warning: podcast has adult content***Hedwig!! Poor Hedwig. She does need a bigger cage and boy, oh boy, she had a rough time. Sadly the movie does skip quite a bit. Our choices define us, not our blood- what a great message overall. Hogwarts!! The safest place in the world, lol, where Voldemort has attacked Harry, twice now. I love that they manage to sum up all the thoughts with humor.Checking Chamber of Secrets off my list.

Rowling Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets begins when Harry is spending a miserable summer with his only remaining family, the Dursleys. During a dinner party hosted by his uncle and aunt, Harry is visited by Dobby, a house-elf. Dobby warns Harry not to return to Hogwarts, the magical school for wizards that Harry attended the previous year. Harry politely disregards the warning, and Dobby wreaks havoc in the kitchen, infuriating the Dursleys. The Dursleys angrily imprison Harry in his room for the rest of the summer. Luckily, Harry's friend Ron Weasley steals Harry away in a flying car, and Harry happily spends the rest of the summer at the Weasley home. ... Quidditch practices begin and Draco Malfoy is the new Slytherin seeker. On the field, he calls Hermione a ""mudblood,"" insulting her Muggle heritage. After taunting Hermione, Draco is the suspect when, on Halloween night, someone petrifies the school caretaker's cat and writes a threatening message. Before the cat is attacked, Harry twice hears an eerie voice. He hears it first during his detention and second during a party, moments before the cat is attacked. Everybody in the school is alarmed. By doing some research, Harry, Ron, and Hermione learn that fifty years ago a chamber at Hogwarts was opened and a student was killed. ...عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «هری پاتر و اتاق اسرار»؛ «هری پاتر و اتاق رازها»؛ «هری پاتر و تالار اسرار»؛ «هری پوتر و تالار اسرار»؛ «هری پاتر و حفره اسرار»؛ «هری پاتر و حفره اسرارآمیز»؛ «هری پاتر و دخمه اسرارآمیز»؛ نویسنده: جی.کی رولینگ؛ موضوع: داستانهای خیالی و جادویی برای کودکان و نوجوانان از نویسندگان بریتانیا - سده 20میلادی؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش ماه نوامبر سال 2000میلادی؛ تاریخ دومین خوانش نسخه ای دیگر ماه آگوست سال 2001میلادیعنوان: هری پاتر و حفره اسرارآمیز - کتاب دوم؛ نویسنده: جی.کی رولینگ؛ مترجم: ویدا اسلامیه؛ تهران، کتابسرای تندیس، 1379؛ در 381ص؛ شابک 9645757045؛ چاپ دوم آبان 1379؛ چاپ سوم 1379؛ چاپ چهارم تا چاپ هشتم 1380؛ چاپ نهم 1381؛ چاپ یازدهم 1382؛ چاپ دوازدهم 1383؛ چاپ پانزدهم 1384؛ چاپهای شانزدهم و هفدهم 1385؛ چاپ هجدهم 1386؛ چاپ بیستم 1387؛ چاپ بیست و یکم 1388؛ چاپ بیست و پنجم 1392؛ شابک 9789645757043؛ چاپ بیست و هفتم 1394؛ موضوع: داستانهای نوجوانان از نویسندگان بریتانیا - سده 20معنوان: هری پاتر و تالار اسرار - کتاب دوم؛ نویسنده: جی.کی رولینگ؛ مترجم: طوبی یکتایی؛ تهران، انتشارات شیوه؛ 1379؛ در 345ص؛ شابک9649177892؛ چاپ دیگر تهران، میعاد، 1381؛ در 352ص؛ شابک ایکس - 964693045؛ چاپ دیگر تهران، فرتاب، 1381؛ در345ص؛ شابک 9647964080؛عنوان: هری پاتر و اتاق اسرار؛ نویسنده: جی.کی رولینگ؛ مترجم: محمد قصاع؛ تهران، آینده نگار، 1379؛ در 383ص؛ شابک ایکس-964927071؛ چاپ دوم 1382؛ عنوان: هری پاتر و اتاق رازها؛ نویسنده: جی.کی رولینگ؛ مترجم: نسیم عزیزی؛ تهران، ذکر، قاصدک، 1381؛ در 227ص؛ شابک 9643071979؛ عنوان: هری پاتر و اتاق رازها؛ نویسنده: جی.کی رولینگ؛ مترجم: فریدون قاضی نژاد؛ ویرایش: نسیم عزیزی؛ تهران، روزگار، جوف، 1381؛ در480ص؛ شابک ایکس-9649306170؛ عنوان: هری پاتر و اتاق رازها؛ نویسنده: جی.کی رولینگ؛ مترجم: فریدون قاضی نژاد؛ ویرایش نسیم عزیزی؛ تهران، روزگار، جوف، 1381؛ در480ص؛ شابک ایکس-9649306170؛ عنوان: هری پاتر و تالار اسرار؛ نویسنده: جی.کی رولینگ؛ مترجم: پرتو اشراق؛ تهران، عقیل، 1380؛ در 376ص؛ شابک9646205275؛ عنوان: هری پاتر و تالار اسرار؛ نویسنده: جی.کی رولینگ؛ مترجم: ایران علیپور؛ تهران، عقیل، 1383؛ در 353ص؛ شابک9647689233؛ عنوان: هری پاتر و تالار اسرار؛ نویسنده: جی.کی رولینگ؛ مترجم: مریم شعبانی؛ تهران، سنایی، 1383؛ در هفت و 360ص؛ شابک9646290388؛ ...این جلد را مترجم کتاب: سرکار خانم «طوبی یکتائی»، عنوانش را «هری پوتر و تالار اسرار» نامیده اند، اما نخستین عنوان این جلد را ناشرش تندیس، با ترجمه سرکار خانم «ویدا اسلامیه»، «هری پاتر و حفره ی اسرار » گذاشته است؛ عنوانهای دیگری که کتاب با آن عنوانها منتشر شده آن بالا نوشته ام؛هری پاتر، پسر بچه‌ ای از نسل جادوگرهاست، که پدر و مادرش را، که آنها نیز جادوگر بوده‌ اند، از دست داده؛ با این همه، از چگونگی مرگ آنها خبر ندارد؛ خانواده ی «دورسلی»، یعنی خاله، و شوهرخاله اش، او را از یکسالگی بزرگ کرده اند؛ رفتار خانواده «دورسلی»، با «هری»، هماره تحقیرآمیز بوده است؛ «هری» در یازده سالگی، برای تحصیل به مدرسه جادوگری «هاگوارتز» میرود، و آنجا تجربیات شگرفی می‌اندوزد، و در پی آن، ماجراهایی عجیب و باور نکردنی را، پشت سر می‌گذارد؛ «هری» در پایان سال نخست تحصیلی خود، برای تعطیلات تابستانی به خانه ی «دورسلی»ها بازمی‌گردد؛ اما رفتار نفرت انگیز آنها سبب می‌شود، هری به یاری دوستش از آن‌جا فرارکند، و روزهای مانده از تابستان را، در خانه ی «ویزلی»ها بگذراند؛ سپس با آغاز سال تحصیلی تازه، دوباره به مدرسه «هاگوارتز» بازمی‌گردد؛ آنگاه با ماجراهای شگفت‌ انگیز دیگری رودررو می‌شود؛ در دومین سال تحصیلی «هری» در مدرسه جادوگری هاگوارتز، او با دوستان صمیمی‌ خویش، «رون ویزلی» پسری كنجكاو، و «هرمیون (هرماینی) گرنجر» باهوش‌ترین دختر مدرسه، سعی دارند، پرده از معمای حفره ی اسرارآمیز بردارند؛ حفره‌ ای كه هیولایی مخوف را در خود جای داده است، و رازی بزرگ در ژؤفای آن وجود دارد؛ و ...؛ تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 13/07/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 25/06/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی",217,-0.9875,0.064,0.917,0.019,0.6848484848484848,NEGATIVE,0.9809

Quick thoughts on the things that stood out to me: Wow, the Dursleys were even more loathsome in this book than the first. I love the Weasleys even more than I already did.I am so glad my mother never sent me a Howler.I thought Dobby was annoying in the movie (which I saw when it came out over a decade ago, not having read the book) but I thought he was awesome in the book. In fact, we rewatched the movie last night, and not only was it as unsatisfying as I remember it, it's just a shit adaptation of this book.I thought it was delightful that (view spoiler)[the flying car went into the Forbidden Forest and went feral (hide spoiler)].Tom Riddle's diary was really, really awesome. The entire idea and execution were fantastic.I loved it when Dumbledore told Harry, ""It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities."" I hope that, as the series goes on, we have more scenes with him, because I really love his wisdom.My minor complaints seem a little nitpicky, and I suppose that if I'm going to suspend disbelief to accept that wizards are real, I should be able to accept that (view spoiler)[none of the adults at Hogwarts would look in Hermione's fist to see the paper that Harry and Ron found after she was Petrified (hide spoiler)] and (view spoiler)[Fawkes somehow just found his way into the Chamber of Secrets (hide spoiler)], but I'm an adult and if I'd read this as a kid I wouldn't have cared for a single moment.",216,0.9787,0.083,0.761,0.156,0.6130102040816326,NEGATIVE,0.7123

17,4502465880,01/27/2022,4.0,"The Harry Potter Saga continues when The Chamber of Secrets is opened at Hogwarts, landing some of Harry’s classmates in danger. Will Harry Potter be able to save the day?The reading of the Harry Potter series has been quite interesting because I really liked the first movie but didn’t really care for the rest. It becomes too dark, but what does that mean exactly? So it has been an exciting process to document exactly how my feelings for the Harry Potter series evolved since the first book.In the beginning of the book, Harry is whining and doing nothing to improve his situation. He is complaining about not hearing from his friends, complaining about the Dursleys, complaining about no magic, complaining about no quidditch. Instead of cross training for quidditch, he just complains. If I wanted to hear complaints, I wouldn’t need to pick up a book. Also, I feel that some of the extraordinariness was missing from the second book. One of the scenes that I loved in the first book was when Harry was receiving all his letters to attend Hogwarts, but this book didn’t have that. There was some animal cruelty in this book involving a firecracker, and I thought that Harry was incredibly impatient with Colin Creevey, the little boy who was asking questions. Harry, wasn’t that you just last year? There were some portions of the book that I did enjoy, and I am grateful that the author didn’t force us into another Hogwarts Express ride and another sorting ceremony. My favorite character (although a bit overused) was Professor Gilderoy Lockheart. I was laughing so much when I saw this note, “To Miss Granger, wishing you a speedy recovery, from your concerned teacher, Professor Gilderoy Lockheart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League, and five-time winner of Witch Weekly Most-Charming-Smile Award.” His various titles took up most of the note! It reminds of people who have PhD’s who try to get you to call them Doctor. Big eyeroll. Yeah. I’ll get right on that. I also loved when Gilderoy said thanks for the 46 Valentine’s Day cards, very similar to when people send themselves flowers for Valentine’s (Remember Clueless?). The author also overly relied on fan favorites, heavily leveraging Hogwarts and the former cast of characters. I am more impressed with some other fantasy writers when they developed an entirely new set of characters and wove them into the storyline. This is a test for greatness from authors. Can they write a subsequent book without leaning so heavily on the fan favorites? In my opinion, JK Rowling didn’t meet that challenge. Overall, it is a decent fantasy book with a system that isn’t too hard to understand. It isn’t embarrassing, but it isn’t great. 2022 Reading ScheduleJan Animal FarmFeb Lord of the FliesMar The Da Vinci CodeApr Of Mice and MenMay Memoirs of a GeishaJun Little WomenJul The Lovely BonesAug Charlotte's WebSep Life of PiOct DraculaNov Gone with the WindDec The Secret GardenConnect With Me!Twitter: https://twitter.com/Lisa_of_TroyYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvmS...Facebook: https://facebook.com/LisaofTroyEmail: hello@lisaoftroy.com",218,0.9959,0.082,0.748,0.17,0.4515158279220779,NEGATIVE,0.9741
18,1558029770,02/23/2016,5.0,"I am always surprised by J.K. Rowling's ability to make her books an allegory of our modern world and it's big and hideous problems. We all know, after all, that she covered discrimination, wars, hate crime, the Kardashians, etc.Let's take this book for example. Harry goes back to Hogwarts. Now enter Gilderoy Lockhart. A fame enamored charlatan, who knows nothing about anything, except memory spells. So clearly a Kardashian. Now some might ask: do Kardashians know memory spells. And the answer is clearly YES! Keeping Up with the Kardashians is already on Season 13, so some magic must be at work, otherwise you'd have to think the world has gone mad!!!!!Carrying on, Harry has an awful year, mostly because of the fact that he can talk snake language. Actually all of Harry's life is an allegory about fame and how it can easily destroy you, hence Harry might've been modeled after Lindsay Lohan. But Rowling had to give a moral to the story and because of that Harry ended up fine in the end... mostly.And to crown all of this awful year, he meets Tom Riddle, who is the heir of Slytherin. He also speaks snake language and has a giant serpent for a pet. So definitely a forefather of Taylor Swift. And look at what that those family ties made her do!! Lessons to be learned from here, people!Now, of course, a lot of questions remain: will the Kardashians magic still work for long? Will Taylor have a nose job so she could resemble her grandpa?

Before he gets there though he had to fight the depression from loneliness as his adopted family does not care about him much and his Hogwarts friends seemingly forgotten about him. Fortunately a magical creature called Dobby shows up and instantly makes Harry's life full of excitement: he is convinced Harry's life is forfeit if the latter goes to Hogwarts, so Dobby makes everything in his power to stop Harry from doing this. Injures and maiming are fair game as long as Harry remains alive. To add to the fun it seems Harry's life as well as that of his friends might really be in danger Dobby hinted at. Like the first one, this book can still fully qualify as a children book however it is darker and it does have some very gloomy and depressing moments; children grew up and matured a little and so is the tale. We get to meet characters familiar from the first book and see their development as well as new interesting ones. Speaking about new people, Gilderoy Lockhart is so full of himself he is excellent. His whole Valentine celebration made me laugh out loud. I think this is the first time we get to meet Lucius Malfoy in person - he is another interesting guy; the last scene with him is excellent. I would like to talk about Harry Potter a little. I saw lots of people say he is not the main hero of the series; he is just a guy who always gets either lucky, or have a helpful friend handy in tight spots. I saw Hermione named the main hero - she is the brainpower behind Harry's successes most of the time. I saw Neville named the main hero - he has the greatest and most unexpected development of all characters. I would respectfully disagree: Harry Potter is the main hero albeit a reluctant one (compare him to Lockhart to see why). For the proof of this look no further than the final confrontation in this novel. This was my reread of the book; I knew exactly what to expect and I was sure I would rate it with 4 stars until I found myself awoke well in the early morning hours finishing this reread despite the fact that I had to wake up early. Any book which can do it to me deserves 5 stars.

I can't say for sure why I don't love it as much as the others, but it's just never stood out to me.However, upon rereading it, I am reminded again how great Rowling is at developing a story arc! There are so many hints to later parts of the series in this book! Especially with Tom Riddle showing up, the diary, hints of Ron's affection for Hermione, and overall just building up the characters and storyline. It's also really fun to see things of importance show up early in the story come into significance later on.Here are some thoughts on things I noticed or didn't remember about this book while I was reading it:-Like in one of the Harry Potter video games, Ron and Harry de-gnome the Burrow's garden at the beginning of the book. -Hermione's parents actually go to Diagon Alley and exchange Muggle money at Gringott's!-Why wasn't Nearly Headless Nick's deathday party in the movie? Also he died in 1492 which is when Columbus 'discovered' America. Significant?-""And some old witch in Bath had a book that you could never stop reading! You just had to wander around with your nose in it, trying to do everything one-handed."" (p.231) Sounds familiar.-I really wish they had the Valentine's Day party in the movie, with all the dwarves walking around dressed as cupids and delivering love messages.-Aragog is literally my biggest fear.-Apparently Dumbledore, back in the day, was a Transfiguration professor at Hogwarts.-And finally, I knew Voldemort was an heir of Slytherin, duh, but I didn't realize he was the last heir of Slytherin.

Second Read Review
 This book was so much fun! And I honestly enjoyed it more than the first time I read it. I didn't know how much I forgot about this book until I reread it, so I probably enjoyed it very much because I mostly forgot many things in this book. So there are also some things that I want to talk about, 
 Gilderoy Lockhart 
 He was so annoying and irked me so much. Especially in the scene where he set loose of pixies in Defence Against the Dark Arts class and he couldn't even fix this mess! And told Harry, Ron and Hermione to put them back in the cage and he left them, I was like "" what the hell? "" he's so unbelievable. But I must admit that he made me laugh like in the Duelling Club, he was disarmed by Snape and that scene was so funny until I laughed out loud. I disliked him very much for lying about those stories! He's such a liar. Ugh. Oh and he deserved what he got in the end that he lost his memory because Ron's wand backfired at him. 
Hermione Granger
I was shocked when I realized that Hermione liked Lockhart. That guy was so annoying. Maybe he was charming BUT he didn't even know any useful spells, like when Harry broke his arm, he conjured a spell and that spell caused Harry to lose his bones in his arm! He just made it worse instead of helping him. And even though I was shocked, I also laughed when I knew that Hermione put a Get Well card from lockhart under her pillow when she was in the hospital wing hahahahaha. I guess she really liked him. that scene was just so funny. 😂😂 Well, overall I really enjoyed re-reading this book and I'm going to read the third book now! Bye! ❤️••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••Edit : Rounded it up into 5 starsREVIEW TO COME ON SATURDAY! ^^4.8 Stars

Okay guys, before I started reviewing this book, I wanted to tell you something. This saturday, I read this book until 04:30 am and I completely didn't realise that I was reading for 4 hours or so and on that same day I had an economy course with my teacher and I completely forgot about that too until my mom reminded me of it. the course started at 10:00 am o'clock and I woke up at 11:00 am and maybe I'll get into a little bit trouble when I'm coming to school on Monday because of this. But I really couldn't help it! THIS BOOK WAS SO GOOD AND I COULD NOT STOP READING IT!! okay now let's talking about this book! 
My Opinion
omg! this book! I had a lot of feelings! Anger. Sadness. Happiness and many more and the chapter I most loved was The Duelling Club. it was so funny to see Professor Snape disarmed Lockhart until he was flying because of the impact of Professor Snape's spell hahaha. xDI don't like calling Lockhart a Professor because he clearly didn't know any spells that were usefull for his students or anyone... Maybe just a Memory Charm. but it was only usefull for him to do his nasty business. ugh and he was a liar too. all those books he wrote were all faked. If Hogwarts were real, I would be really happy to learn all about Defence Against The Dark Arts. this is the most interesting subject that have really caught my interest since I began reading the first book. what about you guys? tell me on the comment section below! ^^and that Duelling Club was so amazing! learning how to fight with spells! and what schocked me was that Voldemort was used to be a human! and Voldemort was not his real name. His real name was Tom Marvolo Riddle but he changed it. I mean, not an ordinary human,of course. he was a half-blood. his father was a muggle and his mother was a witch. I knew he was a Slytherin and he studied at Hogwarts too but I never thought him as half-blood was or a child or a teenager. because he was so evil that I couldn't even imagine what he would look like in the past and he *coughs coughs * used to be handsome...oh! I love Quidditch too! I don't really like sports but it's different with Quidditch. Quidditch is wonderful and amazing! I even always scream like "" YOU CAN DO IT HARRY! YOU CAN CATCH IT!"" and when Gryffindor wins I always scream like "" YAY!! GRYFFINDOR! GRYFFINDOR! "" Am I weird? hahaaha. AHHH. I wish Hogwarts were real. I wish I were at least a muggle-born. I have only read two books in Harry Potter series but they already have changed my life. thank you guys for reading and liking this review! I hope you guys have a great day and Happy Reading!! ❤❤",163,0.9981,0.079,0.742,0.179,0.5197760011524057,POSITIVE,0.9884

Fast forward a decade and I'm now working my way through what I can say already is a children's classic fantasy series that is up there with The Wizard of Oz and The Chronicles of Narnia. Harry's existence with his Muggle uncle and auntie is as horrible as ever and he can't wait to get back to Hogwarts after speaking to a mini-elf masochist who essentially predicts his doom and travelling in an awesome magic-infused flying car. Upon returning to Hogwarts it's similar to before, Quidditch lessons, Malfoy being a bit of a tosser, Hermainie loving studying, and the wizarding threesome getting into all sorts of nonsensical antics. A new tutor is introduced this time, Professor Lockhart and I thought he was brilliant mainly due to how awful he was with his tall-tales and celebrity status! This narrative is brimming with ghosts, boys and girls who adore Harry, spiders, and Professor Sprout. The characters are pretty brilliant and I can easily understand why this is adored globally. I didn't need the continuous info-dumps that reminded me what happened in book one but apart from that there isn't really anything negative to say. The ending was surprising with a cool twist, a magic hat, a phoenix, a sword, a diary, and a giant snake. I hope you don't tell me off for these spoilers as I'm sure I'm the only fantasy book reviewer who hasn't read these yet. I'm loving the adventure so far.

Well, I felt that way before starting this, but I can definitely say that Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is another fabulous installment in the rightfully beloved Harry Potter series!And while I will admit to not loving it quite as much as its predecessor, I still enjoyed it a great deal. I think the reason for my not liking it as much can be mostly credited to the introduction of a new character, Professor Lockhart. Lockhart is an annoyingly pretentious wizard who is completely full of himself, and the majority of his teachings were based on his own life and his supposed brushes with death that he escaped only because of his ""heroism"" and great knowledge of the magic arts. (view spoiler)[Riiiiiiiiight. (hide spoiler)] In a summary, I didn't find the story involving Lockhart quite as interesting as Harry's realization of his true abilities and the escapades of his first year at Hogwarts.But HP II undoubtedly still has plenty of hilarious moments and magical wonders - not to mention the lovely cast of characters - to more than compensate for this particular installment's slightly lacking plot. Hence the five stars. :)(view spoiler)[Very clever Ms. Rowling, very clever indeed.

“You will also find that help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.”
 Summer with the Dursleys has been excruciating. Cut-off from the magical world, Harry is alone. He is more than excited to return to his favourite place in the world, Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry, but receives the strangest warning from a house elf. He tells him that Hogwarts will be a dangerous place for Harry to be this year. But Harry doesn't want to stay with the Dursleys all year. So with the help of Ron and a flying car, Harry is off to his second year despite the spooky warning he received.The year starts off normally, though when Harry begins to hear voices that no one else seems to hear and it becomes unsafe for students in the castle for fear of attack, he realizes that he should have taken that warning more seriously. Strange and dangerous things are indeed walking the halls of Hogwarts.
“It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.”
It's clear that there is an improvement in JKR's writing. What the Philosopher's Stone lacked, this book had. The side characters are more fleshed out and we get to explore new parts of Hogwarts! I loved the ‘new’ characters introduced, like Dobby, Lockhart and Moaning Myrtle.  Lockhart was obviously very annoying sometimes but he brought a great element of humour that the story needed. The mystery aspect of each of these books will always be a favourite, even if I already know what's going to happen. It's the small details of everyday life at Hogwarts that makes this world seem so vividly real to me. I love finding all the Easter eggs that will come into play in the later books. It's so amazing how something as inconsequential as a wardrobe has its own significance that you'll only pick up on further down the road. This re-read was the best idea and I'm having an awesome time slowly convincing Fares (who I'm buddy reading with) that this is an epic series.______My reviews for:1:  Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone3: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban4: Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire",135,0.9768,0.116,0.728,0.155,0.6284294558488107,POSITIVE,0.9836

Nobody in the school gets Ron a new wand and they let him run around the school casting dangerous spells. The first one is a genuine reason and the last two mere petty grievances.

38,14146681,01/31/2008,3.0,"Since pretty much everyone I know has read these books, I figure reviewing them is pretty pointless. But with the new book coming out in a couple of weeks, I have to go through them beginning to end. To make the reviews more entertaining, I will be doing them in a variety of unexpected formats. For this review, I will be writing as someone who's just getting into Freudian theory.From the very beginning, the true nature of this story is quite obvious - The Chamber of Secrets. There is only one ""chamber of secrets"" that is of any human concern, and it is no coincidence that the book of such a title was written by a woman.By sending her young, immature male character, Harry (whose name, along with Tom and Dick, just happens to be one of the ""universal"" male names) into the mysterious Chamber, Rowling is exploring her memories of early childhood sexuality. The Chamber is filled not only with mystery, but danger and legend - its very existence is debated, which no doubt refers to the elusive female orgasm.Ms. Rowling, whose sexual impulses have no doubt been unfulfilled over the years, is attempting to fulfill them by way of her own fiction. She has created a perfect sexual explorer in Harry Potter - a young, innocent and noble young man whose powers have not yet matured. Obviously a male that Rowling would feel comfortable with. This is especially interesting given the actual resident of the Chamber of Secrets - a huge, deadly serpent. And there's only one thing that a huge, terrible serpent can represent.Rowling's sexual past is the fertile ground in which this book was grown. It is her cathartic attempt to win over the guilty feelings that she's repressed from her former sexual life, the one she regrets more than anything else, by manufacturing a hero. That hero, in Harry Potter, represents the type of man for whom she would ""open"" her ""chamber - pure of heart and noble of intention and, most importantly, under her control. The vanquishing of the serpent-symbol is her victory, leaving her free to explore other aspects of her life, including the eventual resolution of the Electra complex that appears to have been built up around Professor Dumbledore...",108,0.9859,0.088,0.754,0.157,0.5952551834130779,NEGATIVE,0.7798

Rowling keeps you guessing up until the final pages.I love how every character brings something else to the table. Ron's dry comments, Fred and George's pranks, Hermione's cleverness, Dumbledore's charming strangeness. Even side characters like Mr and Mrs Weasley have such a strong individuality. They're all fleshed out.Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is an exciting, thrilling read. It makes you think along with the Golden Trio and laugh out loud.

But it didn’t have the same irresistible charm as Sorcerer’s Stone for me.I’m being vague but I don’t know if I can specify. Let me try to.https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...For one thing, this didn’t have the same mastery of language as the first. It seemed in Sorcerer’s Stone that every word was a careful choice. Here, the phrase “after all” was used three times in one measly paragraph. It wasn’t poorly written by any stretch of the imagination...but it could be a bit sloppy.Two: not as exciting. The second act plot-line may have been better than the first book’s, but it took forever to get to that point. The first two-thirds or three-quarters of this book dragged for me, really. And I needed some excitement to break up the endless studying and work of finals week!Three: as I mentioned in my HPSS review, my favorite part of this series is the worldbuilding. Every aspect of this world drips with magic, and it’s so lovely. I’ll never tire of reading about Diagon Alley, or Hogwarts feasts, or Quidditch - and I cannot wait for Hogsmeade! There was a lot less discussion of the world here. God, how I wish there was. Is there more in the other books? It seems there’d have to be in Goblet of Fire, no?Four: I missed Hermione! I didn’t realize how much of the appeal of this series for me was based on her. At least this book really confirmed my adoration of her. Absolutely one of the best YA characters ever, in my opinion. I missed Neville, too! At least Hermione had a reason for not being there, but where was the lovely Neville this whole time?Five: In general, this book seemed a bit...stuck. Sorcerer’s Stone has a great variety of characters, and features different classes and aspects of Hogwarts life. This installment gave me cabin fever. The whole thing is limited almost entirely to Harry and Ron. They’re great, don’t get me wrong, but...I wanted there to be other people too. Hagrid wasn’t here much, nor Fred and George. Quidditch only happened, what, once? The only class truly described was Lockhart’s, which made me want to bang my head against the wall. In short, I missed everybody. All the new characters introduced here are just unbearable. (Colin, Lucius, Gilderoy...even Dobby at some points. Sorry.)On the bright side, I don’t think this is anybody’s favorite Harry Potter book. I’m a bit deflated, but overall rather excited to get on with this reread. (Once a few of my finals are done with, though. Shiver.)Bottom line: every series has its weak points.

It's not just that he's a creepy, sadistic monster who thought it was a good idea to murder a one-year old. No, it's also racism, folks. Voldy and his minions think that a person's worth is determined by who their ancestors are.  If they've all been wizards, then kudos, if they weren't, then you're basically worthless. At least in the eyes of Draco ""Not-Yet-A-Ferret"" Malfoy, his stupid father and old Voldy. Harry, of course, is far too clever to believe in such nonsense, not only because his best friend is both a muggleborn and the cleverest person in like, the entire history of mankind. Not only because of their very different perspective on one's (non-)magical background, this is the first of the two big Draco vs. Harry books. The first time they fight each other at Quidditch, the Heir of Slytherin haunting the halls of Hogwarts, etc., etc. It's actually my least favourite of all these seven books but it's still great. It has Dobby (Oh, my), it has Ron and Harry's brilliant idea to go to school in a flying car, and my all-time-favourite character, Ginny Weasley, is finally coming to Hogwarts.

It was humorous and exciting, but sometimes I wanted to hit Harry in the head for missing obvious clues. The Lockhart character was (intentionally, I admit) very annoying. The outcome was somewhat predictable (especially for Lockhart) and there were moments that the reminders of what happened in the previous book were annoying. The spider episode in the Forbidden Forest seemed transparently inspired by The Hobbit. There were some plot inconsistencies too:: Harry is already dressed for the game when he goes to the quidditch dressing room; in the bookstore where Lockhart makes his first appearance, he doesn't have time to buy his books before the egotistical maniac makes a spectacle of him. Ok, perhaps I am being picky, but I think this was one of the weaker books leading up to the last four which were more epic (at least according to my 10yo self-professed HP expert!)I read about half the book and listened to the second half in the Stephen Fry-narrated book on Audible.

She's had to bear witness to her older siblings being smug about a secret society that has not included her. And she's hated it.

“I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending I'm not there.” 
 Re-read - Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the twin of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. This book is not so far from the first one and I love how joyful it is. Harry Potter comes back to his family, if I can call them that. For this summer, Dobby prevents Harry from going back to Hogwart. He says something will happen and it means death for Harry Potter and everyone.J.K. Rowling never lets us down with her second installment of Harry Potter. The book itself flows smoothly without dropping. Harry, Ron and Hermione are the lead characters that I love most. They try to carry out their plans about the clue that left behind. I enjoyed watching the way they solve the problem and while they're conducting something, Ron is the one that always made me laugh out loud. Hermione is the brain of this group, though, she's smart and subtle. And Harry is the brave one, although he is so scared about the whispers, he drives into the pipe without hesitation in the end. I really adored him !This book is entertaining for many reasons. Lockhart is a colorful character, without him, this book will not be complete. The only thing I want to say about this series is it gets better and better. When you pick the book up, you can't put it down for hours. Harry Potter is my addiction and life. That's all !!

I know, I know. I REGRET EVERYTHING. This is one book I wish I’d of read sooner, because so far I’ve loved both of the books. This time around we got more magic; Spells, cauldrons, defence against the dark arts, muggles, new characters, and lots of fun moments. I loved seeing a more magical aspect of the book which included more lessons, and Hermione rebelling against everything she actually wants to do.Once again I partly listened to this on Audiobook and Stephen Fry is literally the King. The way he portrays the characters and emphasises everything really does bring the magic to life.Fred and George Weasley are at the moment my current favourites of the series. I just find them so hilarious and like to tease the ones they care about.What I liked?- The Gnomes at the Weasleys!- We got to meet Hermiones family and them exchanging real money at Gringotts- THE HOWLER MESSAGE. Oh my god. I can’t even begin to explain how much I loved that part!- I found Colin hilarious, he was just so adorable and desperately trying to get glimpses of Harry. Not only this but the signing of the photos oh god, I can’t.- Deathday party! That was soon good! How ghosts made an entrance, loveeeeee!- FAWKES! - Dumbledores sweet tooth, I was like yep yep yep.- How motherly Professor McGonagall is, I’m just like N’awww!-Gilderoy Lockhart. His character was so well done! Everything he did had me laughing, the valentines day shenanigans with the dwarves and the wings and the songs- The never ending rivalry between Draco, Ron and Harry-In fact just how protective Ron is with Hermione melts my little heart!- Hagrid still has me howlingWhat I didn’t like?- Once again this is probably only me… we have such a build up throughout the book which is so well done, I just think that it all ends very suddenly.

It was a little bit boring, but it was still incredible. It took me to read this book more for what is expected.What I really like about the book is the life lesson that it has. The life lesson that this book is that we shouldn't trust what everyone says, and also not everything is what we see., in the part when Voldemort (He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named) revealed his real name. “Tom Marvolo Riddle” paragraph 2 page 314, “rearranged themselves: I am Lord Voldemort” paragraph 3 and 4 page 314. Also when Gilderoy Lockhart revealed that he actually didn’t did all the heroic things that were writing in his book. “all that stuff you did in your books” paragraph 7 page 297, “Books can be misleading,” said Lockhart” paragraph 8 page 297. Another event in the book that show this lesson was when Lucius Malfoy planned to give the diary Ginny Weasley, “You gave it to her” “slipped the diary” paragraph 11 page 336. But the most important event of all that show this was when Ginny trust the diary and gave all her secrets to it, “Put too much into the diary to me” paragraph 2 “From anything Ginny had told me” paragraph 1, page 313. In this book you could also see that Harry was more mature in the way of thinking, like for example when he found out all about the chamber secrets, with a little bit of time and with no so many clues. And it really impressed me that he found it, because if I was him the school would be already closed when I just found out only one clue of the puzzle.As well in this book they showed more about the history of the school and of some characters such as Hagrid and Dumbledore. An example would be when Harry found out, what did Hagrid did to be expelled from HogwartsIn the end, I really like the book and how they continued where they left the last book, also I will still continue watching the series because I really like it, and is like the only book that can get me out of a reading slump. I will rate this book a 4.5 because it was good but also it was not as good as the first one.UpdateFour years after I read it for the first time, and now I like it even more, than the first book. It just surprised me that even though I have seen the movies multiple times and have already read them, I was still surprised, when they revealed information or solved a mystery, and I can't understand why, but it did.

64,2715483012,02/18/2019,5.0,"DestinyHere I am with The Chamber of Secrets, the second book of the Harry Potter series feeling the tightening grip of adoration, as I get ensnared in the glorious bewitching world created by JK Rowling. Certainly, the first book and now the second, primarily introduce us to the extensive cast of characters that inhabit this sweeping magical world. The background behind Hogwarts and the major divisions that shaped their history become apparent, and how they drive the plot over the entire series, is intelligently, delicately and profoundly imagined.I love Rowling’s patience, the ability to subtly drop a piece of information that may not mean anything for a few books. To drip actions and comments that at some point in the future you’re saying “Oh, That’s what that was for.” – Genius. The relationship between Ginny and Harry is kindled in this book and we also meet Dobby, with the unforgettable line “Dobby is Harry Potter's friend.” The background to Hogwarts and the 4 wizards and witches who founded it, is described, where each house was named after them: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw and Salazar Slytherin. These names have become part of our reference, as in real-life people connect themselves to these houses and what type of person they wish to be. The rift and disagreements between Slytherin and the rest grew until Slytherin left the school. The history also states that 
Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in the castle, of which the other founders knew nothing. ‘Slytherin, according to the legend, sealed the Chamber of Secrets so that none would be able to open it until his own true heir arrived at the school. The heir alone would be able to unseal the Chamber of Secrets, unleash the horror within, and use it to purge the school of all who were unworthy to study magic.’
That is a direct charge against Hermione and others who come from a muggles family, yet she is the smartest student in her year at Hogwarts. We see the gradual ramping up of tension within the school and why Malfoy hates muggles calling them mudbloods. The relationships and bonds between Harry, Ron and Hermione are aspired to in most friendships and are very well-formed here. On one incident they find Mrs Norris the caretaker’s cat 'petrified' with the following words written on the wall. 
“THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS HAS BEEN OPENED. ENEMIES OF THE HEIR, BEWARE.”
 The tension builds. A dark unseen force awaits. The brave, indomitable Harry Potter and his loyal friends, Ron and Hermione, will take this battle on – (view spoiler)[is it a spoiler to say there are 7 books so they don’t die yet (hide spoiler)].There is always an opportunity for humour either in what someone says or does (typically Ron and the other Weasleys), or characters that are strange and provide a comic outlet. In this book, Professor Lockhart provides that mix of cringe behaviour and comedy. His desire to receive praise and recognition, regardless of the fact that it is undeserved, and regularly exposed, except to those infatuated by his charisma, provides a light-hearted element. Funny how one person’s appeal is another’s repulsion.The scene is set, the dark wizards, led by Voldemort (yet to be revealed), against those that provide defence against them, led by Dumbledore and somehow (yet to be revealed) Harry. When will Voldemort return? Why is Harry so important in all this? Will history repeat itself? Damn most of us know the ending but reading the books just brings so much craft and ingenuity into the story that reading them is a must. Someone will do research on this series someday as its depth sits alongside Lord of the Rings. Bring on book 3, The Prisoner of Azkaban.",86,0.906,0.047,0.874,0.079,0.5313836996336996,POSITIVE,0.9999

This installment was obviously a lot darker than the first, and I found the storyline so intriguing and captivating. I love the Weasleys. I decided yesterday that I’m naming my dog after Percy. Also, Ron makes me laugh so much, and Neville is the most precious thing, I’m naming my other dog after him. Fantastic storytelling and world-building, which is entirely unsurprising.

70,972820161,06/20/2014,5.0,"I have lost count on how many times i have re-visited this series and every time i come back i feel like i'm going home because these characters and this world will always have a special place in my heart and i owe it all to J.K Rowling. I remember when i was little and i had to sneak into my older brothers room because he had the books and i didn't at the time, i would take them and read them and my childhood was magical like many other people's childhood all thanks to this series.  It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.  Plot:  This book picks up with Harry once again spending the summer with his family at number 4 privet drive. Waiting for the summer to end so he can finally return to Hogwarts and be with his new found friends Ron and Hermione. However the journey to getting there isn't the best because Dobby the house elf thinking he's doing Harry a favour stops him from walking through the barrier making him and Ron miss the train so they result to flying a car to school. The school year starts of bad for Harry and Ron with them almost getting expelled from the school, but things at the school start to go from odd to strange where the teachers and students life's are put in danger when the Chamber of Secrets is re-opened after 50 years. Even though Chamber of secrets isn't one of my favourites in the series i was listening to this for the first time via audiobook and say since growing older and reading it a few more times i can understand appreciate the story more since i've matured.  Characters:   Harry Potter:  Harry is put to his second ultimate test in the second book after a shocking start to the school year harry finds himself dealing with all the crazy laws and accusations that have come with the chamber of secrets being opened. After its revealed that he can talk to snakes the whole school and some teachers become skeptical about him and this begins his year of trying to prove everyone in the school wrong. I'm glad Harry has Ron and Hermione who believed him from the beginning because if they didn't i feel like Harry would be on his own entirely. As the school year progresses and some of the muggle born students. mrs norris and nearly headless nick are petrified it all comes down to harry to stop it from happening to any more people, were harry meets voldemort for the second time and naturally defeats him.  Ron Weasley:  Ron is one of Harry's best friends throughout the entire series and he provides the comedic relief and trys to see things as rational as he can. I feel like Ron is very underestimated out of the three and its because he is shunned between a famous boy and a clever witch, but i think Ron has an edge on both of the two since he is from a family who grew up in this wizard world so i think it gives him more information that the other two don't know. Ron is also dealing with being put on a scale so high because of who his brothers are and how well they've all done in school so i feel ron knows it and has that to deal with.  Hermione Granger:  One of my favourite characters in this series, because she is truly the brightest witch of her age and i love how she doesn't care what anybody things about her in the way she is so smart and how she looks even though she does get teased by Malfoy and the rest of slytherin because of this. Hermione is the one who fights for whats right and brings a lot of political issues to the surface that this wizarding world seems to be having and yes this world has it's troubles that effect not only Hermione but every muggle born student, house elf etc. She does grow from the first book but don't get me wrong she doesn't change from being that geeky girl who loves to learn which i love about this character. When in doubt, go to the library.  Hearing voices no one else can hear isn't a good sign, even in the wizarding world. This is one series that i will always continue to come back to because it's what got me into reading and got me started for my love of books and i will always be thankful for Jo for writing this magical series. I honestly can't thank her enough because this series is and always will be important to me.",72,0.9315,0.105,0.781,0.114,0.5371601258486505,POSITIVE,0.997
71,189498501,07/25/2011,5.0,"A Comprehensive List of all the Things I Love About This Book: *The whole flying car escape. The fact that the Weasley twins know how to actually pick locks and that they taught Ron how to do it as well. *The Burrow and its sheer chaotic architecture and the warmth of its people. I want to live here please. *Mr & Mrs. Weasley. Adopt me, please. *Dobby and the whole pudding fiasco! Though Dobby really can be maddening at times, I’m quite fond of him. *The fact that Malfoy talks about Harry to his family. That he infcat talked of little else the whole damn summer except for “wonderful Potter with his scarand his broomstick”. This is cannon. I cannot even. *Gilderoy motherfuckjng Lockhart LOL. His autograph scenes! When he tells Harry he might be famous enough one day to keep his own stack of autographs handy, When he made Harry reenact all his äccomplishements.” When he tried to duel Snape! 😂😂😂*Mr. Weasley and Lucius Malfoy throwing hands at the bookstore! I DIE! *When HArry and Ron immediately decide to fly to Hogwarts. Like the absolute mad lads! Immediately jumping into the most chaotic plan! *The Whopping Willow attempting murder because someone touched it. Honestly, SAME. *The Deathday Party. I too would like to be able to throw a post mortem party when I die. Why stop the party at death amirite???*Moaning Myrtle moping around and just wanting to be left the fuck alone but also thriving for the drama?? She is me at 16. Seriously. *The general creepy ambiance of this whole book, the mystery. It’s such a step away from the cherry magic of the first. It really sets a more serious (hur) tone for later books in the series. The dismembered Basilisk voice is also one of my favourite things. It's just so creepy? *Hermoine breaking about a million school rules and making the polyjuice potion in an abandoned haunted bathroom after stealing the ingredients from Snape's office! She just went from 0-100 and honestly, this is my favourite version of her. The sheer balls really. *The Dueling Club, while it lasted, is also one of my favourite things about this book. It’s where Harry learns his infamous expelliarmus spell, from Snape of all people. It also forms a precursor of sorts to the DA later on in book 5. *Harry speaking Parseltongue. I know why he loses this ability later on but damn, I want to be able to speak to snakes. *The first of what will, undoubtedly, be many more visits to Dumbledore's office. Harry meeting Fawkes for the first time. *Hagrid being a sweetheart and standing up for Harry. Always. *Slytherin’s common room under the lake. It speaks to my need for the dramatic and I love it. *The fact that Harry is constantly drawn to Riddle’s diary because of the horcrux inside him recognizing it’s other part just blows my mind. This was just book 2 and the clues are scattered so far back its insaneeee!!! This also sets up the beginning of many, many parallels between Harry and Voldemorth; similarities that start to converge by the end of the series. *That fucking Valentine’s day event!! The surly dwarves as cupids! Ginny’s poem! Lockhart suggesting people ask professor snape for a love potion, the mad lad!! Professor Flitwick looking like he’s on the verge of tears from the sheer disgrace of it all!! I DIEEEEE!!!*Riddle. I die laughing every time I read this part. The fact that Voldemorth’s 16 year old self is just such a self important emo kid. The grand villain monologuing? The side smirks? The threats?? Pure fucking gold!! He's supposed to threatening and all, and generally he makes for a terrific villain. But here he’s just Tom and he's 16 and he's just doing these crazy grand Shakespearean monologues and I just find it so terribly funny every time!*The whole diary reveal when Harry finally (finally) solves the mystery. The visual of Harry piercing the diary and all this black ink just dripping out dramatically like blood. My emo teen ass really loved this imagery and I must say I still do. *Lockhart losing his memory from his own memory charm! I just love s dude so, so much you guys!!!*Lucius Malfoy being an absolute snob! He’s such a drama queen, like I totally get where Malfoy gets it from. I adore him! Also I cannot imagine Lucius Malfoy as anyone other than Jason Isaacs with his beautiful blonde wig and cane! What an absolute ICON!*Harry freeing Dobby with the whole sock in diary thing! I love! Honestly, there is probably a whole lot more but these will do for now. Again, objectively speaking, this would probably be a 3.75 stars. But I love this series and cannot read it without remembering it as a whole. So, forgive the biased 5 stars rating.",75,0.9838,0.119,0.732,0.149,0.5718421052631578,NEGATIVE,0.5136

There's a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Ginny Weasley has taken a shine to Harry… but the real trouble begins when a number of Hogwarts students are ""petrified"" and rendered immobile. The heir of Slytherin is suspected to be behind these attacks, but who is the heir?These first few books kinda feel like we're laying the groundwork for the ""real"" story, which is on its way and will take place from book 3 onwards. I think that's why I view Chamber of Secrets as my least favourite in the series. The first book is special because it's the beginning, we're discovering Hogwarts and the magical world of Harry Potter… but then the second book just isn't as enjoyable as I view it as merely a stepping stone to the real meat of the story. It's still pretty great though... I mean, there isn't one HP book I dislike!One of my favourite aspects of the Chamber of Secrets is finding out more about Voldemort's background. The scenes in the chamber itself are great as more tidbits are unravelled and he reveals exactly what has been going on. Another highlight of Chamber of Secrets is the introduction of Dobby!! He has a big heart and means well… even if he almost kills Harry in the process. Oops. Once again, Hermione is the MVP and proves yet again that those two would have not got very far without her. Hermione is basically the Samwise Gamgee of Harry Potter. I also like how Malfoy seems to have a bigger role in this story, he's fun to hate at this point. This book also introduces us to Gilderoy Lockhart - his narcissism literally cracks me up and I love that Hermione harbours a little crush for him. Colin also slays me when he is obsessed with Harry!I just love how much I actually snigger to myself when reading these books.

80,1733851119,08/20/2016,5.0,"So, what is Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets?Why perhaps one of the greatest sequels ever written?Ha! Then why is it the lowest rated of the 7? Why do so many consider it to be their least favorite?I don't know! I thought it was flipping amazing.Why?Because Jo Rowling, so very English and erudite, with her topsy turvy hilarious and creepy narrative, her human characters and her timeless topics; Jo, who knows the human heart like Hermione knows the works of Gilderoy Lockhart, hides the motives of every character till the perfect moment of revelation. Even those that should be above suspicion are not with the taint of pride and ambition, and even the most beloved characters breathe with the fragility of humanity as the story relentlessly runs along through the darkened halls of Hogwarts. Beware, second-year students, the desire to be great is a double-edged sword beset with rubies.I first became a fan of Jo with Cuckoo's Calling and it occurred to me, breathlessly reading through Chamber of Secrets, that the Riddle was solved. Finally. Why is Jo Rowling so good? It's simple. She's a mystery writer.Harry Potter soars above Muggle mystery books because of its special additives. Magic, yes, and undeniably malleable lenient fantasy elements that Jo masterfully weaves and waves her wand over to manipulate and beef up the story as she sees fit, but truly, how many mysteries have we read (collectively) where we set them down and forget who the detective was, or the suspect, or whatever. Why is that? Because of Jo's reverse engineering (no doubt an ancient Slytherin technique) where the character comes first. No matter what, and no matter which character. The books are entirely character driven and because we love The Boy Who Lived and He Who Shall Not Be Named and The Weasleys and Rubeus Hagrid and Ginny (the cutest human being on planet earth) and on and on and on, we find ourselves shoulder to shoulder with our would-be sleuths and puzzle solvers and their ""we must we must"" attitude. Chamber of Secrets was an outstanding mystery, chock-full of red herrings, an incredible combative climax, and too many laugh-out-loud lines to count. Dear Diary, I have a new favorite book.Oh really, what is it?*Throws diary out the window and runs away screaming*And, shivers, at the mere mention of Azkaban, I read Chamber of Secrets with far too much excitement and anticipation, because, knowing I was going into Harry Potter, The Prisoner of Azkaban, following Chamber of Secrets, was the book I was waiting for the most, and for that I blame Gary Oldman. (I am a Sirius fan of Gary Oldman) That said, I had no idea that Chamber of Secrets would be so outstanding and leave me thinking the incredible Philosopher's Stone was a perfectly-pitched welcome handshake compared to the books to come.For those who like to feel up a book for flaws, I have none, and I see none. I see the sheer verve of adventure and the scintillating luster of mystery, gleaming hungry-eyed and ready for more. You see, as Philosopher's Stone was about love, Chamber of Secrets was about fearlessness. Fearlessness to speak the truth in the face of a lie, fearlessness to stand up for what's inside your heart. Fearlessness to take a leap of faith and follow the path of destiny.Also, I am very interested in how the issues gain maturity as Harry and the other characters age. Obviously there are deaths to come, but in the case of Chamber of Secrets versus Philosopher's Stone, I could feel that sense of maturity creeping in just a bit, and am so very excited for the continuation of the series (I'll have to go buy some more chocolate frogs now) as everything in the Wizarding World becomes increasingly dangerous and unhinged and wild and wondrously unforgettable.Recommended for everyone.And 50 points for Hermione for being epic even whilst being petrified.",69,0.9976,0.054,0.78,0.166,0.5669065340117971,POSITIVE,0.9528

82,1628564795,05/03/2016,4.0,"There is an advantage in rereading a series like Harry Potter, and that is knowing how it all ended, to see its connectivity as it builds toward its climax. When I first read it, over 15 years ago, I had no idea what will be in store for the coming installments. So, this book was just another adventure of Harry Potter where he yet again displayed his heroism. But now, when I'm revisiting them, I can see how Rowling has shaped the series and build up from book to book her story of good against evil. Lord Voldermort, as any Potter fan will know, is the evil incarnation. His power, however, was defeated, by a power far more powerful, a power the dark lord never comprehended, and that was the power of love. It all fits the theme - good vs evil. But Rowling also wants to show that evil doesn't take the defeat too kindly and that it lurks in every dark corner, ready to pounce again. And so, Lord Voldermort hunts Harry so he could crush the good that is associated with him and defeat the forces that fight to preserve the good in the world. Returning to the book, I found this daring adventure of Harry to be exciting and fascinating. This is the first full-blown adventure of Harry after learning of his magical inheritance. This adventure allows Harry yet again to prove his courage and loyalty which he does admirably. Reading the book was like a positive antidote to the present hard times, where we tend to lose hope and courage. Harry's fighting nature, the determination to do what's right, and his courage, even knowing he is no match for the power that he challenges, makes us question whether we tend to give up at the very moment that we should fight. About the creative genius of Rowling, I'm not about to harp afresh. I said that in my review of the first book of the series, and I'll leave it there. But I would like to mention what I've quite missed out on in my first reading; that is satire and humor. Rowling injects both of these subtly through the character of Gilderoy Lockhart, the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts. I think all of us must, at some point in our lives, have met the sorts of Gilderoy Lockharts, those who take credit for other people's honors. :) I liked how Rowling made Harry instrumental in exposing his deception and humbling his vanity while fighting a bigger battle with Lord Voldermort.There is one more thing I want to mention before I wind up my review and that, with a big apology to all the Ronald Weasley fans. It looks like that all through my first reading, I haven't truly appreciated Ron's character. I've seen him only as ""the faithful"" who follows the ""master"". But this second reading of the book made me see the individuality of his character, which to me was closed by Harry's bravery and Hermione's brains. But I'm slowly beginning to realize that without Ron's steadfast support and loyalty, perhaps, it wouldn't have been quite easy for either of them to shine as they did. I'm quite warming to the series again and remembering all the pleasure of my first reading. I was in awe then, and I'm still, even now.",71,0.9962,0.098,0.703,0.199,0.5698121027908261,POSITIVE,0.9998

That quote honestly contains one of the best themes in this entire series. Anywho, this is one of the best (if not the best) books in the series. As most know, Harry Potter isn't just fantasy. Fantasy is a huge aspect but there is also a mystery woven in. Each book has it's own mystery but there is also an overall mystery throughout the series. Chamber of Secrets is, by far, the best mystery in the entire series. It was fascinating. It was creepy. But most of all, it was so well written. I said this in my review of Philosopher's Stone but Rowling is so talented at leaving tiny clues about what's to come and about the reveal but she does so in a way that you only notice it if you're looking for it.Some other things I loved about this book -Moaning Myrtle Petrification (spooky) Professor Lockhart (he's so dumb)Overall, this is definitely in the top three of this series and I cannot recommend it enough. -----------yup. definitely one of the best.review to come------------part 2/8 of the harry potter re-readthis book is one of my favorite in the series| Goodreads | Blog | Pinterest | LinkedIn | YouTube | Instagram",65,0.9926,0.031,0.799,0.17,0.6361111111111112,POSITIVE,1.0
84,1127595769,12/09/2014,4.0,"I did a re-read of this. I listened to the previous book last year and I got around to book two. I remember reading this the first time and it was amazing. It took the wizarding world and what we knew nad expanded everything using mostly the same formula. I thought it was so much better than the first book at the time. Spoilers ahead:I appreciate that Harry is a young 12 year old kid and so he has help all through this book, his friends and even Dumbledore. Some people think the end is too pat, but I think it is modeled after mythology. I feel it's very obvious that Jo knows her mythology deeply. She understands the role of things in a story and everything for a great myth is here. Harry has to stand against Tom on his own, but he still has help from Dumbledore in the form of Fawkes. I have read these books many times now and it's as thrilling to read them now as it was back in 2000. Jo has all the ducks in a row and she doesn't miss many tricks here. We can see hints for the rest of the series that I know will pay off later. It's a fantastic book that deserves a place in history. It's also interesting reading about Gilderoy - a narcissist, while we have one as president at the moment. It's interesting to see the similarities. They are all puffed up saying they can do everything when in reality, they don't seem to be good at much, really.I would find it interesting to know how much has been written by people about these books. I bet its billions of words at least. My niece and nephew have recently read these books and they watch the movies on repeat. They simply love the world of Harry Potter. What I love about Jo's writing style is it appeals to children while an easy read for adults. During the publication of this series, there were many adults reading these books and enjoying them at the time. Many people, aunts, uncles, cousins, moms, in my family would read them and then we would discuss them. It's a series the whole family can enjoy.It got a whole generation reading and I love that about these books. It was written when the movies for Lord of the Rings were delighting audiences and the two things together brought the Fantasy genre mainstream in a new way. Most people in the world have heard of Harry Potter.I love these books so much and I'm loving being able to do another re-read and enjoy what Jo has crafted.",65,0.9983,0.003,0.81,0.187,0.4826790633608814,POSITIVE,0.9976

I wasn't really a fan of Harry Potter before and I always wondered what is making the whole world crazy. Once I started reading this book, I understood why. The book is so damn addictive, you just can't keep the book away. You are always inquisitive as to what's gonna happen next. You get so engrossed in the book, you feel like the fourth member of the 'Harry-Hermoine-Ron' team. You get pissed off on the muggle born relatives of Harry for treating him so badly, you laugh when Ron attempts to do magic with his broken wand, you feel proud to have Hermione with all her intelligence of using the correct magic at the correct time. You wish you had a headmaster like Dumbledore, but never a teacher like Gilderoy Lockhart. Oh! And how your heart wrenches when Hagrid is dragged out of Hogwarts.

The whole situation with the flying car, for example, it's just hilarious. And that scene where Longbottom faints while working on the mandrakes? Priceless. Not to mention Mrs. Weasley's Howler.Also the character of Gilderoy Lockhart, is for me the funniest of the series. I just love his ridiculous, almost idiotic, narcissistic personality - and the fact that Hermione, despite herself, has a complete crush on him - and now re-reading this book as an adult and after seeing the movies so many times I can't help but picturing the actor's perfectly dim-witted smile every time he talks and it just cracks me up.But this book also contains one of the saddest scenes of the first books - before J. K. Rowling starts killing people Game of Thrones style, I mean - and that's when Fawkes approaches Harry who's just being bitten by the poisonous fang of the Basilisk and cries, healing him with its tears. A patch of scarlet swam past and Harry heard a soft clatter of claws beside him. ‘Fawkes,’ said Harry thickly. ‘You were brilliant, Fawkes ...’ He felt the bird lay its beautiful head on the spot where the serpent’s fang had pierced him.‘You’re dead, Harry Potter,’ said Riddle’s voice above him. ‘Dead. Even Dumbledore’s bird knows it. Do you see what he’s doing, Potter? He’s crying.’Harry blinked. Fawkes’s head slid in and out of focus. Thick, pearly tears were trickling down the glossy feathers.This moment has me tear up all the time. Fawkes, you are not the only one crying, believe me! Also yeah, I mean, you can tell phoenixes are my favourite creatures so yeah... 😜While I am in the process of reading this series again after more than fifteen years - yes, I am that old - I can't help but notice the big or small differences between the books and the movies. I love the movies, and I watch all of them every Christmastime, but the feeling of holding the books again feels just priceless. Nonetheless,  and please don't hate on me but, I mean, you can, we live in a free country , I think that some additions/different choices that have been made in the movies actually work better than in the books. I know that the author worked on the set so she probably thought/approved these changes, so I don't feel that bad when I say that, for example, the scene of Lucius giving the smelly sock to Dobby works much better in the movie (if you don't believe me, read it again: it's just plain weird). I'm sad they chose not to iclude the ghost-party scene, though.Anyway, I think we can all conclude that we can't really tell which one is better, the book or the movie, because they are both EXTREMELY AWESOME. Now excuse me while I try to fit back in my 30-yo body.",39,0.9943,0.088,0.75,0.162,0.5593425013683636,NEGATIVE,0.7597
94,1031848320,03/04/2017,5.0,"About: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a children’s fiction novel written by J.K. Rowling. It was published on 6/2/1999 by Scholastic Inc, 341 pages. The genres are fantasy, young adult, magic, adventure, etc. There are 7 books to this series in this order: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. The author also wrote an adult contemporary mystery series which I have yet to read.Experience: This is my second time reading Harry Potter and I read it with a group of Harry Potter fans. Our group name is called HPBloggateers because all of us are bloggers too. There are 6 of us, Stephanie @ TeacherofYA, Tiffany @ Tiff the Book Nerd , Megan @ Bookslayer Reads, Sammi @ One Bookish Girl, Jodie @ For the Novel Lovers, and myself. We are from USA, UK, and Australia. We started reading Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets on 2/24/17 and finished it on 3/5/17. (We actually started reading before this and life got in the way so we pushed back and restarted again).“Never trust anything that can think for itself if you can’t see where it keeps its brain.” p329This book started out with some annoyance. I was annoyed by Dobby, Professor Gilderoy Lockhart, and Colin Creevey. Of course I am always annoyed by the Dursleys too. I really like Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. This school is so mysterious and always have some hidden passages to discover. I like how the author J.K .Rowling brought back Parseltongue when she first introduced it at the zoo in the first book. Re-reading is great because I noticed right away how she introduce Azkaban Prison for book 3. I love learning the creator of the original 4 houses and how Slytherin have created their own Secret Chambers.“It is our choices, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.” p333I really like the magic of the diary. I love the Quidditch game. It’s so exciting to read. I don’t like to watch sports, but this is one game I love and it always put me at the edge of my seats! J.K. Rowling is truly a great writer. This book is easy to read and it’s so entertaining. I couldn’t put it down. When I find myself unable to read anything because of my Vertigo problem this month, I find myself reaching for Harry Potter. I love the brave and smart characters of Harry, Ron, and Hermoine. I like how He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is resurfaced in this book. All events and adventures are worth reading. At the end, I grow a little fondness for Dobby.Pro: magic, plot & characters, adventures, adrenaline rush, page turner, fast paced, couldn’t put down, humor, easy to read, mysteries, braveCon: noneI rate it 5 stars!***Disclaimer: I bought this book with my own money and my opinions are honest.xoxo, Jasmine at www.howusefulitis.wordpress.com",40,0.9976,0.03,0.798,0.173,0.5552104899930986,POSITIVE,0.9968
95,4273354,08/08/2007,3.0,"While the story fits neatly together and again, her imagination is fantastic, the flat characters that play to extreme stereotypes take a lot of the enjoymeny out of this story. There is no excuse for Gilderoy Lockhart. Granted, his fame obsession and ludicrous self-absorption make for some amusing Rowling-esque moments that make the series good (such as a dozen Lockharts running for cover in the photo frames with rollers in their hair), but at the expense of the reader's patience. This degree of narcissism, even if plausible in the real world, stretches my suspension of disbelief too far. Like every page with Malfoy on it, I'd rather flip past them than read them. The greatest problem I have with this series is the two dimensional villains (or irritating Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers). Good villains should draw out some sort of sympathy in the reader, or reveal at some point their humanity. At the very least, you should be able to understand why they are the way they are, and that back story allows you to look at them from a different perspective. This moment never happens for Lockhart, and incidentally it never happens for Malfoy. Rowling allowed the perfect opportunity to make Malfoy a good, three dimensional villain when Harry and Ron used the Polyjuice potion. For the first time, we had Malfoy out of the public eye and in private, where we could see the real him, and not the front everyone else sees. Here was the chance to see his humanity – that he’s such a prick because he’s afraid of disappointing his father, that he worries about his grades, that there’s a girl he likes and he’s secretly worried she doesn’t like him back, anything that humanizes him and draws out some sympathy, because thus far he’s gotten nothing more than eye rolls out of me. But we didn’t get that moment. Rowling wrote him no differently than she does when he is on parade in front of everyone, which was really a shame. So, overall, the characters get tiring, but the writing style and imagination are extremely enjoyable. ",39,0.489,0.121,0.736,0.143,0.5237387387387389,NEGATIVE,0.9998
96,1405697636,10/01/2015,4.0,"This book was slightly more different from the movie as opposed to Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone and its film adaptation but I still loved reading about the infamous Chamber of Secrets nonetheless.I loved the concept of the Tom Riddle and the diary! I was, and still am, so amazed by the magic in this world. After reading the second book, I sort of developed a kind of fondness or some unusual respect for Voldemort as a character. Of course, everything he has done was unforgivable but I can't help but feel pity of him. In his youth, he really was a bright wizard who just had a troubled past that rippled and created the monster that he would later become. I always wondered what spurred his hatred for muggle-borns and this book really clarified that question for me.And now, rather than seeing Voldemort as this all-powerful evil wizard, I just view him more as a tragic character who had such a potential to truly be the greatest wizard in the world that he so wished to be, but because of his past and his choices, it twisted him and transformed him into the very epitome of evil starting at such a young age.I loved this book so much more than the first!

ORIGINAL REVIEW: This is my least favorite Potter. There, I said it. ;) That's probably due to the fact that the emotional pull in this one is just not as high as in the other books. I only teared up once during my re-read and usually I'm crying every ten pages... but the humor is great in this one, I forgot how much Fred & George is in here and I was laughing out loud several times.Another very unpopular opinion: I don't like Jim Kay's art that much and I honestly think it made my reading experience a little worse because the Illustrated Editions are just so damn big and heavy that they are a pain in the ass to read. I won't buy the next ones...But let's talk about the book. I won't give you a synopsis because DUH it's Harry Potter. :D But here is a list of my favorite moments/ moments that were different in the films and I therefore forgot existed:- at the beginning of the book the cake which Petunia prepared for the Masons actually fell on Harry's head; an owl dropped Harry's warning letter on Mrs. Masons head though and she apparently has bird phobia and ran from Privet Drive screaming – ICONIC- Fred and George actually got into Harry's room to help him with his trunk and didn't stay in the car- Vernon Dursley didn't get pushed out of the window which is just a damn shame because that scene is hilarious in the movies- after arriving at the Burrow and getting yelled at by Molly (not Harry of course :D) the rascals actually have to de-gnome the garden which was very fun to read about...- there is a casual mentioning of Mundungus Fletcher by Arthur Weasley- Molly and Arthur's relationship is just adorbs and when Molly gets angry because Arthur doesn't get angry at the boys (he basically says that there is a loophole in the law that you could possess a flying car as long as you don't actually fly it) Molly says: ""Arthur, you made sure there was a loophole when you wrote that law!"" - I loved that scene, sooo funny- Harry mentions that during his stay you could constantly hear explosions from Fred and George's room – I think it's just awesome how JKR hints at things that are to come later and that Fred and George starting experimenting with fireworks for their jokeshop this early- Hermione sends Ron a reply letter and tells them to meet her in Diagon Alley, I loved the sass in her letter: ""but perhaps it would be better if you used a different owl because I think another delivery might finish your one off."" - GOLDEN - Harry sees a fucking VANISHING CABINET in Borgins & Burkes and Malfoy is interested in it as well- Malfoy sees a cursed necklace of opals of Borgins & Burkes – rumour has it he used that one on Katie Bell in his sixth year ;))))- Hermione's parents accompany her to Diagon Alley and in Gringotts they exchange pounds to sickles- Percy's ambitions and how he is at times ashamed of his brothers is obvious throughout this whole book – I think it's nice how JKR started developing her characters this early in the series- Arthur is attacking Lucius and basically shoving him into a bookshelf – CLASSIC- the whole flying to Hogwarts in a car thing wasn't that spectacular at all because in the book they don't get almost run over by the Hogwarts Express and Harry was also not almost falling out of the car :D- McGonagals sass is also real in this one when she disciplinates Harry and Ron for using a flying car and hurting the Whomping Willow: ""I didn't think."" - ""That,"" said Professor McGonagal ""is obvious.""- Neville didn't faint because of the cry of the Mandrakes- I loved how in the books when Malfoy calls Hermione a mudblood basically everyone is losing their shit and not just Ron – Alicia shrieked and Fred and George charged Malfoy – BOSSES- I loved Hagrid's indifference to Ron's slug problem: ""Better out than in.""- Hermione didn't know what ""mudblood"" meant and Ron had to explain it to her – I loved how book!Hermione has way more flaws/ is less perfect than movie!Hermione- Harry finds out that Filch is a squib by finding a Kwikspell course flyer in his office - The Golden Trio gets invited to Sir Nicolas 500th Deathday party and that feast is just ridiculous- in the books Professor Binns (the ghost who teaches History) is telling his students the legend of the Chamber of Secrets and not McGonagal - Lockhart is so much more unlikeable in the books than in the movies, he is so obsessed with Harry – he basically forces Harry to re-enact passages of his books with him and Harry has to pretend to be the monster – it is soooooooooo hilarious: ""Nice loud howl, Harry [...] go on, Harry – higher than that – good""- I loved how protective Fred & George were towards Harry in front of Wood because Wood (being the obsessed dork that he is) put so much pressure on Harry to catch the Golden Snitch that Harry didn't want the game to be interrupted because of the bewitched bludger and Fred & George were just pissed at Wood- Neville broke my heart a little bit when he said that he is endangered of the monster inside the chamber because ""everyone knows I'm half a squib."" - I can't wait for his character to shine, he is my little baby- Harry causing mayem in Snape's classroom so that Hermione can get the ingredients for the Polyjuice Potion without Snape's notice- at the first Duelling Club meeting Hermione is paired with Milicent (the girl in whom she is trying to polyjuice herself later in the books) and Milicent is so aggressive that by the end of the first duel both of their wands are dropped and Milicent had Hermione in a headlock – I mean CAN YOU IMAGINE, again, I love book!Hermione's flaws- ""Scared, Potter?"" - ""You wish!"" IS A FUCKING ORIGINAL BOOK QUOTE, all the good stuff is actually in the books – LOVEEE- I love JKR's shameless foreshadowing, in conversation in which they talk about Tom Riddle and why he got an award for special services to the school, Ron just drops this (as a joke) ""perhaps he [Tom Riddle] murdered Myrtle, that would have done everyone a favor."" - I MEAN JKR I KNOW WHAT YOU DID thERE- how could I forget about Gilderoy fucking Lockhart initiating Valentine's day at Hogwarts and sending carts out to students – and Ginny sending Harry the most ridiculous love poem ever- Hermione signing up for all the classes for their 3rd year – omg the foreshadowing is just too real with JKR (can't wait for timeturner action in book 3)- Why does nobody hear the Basilisk hissing though? I mean it's clear that they can't understand what he is saying in Parselmouth but they should still be able to hear the hissing like why is only Harry aware of the noise?- The line at which I teared up: ""You will also find that help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who asked for it."" - DAMN STRAIGHT- Hagrid gets expelled and sent to freaking Azkaban – I mean I never siriously (pun intended) thought about it but spending even a week in Azkaban most have deep influences on one's character- Aragog: ""I came from a distant land. A traveller gave me to Hagrid when I was an egg."" - A TRAVELLER AKA NEWT FUCKING SCAMANDER? Headcanon accepted- McGonagal shedding a tear when she thinks that Harry and Ron are alone in the curridors because they wanna visit Hermione - Harry used (one of his) first Expelliarmus Charms on Lockhart and it worked – like how weak is Lockhart's game :D- Tom Riddle mentions that 13 year old Hagrid used to go off to the Forbidden Forest to wrestle with trolls – ICONIC- Dumbledore used to be the Transfiguration teacher – I honestly don't know why he stopped teaching I mean he sure as hell isn't doing a lot for being the Headmaster- Foreshadowing game LEVEL 1000000: ""Voldemort put a bit of himself in me?"" - ""It certainly seems so."" - LIKE HOW THIS WOMAN IS A GENIUS- Lucius Malfoy doesn't try to Avada Kedavra Harry – I mean thank God, that part of the movie makes noooo fucking sense – like WHY did they put that in there- Harry doesn't hide the sock in the journal he basically pushes his smelly sock onto Lucius because he know he will throw it away immediately – clever boy ! :D- The victory feast at the end of the book is super spontaneous and everyone shows up in their pyjamas – this is ma school man :DThings that made me THINK whilst reading:- How many students are there in Hogwarts? It sure as hell seemed like Harry only has 4 other boys in Gryffindor in his grade (that would make 5 boys and 5 girls per house per grade: 10 x 4 x 7 = 280 students???)- it is super badass that the Quidditch teams have mixed gender and the girls are allowed to play with the boys even at Elite level- WHY DID DUMBLEDORE HIRE LOCKHART??? I mean come on I know the job's not that popular but Dumbledore could have taught it himself – I am just thinking about the poor 5th years who had to take their O.W.L.s that year or the 7th graders who were graduating and probably failing because of Lockhart- The inter-house relationships are just sooo weak at Hogwarts and it makes me fucking sad – I mean Harry and Ron didn't even know where the Slythering common room was – I mean does nobody have friends who are from a different house – why can't Gryffindors chill in other common rooms as well? It makes no fucking sense- Racism in HP and how Squibs and House Elves gets treated and are seen as inferior",38,0.8992,0.116,0.771,0.114,0.5727092352092351,NEGATIVE,0.9999

I read the first four books a few years ago, but never finished the series, so I'm going back and rereading them all, and I'm determined to finish ALL the books before the year is up.This is my second time reading Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. The first time I listened to it in audiobook format, as I did the first book, but this time I read the actual book, and enjoyed it So much! I love diving back into this world, and I get excited every time I open a new book. These books just get better as time goes by, and I'm really looking forward to reading the rest of the series.One of the things I love most about these books is the friendships. Harry, Ron and Hermione are such great friends, and I love watching their friendship grow more and more throughout the books. They really do have a special bond. There are so many great, well written characters in this series, it's hard not to completely love them all, and I enjoy meeting the new characters as well.The storyline for this book was just as fun as the first book. I love following my favorite characters as they go on adventures throughout the story. The setting is another one of my favorite things. Can I please go to Hogwarts already?? Like with the first book, I was hooked, and I literally flew through the pages faster than I intended to. I really wish I had read this series when it first came out, I'm really kicking myself for not having done so. BUT, it's never to late to start!My kids and I are watching the movies as soon as I finish reading the books, and we are all really enjoying those as well. The kids are actually begging me to read faster so that we can continue along with the movies, as we had only ever seen the first movie before now, and they really, REALLY want to watch the rest of them. I guess I need to get my reading cap on. *wink*Overall; two books down, five more to go! I'm enjoying this journey with the Harry Potter books SO much, and I'm really kicking myself for not having read and FINISHED the series sooner! I have a pretty massive TBR this month, but I'm hoping to squeeze in a few more Harry Potter books as well.Happy Reading!!

But re-reading it, I loved it way more than I remembered.This time around, I was really in awe of how well this book is plotted. Maybe it's because I knew what was going to happen, but I noticed just how great all the foreshadowing is. The pacing is much better in this book than in the first book, and I love how the mystery unfolds bit by bit in such a clever way. And maybe it's because the later books are darker in comparison, but I'd almost forgotten how dark this one is, too. (view spoiler)[Ginny's involvement with the diary/Tom Riddle/Voldemort is really freaking disturbing if you think about it, especially how Voldemort starts controlling her and making her do horrible things, and she can't even remember it. Like, it honestly makes my stomach hurt and I feel so bad for her. She's so alone and so scared the whole year, and keeping this horrible secret––gahh, it's so awful. (hide spoiler)]Over all, my re-read of this book was super enjoyable. Great characters, great world-building, and a really fun and clever story. I'm excited to re-read the rest! (Old review (from 2011) under the cut.) ----------(view spoiler)[3/21/11:I thought this was quite an improvement from the first book ... mostly because the pacing was very good, unlike the first book which seemed really rushed. This one was also a bit darker. I liked the whole ""mystery"" aspect––even though I read it years ago and I still remembered the ending ... nevertheless, the story unfolds in a very clever way. As usual, the world building is great, etc. I still have some issues with the writing and whatnot––but even if the writing isn't the most original style in the world, the story is good.

(At least until the halfblood prince happened. Sorry I don't make the rules.) I remember getting a freaking breakdown after reading about the basilisk. 7 years old me had nightmares for months over this beast.What I loved about this book.1. I absolutely loved Dobby the moment he appeared to warn Harry about going to Hogwarts. He was just this cute, innocent magical creature that wanted to help Harry out and make sure he was going to be safe. It was absolutely precious.2. Harry spending the rest of his summer with the Weasleys. It was so beautiful to see that he reunited with Ron and surrounded by people who appreciated and liked him. I always looked at Molly at his second mother after reading this book for very the first time. I also loved to read more about the Weasleys as a family and to see how they lived. 3. Things got a lot darker during this story and it definitely set a lot of things up for the following books. I loved the flashbacks about Tom Riddle, where we finally got to see more of Voldemort and that we got a little preview of him becoming who is he now. I remember thinking, oh wow shit is going down from now.I couldn't stand Lockhart at all. I don't think I've ever read about a character who's nearly as annoying as Gilderoy Lockhart. Do I even need to explain why? I also couldn't bring myself to hate Snape less. I feel like with every book we just got more reasons to hate him but I am going to talk about this more during my review for the deathly hallows.I found myself liking Draco way more in this book. Of course, he was still arrogant and a little shit after meeting his father it was pretty hard for me to not feel sorry for him. I mean, look at Lucius. It's pretty obvious why Draco's such a little shit most of the time.",37,0.9244,0.079,0.794,0.127,0.6491388888888889,POSITIVE,0.9963

I loved the actors, I do, and the effects of the movies are excellent. I just simply disliked how many, many details were chopped off and I was even turned off by the fact that they did not really follow Rowling's original ideas in some scenes. If you ask me, reading the books is a much better alternative to revisit Hogwarts. I stand resolute with my original 5 star rating.  ""After all this time?"" ""Always.""   I loved the mystery on who's behind the unleashing of the Basilisk. Rowling had kept people guessing and even scattered clues for future cases.

One is that the book (and the series as a whole) is pretty damn exciting, and it's hard to put it down for any reason. The second is the character of Tom Riddle and all the scenes involving him.Since I am reading all the books in direct sequence, the events and characters of each book blend together pretty fast, so I will probably do a more detailed series review at the end.For now, all there is to say is that I am actually enjoying Harry Potter.

There is a lots more action in this one as well bringing Harry, Ron, and Hermione into more intrigue and danger! In the second installment of the series, Harry's troubles start right away when he finds a house elf by the name of Dobby in his bedroom. Dobby is there to warn Harry of danger that will be coming to Hogwarts so he tries to sway Harry from going back so he causes a little havoc at the Dursleys which ends up with Harry having bars put on his windows. Thankfully the Weasley boys come to the rescue and is able to rescue Harry taking him back with them to the Weasley home. 

From that point on in the story things start to go downhill for Harry as him and Ron have to fly the magical car by themselves so they can get to Hogwarts.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione find out soon enough that there is quite a bit of danger within Hogwarts and they have a big mystery to solve as they delve deep into the school to discover the Chamber of Secrets. Thoughts:This was a fun read and again I loved all the characters in this story as well. Lots of suspense, mystery, and tons of action as the three friends jump straight from the frying pan and into the fire as they explore the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets.

Harry also happened to be Snape’s least favourite student. Cruel, sarcastic and disliked by everybody except the students from his own house (Slytherin), Snape taught Potions.‘Maybe he’s ill!’ said Ron hopefully.‘Maybe he’s left,‘ said Harry, ‘because he missed out on the Defence Against the Dark Arts job again!’‘Or he might have been sacked!’ said Ron enthusiastically. ‘I mean, everyone hates him -‘‘Or maybe,’ said a very cold voice right behind them, ‘he’s waiting to hear why you two didn’t arrive on the school train.’What I loved, and still love, about the Harry Potter books wasn't how they gradually became darker and more serious with each book. No, it was the lighthearted, funny subplots that had me hooked to this series. HP and the CoS was full of these happy cutesy scenes, and to this this day it remains my favourite HP book.Plus can I just say how much I love the hugging scene at the end of the movie?

‘Name … Harry Potter. Crime …’‘It was only a bit of mud!’ said Harry.‘It’s only a bit of mud to you, boy, but to me it’s an extra hour scrubbing!’ shouted Filch, a drip shivering unpleasantly at the end of his bulbous nose. ‘Crime … befouling the castle … suggested sentence …’Basically, CoS was the last ""not too dark"" book - unlike the new few novels (in my opinion), it had very magical, fun feel to it.Harry ducked swiftly down behind his cauldron, pulled one of Fred’s Filibuster fireworks out of his pocket and gave it a quick prod with his wand. The firework began to fizz and sputter. Knowing he had only seconds, Harry straightened up, took aim, and lobbed it into the air; it landed right on target in Goyle’s cauldron.Goyle’s potion exploded, showering the whole class. People shrieked as splashes of the Swelling Solution hit them.‘Silence! SILENCE!’ Snape roared. ‘Anyone who has been splashed, come here for a Deflating Draught. When I find out who did this …’When everyone had taken a swig of antidote and the various swellings had subsided, Snape swept over to Goyle’s cauldron and scooped out the twisted black remains of the firework. There was a sudden hush.‘If I ever find out who threw this,’ Snape whispered, ‘I shall make sure that person is expelled.’I remember reading this part as a child and laughing my head off!Harry couldn’t believe it - he was free. He wound down the window, the night air whipping his hair, and looked back at the shrinking rooftops of Privet Drive. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia and Dudley were all hanging, dumbstruck, out of Harry’s window.‘See you next summer!’ Harry yelled.The Weasleys roared with laughter and Harry settled back in his seat, grinning from ear to ear.And of course we can't forget dear Gilderoy Lockhart:The bell rang and there was a mad rush towards the exit. In the relative calm that followed, Lockhart straightened up, caught sight of Harry, Ron and Hermione, who were almost at the door, and said, ‘Well, I’ll ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage.’ He swept past them and shut the door quickly behind him.‘Can you believe him?’ roared Ron, as one of the remaining pixies bit him painfully on the ear.‘He just wants to give us some hands-on experience,’ said Hermione, immobilising two pixies at once with a clever Freezing Charm and stuffing them back into their cage.‘Hands on?’ said Harry, who was trying to grab a pixie dancing out of reach with its tongue out. ‘Hermione, he didn’t have a clue what he was doing.’‘Rubbish,’ said Hermione. ‘You’ve read his books - look at all those amazing things he’s done …’‘He says he’s done,’ Ron muttered.Hehe. You know, I really liked Ron in this book. Can't believe I just said that, because I loathe him in pretty much all the HP books.But he was funny, tolerable and he wasn't being a bitch to Hermione *cough he is in the next book though*.‘Signed photos? You’re giving out signed photos, Potter?’Loud and scathing, Draco Malfoy’s voice echoed around the courtyard. He had stopped right behind Colin, flanked, as he always was at Hogwarts, by his large and thuggish cronies, Crabbe and Goyle.‘Everyone queue up!’ Malfoy roared to the crowd. ‘Harry Potter’s giving out signed photos!’

A wave of nostalgia hit me as I was reading this book and I recalled the times back when I used to re-read Harry Potter during my summer vacations and watch the movies alongside!

INTRODUCTIONHarry Potter has been having the worst summer ever with the Dursleys and he’s being treated like a bomb that might explode any second! Not to make things worse, a house elf, Dobby, warns Harry to not return to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year! There is a plot to make the most terrible things happen at school this year! Dobby finds numerous ways to persuade Harry to not go to school but Harry does so anyway! And what awaits him there will come as a shock to everyone and it might possibly lead to the closure of the school! (oh no…) 
”Brilliant!”, yelled Lee Jordan. “Inspired! What an entrance! Flying a car right into the Whomping Willow, people’ll be talking about that one for years!”
 A flying car dammit! PLOTHarry is hearing eerie and unsettling whispers as he strolls in the corridors of the enormous school and just a few seconds later…students are found petrified! And he also notices a trail of spiders fleeing the place, not to mention messages left behind on the walls by the one who claims to be the heir of Salazar Slytherin! There is an uneasy tension in the air and Harry works his way to put a stop to this along with his companions Hermione and Ron! I loved the plot and it’s pretty fast paced…there weren’t any dilly dallies and it was quite humorous!THE CHAMBER OF SECRETSHAS BEEN OPENED,ENEMIES OF THE HEIR,BEWARE!  (except picture this written in blood) CHARACTERS I’ve already talked about Harry, Hermione and Ron in my review of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s stone , so you can check out that review as well! 
Dumbledore
Professor Albus Dumbledore is the Headmaster of Hogwarts! He’s got a bizarre liking to sherbet lemons and is reluctant to try Bertie Botts’ every flavor beans! Okay it’s weird cause I can’t think of anything else to say about him…well, he’s a good man and he guides Harry and is always one step ahead in any situation! He’s one of those wise old men… He reminds me of Santa Claus! Okay I think I’ll stop here! 
Hagrid
Hagrid is the keeper of keys at Hogwarts and he’s gigantic!!! He was the first one to inform Harry that he’s a wizard! He’s got a heart of gold and is an empathetic person…He sure is trustworthy too! He loves taking care of monstrous creatures as well! 
Gilderoy Lockhart
 Now back as the Defense against the dark arts teacher, Gilderoy Lockhart is a complete nitwit! He thinks too much of himself and his excessive flattery exhausts me! He won The Witch weekly's most charming smile award...Who cares?! 
""You know, Weasley, I think I will,"" said Lockhart."" I really should go and prepare my next class."" And he hurried off.""Prepare his class, ""Ron sneered after him. ""Gone to curl his hair, more like.""

Draco Malfoy
Draco Malfoy is a fellow second year and he's Harry Potter's arch enemy, they both simply can't stand each other! Now there are rumors that Harry Potter is the heir of Slytherin and Malfoy is outraged! He comes from a rich and ancient family who were once rumored to be working with Lord Voldemort! 
Malfoy started taking pictures with an imaginary camera and did a cruel but accurate impression of Colin: ""Potter, can I have your picture, Potter? Can I have your autograph? Can I lick your shoes, please, Potter?""

It's the second year in Hogwarts for Harry Potter and his friends Ron and Hermione. The year we discover many new things in the Harry Potter world.This is the book where we meet Dobby. Also the book where we find out about Voldemort's true identity. The book in which we find out what really happened to Moaning Myrtle.I have truly forgotten how good the beginning of the book is. Firstly, I cannot understand why Harry has to go back and stay with that awful family during the summer. I know they are his legal guardians, but they don't want him staying with them either! Then, there is Dobby, who wants Harry to not go back to Hogwarts and creates a huge mess. The best moment though, is when Ron comes to the rescue with the flying car! Because Ron knows Harry might be in trouble. And Harry's owl secret endeavours are revealed too. And I cannot help but share this moment of Hermione worrying about Harry, as well as Ron's family owl. 
""I've been really worried and if Harry is all right, will you please let me know at once, but perhaps it would be better if you used a different owl, because I think another delivery might finish your one off.""
There is something about the Harry Potter books that I have always loved. The feeling of acceptance they give you. The inclusivity. The ability to be part of the magical world too!
""You will find that I will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me. You will also find that help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.""
Harry's curiosity is something I loved since day one.I love the powerful friendship he has with Hermione & Ron. His bravery and his eagerness to always make things right. I love that danger doesn't scare him. And I have to admit - I also love Harry's rivalry with Malfoy! Their encounters are always a treat!
""Honestly, if you were any slower, you'd be going backwards.""
What I loved the most about this book were the conversations between Harry and You Know Who. The moment Harry acknowledged why he is alive and why he is better.
""How is it that a baby with no extraordinary magical talent managed to defeat the greatest wizard of all time?""""No one knows why you lost your powers when you attacked me. I don't know myself. But I know why you couldn't kill me. Because my mother died to save me.""
And on top o all this - the moment Harry finds out why he truly belongs to Gryffindor!
""It is out choices, Harry, that show us what we truly are, far more than our abilities.""
Truly a favorite of mine and a series I will be forever recommending.
Always!

117,1482090652,12/27/2015,5.0,"Oh Ginny. Even after you first met Harry in the Sorcerer's Stone, I knew you had a thing for him. That little crush gave me hope because I started to ship you two together in this book. It also doesn't hurt that Harry ends up saving her.. so yeah, sticking with my ship guys. Then there's Dobby, and I died when he was at Harry's house being all kinds of dramatic. I loved him right then and there. Now I need more Ginny and Harry. ____________________________________So Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is another re-read for me. I know I said I was in love with the first book because everyone I was already in love with was being re-introduced to me and I was coming back to this magical world and everything. But no, now I'm in love with this book even more. WHY? Oh because it has more of Ginny and it freaking has Dobby.GINNY FUCKING WEASLEY is one of my favorite characters in this book (and remains to be a favorite until the very fucking end). Seriously I started shipping her and Harry from this book. Now I totally get how a girl is with a diary so I can't get mad at her for being sucked into shit with Tom fucking Riddle (aka VOLDY aka VOLDEMORT aka HE WHO MUST NOT BE NAME aka Guy with no nose). Seriously, it was bound to happen to someone. So, I was ecstatic when Harry came in all hero-like and saved the fucking day, saved her from dying, and killed the ghost creepy vision version of Tom Riddle from stabbing the shit out of the diary. Seriously, it was epic. I was rooting for him the whole time. Then there's Dobby who is obviously an all-time favorite for a lot of people - unless you're one of those people who don't like Dobby (I obviously don't associate with those people). God, I felt so bad for him because he served the Malfoys. THE FUCKING MALFOYS PEOPLE! I was so glad that Dobby was freed from a super stinky sock that used to be Harry's that Lucius accidentally gave to Dobby because he's an asshole and deserves to be sad. Speaking of people I dislike: The Dursley's are still there and I still hate them so freaking much.Hermione was kind of annoying in some parts but then shit happened to her which I will deem as Karma working her magic and then she become the girl I love. Ron was funny and all I could picture him during the ""follow the spiders"" scene is from the movie.Oh, and I can't forget Harry because I mean it's called Harry Potter. Well he's just becoming such a bad ass wizard and he's only in his second year. Who knows what he will be doing next year?!? (Ha! Just kidding I know) but seriously! These three somehow always find trouble and then they have to quickly think on their feet and save the day. I wonder what form Voldemort will be in the next book.

122,38425412,11/22/2008,3.0,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the number two of the entire Potter series in more ways than one. It's the turd of the lot. Here are five reasons why I think Chamber is widely considered one the worst book of the series:1. Hermione Granger - She's a pill. No one likes a know-it-all. However, she's the least of the problems. I honestly don't mind her. A voice-of-reason amongst the students is a good thing and she's one of the few students described by Rowling as excelling at school, and that's kind of important to show, otherwise what the F are all these kids doing there at Hogwarts? So, as far as I'm concerned, one slightly annoying character per book is okay. But Rowling didn't stop there...2. Colin Creevey - This little spaz latches on to the famous Harry Potter and bores a hole right through my patience almost immediately. 3. Dobby the house elf - While an important conveyor of information and a tool Rowling needed to connect the dots of her plot, his secondary role as comic relief is too reminiscent of Jar jar Binks for me ever to forgive his existence. 4. Moaning Myrtle - What a debbie downer! She whines and bemoans this and that, and holy christ, who wants to listen to that?5. Gilderoy Lockhart - One of the most annoying characters in the entire Potter series. Whereas I don't think Rowling necessarily set out to make all of the above characters a great prodding annoyance in book two, Lockhart is actually meant to be annoying. And that would be fine, if it were just him and maybe one other, but it's not. Any one of the above alone would not have tipped the annoyance tolerance levels of this book, but all five together are just too much. I don't think Rowling noticed this while working on the manuscript, otherwise she probably would have altered the personality of at least one of them. Having said all that, Chamber is not terrible. It's just that compared to the rest of the series it stinks and has all the originality of a carbon copy of its predecessor, written in a way that mirrors and capitalizes on the success of the first book. Yes, Harry and schoolmates have moved on to their second year and there are occurrences that will later come into play in the bigger picture of the story, but these seem like mere happenstance that had to be cajoled into the plot once Rowling realized she had a hit on her hands that would demand sequels and a big finish. Or perhaps I'm just an old cynical fart and completely wrong. As for the movie...oh lordy, don't get me started on the movie! It's the only one we don't own on dvd. My wife refuses to buy it and has forbade me to gift it to her. I blame Kenneth Branagh.",34,0.8682,0.074,0.832,0.093,0.5571676587301587,NEGATIVE,1.0

The reason most likely being that the first half if a lot of retelling and reintroducing, as well as less exciting chapters and scenes such as Nearly Headless Nick's deathday party, and the Quidditch match where Harry is chased by a rogue bludger. The whole Aragog scene isn't my favourite either.

“It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.”
While I think the movies are just awesome, I think they fail to capture the magic this book has. This book just enveloped me in my magic. Magic, magic everywhere. Surrounding me. Making me feel like I was a person living inside this magnificent world, but terrifying and dangerous nonetheless.This is the second book in the series and I couldn't have been more satisfied with it, I don't know if there's anything bad for me to say about it. I don't know why I'd bother myself trying to figure out what are the flaws of the book and I enjoyed myself so much reading it.I'm not one of those people who try to find every needle in a haystack. I can be satisfied with imperfection, and that's not at all imperfect. It met all of my standards I had set after reading the first book. It was adventurous and the world grows more and more complex, just like I wanted it to be. Learning more about magic, was just as wondrous and exciting as it was for Harry, Hermione and Ron and all those other kids at Hogwarts. I almost feel like I'm a student there, which I wish I were. Take out the Basilisk & Voldemort though because I'd shit my pants. Not that the kids weren't afraid. Of course, they were and that makes it that much more real. The kids have a magnet for trouble. It's so deep, it is a book any kid should be reading instead of reading and obsessing about instead of playing pc games all day and night long. I'll be careful enough to teach my kids how to read and appreciate what books give to us. I love that in the end Harry stands alone and face the enemies without the immediate help of Ron & Hermione. They help him along the way, and that's just as important. It was such a great read and writing this after almost 1 year I feel so drawn to just pick up the book and reread it.",32,0.9556,0.106,0.74,0.154,0.673125,POSITIVE,0.9982

“Famous Harry Potter,"" said Malfoy. ""Can't even go to a bookshop without making the front page.”

Harry and Draco’s rivalry is truly hilarious, it’s so entertaining to see them scheme against one another. It’s arguably one of my favourite things going into this series.The mystery aspect was much more prominent in the Chamber of Secrets than it was in the Philosopher's Stone, which I’m really glad for. There was a conflict underway from early on, which I found the first instalment lacked.I also liked seeing Harry struggle with his identity and whether he belonged to Griffyndor or Slytherin; him learning that the choices he makes for himself are what determines the future. 

“It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.”

That being said, there were also a lot of things that took place simply for convenience. Hermione being petrified and/or injured for most of this novel was ridiculous. We know she would have figured everything out right away if she weren’t. The villain’s entire spiel revealing everything at the end was disappointing; I wish the protagonist could have discovered things on his own. Though this book was released years ago, it’s become a tiring cliche for antagonists to reveal their master plans in startling detail. I’ve heard that this series gets better later on, so I’m still eager to continue!",33,0.902,0.082,0.79,0.128,0.6352813852813853,POSITIVE,0.9999

136,2383179302,05/05/2018,5.0,"What a thriller!What a classic!What a masterpiece!What a… Anyone got anymore words i can use to describe this book? Another year at Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and wizardry for young but famous Harry Potter… These adventures are timeless treasures and i absolutely adored them!  As we already know Harry Potters parents were killed by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort whenever he was just a baby and since that time is has been liveing with his Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon, and his brat of a cousin Dudley on Privet Drive in London, England. As we discussed in my last review Harry had quiet the encounter whenever he found out he was a wizard… Just so you know i am one as well and slowly moveing my wand to make this review type faster…  Unlike book one i feel like book two revolves around Lord Voldemort much more… Yes he was in the first book but i find that in the chamber of secrets we learn more about him and his connection with Harry… In this book we all know that Harry who is still at a young age already destroyed his first hollcraux which was… Tom Riddles diary and Tom Riddle is Voldemort… I do not want to get into what a hollcraux is because that comes much later but what i do want to get into is one of my personal favorite characters… Dobby the house elf. We all know that Dobby did not make an apperence in the first book amd as far as i can remember no house elf was mentioned at all… A house elf is a slave to the same family for generations until finally that family gives the elf clothes and sets him or her free. To me i considered Dobby as a rescue elf and very conserned for the safety of Harry Potter… I saw him as kind and a wonderful, wonderful friend… Even though multiple times in the story Dobby gets Harry into LOADS of trouble i still felt that it was nice of him to warn Harry Potter about the dangers lurking inside the walls of Hogwarts.  In book two Dobby piulls a lot of stunts to stop Harry Potter from attending Hogwarts school and one of them was closeing the barrier to Platform 9 3/4... Of course if Harry Potter and his friend Ronald Wesley could not get threw then surely they could not go to school… Right? Absolutely wrong… Instead they steal Ronalds fathers car and flys to Hogwarts crashing into the whomping Willow right before the landing causeing serious damage to both the tree, the car, and Ronalds wand.  The danger starts whenever Harry starts to hear voices from something inside the walls… The word ""kill"" was used multiple times but what was this misterious creature? Well we find that out much towards the end of the book. Due to this mysterious creature multiple people were petrified and had to stay in the hospital wing and one of those people was Harrys other best friend Hermione Granger…  Many new characters were introduced in this story but my personal favorite was Ginny Weasley who was a bright red haired girl who was the youngest of all the Weasley children… Dobby was hilarious and such a cute elf to imagine… I have two elfs at home with me right now who keep me on my feet all of the time but hey what are siblings for…  The mysterious creature turned out to be a bassalisk and anyone who looked at it would surely die but how were they petrified do you ask… Well you see no one looked directly into this creatures eyes but they all saw the reflection and that is how they were petrifed and did i flrget to mention that everyone who had an encounter with the bassalisk was muggle born? Mudbloods i think is what they called them…  Define Mudblood: Someone with non magical parents... Another name for dirty blood! At the end of this book Harry Potter and Ron find the opening to the chamber of secrets with their no good for nothing professor Gilderoy Lockheart who uses the oblivious curse accidently on himself and went loopy and lost his memory. Ginny Weasley had opened the chamber while under control of Tom Riddles diary and Tom Riddle really turned out to be… Voldemort… I have spoiled this book so much for all of you already so even though i am missing lots of details i am going to stop my summary and go straight to my thought. This book was magical and i absoliutely adored it! The characters impressed me, the plot impressed me, the detail impressed me, there was not one thing in this book that i would have liked to change…  One last (view spoiler)[ Dobby the house elf really belonged to the Malfoy family which was really Harrys enemy family and they stuck Tom Riddles diary in Ginny Weasleys diary that day in diagon alley so it was all their fault this happened but also Lucius Malfoy was a great supporter of Lord Voldemort and wanted to see him return to power... (view spoiler)[ This book was an automatic five star rateing and i absolutely cannot wait to get out the book three review… I had so much fun typeing this out for you guys and i really hope i did not ruin to much of the story... There is no to old age for Harry Potter even if your over one- hundred i reccomend ypu read this right now… Buy it off Amazon because honey its so worth the money and the time!My Rateing5/5 (hide spoiler)] (hide spoiler)]",34,0.9964,0.09,0.769,0.141,0.5260988645857069,POSITIVE,0.9999
137,478650384,12/16/2012,4.0,"“It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.” It's not as easy to review such a well-loved and received series. The base story is already familiar to me since I've seen the movies. While the first followed the movie plot line closely, I noticed little scenes and extras in this book that didn't make their transfer to film. As before, Harry starts in the house of horrors, aka the Dursley residence, where they treat the kid so poorly I'm surprised he doesn't lose it and become an evil wizard himself. I can totally understand his desire to go to Hogwarts and escape that household, as morbidly amusing as it is (and it DOES make a good opening to these novels). Hogwarts was already fleshed out fully in 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone', but the charm and magic of the series came further alive in this second installment. It seems that Rowland has become more comfortable with writing itself, something that's hard for me to put a finger on exactly, but it's felt all the same. This book just read better, the previous mild cheese coating dusted away, leaving a fun joy behind. It's not all happiness and games, however; what good story would be? There's a darkness lurking around the corner and a mystery to solve.First, the professor Gilderoy Lockheart. The new Dark Arts teacher is introduced to this series, bringing numerous hilarious scenes that worked perfectly. What fun it is to follow the three kids through their classes - the clueless and boastful professor is a contrast to the experiences in the classroom of the slithering Snape who seems to have it against the kids. Hogwarts itself has such a strong presence in the novels - from the teachers, the classes, the studied subjects, Dumbledore, Hagrid and his cottage of tea and bizarre animals, that creepy Forbidden Forest with giant critters that nightmares are made of....and now let's throw in secrets passages and riddles and secret diaries. If that doesn't make a workable magical concoction, then I don't know what does.Since I'd experienced the story celluloid style, it held little surprise. I'm sure if I were naive going in, I'd have been surprised at the twist with the riddle for Tom Riddle, the discovery of the creature waiting in the bowels of the school, and the small twists that came about, but it was still a joy to experience in written form even if I knew the waiting answers. Pacing is kept up strong - you'd think it may be dull to spend so much time in a classroom, but not at all, for it unfolds naturally, applying in various ways to not only the main story of the Chamber, but to small details of the characters lives that will continue enriching the series.Harry is a wonderful protagonist - he's reasonable and decent but still a typical type of wizard kid willing to break small rules all for a spot of fun or dire circumstances. Ron is humorous without meaning to be, that unfortunate type who has bad luck and circumstance but shines with their general personality, and of course Hermione is a great confidante and friend you like to have around, especially when you aren't sure of the right curse to muster or potion to mix.Definitely recommended, hard to put down, I enjoyed this one more than the first. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone wasn't bad, but something felt awkward to me, kind of like the beginning of one those odd school moments where teachers are trying to get kids to learn lame square dancing and then sectioning the kids into gender to dance together. I'm happy to say that awkwardness isn't present in Chamber of Secrets, and the heart of the series has started beating harder - it's not possible for me not to continue this series now.

So there they were at work, on the book shelf, unread – a challenge of the fun, slightly-retro, popular culture kind. I show off my growing knowledge of the book to my self-described Harry Potter-loving coworker. “A muggle is a person who doesn’t use magic.” I smile. I pretend I care. I think my coworker cares, but actually, it occurs to me at this moment that she might be faking it as well. This leads to an interesting question – How many Harry Potter fans have been faking it all this time? I care more now that I’ve entered the Great Depression. I need to escape the world of “The Grapes of Wrath”, at least for a little bit. The world of 1930s itinerant farmers from Oklahoma is weighing me down.

Do they have plenty of food to eat? Check. Do they own shoes? Check. No threats of getting beat to death with a shovel? Check. What is a simple rivalry with Malfoy compared to a rivalry with hunger? Oh, and there is flying car, an owl, and a bunch of new words to learn so I don’t have to feel like a muggle.Harry Potter is the kind of book you read if you want to get away from bitter grapes. Harry: Pa told me I had to sell my wand. Said if I didn’t get no 2 dollars for it the yougins gonna go hungry. For all the magic elements, Hogwarts is a school. It feels safe. It feels like the people there are members of a community. It feels like the world has coherence – Malfoy, the Dursleys – these are just background shades of black that help the reader appreciate the beauty and wonder of Hogwarts. Hog. Warts. Hogwarts. A mashup of two ugly things. But there is nothing ugly about Hogwarts. It might as well be Neverland for all the beauty and color it has. Sure, the writer might convince us it is drab and foreboding. Sure, the California of Steinbeck might look on the surface like a paradise. But in Hogwarts no one has to worry about work. Hermoine: Last night I done boiled down my books and et dem. I got to eit dem. Or I gots to eat dirt. How good is this book for curing a bout of the Great Depressions? Well, I forgot almost the entire plot of the “Grapes of Wrath” while trying to understand the rules of Quiddich. Girlfriend just broke up with you? Try understanding the rules of Quiddich and then see if you even remember her name. Got angry with your boss about something? Try calling your best friend and explaining to him or her what is going on in a game of Quiddich. I wonder if I can do this again. I wonder if I can read one book to escape another. Not necessarily Harry Potter, but something like Harry Potter. Basically, the fun blonde of books to help me even out the highs and lows of my brainy, manic-depressive brunette of books. (The last paragraph seems unnecessarily crude – yet I can’t get myself to delete it.) It occurs to me now that Dobby and the house elves are the closest thing the book has to “Okies” in the Grapes of Wrath. Someday, mark my word, there will be a book about the starving and hungry house elves from Harry Potter. “Magical Broths of Wrath”",31,0.9933,0.113,0.704,0.183,0.5774752394070576,NEGATIVE,0.99

“It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.” 
What’s there to say about the chamber of secrets? Harry has always been one of my favorite characters and I know he always will be. Can’t forget about Ron and Hermione, can I? The golden trio have been a part of my life for so long that even if they do some dumb things every once in a while it just makes me love them even more. Professor McGonagall has always been a favorite (but isn’t everybody?) even if she’s a little dry. Snape is one of those characters that you just have to tolerate in every book because you know they aren’t going anywhere any time soon (sadly). Lockhart was possibly the most annoying character in the history of annoying characters and of course let’s not forget the Weasley’s (Aren’t the Weasley’s the perfect family?) Dumbledore and Hagrid!
“Oh well... I'd just been thinking, if you had died, you'd have been welcome to share my toilet.” 
And Moaning myrtle.Growing up, Chamber of secrets was one of those movies that I just watched on repeat for like a gazillion times (the only other harry potter movie I had at the time). And even though I saw it that much, it never made me love it any less. Reading Harry potter was like diving into my favorite memories all over again.

153,3624357758,11/06/2020,4.0,"Returning for more fun, I am back to see what Harry and his friends have to offer in this second novel of the series. Still fairly light and entertaining, J.K. Rowling keeps the story on track, while tossing the odd flying broom, swooping owl, and Quidditch match to keep me on my toes.After a long summer with his family, Harry Potter is eager to return to Hogwarts for Second Year. While the excitement builds amongst others as well, Harry receives an ominous visitor on his birthday. This elfin visitor hints strongly that Harry ought not return to school. A warning that Harry does not wish to ignore, but his excitement supersedes all else.When Harry refuses to heed the warning, he finds himself in a great deal of trouble with his aunt and uncle, who lock him away for his attitude. Fearing the warning may indeed keep him back, Harry wonders how he will be able to escape without using the small amount of magic he knows, forbidden from using it away from Hogwarts. Before he can get too upset, his best friend, Ron Weasley, arrives with some help to get him out. Harry spends the rest of his summer break living with the Weasleys, learning what it is like to live amongst those who understand and practice magic.Once school begins, Harry must cope with piles of new homework and some professors who are anything but engaging with their students. Seeing Ron and Hermione help lessen the pain, but it is still a hard push through. When Harry begins hearing a mysterious voice, he wonders if this is a game someone is playing, though the voice does not dissipate and has a message for him. As well as ominous warnings, there are attacks on members of the student body that cannot be explained. Harry begins to worry and wonders if the voice may be a part of the violence. Harry also discovers the power of being a Parslemouth—able to speak to snakes—which only adds to the suspicion that he could hold some dark magic powers. These powers include coming from a lineage able to open a mysterious ‘Chamber of Secrets’ and unleash the monster that lives within.Baffled about all of this, Harry vows to discover who is behind the attacks on the students. With the help of Ron and Hermione, Harry goes undercover and targets the most likely suspect, Draco Malfoy, hoping that he will reveal himself. Things take a turn when they cannot nail Draco for the attacks and Hermione finds herself being the latest victim. While Ron and Harry continue their quest, the former’s younger sister, Ginny, is taken and dragged to the Chamber of Secrets, upping the ante to solve the case. With the help of a key clue Hermione left the boys, they inch closer to learning the truth and revealing all.Harry finds himself facing much danger on his own and must clash with the person who has been unleashing all the violence throughout Hogwarts. He will be surprised to see the truth and wonders if the warning to stay away all those months ago might have been a wonderful decision after all. Harry will need some outside help from a trusted ally and some new faces, but there comes a time where dark magic might be too much for even Harry to handle. The pressure mounts and young Harry is forced to make a decision he hopes not to regret! A chilling follow-up book that is perfect for those seeking to get hooked on Potter and all his world.I admit, the series has me curious and I am wanting to know more with each chapter. I wish I had heeded the request of Neo and others to start this sooner, though there is no time like the present, as the world could use a little magic, what with the dark forces that emerge south of the Canadian border. J.K. Rowling lays the story out masterfully and develops strong characters to support her plot lines. This looks to be a wonderful reading experience for all, with different people taking something away from the story for themselves.Harry Potter remains central to the story, but, as mentioned before, is more a part of a trio of protagonists. The reader learns more about Harry and perhaps some of his backstory, while also being immersed into some of the Ron story, through tie spent with his family. While Hermione’s past is not as developed as the boys, she comes into herself and readers can easily sense a connection to her. While not a damsel in distress, she has fallen into the stereotype of being ‘in need of saving’ to this point, a mantle I am sure she wishes it dispel soon.Rowling offers more strong supporting characters for the reader, with new forms of magic and creatures who are just now scurrying from the shadows. This is sure to be an evolving list, perhaps adding to what will be a chaotic and action-packed series as things continue. This cross-section of characters will take some concentration to keep straight, as names fly by with each passing chapter. Still, it is exciting to see how things will progress and who returns to the fold as the novels continue .While the theme of the story is definitely geared towards the younger reader, Rowling writes with an inclusive pen and allows everyone to take something away for their own entertainment. I can see that I may find nuggets that Neo missed and vice versa. That is truly the sign of a wonderful book, allowing out conversations on the various plots and character developments to remain rich and wholesome.The story flows really well, so much so that I find myself getting lost in the story and losing track of time. A well-paced narrative keeps me wanting to learn more, with strong characters to keep me interested. Rowling does keep the conversation at a level that the banter is understood and geared towards the younger reader, but I have no complaints there whatsoever. While I am told these early novels are lighter and happier, I am eager to see how things progress into a darker presentation and what Rowling will do to add depth to the stories, while still understanding her intended reading audience. Until then, Muggles can stand aside, as I need to get back and see how my House is doing. Any guesses which might be mine?Kudos, Madam Rowling, for a great continuation of the series. I am eager to see where things progress from here.Love/hate the review?

You will also find that help will be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.”Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets follows Harry Potter, who’s excited to get back to Hogwarts and begin his second year. However, before he does, a strange creature named Dobby shows up and gives Harry a warning: he must not return to Hogwarts, or else something disasterous will happen. And it does, because once school starts, new horrors arise. Something, or someone, is turning Muggle-born students into stone. And, of course, the main suspect from everyone in the school is none other than Harry himself.I was going to spread out this reread, but there was nothing I wanted to read as badly as I wanted to reread Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, so here we are. This was wonderful, of course, as it always is. For a book that’s still written with easy, simplistic writing, it's so incredibly magical and captivating from the very beginning. I had so much fun reading this one and, considering my favorite book in the world is next, it only made me want to immediately continue the series right after I’m done with this review.“Mr. Weasley was unavailable for comment, although his wife told reporters to clear off or she’d set the family ghoul on them.”I think I honestly forgot how much I love Dobby. What a wonderful, obnoxious little creature. He tries his best, doesn’t he? Going off of that, I love seeing how much the characters have changed and developed just through one book. Ron, Fred, and George will always be my favorite Weasley’s. Ron told Fred and George they had to rescue Harry from his relatives, and they stole their father’s car and did it, no questions asked. They always take Harry’s side, even when the entire school thinks he’s turning Muggle-borns to stone, and are always trying to cheer him up. I love one (1) surrogate family.Overall, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a fantastic sequel. I love seeing the world develop, the characters grow up, and the series evolve into something incredibly wonderful. It’s so much fun from the very beginning and I can’t wait to get to Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban very soon. That one will fuck me up in so many ways, and I'm very excited.

155,2334848632,03/21/2018,5.0,"On to the second book of the Harry Potter series in my yearly re-read. I always forget how much shorter the first few books are compared to those that come later. When I was younger I would have said that this one was my least favourite of the series but as I re-read it slightly older, I can’t help by question my youngerselfs judgement! The way that Rowling approaches the mystery element of this book is wonderful. The first book was all about creating the world of Hogwarts and introducing us to it, the second sets up Rowling’s beautiful style of writing and delivering plot. Information is always delivered at the exact right moment and you really start to see the team of Harry, Hermione and Ron develop and how they all work together and support each other. Again, when I was younger I wasn’t so keen on Ron (I didn’t dislike him, I just wasn’t as into his story as others) but now I really appreciate what he brings to the dynamics – he is the heart of the group and he has so many wonderful lines that I had forgotten about! I do think that this book really shines when it is re-read after finishing the entire series. There are so many wonderful easter eggs in this one that you don’t appreciate on the first read. It really shows a different side element to Voldemort to the one that is seen in the rest of the books and is vital in order to develop him so that he isn’t a one sided villain, instead a fully realised character, showing that as manipulative and cruel as he was, he was also charismatic enough that people would follow him. Showing a younger side that could charm people is vitally important because somehow he manages to amass a huge following and he couldn’t do that if he was only the Voldemort that we meet in later books.“It is our choices, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.” It is also where we start to build up the idea that Voldemort and Harry have similarities that cannot be denied but it is their intentions and how they have approached their lot in life that makes all of the difference – it is also a great way of showing what could have happened if Harry was more power hungry and had internalised the Dursley’s dislike of him and didn’t have people in his life like the Weasley family and Hermione and Hagrid and list goes on and on.  ""You will find that I will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me. You will also find that help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.” I love this quote because it foreshadows so much more that there is to come including Dumbledore’s Army and the fact that Hogwarts is the one place that Harry can rely on to find answers whether that is from the teachers, staff or friends. Finally, in this book we get Dobby, do I really need any more reasons to think that Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets deserves 5 Stars. Now onwards to the Prisoner of Azkaban!",27,0.9968,0.047,0.801,0.152,0.4796404275996113,POSITIVE,0.9998
156,424213851,09/29/2012,5.0,"How can I start writing a review for a book that marked my pre-teen years so deeply and shaped the way I measure books even now, 15 years later? I'm not trying to exaggerate, not at all, but it's true. A high percentage of my generation will always be enthralled by the tales, of the young wizard with the oddly shaped mark on his forehead, no matter how many years will pass. Harry Potter is and always will be a cultural figure, a phenomenon, and for many the reason, they start reading books.I still remember the day I got this one in my hands. It was 14th July of 2000 and I had my birthday, finally turning 9. My parents had arranged a big party in our new house and everyone was having fun. I was in my room playing with my friends when my Godmother came in bearing gifts. Clothes -meh-, Gameboy cassettes -score- and a book -hmm-. That wasn't weird, I was always a keen reader even in my younger years, but this book was something else. I hadn't read the first one in the series yet but I didn't encounter a problem understanding the story. I started reading and reading and couldn't stop, not even to eat or sleep. I finished it in a day and a half, and after that, I was forever a Potterhead.The Chamber of Secrets is my favorite of the series along with the Goblet of Fire. I have read them both countless times, I can still recite big chunks out of them, or remember the exact pages my favorite scenes are in. Nowadays the same books stand in my bookcase with somewhat broken spines, looking proudly well-read and reminding me what a great story should be like.Every character, every situation, every moral conundrum or ethical kerfuffle, every little detail, is so well thought out and brilliantly molded that certainly blows your mind away. For me, Hogwarts is an extended home and Harry, Hermione, Ron, Dumbledore, Professor McGonagall and even Snapeare a part of myself.

A quarter of an hour. Not hours, a seemingly endless amount of time, half a day, the whole night. A quarter of an hour.

But new month, new Harry Potter book to read, is a nice change! A little trip to Hogwarts to start February off right.I'm going to continue with the format I used last go-round, since it was pretty stress-free, and didn't involve a heck of a lot of thought. Plus, my usual tactic with reviews is to focus on the big picture, ignoring all the small stuff. It's nice to only focus on the small stuff for once.This is still my least favorite Potter book, but not because of the plot or the themes, or the new characters. I quite like all of them, even the annoying ones (and pretty much all the new characters have one irritating characteristic or another . . . ) Dobby is so sweet and pure but he doesn't use his brain when trying to save Harry and it frustraattttes me. Lockhart. Colin Creevey. Myrtle.No, what makes this book slightly lesser than any of the others is that it's the only one that is written into the typical children's/middle grade format where you spend the entire first chapter, and maybe some of the second, re-telling your reader a bunch of things they already know, and this is either done because publishers or editors think readers are much less capable than they actually are, or because they want to make it so that new readers can jump in without having read the first book. Either way, the motivation is money. Once this series became a bestseller, they pretty much let Jo do what she wanted and this nonsense knocked off.And this book is still great, despite that! It gently introduces a bunch of darker themes that later she will do a lot with. And in hindsight, she does so much preparation for the endgame, and you see none of it the first time around.- - -""Pass the frying pan.""""You've forgotten the magic word,"" said Harry irritably.The effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the family was incredible.I just like this little scene because my mom used to say that to me when I was a kid, and it always annoyed me. I enjoy how sassy Harry continues to be, and it's amusing at the same time to see such an innocuous little phrase causes the Dursleys to have such an overreaction.No cards, no presents, and he would be spending the evening pretending not to exist. He gazed miserably at the hedge. He had never felt so lonely.This just reminded me of the time when I was a freshman in high school that all my friends pretended to have forgotten my birthday as a ""fun joke,"" but it was not fun, and I ended up crying alone in the bathroom because I didn't want to say anything, and then crying harder at lunch when I realized they had been messing with me. Guys, do not play jokes like this on your emotionally trusting and gullible friends. It will not amuse them. (They all felt really bad afterwards. I probably milked it a little.) Anyway, I seriously empathize with Harry in this moment, just wishing for Ron and Hermione, and thinking they forgot about him on the very day his friends are supposed appreciate him the most.""You've just ruined the punch line of my Japanese golfer joke . . . One more sound and you'll wish you'd never been born, boy!""I read in an interview Jo gave one time that this joke is actually very racist.

And I'm right underneath the ghoul in the attic; he's always banging on the pipes and groaning . . .""But Harry, grinning widely, said, ""This is the best house I've ever been in.""Ron's ears went pink.This is a sweet moment for both of them. Ron is embarrassed by what he sees, and others see, as his poverty, but all Harry sees is a wealth of exactly what he had been missing all his life. Harry doesn't care about things, he cares about love and affection, and the fact that Harry can see what is good about Ron's life is validating to Ron in a way he's probably never felt before.""But you're Muggles!"" said Mr. Weasley delightedly. ""We must have a drink! What's that you've got there? Oh, you're changing Muggle money. Molly, look!""I really want to know exactly what the process is for Hogwarts when a Muggle-born student is invited to attend Hogwarts. How do they break the news to the Muggle parents? Are there social workers for that? Does Dumbledore do it himself? How did the Grangers get in to Diagon Alley if they don't have magic? Is there a list of instructions for these students specifically? It would have to be horrifically detailed.

We saw the pair to this vanishing cabinet earlier in the book when Harry hid in it at Borgin & Burkes. These vanishing cabinets become very important in both Order of the Phoenix and Half-Blood Prince. Nick's actions here directly ensure that it will be stashed in the Room of Requirement, that Montague will be shoved into it by Fred and George during the hullabaloo surrounding Umbridge, that Montague will discover its powers and that it's linked to a cabinet outside Hogwarts, thus also ensuring the fight at the end of Half-Blood Prince, and Dumbledore's murder by Snape (though we learn later that this would have happened eventually anyway). Such beautiful plotting.Professor Binns was looking at [Hermione] in such amazement. Harry was sure no student had every interrupted him before, alive or dead.I just want to take a moment to talk about how angry it makes me that Professor Binns and other teachers like him do such a thorough job making history seem boring when history is CRAZY. I did not appreciate how interesting it could be, and how important and relevant, until I was out of school. It is the rare history teacher that can make their subject come alive. Maybe if I would have studied it in undergrad I would feel differently, but certainly as a high school and middle school student good history teachers were rare. This is a crime and a tragedy.""All we'd need would be some Polyjuice Potion.""""What's that?"" said Ron and Harry together.""Snape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago—""""D'you think we've got nothing better to do in Potions than listen to Snape?"" said Ron.Ron is really funny in the books, in a clever way. They kind of neuter him in the movies. Sassy Ron and Sassy Harry BFFs.""the immensely complex Homorphous Charm""""—and another village will remember me forever as the hero who delivered them from the monthly terror of werewolf attacks.""I have always wondered about this so-called charm. If it exists, why didn't somebody try to help Lupin with it? Is it something that only very, very talented wizards can pull off? Is it dangerous? Could Dumbledore have done it? It must exist, since Lockhart mentions taking all his stories from other, real people, who he then performed memory charms on. I want to know more about this spell!Ginny Weasley, who sat next to Colin Creevey in Charms, was distraught, but Harry felt that Fred and George were going the wrong way about cheering her up. They were taking turns covering themselves with fur or boils and jumping out at her from behind statues. They only stopped when Percy, apoplectic with rage, told them he was going to write to Mrs. Weasley and tell her Ginny was having nightmares.So basically this whole book is everyone torturing Ginny unknowingly. Everything that happens, Ron and her other brothers, and even Harry and others, makes worse because none of them know about Riddle's diary and that she's been setting the basilisk loose on his instructions, and feeling terrible about it. They interpret it all as her just being a silly first year, when really she's the total opposite. She's a badass, and she acts out of character for an entire year.""Just do what I did, Harry!""""What, drop my wand?""Sassy Harry strikes again. They cut this line from the movie, and I'm always upset about it. That scene in the movie is way too overdramatic.
""Oh, Potter, you rotter, oh what have you done,You're killing off students, you think it's good fun — ""
Another thing that is missing from the movies: Peeves. Although, I'm not sure the movies could have pulled him off very well, so maybe better they didn't even try.I just love this little Mary GrandPre illustration. It's the opening to Chapter Twelve, with Harry looking at his Polyjuiced Goyle face in the mirror. It looks even goofier in my older edition because the ink's all messed up.""What's the new password again?"" he said to Harry.""Er — "" said Harry.""Oh yeah — pure-blood!"" said Malfoy.OKAY. So this is something I want to talk about! ""Pure-blood"" is legitimately Slytherin's password. The entire house of Slytherin. Just going along with anti-Muggle, anti-whatever sentiment. How is this okay? Who sets these passwords? Prefects? I know, #NotAllSlytherins, but with this kind of thing basically out in the open, if you're a Slytherin, how could it NOT be all Slytherins?""But I know one thing — last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died. So I bet it's a matter of time before one them's killed this time . . . I hope it's Granger,"" he said with relish.AND ANOTHER THING. I do not and never will understand the appeal of Draco Malfoy to a certain kind of person. Sure, he's tragic and brooding in his later years, and as a youngster is just spouting off the poppycock his family's been stewing him in. But nurture aside, he's still not a good guy. Here, saying things like this, how can you like this little shitstain? He's wishing for someone's death! And not just anyone's death, but Hermione's, one of our main trio! (This is very similar to how I feel about Snape, who is a cruel bully, love for Lily aside. but more on that in later books.) On the other hand, I do wonder if he really even knows what he's saying. BUT AGAIN. Harry also did not experience love or nurturing or great ideas about kindness or empathy growing up. Malfoy still has a choice, and he's choosing to be actively terrible.""Could've been anything,"" said Ron. ""Maybe he got thirty O.W.L.s or saved a teacher from the giant squid. Maybe he murdered Myrtle; that would have done everyone a favor . . .""I love when Jo messes with the reader like this. And coming out of Ron's mouth, it's even better. Riddle totally did murder Myrtle, and totally did get an award for it. Well, an award for ""solving"" her murder. But he totally murdered her before he solved her murder.""I don't think Potter liked your valentine much!""Do we ever find out for sure that Ginny did send Harry the valentine? Part of me feels like she's way too traumatized at that moment to be doing something so frivolous. But later, we hear Riddle repeating bits of her diary, and her preoccupation with Harry is in there. Could go either way, I suppose. I wouldn't put it past Colin Creevey to have sent it, either.Down the moving spiral staircase they went, emerging next to the gargoyle in the darkening corridor. Riddle stopped, and so did Harry, watching him. Harry could tell that Riddle was doing some serious thinking. He was biting his lip, his forehead furrowed.Then, as though the had suddenly reached a decision, he hurried off, Harry gliding noiselessly behind him.I love this little moment. Harry is empathizing and interpreting it one way, but we know on a second (or third, or fourth . . . ) read that this is the moment that Riddle is weighing the benefits of keeping on killing Muggles vs. his deep need for Hogwarts, and his desperation not to go back to the Muggle world, where he is nothing and nobody, and can't even do magic. The decision he makes isn't to finally turn Hagrid, the real culprit, in, as harry thinks. The decision is to use the information he has about Hagrid keeping a baby acromantula in a box to make himself a scapegoat, and then quietly retire his basilisk until a future date.It was now nearly four months Justin and Nearly Headless Nick had been Petrified . . .I hope they held Justin back a year. He missed that four months of lessons, plus what, two more? Three? Hermione can easily catch up on what she missed. But that kid is going to need some help.""The moment they start trying to move into each other's pots we'll know they're fully mature,"" she told Harry. ""Then we'll be able to revive those poor people in the hospital wing.""""Hidden Sexuality in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter Books: A Thesis."" Horny mandrakes! (But as a kid, I just thought it was funny that they would move into each other's pots. Riiiight over my head.)""But why's she got to go to the library?""""Because that's what Hermione does,"" said Ron, shrugging. ""When in doubt, go to the library.""Classic.And if the culprit wasn't caught soon, he was looking at a lifetime back with the Dursleys. Tom Riddle had turned Hagrid in because he was faced with the prospect of a Muggle orphanage if the school closed. Harry now knew exactly how he had felt.This moment is the heart of the book. Harry is empathizing SO HARD with Voldemort (the villain! the guy who kill his parents!). And there DO seem to be many, many similarities between him and Voldemort/Riddle. But those similarities only make the differences stand out that much more. Tom Riddle never would have looked at Harry in a similar situation and felt for him. Tom Riddle doesn't even acknowledge his own emotions, let alone that other people are real and have them, too. I also remember what it was like reading this before knowing Riddle was Voldemort, how emotionally attached I got so quickly to him, because he was like Harry, and because Harry could sense it, and was attached, too.""That tap's never worked,"" said Myrtle.Okay, remember last month when the internet freaked out about one of the Pottermore revelations? I did not understand the fuss. It makes perfect sense that wizards would not bother with a disgusting outhouse or whatever horrorshow medieval humans used to deal with their piles of shit. What HAS always bothered me is how the Chamber of Secrets entrance could have been built in a bathroom with modern plumbing, when clearly Salazar Slytherin built it long before plumbing even existed. But Jo answered that! And now I legitimately feel better because this has bothered me for years:""There is clear evidence that the Chamber was opened more than once between the death of Slytherin and the entrance of Tom Riddle in the twentieth century. When first created, the Chamber was accessed through a concealed trapdoor and a series of magical tunnels. However, when Hogwarts’ plumbing became more elaborate in the eighteenth century (this was a rare instance of wizards copying Muggles, because hitherto they simply relieved themselves wherever they stood, and vanished the evidence), the entrance to the Chamber was threatened, being located on the site of a proposed bathroom. The presence in school at the time of a student called Corvinus Gaunt – direct descendant of Slytherin, and antecedent of Tom Riddle – explains how the simple trapdoor was secretly protected, so that those who knew how could still access the entrance to the Chamber even after newfangled plumbing had been placed on top of it."" [source]He pulled Harry's wand from his pocket and began to trace it through the air, writing three shimmering words:TOM MARVOLO RIDDLEThen he waved the wand once, and the letters of his name rearranged themselves:I AM LORD VOLDEMORT""You see? he whispered. ""It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts, to my most intimate friends only.""I've never really stopped to think about this moment before, but Voldemort chose his own name, which translates roughly as ""fleeing from death"", yes? Of course Jo chose it, but he did too. He knew what he wanted from day one. There's also something vaguely hormonal and overdramatic, something very teenager-like, about this behavior. I wonder if before Harry defeated him, Voldemort ever read his old diaries and was just like, Oh my god, why did I write this? Somebody burn it right now. Probably not, way too human of a behavior.""I seem to remember telling you both that I would have to expel you if you broke any more school rules,"" said Dumbledore.Ron opened his mouth in horror.""Which goes to show that the best of us must sometimes eat our words.""I love that Dumbledore isn't afraid to admit that he's wrong, and the message that sends, that authority is not always right, and should be questioned or disobeyed if necessary.""Harry had been to several Hogwarts feasts, but never one quite like this. Everybody was in their pajamas, and the celebrations lasted all night.""This sounds amazing. Maybe I will try to throw a dinner party, and I will make everyone wear their PJs and stuff ourselves silly, and our pants will be stretchy so, it will be okay!",26,0.9993,0.103,0.75,0.147,0.5263467279846589,POSITIVE,0.8861
163,717136545,09/11/2013,5.0,"Reread after 11 years and it's still so good. How is this even possible?Original Rating (2009): 5 Stars2020 rating: 5 Stars Goddamnit! Okay listen, much has been said about Harry Potter over the years so I'm not gonna dwell much on it. I guess we all know and feel what we know and feel about this series.What I'm gonna tell you is a story of an 11 year old girl who, having ran out of books to read, picks up the second book of the Harry Potter series (Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets) - which her dad bought her some years ago while she was too young to enjoy the story - to read on the toilet. Because that's what I did and still do and we all do so shut up!Chamber of Secrets was the first book I ever read in the Harry Potter series. Prior to that I pretty much disliked Harry Potter due to whatever I had watched and the little I read of it years back. So picking it up, I wasn't really expecting to get hooked and not be able to leave the toilet for more than one hour!I don't remember much else from that time except that I fell in love bad and begged my mom to buy me the other books in the series.And my people, let me tell ya, I spent the entire Christmas holidays with my nose buried inside Prisoner of Azkaban and from that point forward I was a goner.This book Apparate me into a whole different world. Suddenly, I wasn't little Rosaline sitting on a muggle toilet in a muggle world reading a muggle book, but I was a magical spirit floating through the air and seeing, hearing, feeling, and tasting whatever Harry saw and heard and felt and tasted. Reading this book again gave me all those feelings. And it also made me realize how lucky I was to read these books when I did. Back then books were not just books, they were a whole other life that I lived. And even though they still are to some extent, I wish I could again experience stories the same way my child self did.These days, Harry Potter is not technically to my taste. I mean this is a middle grade book about a 12 year old boy and his speshool specialness, and it doesn't have the best writing (let's be honest), but somehow it's good. It's so good it makes your eyes cross and your mouth taste like honey even though you haven't been eating all day due to the book not letting you move your butt. Everything just works in this book's favor and there's nothing I would change... and I'm always  looking for things I'd like to change. I won't be surprised if J.K. Rowling was actually a witch who put a charm on this series and made me not be able to get enough. I don't know, people, I have not thoroughly cracked the mystery that is the awesomeness of this series. But I strongly suspect it has very much to do with its world-building. I mean the Harry Potter series' world-building is one of the best. It is just phenomenal. J.K. Rowling has created a world in which any story is possible. Harry potter may be the center of this series, but countless other stories can be written set in this world and they could be just as brilliant. Rowling has created a world with its own rules and it has gained a life of its own. We can see this with all the fanfics with random characters set in this world. People see themselves as a part of the wizarding world. Readers imagine themselves in this world and wonder what their own lives would be like there. Most of us don't see ourselves in the shoes of the protagonists, but our own. It's not the fun and dangerous adventures of the main characters that draw us in. Even the most ordinary existence in this world sounds thrilling to us. And I think this is the true brilliance of Harry Potter. P.s. How have I managed not to forget these books? I mean I'd forgotten almost everything about one of my favorite books I read 2 years ago! This is from almost 11 years ago....",28,0.9946,0.047,0.836,0.116,0.475625,POSITIVE,0.9999

166,1609307550,04/13/2016,4.0,"If I say that the Chamber of Secrets is my least favourite book out of all the Harry Potter books, that is of course merely a slight differentiation I am making in the levels of excitement every single novel is igniting in me. JK Rowling's Harry Potter has truly been my first literary love and as it is with all romances, the first one will always be special. Obviously, this makes Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's stone even more of a special thing. But back to this book, what is happening.Having just had the most amazing year of his life, it pains Harry a lot to realize that his friends seem to have lost all interest in him now that the summer break has arrived. Drying out in the heat of southern England, Harry has nothing but the weird ordinary life of the most wannabe posh Muggles ever. While the Dursley's keep Harry breathless with their absurdities, he suddenly finds a house-elf in his room that warns him of the great dangers that will await him should he decide to go back to Hogwarts. But Harry, obviously, wouldn't be Harry if he didn't ignore such incidences. With the help of Ron and his gorgeous twin brothers Fred and George, the bust Harry out of his Muggle prison and he learns what it means to live in a wizard family.And as he is back at H0gwarts with Ron and Hermoine, there is indeed a very real danger with the name of Gilderoy Lockhart. He is the most incapable teacher in the history of incapable teachers. In love with nothing but himself, his fame and his fakeness, he teaches the kids to...not be a self-indulging pain in the ass. But that threat fades to nothing when suddenly, the inhabitants of Hogwart turn up frozen to stone and nobody seems to be spared: cats, pupils, ghost, the heir of Slitherin has taken hold of the school's fate yet again.goes without saying that Harry, Hermoine and Ron just dive headfirst into the advanger (see what i did there? adventure + danger).

167,1514738092,01/17/2016,4.0,"I always have to wonder just what Lucius' plan was. It's said in later books, I believe, that he didn't know what he had... did he think it was just a cursed object? Or did he really think that the memory could have the power to do what he planned, not knowing that there was a real tether...? It just seems rather short-sighted on Lucius' part. Anyway, this is actually my least favorite of the series. I am far, far in the minority on this, but I just find Dobby to be a bit tiresome. I know why people love him, but each time I read this book, I like him a bit less. I did love Snape in this book, though he has a pretty small role in this one. His micro-expressions though... love them. When he finds out a student was taken into the Chamber, and he grips the back of the chair - that can be interpreted in so many ways. That is why I love Snape's character so much - he's not friendly, not likable, not charming... but throughout the whole series, his smallest moves and gestures can be seen to be whatever the viewer projects on them. He's like a blank slate. If you think he's evil, you will see his actions that way. I love that he's willing to walk that line. Also, this is the book that made me love Ron. His reaction when Hermione is attacked, and his slide down the wall when he hears about Ginny, are just perfect. His reaction when Hermione recovers is so adorable and great. It's one of my favorite moments in the book, and it's literally like one sentence long. (I love Ron & Hermione together. Harry and Hermione? No way.) Anyway... I'm not reading these in my usual no-interruptions, straight through method and it feels a bit weird, but whatever. I'm going with it. On with the next!

Harry and his friends have no choice but to put their lives on the line to get to the bottom of things and prevent the destruction of Hogwarts from within by unraveling its many forgotten secrets.A bit of a slow burner in the beginning, but I ended up appreciating the world building regarding the more defined relationships between wizard and muggle societies and how they can coexist, as well as learning about the histories of each respective branch at Hogwarts, especially regarding Slytherin and its connections to both Harry and Voldemort. Another thing I really liked about this book was the well-crafted murder-mystery vibe and the more dark themes of crime and violence sprinkled throughout it. I thought I knew who the culprit was for most of the book, but it turns out that I couldn't have been more wrong. I love being surprised and the revelation of the true culprit was really cool.

173,578311589,04/01/2013,2.0,"I stand by my original 2-star rating for this one; it's one of the 
weakest of the series.
It goes for the same light tone as the first, but most of the magic is kind of a rehash from the first book, so it's lost some of its appeal. Then there's the darker theme of, well, racism, really, in the form of musings over the 'purity' of magic families. Pretty heavy stuff for a kids book, and not nearly as much fun as the first.Lockhart is a doofus, and it's painful and offensive how EVERY woman in this book throws herself at him. It's particularly grating that Hermione gets on board with it - she's supposed to be the smart one. There really needed to be a female character that saw through his bs like the boys did. I know he's supposed to lighten the tone, but it was rather exaggerated. Appropriate for a kid's book, but it's going to lose the older audience a little.Once again, the teachers are basically useless, and Dumbledore stands by and lets Harry fight his battles for him again. Harry is his typical arrogant self, once again believing he's solely responsible for fixing things. Ron gets reluctantly dragged along, making my appreciation for him and his grumblings grow. Hermione is much more fun with her rule-breaking - she must have really loosened up over the break because she's chill AF about doing the wrong thing. Snape is in fine form, particularly paired up with Lockhart, because Snape just does not have time for your sh*t and it brings out the sarcasm that I love so much. His loyalty for Dumbledore doesn't exactly shine through, though, and it bothers me that he's so chummy with Malfoy. Malfoy's a total weasel and Snape should be too old and wise to fall for that crap. Dobby is the most annoying character ever invented and rivalled only by that giant floppy-eared rabbit thing from the Star Wars prequel movies. The twins are solid amusement, but poorly utilised in this book.I disliked the way Harry treated Colin, and Myrtle, and Nick ... like he kind of pretends like he doesn't think he's better than anyone but he also seems to think that what he wants and needs is far more important than what anyone else wants and needs. Again, this is me struggling to deal with children. I get that they're kids, but 
someone needs to sit Harry's ass down and explain to him how to respect other people.
 He's got a bit of that Dursley jerk factor in him, whether he likes it or not.The whole Chamber of Secrets mystery is curious, but a bit underwhelming. It's pretty slow, and the book doesn't really start to get exciting until the last quarter. Shame, really, after such a great introduction to the world in the first one.It was an easy enough read, and there's still plenty of magic and unusual happenings, but overall it's pretty weak compared to the first one. Lots of dumb, illogical ideas and conclusions, meaning it all kind of crumbles under scrutiny.

Re-feeling all the feels....I had forgotten how much I love Dobby......because if you just watch the movies, you miss out on how awesome he really is.I had forgotten what a little shit Malfoy can beI had forgotten exactly how much Lockhart annoyed me^ Obviously I'm not alone in that.I remember how shocked I was in my youth, about the introduction of Tom Riddle, and how he ends up fitting into the story.And then the Chamber of Secrets itself...It was so great getting to revisit the action and mystery of this book. Dumbledore's great quote of this book:It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.",28,0.9873,0.064,0.754,0.183,0.5571358748778105,POSITIVE,0.9998

Although this may be the least favorite book in the series for many readers, it will always be one of my favorites because it was among my first reads ever! The characters: 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟There is a wide cast of characters, each one is unique, they can be funny, smart, dumb, deep, selfish...etc you can find all kind of characters hereAlso it has 2 of my favorite characters of all time: Hermione and Dumbledore 💖💖Writiing Style: 🌟🌟🌟🌟Rowling's writing style is great because it can be vivid and full of details and yet there are no points of confusion at all. I didn't give 5 stars as I save that for the more unique styles as Laini taylor, Leigh Bardugo, Maggie stifevater and Adam Silvera Nostalgia: 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟All of the previous things being said, I think the main reason why I and many others love this is the Nostalgia. IT. HITS. HARD!!!I had goosebumps going through the last pages although I know what will happen,specially that I know many parts of this book by heart. I am just grateful that this series exist :D ",25,0.9836,0.056,0.789,0.155,0.5903174603174605,POSITIVE,0.9972
176,177283411,06/16/2011,5.0,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets has always been one of my favourite books (and movies in the series). This seems to be a bit of an unpopular opinion, with a lot of people citing this as their least favourite, but I honestly can't understand why. This has everything I love about the series - humour, darkness, and a hell of a lot of heart.I couldn't give this book anything less than five stars, and a glowing review. I am absolutely loving returning to these childhood favourites as an adult - I was immediately enveloped in the story, and it was definitely a real comfort to read curled up on my sofa at home in the evenings. The fact that this book in the series already started to betray the much darker themes that would come into the later books is something I love - there is something so chilling about the bloodthirsty Harry hears, the Petrified students, and the messages daubed in blood. And one of my all-time favourite things about this book? Gilderoy Lockhart. He is honestly one of Rowling's best creations I think, and it doesn't even bother me that Kenneth Branagh now features heavily in my mind whenever I read his scenes, because it was perfect casting in my opinion.What else can I say? I love this book, I love this series. Onto my re-read of The Prisoner of Azkaban!",25,0.9925,0.09,0.682,0.228,0.5564814814814815,POSITIVE,0.9999
177,838238668,01/29/2014,5.0,"I can’t even begin to tell you how many times I’ve read this series and how rewarding it is to rediscover so many different elements associated with this series and how the books connect to each other. If I had to rank the Harry Potter books in order, I would say that this is typically my least favorite, but I always have the most appreciation for the book simply because of the fact that this is where readers really get the opportunity to see how so many elements of this book connect to Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. I could do an extensive review of each book; however, I just want to really discuss some key differences I noticed between the book and movie simply because the movies seem to be the easiest to remember. Every time I go back and I re-read the book it feels so amazing to actually remember all the tiny details that the movies were not able to capture. Also, my re-read of this book entailed me to listen to it for the first time on audiobook and I must say WOW! It was so beautifully done and I absolutely loved the way he characterized the voices of each character. It brought the story to life and I can’t wait to listen to the rest of the series on audiobook. My full review will be posted when it goes live on my blog! : )",26,0.9931,0.007,0.831,0.162,0.5725340136054423,POSITIVE,1.0
