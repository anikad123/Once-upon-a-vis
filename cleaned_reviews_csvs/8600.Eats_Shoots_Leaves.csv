0,89601344,02/14/2010,,"I have, for some reason, frequently been recommended Lynne Truss's book, though the reason escapes me; friends who have been exposed to my academic writing style are particularly prone to do so, and I have grown used to this strange phenomenon. I'm sure it says more about them - poor, unenlightened souls - than it does about me; for some reason, in particular, very few people understand what a wonderful punctuation mark the semi-colon is, and that it can, and very often should, be used to replace the period. Though there is also, of course, much to recommend the humble comma: the average sentence (not that I wish to imply that a sentence should content itself with merely being average) could be much improved by the addition of one or two, possibly more, of these handy little beasts.No, I simply can't understand it; I suppose that a careful reading of Eats, Shoots and Leaves could, if I really tried, help me make my sentences a little longer, and assist me in festooning them with additional, glorious, punctuation.

Who knew punctuation could be so entertaining?As someone who writes a fair bit (half a million words on Goodreads alone), I know my way around a sentence. However, when this popped up on Amazon on the cheap, I was powerless to resist, like my dog on a piece of cat shit.In Eats, Shoots & Leaves, Lynn Truss takes us on a Bill Bryson-esque odyssey through a forest of commas, apostrophes, colons, semi-colons, and exclamation marks. Incidentally, did you know an exclamation mark is called a dog's cock in some circles? I did not.Truss' writing makes things like how to properly use an apostrophe entertaining, using amusing phrasing and real life examples, offering up rules like ""Don't use commas like a stupid person."" It isn't all laughs, however. I normally avoid colons and semi-colons but I feel like she's given me a greater understanding of them.There's not a whole lot more to divulge. It's no surprise this short but sweet book is a best-seller. It's very accessible and as entertaining as a book on punctuation can be.

In the comfortable safety of my desk chair, I'm audibly mocking you if you dare use ""your"" for ""you're"" (my biggest punctuation pet peeve) or if your emails are peppered with unnecessary exclamation points and an overabundance of emoticons. I like the smiley in IM conversations; I hate it in email. It's just a thing. When I meet a pretty young thing that I might want to break bread with on occasion, I'm filled with anxiety over that first email: will she write in complete sentences with capital letters and periods and paragraphs, or will I be left reading a ton of LOLs and dashes and ellipses? The bad email is going to seriously hamper this relationship.It's with that kind of word nerd superiority complex that I went into Lynne Truss' short book on punctuation. I'm not a stickler, mind, but I do know when things aren't written properly and there are certain crimes against grammar that I just can't abide. Even though I'm sometimes a lazy writer here, I know the problems. I've been known to throw an extra comma where it doesn't belong, and when I'm furiously typing, the ""there"", ""their"" and ""they're"" usage can get hairy. In the last week alone, I've edited recent posts over and over again -- correcting tense and errant apostrophes. Eats, Shoots & Leaves has only succeeded in ramping up my snobbery and intensity.I politely chided a friend in the comments of a post because she had made a grammar error and she didn't even catch it. That riled me up even more. It's driving me crazy that some old entries in here imported funny and now there are question marks masquerading as apostrophes and single quotes (not to mention the number of dead links, but that's more web nerd than parts of speech geekery isn't it?). Even now, I'm obsessing over whether I'm using punctuation correctly in this piece. I've got two hyphens impersonating a dash and I've got colons and semi-colons up there that I'm pretty sure I'm using the right way but can anyone ever be completely sure? Sigh.But, yes, I'm a snob. My blogroll is filled with bloggers who are actually writers or aspire to be. If you're going to use words, I want you to have a way with them. I love that most of you understand the importance of setting off proper titles of books and films (whether it be in quotes, italics, or the web person's favorite: the bold) and that you probably are wondering whether or not the period or question mark goes inside or outside the direct quote marks. Ms. Truss makes me feel a little stuffy about caring about such things but there is definitely a comfort in knowing I'm not alone. I appreciated most the history of punctuation she peppered throughout the book along with her very dry British humor and the delight with which she plays with her own writing, saving the colon and semi-colon until she is actually talking about them; keeping the hyphen and dash under-wraps and then exploding with them at the perfect time.If you're a word nerd, you must read Eats, Shoots & Leaves.",73,0.9684,0.106,0.754,0.141,0.5476770451770453,NEGATIVE,1.0

4,39164693,12/02/2008,1.0,"Lynne Truss pulls off the impressive feat of pumping about 20 pages of expository writing full of enough hot air to go into orbit (or at least top the Bestsellers list for several weeks). I could probably write a book of equal length (a fluffy and yet tedious 204 pages) going into what a disorganized mess this book is, but I'll spare you. Instead, here are three reasons why you should save yourself the criminal $17.50 this book costs. First, Truss comes across as such a pretentious, self-important jerk that it makes the reading often unbearable. Take this little nugget from page 104: ""To this day I am ashamed of what I did [her response to a pen-pal, both in eighth grade:] to Kerry-Anne (who unsurprisingly never wrote back). I replied to her childish letter on grown-up deckled green paper with a fountain pen. Whether I actually donned a velvet smoking jacket for the occasion I can't remember, but I know I deliberately dropped the word ""desultory"", and I think I may have used some French. Pretentious? Well, to adapt Gustave Flaubert's famous identification with Emma Bovary, ""Adrian Mole, age de treize ans et trois quarts... c'est moi."" I don't speak French, and she leaves this line, pretentiously, untranslated, so I'll have to give her the benefit of the doubt. However, she does not seemed to have learned much from this unrepentantly asshole experience (note: she goes on to use poor Kerry-Anne four more times for her examples) because she spends the entire book essentially trying to tell the world what to do. You might wonder to what end. High standards? A love of literature? No, just her own need to sound sophisticated and manage other people's business. She attempts to gloss this over with an ill-fated attempt at humor, which I'll address next. Second, she is just not funny. I generally love British humor and I'm familiar with a fair amount of British comedy movies, shows, and writing. I think she must have produced the least funny attempt at humor in British publication in the last 100 years. Her jokes are based on a shared sentiment of self importance, not joy of the language. Furthermore, she tries to come across as appealing to everyone and treating her targets with cautious respect, but she ends up just taking cheap shots at greengrocers, teenagers, and the illiterate (fear of losing language to the barbarians). That's the sickening part. Couple that with her tedious recurrent references to her being single at at age 48 (at time of press), her lack of stereotypical teenage fun (""when other girls of my age were attending the Isle of Wight Festival and having abortions, I bought a copy of Eric Partridge's Usage and Abusage""), and her repeat references to the same stale jokes (Sir Roger Casement ""hanged on a comma"") and you get a long, tiring read. Her style is an attempt at tongue in cheek, but she really just can't pull it off. Finally, the book does not even achieve what it aims to. That's impressive for a book pumped ten times the size of its meaningful contents. Truss's real issue seems to be dissatisfaction with lowered standards by the public. She lumps improper punctuation in with poor grammar and phonetic spelling, and in the process she looses sight of her original aim. Poor writing, she assumes, is due to primarily to ignorance; she deplores shorthand writing for text messages, but fails to consider the utility in that context (she doesn't criticize court stenographers using official shorthand). Furthermore, she seems to interpret lax writing as a sign of social, and perhaps moral, decay rather than personal standards for what matters. These days everyone accepts, at least I believe, that the internet is filled with lazy, disorganized writing. I hold most all my own writing to high standards, including this book review, because it matters to me. I don't think it makes much sense or does much good to blow off steam about the masses' lazy writing on the internet. There's no clear thesis and no clear argument. That's the death call for expository writing and defeats the entire purpose of writing the book. The book fails as an educational tool and cannot be redeemed on its humor or otherwise. I've always had high standards with writing (grammar, punctuation, spelling, style), but having high standards is different from being anal. Truss would have benefited from revisiting The Elements of Style (to which she pays a passing nod at the end) and thoroughly edited her book on everything besides the punctuation, especially the organization. Clarity, flow, and interest would go a long way. ",56,0.1883,0.123,0.755,0.122,0.4897886297376092,NEGATIVE,1.0

6,14147031,01/31/2008,5.0,"This is how I know I'm a real English teacher - I have a shelf dedicated to books just about English. The history of English, the uses and misuses of English, and even the history of the alphabet we use. This is something I never expected to have in my personal library, that's for sure. But that's all to be expected; I'm an English teacher, and people like me are supposed to read books like this. It's professional development, or something. The weird thing about this book, a book dedicated to punctuation, of all things, is that it was popular with people who weren't English teachers. Everyone was shocked by how well it sold, the author included. A book written as kind of a primal stickler scream somehow struck a chord with the general reading population. Perhaps there is some hope for our species after all....The reason it sold well, of course, is that it's well-written and entertaining to read. Far too many books about language are written by dusty intellectual Linguists who exude smugness with their impenetrable jargon and are completely inaccessible to the general public. I have those books on my shelves as well, and nothing this side of a double shot of NyQuil is as good at getting me off into slumberland. Ms. Truss, however, writes like one of us. She's an ordinary person who loves her language and who just snaps every time she sees a sign like, ""Apple's - $1"". I share her pain.The book is a well-mixed combination of history, usage and style. The tiny marks that make the written English word behave the way it does have come to us along a remarkable number of paths. In the last millennium or so, marks have been added, changed and removed over time as necessity dictated. One of her fears (and the impetus to write this book) is that we may be changing English to a new form that requires less of that rigid, form-fixing punctuation.Or people just haven't bothered to learn.As she notes throughout the book, punctuation is one of those things that few people ever really get to learn. Our English teachers give it a once-over in elementary school, and then we never get a review of it, so we spend most of our lives just throwing around commas and apostrophes and hoping we get it right. More often than not, we don't. And we're afraid to ask anyone, lest we look like ignorant yobs.But to master punctuation means more than just being a pedant and a nerd. Heavens, no. Mastering punctuation means controlling your language, which is controlling your thoughts. The vast difference between a sentence like, ""The convict said the judge is mad"" and ""The convict, said the judge, is mad"" should be enough by itself to illustrate how important proper punctuation is. In a language like English, so dependent on rhythm, timing and stress, punctuation is the substitute for our voice. It tells us when to speed up and slow down, which points need to be stressed and given special attention, and which points (like this one) can be safely disregarded, if one so chooses.It would be very easy for Ms. Truss' obvious frustration with the misuse of punctuation to overwhelm her and poison the book. Admittedly, she does at one point put together a kit for those who would be punctuation guerrillas and risk prison to set the world straight, but by and large she stops short at advocating actual lawlessness.Ms. Truss understands that punctuation abuse isn't something that people do intentionally - it's largely a matter of ignorance, and she wants to help. What's more, she's funny. For example:In the family of punctuation, where the full stop is daddy and the comma is mummy, and the semicolon quietly practises the piano with crossed hands, the exclamation mark is the big attention-deficit brother who gets over-excited and breaks things and laughs too loudly.Every section in the book has sharp and clever humor, a description of something as simple as a comma made in such a way that you find yourself laughing out loud on the train.So, if you've always wanted to know about how to use a semicolon, or you're not sure if your commas are in the right place, or if you've ever driven someone to madness by dropping an apostrophe into a possessive ""its"" - and you know who you are - then this book is the one you need.

We know the difference between who's & whose & whom, they're & their & there, the correct plural for words or the fact that some words exist only in either singluar or plural and correctly use the comma, semicolon, full stop, exclamation mark and question mark. And by god, we'll make you know the difference, too! :DIt is so refreshing reading a book like this. Honestly. Many people, as the author correctly bemoaned, don't give a damn, but they should. Everybody should. Lives can depend on it; or at least my sanity (and therfore the survival of whoever made me lose it).What is especially strange, no, downright scary, is the fact that I know most grammar and punctuation rules better than many a native speaker. Because no, my first language, my mother tongue, is not English. So if I can know this stuff, you can as well. No excuses. It's not about getting it right all the time, but reading some posts even here (on a literary website, for crying out loud), makes me shudder! Some don't even use the full stop and especially in the English language, where almost every word starts with a minor letter (German, for example, uses capital letters at the beginning of nouns), this is the worst case scenario if you want to know what exactly a person was trying to tell you.Mind you, English speakers are not the only ones afflicted. Auto-correct and the laissez-faire attitude (yes, I just included a French term, I'm classy that way) on the internet have made sure of that. It's not only the younger part of the populace either.

On being queried by the restaurant owner on his strange behaviour, the panda points to the dictionary entry on himself, which says: “eats, shoots & leaves”. The problems created by an unnecessary comma!It is this joke that this book takes its title from – though it is not mentioned in this book. However, there are plenty of other examples, some well-known, some obscure, of how punctuation can affect a sentence and turn its meaning completely on its head. Lynne Truss does a fantastic job of putting ahead her case for punctuation; I, for one, am convinced.‘ , ; : ! ? “ () [] {} <> – ... -Ahem! See above the stars of this book, taking a bow; the apostrophe, the comma, the semicolon and the colon, the exclamation mark, the question mark, quotes, various types of brackets, the dash, the ellipsis and the hyphen (along with italics). The full stop, though a very important member of the contingent above, is not given special treatment because it performs a self-evident role.Now the question you ask will be: don’t the others? Well, yes and no. It turns out that we have a fairly good grip of how most punctuation marks should be used – however, most of us (including established writers) are unaware of the nuances. Which lacuna Lynne Truss, self-declared punctuation vigilante, sets out to correct.After some preliminary cribbing on the sins against punctuation in modern society, she starts with the apostrophe. Here, I felt on safe ground – most of the things she said jelled with me. At least I was not sinning against the apostrophe! Well, she did clear up one long-standing doubt: whether we should add it, when we are writing the plurals of abbreviations (i.e. CD’s or CDs) – apparently, both forms are correct.When it comes to the comma, however, things get a lot murkier. It seems that there is no hard and fast rule on comma usage, though there are correct and incorrect ways of placing it. As mentioned at the beginning of the review (and through countless horror stories we have heard), an absent or misplaced comma can create havoc with the meaning of a sentence. But what exactly are its functions? The author enumerates six, and after reading them, I was feeling that they were pretty self-evident – before I admitted to myself that I had not thought about it in that way before Lynne told me. She says...[B]etween the 16th century and the present day, it became a kind of scary grammatical sheepdog. As we shall shortly see, the comma has so many jobs as a “separator” (punctuation marks are traditionally either “separators” or “terminators”) that it tears about on the hillside of language, endlessly organising words into sensible groups and making them stay put: sorting and dividing; circling and herding; and of course darting off with a peremptory “woof” to round up any wayward subordinate clause that makes a futile bolt for semantic freedom. Commas, if you don’t whistle at them to calm down, are unstoppably enthusiastic at this job. A very colourful metaphor indeed.Now we arrive at the two pesky things: the colon, and the semicolon. I never knew exactly how to use these guys, though I had a vague idea – and I must thank Lynne for spelling it all out for me. The way I had imagined them in my mind was as breaks interrupting the vehicle of narrative: you put a comma, and you engage the clutch; the semicolon is a gentle braking; with the colon, you stop the vehicle momentarily; and the full stop brings it all to a grinding halt. It seems that my idea was not very much off: these are indeed pauses, but it seems that there are some rules for using them.A colon is nearly always preceded by a complete sentence, and in its simplest usage it rather theatrically announces what is to come. Like a well-trained magician’s assistant, it pauses slightly to give you time to get a bit worried, and then efficiently whisks away the cloth and reveals the trick complete.  The semicolon, in contrast, joins two related sentences where there is no conjunction such as “and” or “but”, but where a comma would be ungrammatical. It also serves as a “Special Policeman in the event of comma fights” (to see a live example, see the paragraph above the quote).(Here, I was a bit worried about the dash – I tend to use it in lieu of the colon quite a lot – but the author set my mind at rest assuring me that it is perfectly legitimate. In fact, the dash is more “dashing”: it can subvert the meaning of the sentence in subtle ways, as shown in the example below, from Byron:A little still she strove, and much repented,And whispering “I’ll ne’er consent” – consented. Lynne Truss discusses the exclamation mark, the question mark, quotation mark, ellipsis, brackets and the dash all together as these are the guys which give the text its sparkle – “cutting a dash”, to use the author’s own term. I loved the way she explained these rules as they appeared in a sort of story, where Lord Fellamar almost succeeds in spoiling Sophia’s virtue, to be frustrated at the last minute by the Squire Western.Before winding up, I would like to mention two more things the author touches upon:1.	The use of italics. Though overkill would grate upon the reader’s nerves, apt use can enhance the power of narrative no end. In one Agatha Christie novel, the whole mystery hung upon where the emphasis in a sentence was placed: “she wasn’t there”, “she wasn’t there” or “she wasn’t there” (and this example is mine!).2.	The under-used hyphen. I could very well have written underused in the previous sentence, but I decided to take the advice of Lynne and use the cute little connector. And it is a must in some cases: a little used car is very much different from a little-used car!So, ladies and gentlemen: punctuation is important. Though I would say that no one should lose sleep over the exact place to put that comma, or whether a colon or dash should be used, one cannot say that sometimes it does not become damn important, as the following sentence illustrates.Woman, without her man, is nothing. (So say the MCPs.)Woman! Without her, man is nothing. (The feminists retort.)",38,0.9885,0.054,0.855,0.09,0.5035699023199023,NEGATIVE,0.9963

But it looks like every language has its own tormentors.Beside being extremely informative, it is in equal measure hilarious. What is it with these books on punctuation that makes them so unputdownable? I've read not long ago Semicolon: The Past, Present, and Future of a Misunderstood Mark, and I loved it. Now this one is even more captivanting. Here are some fragments:I mean, full stops are quite important, aren't they? Yet by contrast to the versatile apostrophe, they are stolid little chaps, to say the least. In fact one might dare to say that while the full stop is the lumpen male of the punctuation world (do one job at a time; do it well; forget about it instantly), the apostrophe is the frantically multi-tasking female, dotting hither and yon, and succumbing to burnout from all the thankless effort.Punctuation developed slowly and cautiously not because it wasn't considered important, but, on the contrary, because it was such intensely powerful ju-ju.Everyone knows the exclamation mark - or exclamation point, as it is known in America. It comes at the end of a sentence, is unignorable and hopelessly heavy-handed, and is known in the newspaper world as a screamer, a gasper, a startler or (sorry) a dog's cock.In the family of punctuation, where the full stop is daddy and the comma is mummy, and the semicolon quietly practises the piano with crossed hands, the exclamation mark is the big attention-deficit brother who gets overexcited and breaks things and laughs too loudly.The name comes from the Greek, as usual. What a lot of words the Greeks had for explaining spatial relationships - for placing round, placing underneath, joining together, cutting off! Lucky for us, otherwise we would have had to call our punctuation marks names like ""joiner"" and ""half a dash"" and so on. In this case, the phrase from which we derive the name hyphen means ""under one"" or ""into one"" or ""together"", so is possibly rather more sexy in its origins than we might otherwise have imagined from its utilitarian image today.Recommended to everyone, I've seen a lot of reviews which could benefit from it.

I have the same feeling about “its” and “it’s”. I vividly recall learning English grammar at school. It was exceedingly painful at the time, because the teacher was rather boring and this carried over to the class. Yawning was very common then too.

A reference to this was made earlier on in the book:“True, one occasionally hears a marvellous punctuation-fan joke about a panda who [my addition - shouldn’t this be ‘which’ because a panda is not a family pet?] ‘eats, shoots and leaves’….”So on checking the acknowledgements I see that Nigel Hall was responsible for this. After a certain amount of research, I assume this is the joke? It’s rather good anyway.“A panda walks into a restaurant, sits down and orders a sandwich. After he finishes eating the sandwich, the panda pulls out a gun and shoots the waiter, and then stands up to go.“Hey!” shouts the manager. “Where are you going? You just shot my waiter and you didn't pay for your sandwich!”The panda yells back at the manager, “Hey man, I am a PANDA! Look it up!”The manager opens his dictionary and sees the following definition for panda: “A tree-dwelling marsupial of Asian origin, characterised by distinct black and white colouring. Eats shoots and leaves.”Ms Truss starts with the unfortunate apostrophe. She just sees glaring errors everywhere: on buses, billboards, in newspapers, public institutions like the British Library, you name it, there are errors everywhere.As an example, a headline in the paper states: “Dead sons photos may be released”. How many sons are there one wonders?When Ms Truss was on Radio 4 making a series of programmes about punctuation, she met John Richards from the Apostrophe Protection Society. Imagine that. The apostrophe has become alive and finally reached “animal” status. The author questions:“Why did the Apostrophe Protection Society not have a militant wing? Could I start one? Where do you get balaclavas?”It continues in this style, attacking all those who misuse commas, full stops (period US), semi-colons, etc. It's all an outrage to her and she throws in wonderful anecdotes to illustrate her point of view.Under commas, I especially liked the Oxford comma. A typical example was “The flag is red, white, and blue.” The comma after white; in Britain, we normally leave it out but there are those who prefer to leave it in. I suppose this is somewhat pedantic?Or, A woman, without her man, is nothing.A woman: without her, man is nothing.It’s remarkable really how the comma can actually change the sense of a sentence so dramatically. I confess that I’ve never really thought of that before.When we arrive at the semicolon, there’s a very good example with George Bernard Shaw. I agree with Ms Truss, we would obviously look on his use of this punctuation as sheer insanity but he’s dealing with T.E. Lawrence, who he refers to as “Luruns” (sounds like a place to me as we have “Laruns” not too far away from where I live in France). Mr Shaw believes that Lawrence is a liar:“You will see [writes Shaw] that your colons before buts and the like are contra-indicated in my scheme, and leave you without anything in reserve for the dramatic occasions mentioned above. You practically do not use semicolons at all. This is a symptom of mental defectiveness, probably induced in camp life.”Ms. Truss laments on the arrival of the e-mail and the vocabulary that has come into being because of that. She blames the internet for all the books on line and wonders if the book will still be around in twenty years. She also makes references to the printed word:“…The book remains static and fixed … Holding the book, we are aware of posterity and continuity. Knowing that the printed word is always edited, typeset and proofread before it reaches us; we appreciate its literary authority. Having paid money for it (often), we have a sense of investment and a pride of ownership, not to mention a feel of general virtue.”Certain sections of the book just show a comma on the line. I rather liked that too; a fleuron of sorts? It’s probably best to pretend that it’s a variation of a flower or leaf.I really could go on about this book but suffice it to say, I just thoroughly enjoyed Eats, Shoots and Leaves. It stands up for punctuation and correct punctuation at that. It’s all part of our heritage and must not get lost in time. It’s also very amusing.All said and done, I recommend this book to everyone, regardless of their age. I'll no doubt go back to it from time to time just to re-enjoy it.",30,0.9899,0.058,0.845,0.097,0.4239526045159849,NEGATIVE,0.9988

While my punctuation is not perfect and my reviews always contain typo's that I only spot years later, I still enjoy a good laugh at terrible punctuation.Lynne Truss has collected some great punctuation faux pas. But more than that, she has provided relatively simple guidance on how to correctly position those commas, apostrophes, hyphens, and the like. (Points for noticing the Oxford comma (used after the and in a list) which I quite like.) I also like the guidance on how to position the full-stop when dealing with quotation marks or brackets (which I know I tend to over-utilise). Of course, I am paranoid now about every comma, hyphen and apostrophe in this review, as it would have been better just to throw some stars at it and not write a review at all than to cock up the punctuation...Some quotes:
To those who care about punctuation, a sentence such as ""Thank God its Friday"" (without the apostrophe) rouses feelings not only of despair but of violence.-If you still persist in writing, ""Good food at it's best"", you deserve to be struck by lightning, hacked up on the spot and buried in an unmarked grave.-Why did the Apostrophe Protection Society not have a militant wing? Could I start one? Where do you get balaclavas?-I apologise if you all know this, but the point is many, many people do not. Why else would they open a large play area for children, hang up a sign saying ""Giant Kid's Playground"", and then wonder why everyone stays away from it? (Answer: everyone is scared of the Giant Kid.)-Phrases abound that cry out for hyphens. Those much-invoked examples of the little used car, the superfluous hair remover, the pickled herring merchant, the slow moving traffic and the two hundred odd members of the Conservative Party would all be lost without it.

16,354478785,06/23/2012,4.0,"This book is a witty rant about the use and misuse of punctuation. It has a very high feel good factor. We, the readers, of course know how to use apostrophes correctly, and that writing littered with exclamation marks infers a feeble mind. We know subconsciously, even if not via overt rules, how to use hyphens. We pat pat pat ourselves on the back with being so in accord with this funny woman and her nit-picking usage of grammar.Ahhhh, except this is the nub of the thing. Lynne Truss in this book deals only with punctuation - that thin layer of tasty icing on top of the vast, dense, impenetrable cake that is grammar. Reading Eats Shoots & Leaves does not maketh a grammarian of us, but merely a punctuator. Something that most kids do with reasonable efficiency by about the age of 11. Maybe I am being a bit harsh. Ms Truss mentions several famous authors who have tussled with nuances of punctuation, often with ferocity, and there is a bibliography at the end which is over four pages long. Still I can’t help thinking this is the easy-peasy edge of grammar, and really, she is giving us a very cushy ride.Reservations aside, this is an enjoyable book. Ms Truss writes in an endearingly chatty style, and she’s a very amusing woman. I also learnt a thing or two. For me, best of all, was an introduction to the Oxford comma. This is when you are allowed to put a comma before an ‘and’ when making a list in a sentence. Thus….“The fruit salad, of oranges, apples, guavas and tenderly-ripened bananas” is replaced by “The fruit salad, of oranges, apples, guavas, and tenderly-ripened bananas”. Oh hooray, hooray! I always wanted to insert that last comma, but thought it was forbidden. Other people will undoubtedly find their own unexpected freedoms. For all her huffiness, Ms Truss is a surprisingly generous mentor.All in all this book is a good fun read. The average rating on GR - a nice plump 3.83, from 50,719 people - says it all.--------------------------------------------------------Note: And for those of us who flail around in the gooey morass of more difficult areas of grammar, help is at hand via this wonderful Goodreads group.Language and Grammar",27,0.9962,0.038,0.781,0.181,0.6428796296296295,POSITIVE,0.5141

Quotation Marks (single and double)(Now I understand why I see punctuation in and outside of quotation marks; British place outside while the American custom place inside.)4. Colon, Semicolon and Interjections5. Dash, Exclamation, Question, Italics, Underlining...6. Hyphen7. Emoticons and other stuff(The author does not think too highly of using emoticons.

24,8135055,10/23/2007,5.0,"To be honest, I never heard the panda joke until this book came out. The Australian version is a bit different - not as clever and involved, perhaps, but funny nonetheless. It went something like (and I am the worst person at re-telling jokes, I always forget bits. Usually the punchline): What does an Aussie bloke have in common with a wombat? They both eat, shoots and leaves. Except that's not quite it cause the grammar is off. Never let me tell a joke, I'll always ruin it.Anyway, to the book. Wonderful, wonderful book. Hilarious, absolutely hilarious. And, as a bit of a ""stickler"" myself, very welcome too.Eats, Shoots & Leaves covers the apostrophe, the comma, the semicolon and colon, the hyphen, dash and bracket, and even the question and exclamation marks. If you have always struggled, or sometimes doubt, how to use any of these, this is definitely the book for you. If, like me, you read it and get awfully chuffed with yourself for using them (almost always) correctly, you'll still want to keep this little gem around, either for back-up in those arguments with other sticklers (or punctuation-impaired people), or for a laugh. It's an easy-going, ironic book, full of tongues-in-cheeks and witticisms and puns - intelligent puns. One of the things I love about this book is how Truss captures the punctuations marks' true characters. Giving marks personalities is a great joy to me - the only reason I used to fly through the times table every morning in primary school was because all the numbers had personalities and characters, and when they times'd by each other it was like a dramatic scene in a play; that was how I remembered it all. I can't say I do the same with punctuation, but I totally agree with Truss' personifications. For example:Now, there are no laws against imprisoning apostrophes and making them look daft. Cruelty to punctuation is quite unlegislated: you can get away with pulling the legs off semicolons; shrivelling question marks on the garden path under a pwerful magnifying glass; you name it. ... the tractable apostrophe has always done its proper jobs in our language with enthusiasm and elegance, but it has never been taken seriously enough; its talent for adaptability has been cruelly taken for granted; and now, in an age of supreme graphic frivolity, we pay the price. [p.36:]And:... if you feel you are safe paddling in these sparklingly clear shallows of comma usage, think again. See that comma-shaped shark fin ominously slicing through the waves in this direction? Hear that staccato cello? Well, start waving and yelling, because it is the so-called Oxford comma (also known as the serial comma) and it is a lot more dangerous than its exclusive, ivory-tower moniker might suggest. [p.84:]Also:There are times ... when the semicolon ... performs the duties of a kind of Special Policeman in the event of comma fights. ... One minute the semicolon is gracefully joining sentences together in a flattering manner ... and the next it is calling a bunch of brawling commas to attention. [p.125:]I love it! It also does wonders for understanding how to use the fiddly little things, if you've ever had trouble - and let's face it, who doesn't? And while Truss' tone may often be light and playful (even a little frivolous), this book is hip-deep in interesting historical background, usages and common mistakes, and entertaining examples of real-life punctuation boo-boos that, if you care at all, will actually make you tense up in indignation.She also has a friendly dig at Australians and our tendency to turn statements into questions, which the British fans of Neighbours have picked up, much to her chagrin:Increasingly people are (ignorantly) adding question marks to sentences containing indirect questions, which is a bit depressing, but the reason is not hard to find: blame the famous upward inflection caught by all teenage viewers of Neighbours in the past twenty years. Previously, people said ""you know?"" and ""know what I'm saying?"" at the end of every sentence. Now they don't bother with the words and just use the question marks, to save time. Everything ends up becoming a question? I'm talking about statements? It's getting quite annoying? But at least it keeps the question mark alive so it can't be all bad? [p.141-2:]I laughed and laughed.I did feel a bit ashamed when Truss disparagingly brings emoticons into the discussion - I have used a couple of smileys and the like on occassion. But it's not easy getting tone across in written words - or, rather, it kinda is (isn't that what writers accomplish all the time?), but in emails etc. it's more personal, and you can't read body language or facial expressions, and these people you are chatting away to are so often strangers, that it is so easy to be misconstrued, misunderstood, and a whole lot of other ""mis-es"".Another thing I appreciated was that, this book having been written by a Brit, it hasn't been Americanised. That would be a completely different book. But Truss does make distinctions between American and British usages which are very helpful, and interesting too. This book reads a bit like an essay, the kind famous writers write so that we'll all be awed by the intellectual genius behind their Great Works - except Eats, Shoots & Leaves is not at all pretentious; on the contrary, Truss confesses several times that she herself has doubts, and still learns that what she thought was wrong is actually ""correct"" (such as it is). What I mean, is that this is not some dry reference book - and the panda joke on the back cover prepares you for that. Even so, this is perfect reference material for students, teachers, copy-editors, journalists, proof-readers (please!), sticklers and, well, anybody. I learnt a lot from it but had fun learning, which should actually help me remember it all.And I just can't believe I never noticed that the movie Two Weeks Notice doesn't have an apostrophe (which I very nearly typed in myself just now), or that Who Framed Roger Rabbit doesn't have a question mark. I think my brain put them in for me, which is why I'm very surprised to find these punctuation marks are missing.Recommended for everyone, even people who are bored shitless by anything to do with writing.",16,0.9993,0.075,0.732,0.193,0.5414580386610091,POSITIVE,0.9979

Eats, Shoots & Leaves
 is a hilarious, heartfelt, and at times long-suffering love letter to punctuation. Lynn Truss had me laughing out loud and re-reading bits of text to myself—no small feat given that I read the book in the midst of a pandemic. Truss is not content to simply bemoan the fact that standards of punctuation today are abysmal; she attempts to help readers understand and appreciate the beauty of punctuation. She passionately argues that punctuation is not a set of dusty rules for fusspots, but rather a system that clarifies the meaning of the written word. Consider the difference between:A woman, without her man, is nothing A woman: without her, man is nothingOr take hyphens, which were apparently hated by both Churchill and Woodrow Wilson. As the author notes, the difference between extra-marital sex and extra marital sex is a rather important one—at least for the individuals involved. But wait, there’s more! Punctuation is not just about rules—it’s an art form. Like notations in music that direct you how to play, punctuation helps the reader know when to pause, what text is being emphasized, and the flow of language. In fact, punctuation was first invented by the ancient Greeks to mark when actors should pause during dialogue. Standard punctuation became important with the rise of printed books meant to be read silently. Truss is endearing as she fangirls over the obscure Venetian family of printers who helped set these standards during the Renaissance.I adored the author’s dry wit and grandiose writing, although I recognize that her style will not be everyone’s cup of tea. She shares her thoughts on a poorly punctuated road sign in this gem of a paragraph:“Children drive slowly.” Evidently, this sign—inadvertently descriptive of the disappointing road speeds attainable by infants at the wheel—was eventually altered (but sadly not improved) by the addition of a comma, becoming “Children, drive slowly.” A kindly exhortation, perhaps, which might even save lives among those self-same reckless juvenile drivers; but still not quite what the writer really had in mind.Despite the book’s subtitle and her sly comments about sticklers, Truss does not really have a zero-tolerance approach to punctuation. Some reviewers who disliked the book found her elitist or arrogant, but to me it was clear that she was gently mocking herself and her fellow sticklers, while still expressing her belief that everyone can and should master punctuation. Some of the funniest sections of the book are the various literary battles over punctuation. George Bernard Shaw, who never used one semi-colon when three would do, wrote a series of scathing letters to T.E. Lawrence taking him to task for his punctuation:""You practically do not use semicolons at all. This is a symptom of mental defectiveness, probably induced by camp life. As you have no rules, and sometimes throw colons about with an unhinged mind, here are some rules for you."" The last chapter briefly explores punctuation in the digital age. Truss notes that an increasing number of people are sharing their written thoughts online, yet fewer and fewer people bother to learn punctuation. Speed is often valued over quality or clarity. Truss worries that rather than reading, writing, and arithmetic, children in the future will learn reading, sending, and arithmetic. I think that’s alarmist, but it is concerning to see so many people dismissing punctuation and metaphorically shrugging their shoulders when confronted with errors. The book covers the entire history of punctuation and the rules for usage in just 228 pages. Memorizing so many rules felt overwhelming to me at times, especially since most punctuation marks have multiple purposes and there are stylistic gray areas. Even after finishing the book, I admit that I am a bit woolly on some of the rules. So I would not recommend this book as a starting primer for teens or beginning ESL learners. But for people who revere language and/or want to clarify some of the finer points of punctuation, this book is completely delightful.I apologize, in advance, for any punctuation errors in this review.",16,0.8224,0.078,0.821,0.101,0.5024761904761905,POSITIVE,0.9574

28,1456692134,12/01/2015,3.0,"This is a first book in a while I read in russian. You may notice that maybe it's not the best idea to read a book about english grammar in russian language. But worry not, I had a really good translation that was created with the help of many educated british ladies and gentlemen; moreover the original quotes were saved in translation and I had a bonus in a form of two phrases instead of one. This book is not a grammar book but an entertaining nonfiction about the most funny misuse of punctuation. As you can see from the title, the original meaning was that panda eats shoots and leaves, but someone misplaced one comma, and the result is drastically changed. We have in russian similar phrase and even a wonderful cartoon ""In the country of unlearned lessons"" about it. There's a difference between russian punctuation and english punctuation, and sometimes when I write my reviews, I find it rather hard to determine whether this comma is ok to use in english as I use it in russian. Well, this book definitely helped me to distinguish some of these rules. It is - to some extent - a depository of different references to world-known classics and how they used punctuation to create their masterpieces. It was, at least, educational information and, at most, spiced with funny examples. But in many ways this book is for huge fans of punctuation. There were times I couldn't really understand the author and her obsessive love with punctuation, and considering the punctuation mark in the wrong place almost an unforgivable crime. Sometimes it was annoying to read all the author's hysterics about misuse of it. Maybe I am wrong and don't get it, but in this case I can freely admit: I don't get all this obsession. But I definitely agree with Lynne Truss in one thing for sure: punctuation, in the first place, must bring the correct meaning to words, and underline emotions and the mood author wants to show to his readers.",13,0.9892,0.086,0.733,0.181,0.4596883468834689,NEGATIVE,0.9968

To be serious I must say that this book was enjoyable first and foremost. Secondly this humorous little volume explored a little of the history of the English language. Which is of course something I look forward to exploring at university this year. While my grammar and punctuation is hardly perfect it tends to on the whole be sound. However I still aim to work on getting all the kinks out so that any 'mistakes' are simply induced from my unique way of phrasing, well, phrases. I wish others around me took the same care because I constantly see mistaken uses of homophones and contractions such as there's theirs; there and they're; and its and it's. In fact I tend on the whole to often humorously correct such misspellings and incorrect uses of language procedures. For instance earlier I commented on how I hate how fair evaders always avoid carnivals and good looking people. And that is why I enjoyed this book.

31,5152785,08/26/2007,3.0,"When was the last time you read a book where you could literally say, ""This book has changed my life."" Eat, Shoots and Leaves by Lynn Truss is one such book. At first I thought a zero tolerance approach to punctuation sounded a bit extreme. That is until Truss mentioned one of my favorite movies (""Two Weeks Notice""), pointing out that the title should be ""Two Weeks' Notice"". I was shocked. I had always assumed an apostrophe was there. Then I started listening to The Plain White T's, a band whose name makes no sense with an apostrophe, and I knew things were getting serious.Nonetheless I will admit that it was a challenge reading the chapters about the apostrophe and the comma (although I have learned a few knew tricks for commas). Then I came to a chapter entitled ""Airs and Graces."" From there onward, the book was a revelation.I learned my punctuation from my mom and copious reading. I still have a hard time explaining dependent clauses and why it is appropriate to use ""well"" instead of ""good"" even though I can tell when a sentence is complete/written correctly if I can read it. I am sharing this background so that when I say Truss explains all of the punctuation rules presented in her book you will know I mean really clear.Truss has illustrated that there is a time and place for the dash and double-dash in all good literature. She has also shown that, to avoid over-using the dash, a colon can easily replace a dash in certain situations. I never knew that!What's nice about Eats, Shoots and Leaves is that it's not a dry read. Yes, Truss is talking about punctuation. Yes, she is deadly serious about it. But she maintains a sense of humor throughout: including witty examples and poking fun at punctuation (and punctuation sticklers) as much as she explains it. In addition, Truss includes abundant historical information about the punctuation marks she discusses ranging from the first names for parentheses to the first appearance of an apostrophe in printed documents.I would recommend this book highly to anyone with an interest in writing. Even if you know the basics, Truss has a few tricks up her sleeve that are sure to give your writing a little extra flair.You can find this review and more on my blog Miss Print",10,0.9387,0.053,0.857,0.09,0.5031301106301107,POSITIVE,0.9814

I found this insightful, and (I have to be honest), quite exciting. Write me off immediately as a saddo; I don’t care.My problem was the main thing I learned here, which is Lynne Truss is a horrible person. I worked this out quickly (reading a couple of pages of the introduction should do it), and it marred the book for me entirely. No one wants to listen to someone they dislike, and let me tell you I disliked Truss.Her commentary reeked of her own self-importance, she slagged off anyone with the audacity to make a punctuation error, and even threatened people with death, guns, and violence should they incorrectly punctuate a sentence. There is no fucking need.She seems to forget not all of us are from the same background. We’re even treated to an anecdote of a punctuation novel she was reading whilst all the other girls her age were out having abortions. I’m not kidding. This holier than thou attitude permeated through each page, completely disengaging me and, frankly, making me hate her.

But for some reason I have a copy of it, so I read it to get it off my bookshelf, and now that I've read it I'm going to get it out of my house because it's terrible.Truss consistently confuses education for intelligence, all but saying the people who get this stuff wrong are stupid, and her tone is so patronizing and self-satisfied it makes me wonder who she thinks her audience is. Did she write this book to commiserate with other grammar snobs about how disgusting the uneducated are? Or did she think she was going to reach the people who genuinely wanted to learn about grammar, teaching them the error of their ways through her superior attitude and half-smothered laughter? Unlikely. So we're back to the idea that she just wants to laugh at them from the safety of a like-minded mob.And then, as if her abhorrent attitude weren't enough, in pursuit of her agenda of shaming everyone who has ever misused an apostrophe, one of her real-world examples includes the n-word, which is completely unacceptable. But apparently in Truss's world, hate speech is funny as long as it has an unnecessary apostrophe in it. Now, I like grammar. I intentionally took three classes on the subject. I wince whenever someone gets the wrong ""your"" somewhere. But I also know that grammar is something that has to be taught and has nothing to do with inherent intelligence—the differences between British and American grammar proves that easily enough. If grammar were an innate quality humans have, it would all be the same. But it's not! It's flexible. And situational. And cultural.

Thus people who don’t know their apostrophe from their elbow are positively invited to disseminate their writings to anyone on the planet stupid enough to double-click and scroll.”I think this comment is well-deserved.

No. That’s lazy and disrespectful to the reader. By the way: without a reader, an author is nothing (Gardner, M. Some Book I Wrote About Something). Here’s why we should care.

Part of me has always wondered if I use commas properly, not in the sense of making grievous meaning-altering errors, but whether I use them to their full potential for creating deliberate flow and intonation. Despite writing daily, in some form or another, I had never truly acted on this thought. I think this is easily explained. Punctuation holds a reputation as a necessary evil in our society. And the only thing more tedious than punctuation is the group of people who correct others on it. Examining the finer details of punctuation is therefore rarely a serious consideration. Anyway, I had no intention of reading the whole book, but after starting on the section on commas midway through it, I made my way to the end absentmindedly. Then I went to the introduction and read the first half. What I found most interesting were the discussions of cases where two options are grammatically correct (e.g. using parentheses instead of commas or hyphens, like in this instance), and the decision is purely for stylistic purposes. The author's command over the English language is sharp, as you would expect, which made for enjoyable reading. It was also amusing throughout.

All these conditions for reading are overturned by the new technologies. Information is presented to us in a non-linear way, through an exponential series of lateral associations. The internet is a public “space” which you visit, and even inhabit; its product is inherently impersonal and disembodied. Scrolling documents is the opposite of reading: your eyes remain static, while the material flows past. Despite all the opportunities to “interact”, we read material from the internet (or CD-roms, or whatever) entirely passively because all the interesting associative thinking has already been done on our behalf. Electronic media are intrinsically ephemeral, are open to perpetual revision, and work quite strenuously against any sort of historical perception.

The author talks about how the rules of punctuation has become more lax over the years, and later in the book she explains why we shouldn’t allow this to happen. I read this for a non-fiction book club, and I probably wouldn’t have picked this up on my own. I’d always enjoyed English, writing, reading, and grammar in school, so this book was right my alley. This sounds like it could be 200 pages of boring textbook writing, but honestly, I was surprised by how much humor was in the book, and even more pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this book. Even from the title, we can tell the author has a sense of humor and she continues that writing throughout the book. Yes, there were examples of all the different rules for punctuation marks, but I never did find this boring. I really enjoyed the chapters about the apostrophes, commas, and the ellipses, because I tend to use those…a lot… The other chapters were informative, but I preferred the first half of the book overall. I also loved how the author compared the punctuation marks to musical notation, so musicians know HOW to play the music…not just the black notes on the page. The book is broken into chapters, and each chapter address a specific punctuation mark. -Apostrophe -Comma-Colon -Semi-colon -Hyphen -Period-Explanation Point -Brackets and Ellipse Overall, I really enjoyed this book, but English was also one of my favorite school subjects growing up. I think anyone who teaches or does anything with reading and writing would enjoy the humor in this book. There was a part at the beginning of the book that stood out to me about talking about when and how to properly correct people about grammar, and how it can come off being rude. Personally, I don’t call people out about their grammar, or really anything that could potentially embarrass them--unless I need to defend someone. It would be interesting to see if correcting people on the spot would help our issues with grammar or not. I think it has a lot to do with texting and emailing that has made grammar rules more lax and people being afraid as coming off too angry or formal in an email, so they write like the would talk. I was told as a teacher that it’s hard to express emotion and personality in emails to students and parents, and to be careful when writing those types of correspondences because it could seem like I’m angry or short, so I think to accommodate for that, people are trying to make emails seem more personable when emailing and texting. (That’s just my opinion, and I notice that I do that as well.) I liked the book quite a bit and I’m glad it was a choice for book club. ",5,0.9958,0.048,0.793,0.159,0.535639880952381,POSITIVE,0.9779
56,131164832,11/17/2010,4.0,"Originally posted here.Stop me if you've heard this one before:A panda walks into a cafe. He orders a sandwich, eats it, then draws a gun and fires two shots in the air.  “Why?” asks the confused waiter, as the panda makes towards the exit. The panda produces a badly punctuated wildlife manual and tosses it over his shoulder.  “I'm a panda,” he says at the door. “Look it up.”  The waiter turns to the relevant entry and, sure enough, finds an explanation.  “Panda. Large black-and-white bear-like mammal, native to China. Eats, shoots and leaves.” This joke, which appears right at home as a filler on a page of Reader's Digest and hardly calls for a round of badum tish, has become a classic illustration of the importance of correct punctuation since the publication of the bestselling book that made it famous several years ago. The book in question is Lynne Truss's Eats, Shoots & Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation. “So, punctuation really does matter,” the book says, “even if it is only occasionally a matter of life and death.” I'm a self-styled grammar and punctuation stickler, but I'll be the first one to admit that the chances of a black-and-white, primarily herbivorous bear-like animal entering your business establishment or even your home, eating your burger and fries, firing gunshots in the air, then exiting as though what it just did was perfectly normal on account of an extraneous comma in a reference book that transformed a pairing of a simple present tense transitive verb (eats) and its noun-phrase direct compound object (shoots and leaves) into a series of simple present tense habitual verbs (eats, shoots and leaves) are practically nil. Translation: Don't panic. Unless pandas stop being complacent and go beyond cutely eating bamboo shoots and leaves and cutely sneezing to their mothers' surprise in YouTube videos by developing the advanced facility to read and the even more advanced ability to recognize ambiguities caused by grammatical faux pas, we don't have to worry about them taking our favorite food and endangering our precious lives. But I stand firm like the sarcasm-denoting temherte slaq (although I'm in no way being sarcastic) in supporting Truss's (yes, that's an apostrophe and an s) proposition that we pay attention every now and then if not ideally all the time to proper grammar and punctuation. I told you I'm a stickler.“Sticklers, unite!” is Truss's battlecry, and its reverberations are felt throughout the book. She is, of course, calling for grammatical sticklers like her to band together and counter the decline of punctuation, which may or may not be the decline of civilization itself. For those who don't know what a grammatical stickler is, Truss gives a pretty accurate definition:Grammatical sticklers are the worst people for finding common cause because it is in their nature (obviously) to pick holes in everyone, even their best friends. Honestly, what an annoying bunch of people.Indeed, Truss, not unlike her stickler friends (myself included), can be so annoying and ruthless as to say,To those who care about punctuation, a sentence such as ""Thank God its Friday"" (without the apostrophe) rouses feelings not only of despair but of violence. The confusion of the possessive ""its"" (no apostrophe) with the contractive ""it's"" (with apostrophe) is an unequivocal signal of illiteracy and sets off a simple Pavlovian ""kill"" response in the average stickler. Apparently, I'm no average stickler, or else I'd be guilty of multiple homicide. Thank God.With playful chapter titles like “That'll Do, Comma” and “Cutting a Dash,” Truss puts forth both a brief history of punctuation and a straightforward punctuation guide in Eats, Shoots & Leaves. She considers, not without humor and self-reference, the versatile apostrophe (which greengrocers tend to violate in their signs for “FRESH FRUIT AND VEGETABLE'S”), the ubiquitous comma (whose appearance has been likened by Nicholson Baker to “the pedals of grand pianos, mosquito larvae, paisleys, adult nostril openings, the spiralling decays of fundamental particles, the prows of gondolas”), the intoning question mark (of which Gertrude Stein was not a fan), and the snooty semicolon (which Donald Barthelme thought was “ugly, ugly as a tick on a dog's belly”), among other common punctuation marks. She also mentions the rise of the punctuation mark-based emoticon and, in the manner of Roger Ebert pointing the finger on the growing popularity of e-books for what he perceives as the present generation's underappreciation of The Great Gatsby and 10,000 Jokes, Toasts and Stories (It took me great restraint not to put an Oxford comma between Toasts and and.), says that the Internet—you know, that place with all the grammatically challenged but deadly cute feline creatures—and text messaging are partly responsible for the widespread mistreatment of the subtle art of punctuation.Truss is a prolific print and broadcast journalist hailing from England, and Eats, Shoots & Leaves is decidedly British, retaining its British English conventions in its American edition. But Truss, rather scathingly, makes sure to point out a few important differences between American and British English punctuation terms and rules, with which the very British Lord Voldemort himself agrees:You say ""parentheses"" while we say ""brackets""—but to people who call an apostrophe ""one of them floating comma things"" it doesn't matter very much. They are unlikely to spot that American usage interestingly places all terminal punctuation inside closing quotation marks, while British usage sometimes ""picks and chooses"". (Like that.) All the same, whether you're on this side of the Atlantic or that, whether you're inclined to write, “A woman, without her man, is nothing,” or “A woman: without her, man is nothing,” and whether you uphold the Oxford comma or not, there's something to like about and plenty to learn from Truss and her trigger-happy panda.

58,30114629,08/14/2008,3.0,"EVERYONE! I HAVE A QUESTION:When you read to yourself, that is, not aloud, do you hear the words in your head? Does the punctuation affect how you hear them? Does it change, as it were, your mental intonation, the cadences of your inner voice? Does it tell you when to pause, when not to pause, how long to pause, and when to stop completely? It does mine. And hence why I have never understood why people have trouble with of punctuation (Actually, this isn't quite true: I can understand to a large extent people having problems with apostrophes and even hyphens, and whether to use single or double quotation marks is something with which I grapple daily). But FULL STOPS, commas, ellipses, dashes, and even the dreaded semi-colon: what's the deal, world? Is it really that hard? Can't you just listen to the words in your head and just know which punctuation mark to use?But seriously, am I alone in this ability? I thought everyone could do it. But evidently not, I guess. Or alternatively, I am a snob who reads too much. Incidentally, I remember a time (back in year eight) when I didn't know how to use the semi-colon, but I seemed to develop the ability spontaneously. Why doesn't this happen to everyone? But anyway. Punctuational musings aside and on to the book.I had to re-rate this book from four stars to three. Somehow I didn't find it so funny the second time I read it. The humour seemed forced, and formulaic (I'm a proponent of the Oxford comma, in its place, by the way). Perhaps linguistics has spoiled me. One year of rabid left-wing hippy pot-smoking free-yonder-children-from-the-shackles-of-modern-education descriptivist linguistics lecturers has cured me (almost) completely of any lingering signs of prescriptivism (for all you who remain unconvinced, Stephen Fry and Language Hat will tell you why descriptivists have more fun).In any case, I've seen curses rained upon Lynne Truss for her 'smug', 'self-righteous' 'linguistic snobbism', but she's a sweetie at heart, I believe. For all her grouchy, unconvinced attempts to paint herself as a not-too-prescriptive-prescriptivist (if that isn't an oxymoron), she's clearly just a language lover (to hyphen or not to hyphen?) at heart. Observe:""... it is a matter for despair to see punctuation chucked out as worthless by people who don't know the difference between ""who's"" and ""whose"", and whose bloody automatic 'grammar checker' can't tell the difference either. [hear, hear! Fucking grammar checkers.:] And despair was the initial impetus for this book. I saw a sign for ""Book's"" with an apostrophe in it, and something deep inside me snapped; snapped with that melancholy sound you hear in Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard, like a far-off cable breaking in a mine-shaft [sic; I would have said mineshaft:]. I know that language moves on. It has to... But I can't help feeling that our punctuation system, which has served the written word with grace and ingenuity for centuries, must not be allowed to disappear without a fight.""And no, it's not just the Cherry Orchard reference that makes my heart go boompity-boomp. No matter how many linguistics lecturers I have, no matter how many blog posts written by celebrities advocating descriptivism I read, I will still understand, even if not share, Ms Truss's sentiments. It's the same feeling of sadness I feel when I contemplate the word 'awesome' and how it can never really encompass all that it used to. The same feeling of tragic loss I feel when I realise that the phrase 'the stuff of magic' is actually kind of funny these days. The same half-smothered regret that is inspired within my soul as I cast around desperately for a synonym for 'random' that doesn't make me sound like an idiotic teen.It's just nostalgia, pure and simple.",5,-0.9801,0.13,0.79,0.08,0.4589743589743589,NEGATIVE,0.9974
59,8936057,11/10/2007,4.0,"I had read about this book on the Internet; it was hailed as wildly funny and cleverly written. When I decided to look into it, I was surprised to find it was shelved with the nonfiction books. I figured such a humorous book would naturally have to be fiction. It was like when I found out The DaVinci Code actually was fiction. With all the talk on those early-morning shows about it and with people taking it so seriously, I honestly thought it was some guy’s research, not a novel.It was pretty darn funny in plenty of places. For example: ""The confusion of the possessive “its” (no apostrophe) with the contractive “it’s” (with apostrophe) is an unequivocal signal of illiteracy and sets off a simple Pavlovian “kill” response in the average stickler [one who adheres strictly to rules of punctuation]. The rule is: the word “it’s” (with apostrophe) stands for “it is” or “it has”. If the word does not stand for “it is” or “it has” then what you require is “its”. This is extremely easy to grasp. Getting your itses mixed up is the greatest solecism in the world of punctuation. No matter that you have a PhD and have read all of Henry James twice. If you still persist in writing “Good food at it’s best”, you deserve to be struck by lightning, hacked up on the spot and buried in an unmarked grave.""SO TRUE! Ha!Besides being an entertaining read, I learned quite a bit, too. I had forgotten about certain apostrophe rules and there is lots about the history of punctuation that I’d never thought about nor realized. Also, it was interesting to read from the British point of view. I also learned that, when it comes down to it, once you learn a few basic rules, punctuation becomes a matter of personal style. Sure, changing the punctuation can certainly change the meaning of something, but many people are doing quite all right grammatically. Okay. All that being said about the book, I couldn’t read more than a few chapters at a time, though it was very readable (despite its erudite tone). This is because the whole “zero tolerance” thing about bad punctuation would really start to irk me. Yes, I roll my eyes when I see 5 Buck Pizza advertising “all toppings ‘free’” as though they are quoting themselves. And I HATE when people think that “plural equals possessive” and just slap on an apostrophe whenever a word ends in “s.” But a lot of rules Truss harps on are, in my opinion, inconsequential. The Two Weeks Notice thing got a little out of hand, I thought, because it really was an obscure apostrophe rule — and I’d much rather people leave OUT apostrophes then throw them in when they’re not needed, wouldn’t you? Also, with all the talk she does of how punctuation has changed — even in the past century — to be a “stickler” in the age of the Internet is hardly worth getting into a fuss over (she does say “let’s not get into a fuss over this” at one point but then proceeds to get angry about emoticons. And I love emoticons! :-) )Also, this book seemed useful and entertaining to me because I think I have a pretty solid handle on most punctuation rules already. If you don’t know how not to use a comma “like a stupid person,” that “rule” (which is defined mostly by limited examples) is not going to be much help. A reference book this ain’t — go pick up a style guide instead.",5,0.9634,0.067,0.822,0.11,0.5207979024943311,POSITIVE,0.5544

From there, she gives amusing examples of how punctuation changes the meanings of sentences, which is where the title comes from. By then, you’ll be sold on her overall message: correct grammar is important. The concluding chapter reveals what probably prompted her to write the book: it’s a rant about the decline of grammar and especially punctuation in the Internet age. Mind you, the book was published in 2003, before texting was in vogue and before Twitter even existed. And now that I’ve mentioned Twitter, I want to share a cautionary tale. This book makes such a compelling case for good grammar, it prompted me to correct someone on Twitter. Note that I said, “someone,” as in one person. I did not appoint myself Grammar Cop of the Internet, though I was accused of it. I just thought a particular mistake was marring an otherwise important message, so I suggested its author edit the post. As I should have predicted, I caught flak for it. Errors in print literature are one thing, I was told, but on Twitter, where messages are usually punched in on phones with autocorrect, errors should be overlooked. So the moral of the story is that if you read this book and want to improve your own grammar and usage, the book will have accomplished its goal, but don’t try and correct other people.

Sorry!If punctuation is the stitching of language, language comes apart, obviously, and all the buttons fall off.This was an informative read. Lynne Truss approached the subject with humour and intelligence. She gave an example of how crucial the placement of the comma is by reiterating what Cecil Hartley pointed out in 1818:... consider the difference between the following: ""Verily, I say unto thee, This day thou shalt be with me in Paradise.""and: ""Verily I say unto thee this day, Thou shalt be with me in Paradise.""Now, huge doctrinal differences hang on the placing of this comma. The first version, which is how Protestants interpret the passage, lightly skips over the whole unpleasant business of Purgatory and takes the crucified thief straight to heaven with Our Lord. The second promises Paradise at some later date (to be confirmed, as it were) and leaves Purgatory nicely in the picture for the Catholics, who believe in it. Similarly, it is argued that the Authorised Version of the Bible (and by extension Handel's Messiah) misleads on the true interpretation... Again, consider the difference:""The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness: Prepare ye the way of the Lord.""and:""The voice of him that crieth: In the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord.""Also:""Comfort ye my people""(please go out and comfort my people)and""Comfort ye, my people""(just cheer up, you lot; it might never happen)I apologize for this lengthy review, but I really wanted to share all of that because it blew me away.

I couldn’t help myself; I was in the midst of reading the informative and extremely funny Eats, Shoots & Leaves by Lynne Truss. The subtitle, The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation, pretty much says it all. But the book, a runaway bestseller on two continents, can also be classified as humor. Not only is this a no-nonsense primer on the correct use of punctuation in the English language. It is also well supplied with laugh-out-loud remarks on the vagaries of usage both in the U.K. and the U.S. The comma, the apostrophe, the colon, and the dash—who knew they could be the subject of such joviality?I highly recommend this little book to all writers, to those who are curious about exactly when to use that comma, and to anyone who appreciates the value of correct grammar and punctuation and would like to witness their perpetuation.

113,3575523890,10/01/2020,4.0,"A book about punctuation. As if I needed any more proof that I’m a nerd. The joke that inspired the title is a conversation staple in our household, and we are suckers for a good punctuation, spelling or grammar joke. So this book fell into the right lap. It's an entertaining book, but every now and then I had the feeling that the jokester in Lynne Truss was trying too hard, to the point that the beginning pages became a difficult read. This is mainly a question of style: too many parentheses that repeatedly halt your thoughts (I dare you to open the book at random and not find one like this one); the fact that, sadly, she needs to explain her jokes just in case a punctuation simple soul doesn’t know why he should laugh; or crowded sentences that try to pack together information, sources, joke and explanation before the period finally saves you.But the book gets better, the style cleaner - or you get more accustomed to it - and it becomes clear why you need this on your desk as a reference book. I did learn a few new things, even if some were just explanations I craved for things that I had already been doing instinctively. Simpler ways to think about punctuation usage are always welcome. On a personal level, I’m happy I finally found someone that hates as much as I do the inexplicable confusion around the correct usage of the apostrophe when it comes to its and it’s. I can’t understand for the life of me why it’s so difficult to get it. Much like Lynne Truss, I confess that, no matter any other virtues they may be blessed with, I put the confused its/it’s-spellers in a category of their own. Somehow, that label gets stuck to their forehead, and I can hardly look them in the eye without having that apostrophe in my peripheral vision.For the first time in a lifetime of fruitless discussions on the subject, I finally find somebody that doesn’t go around flowing the “possessive” flag, but tells you simply, as I wish they told students in school: If there is something missing, replace it with an apostrophe. If there isn’t, don’t.I also learned some interesting facts. First, that the first punctuation hero was a Venetian printer from the 15th century, Aldus Manutius the Elder, (plus eponymous grandson) who brought us the semicolon, the italic typeface, the full stop at the end of a sentence, and did some cosmetic work on the virgule, so that it resembles the elegant comma we use nowadays. I also found out that there is such a thing as a Philosophy of Punctuation, even though this is just the title of an essay written by the American writer Paul Robinson in the blessed year 2002. Who knew? The fact that apparently there is also a psychology of punctuation (semicolons are all about expectation and reward, it seems) makes things even more interesting. The point about the psychology of punctuation is a good one, since it seems Gertrude Stein would not agree. If this book were a novel, Gertrude Stein would be the villain. Every now and then, when Lynne Truss starts discussing a new punctuation mark and declares herself in love with it, here jumps Gertrude Stein in the middle of the act, telling us she hates it. She has a visceral reaction to most punctuation marks, including the question one – whaaaat??!! I imagine that in an Eats, Shoots & Leaves fairy tale, Gertrude Stein is the wicked fairy who wishes bad things upon any punctuation mark that dares to be born and not be a period.I enjoyed the distinction Lynne Truss made between the descriptive and the prescriptive approach to punctuation, and the idea of following the rules, but allowing common sense and even personal taste to have their say. What also satisfied me greatly is her criticism of the “chaotic scriptio continua swamp” that is threatening to swallow us. While she clearly refers to e-mail practices, I preferred to think about some nonsensical “poems” that use this technique to make up for the lack of poetic value, and that banish all punctuation marks in the hope of achieving some level of artificial ""depth."" A funny touch is the addition of oversized punctuation stickers at the beginning and end of the book, which, I guess, are part of the weaponry Lynne Truss proposes for the punctuation stickler with a revolutionary instinct. Finally, one thing I really liked and one thing I really hated about the book. I’ll start with the bad. BAD. On page 90, Lynne Truss explains that comma should be used to set off interjections, then proceeds to give the following example:Stop, or I’ll scream.Just because this sounds like an emotionally charged statement probably delivered at high decibels doesn’t mean that “stop” is an interjection. “Stop” is a verb in the imperative mood. You can replace it with any other verbs in the imperative mood (“eat”, “sing”, “play”), and the syntactic structure remains the same. As for the comma, it's there because it separates two independent clauses (rule 2, page 87). The mistake is more glaring than an ambulance siren, and I’m amazed that this passed through what I imagine was a long series of edits without being caught. In her defense, on page 32, Lynne Truss warns her readers that she is not a grammarian and that, for her, subordinate clauses are just some sort of subservient elves (very funny). But this is no excuse to allow the evil of erroneous grammatical statements to slip into a book in which grammar is your auxiliary tool of argumentation. The example caused me to go through meltdowns and pains similar to what Lynne Truss experiences when her dear punctuation rules are butchered. So, if I’m wrong (which I’m not!), please someone prove it to me, because I’m going nuts.Now on to the good.GOOD. In the final chapter of the book, Lynne Truss makes an excellent point that should be heard by all punctuation minimalists. Punctuation is not just mere convention, but it’s a tool of expression. By using it wrong, something of what you have to say gets lost. Since punctuation activists are often seen as pedantic weirdos, it is nice to have someone that states otherwise. Punctuation makes speech clearer, emotion sharper and life richer. In other words, Lynne Truss finally told the world that I'm not a pretentious nutcase, but a lover of all things life. Above all, the book is obviously fueled by some serious punctuation passion. While some pages are going to give you a good laugh (especially the last chapter), Lynne Truss occasionally does what all love-stricken people do – she becomes lyrical - which feels great if you share her obsession. Not lastly, her image holding a huge apostrophe on a stick in front of a movie theatre to show that the movie title is gramatically incorrect is going to stay with me for a while.",2,0.9889,0.109,0.756,0.136,0.5647378193701723,NEGATIVE,0.9999
114,4361298655,11/28/2021,5.0,"If I got marooned on a desert island and had choose one non-fiction book to take with me, this would be it. I've read this book a number of times, and a there's a clue there as to why this is such a brilliant book: you do actually read it. It's superbly entertaining. It's funny. It makes you want to be a better person--not better writer (although obviously that too), but an actual better human being. I liken reading this book to meeting a headmistress of my acquaintance who would always greet me with polite gravitas and ask me, after a suitable pause, what I thought about the situation in Poland, or Belarus: wherever a situation was at that time. Perhaps, this being New Zealand, she didn't meet many people who had taught Peace Studies (the army loves its euphemisms) and thus asked my opinion on these things clearly troubling her. I always straightened my spine (and not metaphorically) and gave her considered and nuanced replies. She made me want to be better than my usual rather cynical and flippant self. And that is how this book affects me. If you read (and I assume you do or why are you here at all? On Goodreads and on this Earth both), or if you write (even shopping lists) then this is a book for you. It is quite simply brilliant. Truss manages to convey why punctuation is important rather than just telling you rules. She uses exquisite examples of where punctuation can let you down, destroy your message entirely and ultimately get you killed (true!). She manages to make this book so intimate, so personal, that I genuinely feel I must know her. We were both educated (and I use this word loosely) at English grammar schools in the 1970s. Neither of us clearly learnt much actual English or grammar, which still amuses me and infuriates me in equal measure when I recall those wasted years (I know someone who wants to call his memoirs of being in the army The Nine Wasted Years). We were given writing tasks such as: imagine you are inside a ping-pong ball and describe what it is like. Which is all very well, but when you can't spell, have no idea how to use even a comma let alone a semi-colon, your attempts to convey the horror of this experience (the nothingness, the void) might be very entertaining, but it's probably so badly executed technically to make it all but unreadable. Fortunately, none of my teachers seemed to know much more grammar or punctuation than I did, and I even bluffed my way through a degree in English, still not really getting it. Lynne Truss has clearly not suffered much from the English 'free-love' approach to language (perhaps we are so bad at learning other languages we don't want to offend any foreigners by being able to write our own either), and has a produced this literal masterpiece of writing. If you're hesitating over whether you'd enjoy a book about punctuation, trust me and give this book a go. I suspect you are a lover of language; you like words; you love finding out that you are not alone having secret pleasures like a well-placed colon. Perhaps you rail (as does the author) at signs in shops missing apostrophes, but can't admit this to family in case the old 'grammar Nazi' accusation gets thrown at you. If any of this is you, get and read this book. You will absolutely love it. One of those books that Goodreads needs to have a 5-star plus rating for. (And if any of my fans wonder why I'm re-reading a book on punctuation...yes! Book 9 of the More Heat That the Sun series is finished and is just about to go off to my editor.

She strikes a good balance between a prescriptive and descriptive approach, revealing a good awareness of the historical changes in this aspect of language that make it hard to maintain a pure prescriptivism.

Yes, the main punctuation rules are explained, but that is embedded in a pleasant cushioning of wit, anecdotes, strange history, and what may be described as gushing over language. As such it is a very pleasant read with plenty of insights and many little hooks to entice our memories to retain the drier information.Reading this has made me aware that I am not, apparently, the sort of stickler for punctuation described by Truss - though that should not lead anyone to the erroneous conclusion no stickler rears its head when I pick up a pen to mark essays.PS: I hope no punctuation errors have slipped into this review.

The point is, I understand where Lynne is coming from, even if it's almost totally and completely different. I'm ok with that. We all are peevish about some small thing that seems huge and important to us...erm. Yes, well, punctuation. She DOES make a strong case for its importance, especially in law - by altering the placement of a comma, things can read very differently. I thought this was entertaining and fun - most especially the examples, the preponderance of references to ""Opal Fruits"" and the conversation between Sophia and Lord Fellamar (which begins on p. 151, if you're interested).

It's better that way, really. You'll love it.""I guess they forgot that the point of the book isn't to tell hilarious anecdotes about pandas, but to teach those poor souls who can't place a comma how to do so. Not changing the book for North America is like releasing ""The Zero Tolerance Approach to Medical Care"" by taking a veterinary textbook and adding an introduction that says, ""Okay, so not everything in this book will be right for people, but, you know, whatever.""As an American reader and editor, reading a book this smug and self-important about punctuation that is (to my culture) constantly wrong gets infuriating after, well, twenty-five pages. On page 23 she complains about how nobody uses capital letters on the ""internet."" AP style considers Internet to be a proper noun and, thus, capitalized. There may be hard and fast rules about where to use something like a question mark or a semicolon, but if you're going to throw down the gauntlet on matters of style, there's almost certainly a respected style guide out there that thinks you're a dumbass.By the time I got to page 25 and she was complaining about how people would be likely to incorrectly write the time ""seven-thirty"" as ""7:30"" because, ""their American software uses a colon for 7:30,"" I was done.

We, who live in a world of “Netspeak” and emoticons (both excuses for not putting the right words in the right places), do we think the age of the appropriately placed semicolon, dash or parenthesis is dead? I personally murder the semicolon on a daily basis it seems. I tire of pursing my lips in thought at the end of every sentence I write (or send as it were), wondering if I should use that uppity mixture of comma and full stop, or slice off its bottom (and more lovely) half, until I start drooling uncontrollably and mumble gibberish to myself. Who really cares after all? Ah, and see ¬– therein lies the problem: someone always cares. With the advent of the internet and millions of us fancying ourselves “writers” when really we are “senders”, there are – for the good of those with stock in the makers of red and blue pens; I’d hate for them to suffer – some still left in the world, hiding in corners waiting to pounce on the first ill-used word; shouting with their fists in the air, “Sticklers unite!” Lynne Truss is one of those standing in the picket lines, with her blue pencil in hand of course, editing everyone’s protest signs and encouraging all to read her book, Eats, Shoots & Leaves, a book about a misplaced comma and a panda with a gun....ahem. Truss is a woman on a mission; a personal journey that nimbly gyrates from the grocer, and the newspaper; to the sign on the road, and the Hollywood marquee. This woman is extremely anal, perhaps bordering on obsessive- compulsive, but I don’t think she cares. For her punctuation marks are the traffic signals of language: they tell us to slow down, notice this, take a detour, and stop. But did I learn something, which after all, is probably her point, regardless of her nit pickiness. I would say, yes I did. Mainly, it was this: in a lot of cases, it’s a matter of personal taste. If it burns deep within your chest to place a semicolon after a sentence, then by all means – do it! Want to put a comma after the word and? Apparently it depends on what country you’re from. What?

She helps us to understand that commas, apostrophes, colons and the other denizens of our pantheon of punctuation marks are aids and signs on a road map for communication without misunderstanding. They are an invaluable assistance to reading out loud with the proper interpretation, lilt and intonation that an author intended in the same fashion as a well annotated musical score enables a musician to interpret music as a composer meant it to be played.Eats, Shoots and Leaves also provides us with snippets of the history of punctuation. I wager that few of us were aware that the apostrophe first appeared as early as the 16th century.If history and a pedantic rant delivered with a school marm attitude, a baleful glare and a wrathful wagging finger were all we got from a reading of Eats, Shoots and Leaves, I'm sure most of us would have yawned in complete boredom and Lynn Truss's novel would not likely have reached the list of best sellers. But, thankfully, Eats, Shoots and Leaves is also liberally sprinkled with a very healthy dose of dry as dust British wit, humour and sarcasm that hit my funny bone with a full-sized mallet.

Some of her references to apostrophe errors seemed to fall into the area of non-Anglican names, where apostrophes are used to separate vowels that are separated when pronounced. Her diatribe also seemed to have little consideration for style, merely for rules of usage. I did enjoy the level of research in this book--to learn, for example, who invented italic script and semi-colons, and to get some sense of the evolution of punctuation--but the pro-stickler cheerleading seemed to be missing the point of punctuation altogether. Fortunately, the later chapters improve in their consideration of style and are a little less hung-up on rules. Perhaps the hardcore stickler attitude was something infused to put some gimmick to the book--after all, the book was a phenomenal success.

I'm sure she thinks she's being utterly hilarious when discussing standing in front of a billboard for a film looking aghast at an incorrectly punctuated title and I'm sure she imagines us in fits of hysterics at the idea of her standing outside a cinema with a sign displaying the missing apostrophe. Lynne, we're not laughing, really we're not. You are not funny and your faux fury regarding incorrect grammar is pathetic. The book is hopelessly padded out with examples of poor grammar without ever explaining in simple terms how to use the grammar correctly. If her aim was to teach people how to use grammar perhaps a bit more of the book should have focused on that aspect rather than snide bitching about imaginary friends (imaginary as she clearly has none).

149,85363992,01/16/2010,5.0,"Lynne Truss is, perhaps, a little nuts about punctuation, but she has a point and she knows how to use it. Eats, Shoots and Leaves is a very useful and very funny little book that discusses and illuminates punctuation in a manner that all but ensures you’ll know how to use it. Truss strongly believes that “[p:]roper punctuation is the sign and the cause of clear thinking” (202) and she argues her case very well. Using gorgeous little metaphors and images, historical origins, and a generous dose of humour (including hilarious errors), Truss makes clear the functions and importance of various types of punctuation. Not only does she explain the rules (where they exist), but she gives you a feel for language that deepens understanding.Particularly amusing are the ‘raging’ debates that have occurred over such things as the frequency of comma use or whether or not one should use a semi-colon. Any editor or proofreader will be able to recall similar disputes (with fondness, frustration, sadness, anger, hilarity, etc., etc.). “If there’s one thing to be learned from this book,” Truss says, “it is that there is never a dull moment in the world of punctuation” (125). Heated debates on apostrophe use aside, I’m not sure if that’s true, but I can say that at least there’s never a dull moment in this book. Highly recommended to everyone.Read more reviews on my blog Violin in a Void",2,0.9916,0.08,0.702,0.218,0.5539957264957265,POSITIVE,0.9998

The first version, which is how Protestants interpret the passage (Luke, xxiii, 43), lightly skips over the whole unpleasant business of Purgatory and takes the crucified thief straight to heaven with Our Lord.

152,62594105,07/08/2009,3.0,"In general, I share Samuel Johnson's opinion about language, including punctuation, namely that its value is in the life of the language not in the form. This book cogently argues that the form has a logical basis for existing the way that it does, but notwithstanding, a Johnson of today would still not have made a proscriptive book taking potshots at ""sloppy"" texting punctuation, or about the fact that ""texting"" isn't a word but would instead have described the new ways that punctuation is being used, or not being used, and would have put the word ""gr8"" in his dictionary. As long as communication is occurring, language is being used well enough. Punctuation does tend to add clarity, the author is right about that. But the ability to add clarity is not a good enough criterion for a word or convention to stay in a language. If you don't believe me, go ask whither and thither, two useful words who haven't been with us of centuries now because we started to use the less precise where and there in their place. (The word whither means ""from where"" and the word thither means ""towards there"", a useful, specific distinction that we just discarded as not useful enough.)Someone back then no doubt wrote a pamphlet about how horrible it was that people weren't using whither and thither any more.

My interpretation is more of the former. She may be a purist, but she also pokes fun at how much of a stickler she is being, and she acknowledges that many of the finer points of punctuation are judgement calls, as evinced by the stories she relates of conflicts between editors and famous authors over the placement (or not) of commas and semi-colons.

199,2963274150,11/09/2019,5.0,"Oh, the marvelous uses of commas and exclamation marks! My fellow semicolon savior and grammatophile Lynne Truss, author of the “Runaway #1 British Bestseller,” Eats Shoots & Leaves, and no doubt ones of others, would agree. So why do we need another book espousing the glories of grammar?We are reportedly more literate than ever, reading almost constantly the words on our ubiquitous devices. Nevertheless, grammar misdeeds are on the rise. I know I am not the only one to surmise that the decreasing ability to punctuate properly seems to be directly proportional to our increasing use of screens and social media (as are other once-beloved skills such as deep and meaningful conversation; dancing; going outside; and reading books about punctuation). Yes, though the digital era could be considered an enemy to symbols of syntax, thus leading to linguistic chaos and possibly World War III; there is yet hope. A select few who have noticed (and care) are here to help stem the tide of punctuation Armageddon before it is too late. Thus enters Lynne’s delightfully supercilious tome to the rescue.Certainly, we all, like characters in The Sixth Sense, see examples of grammatical death everywhere. There is, however, a continuum of solecism sensitivity. While many of us might notice apostrophic angst like, “Thank God its Friday,” and nonchalantly let it pass; only a select few feel painfully, like the eponymous heroine of The Princess and the Pea, a grocery store sign promising “Potatoe’s on sale,” or a billboard advertisement of a movie called “Two Weeks Notice,” with the resultant raised-fist reaction of a revolutionary before a despot’s balcony.If you have ever daydreamt of sneaking a ladder under a shop’s signboard to pluck out a superfluous vowel or apostrophe, this book will be a friend to the friendless. If you haven’t experienced such a compulsion, you may find this book gently humorous, sometimes enlightening, and possibly exasperating. You might wonder, “Who are these crazy punctuation people? Don’t they know we won’t need all these squiggly lines and dots in our fantastic new digital age?”*Don’t be so sure.Lynne makes a compelling case that, while grammar has evolved and will continue to do so, we can’t seem to be rid of it completely. Who knows? Word nerds might possibly save the world. Be prepared, I say. Mastering the rules in this book should not only be a requirement for linguistic studies, but also a prepper-sustainable-living-World-War-Z strategy. Hey, at the very least, reading Truss’ manifesto will entertain; but it also has the potential to clarify miscommunications, save mankind from zombie apocalypse, and even prevent pregnancy at all manner of outdoor festivals.My reading yielded such treasures as solecism (which means grammatical mistake); the dissection of double possessives; the relatively new emergence and necessity of grammar; the Latin sicut, meaning “just as”; and much more. Especially intriguing to me were the differences between British and American English. Who knew people around the world were putting sentence endings outside the closing quotation marks? I continue to be amazed at the beauty and nuance of our language.“Perspicuity and beauty of composition are not to be sneezed at in this rotten world.”—L. Truss*Wouldn't it be ironically difficult to state these sentiments without the squiggly lines and dots?",0,0.9884,0.047,0.827,0.126,0.5000818181818182,POSITIVE,0.5896
200,2663130244,09/08/2020,4.0,"A witty little book on the origins and evolution of punctuation, and where it may be headed. I do appreciate good writing, spelling, and punctuation, and I can't understand those who don't know the difference between it's and its. But I don't think I would have considered reading a book about it. I only read Eats, Shoots and Leaves based on a co-worker's recommendation, so I knew going into it that it was intended to be equally humorous and informative.This was surprisingly entertaining for a book on punctuation, with many snarky comments and references, examples from literature of good and bad punctuation, and sample sentences to illustrate usage. I'm sure I didn't fully grasp some of the jokes and literary references, but I still found them funny and illustrative. I actually learned a thing or two to reinforce my own correct usage, particularly for semicolons, which are dying out. (I don't think I was ever properly instructed in the first place, so I avoided them like everyone else, but now I know better.)The author is well-known in England for her adamant views on punctuation, especially in journalism, advertisements, and signage. She does not attempt to hide her disdain for the more recent re-purposing of punctuation symbols into emoticons to show meaning, rather than using them the proper way and succeeding with actual written words to convey meaning. I have to admit that while I agree with her, I still find emoticons (or emojis, as they are now called) rather useful in informal messages with friends where it's more amusing to illustrate the emotion I intend the recipient to associate with my words. I can see points for both sides of this argument, as long as they remain in their respective places.It was interesting to learn where the punctuation symbols originated from, how their uses have changed, and how they are still necessary, even essential, to modern-day writing for clarity and function. I often found myself nodding vigorously in agreement of the author's arguments and examples and poking fun at those who just can't seem to grasp punctuation. I also appreciated that she emphasized the continual evolution of language and punctuation; even though many grammarians mourn the loss of coherent writing today, it is normal for it to develop and change with the times. We just hope that the world won't entirely lose its ability to write and punctuate appropriately in order to make their voice and meaning clear to the reader.

The world is alive again and things are happening; I can spend time with many different beloved people once more; I can even drink in a pub again if I want to.So I finally finished Lynne Truss' book. I won't say that there weren't moments that I didn't enjoy, because there were. In fact, it is on the whole fairly entertaining even if I believe it tries far too hard to be so for a large portion of the book. It did even make me laugh out loud a few times (though I think I comparably cringed at roughly the same number of instances).A quick aside here to mention the vomit-inducing introduction from Frank McCourt. My god Frank, just ask her out! Let's not put on airs here - we don't really think that punctuation is sexy...  do we?What is unavoidable in this book as the masturbation over punctuation. Don't get me wrong, I think highly of punctuation and understanding it, and I certainly abuse the semi-colon. I also misuse punctuation all the time; I probably have in this very review. That's one of the interesting things about it, and something that I'm glad Truss doesn't shy away from. Punctuation is to be utilised by the author as they see fit. It is a tool, not necessarily an implicit rule. Understanding how we would define the rules behind punctuation allows us to break those rules to our own effect and wont; the same way an artist can break the rules of colour or composition once they know how they should be used. So much time is dedicated to wanking off correct punctuation and scolding those who misuse it purely from their own ignorance, that it comes off as less bashful and more puritanical for a lot of the book.It's an interesting read on the formula of our squiggles and dots with a number of humorous stories about authors and writers throughout history. It's certainly not the ultimate guide to punctuation (god forbid what that would look like) and it comes across a bit ass-y sometimes but it is not un-enjoyable and I found it a refreshing update on my own use of written language - like the revelation that my infinite use of the dash comes from texting... woops!",0,0.9419,0.029,0.878,0.093,0.5926613756613757,NEGATIVE,0.9935
202,4112551624,07/14/2021,,"I cannot rate this book. Here's why: Back when it was all the rage, I was in my bookstore a one-woman furious backlash of not just the bestseller variety but the personal.This was in part due to Lynne Truss being a self-professed stickler for punctuation but dismissive about grammar. I rapidly and enthusiastically took the side of some language types who were opposed to her and never looked back. Recently, the book came up and I began to feel guilty about having read only a small part of the book back when I decided to hate it; I wondered if I should give her a fuller chance, not to mention apologize for bad-mouthing her (insulting doesn't seem strictly necessary regardless of my feelings about the book). The reason I can't rate it now that I've blazed through it isn't unresolved guilt, nor that it neither sucks nor is brilliant (that's true, though). I can't rate it because it feels like any positive rating of it is taken as either total simpatico OR delighted shock at how fucking cool and interesting punctuation is. But I already knew how fucking cool and interesting punctuation is. It would be like if Indigo Girls suddenly hit the big time with like a TikTok video starring the Obamas playing Monday Night Football or something. Imagine such a wide swath of people suddenly wondering if I have heard of this great new band? I would die.But I'm not in the throes of ecstatic simpatico either. The book is just -- fine. Some quips are particularly funny, and the self-referential and self-deprecating recurring references (Elton John, Opal Fruits, etc.) in example sentences are fantastic. Frankly, she is probably not hard enough on sloppy writers for my liking. Anyway, it's a quick read. Also, she notes that ""by tragic historical coincidence a period of abysmal undereducating in literacy has coincided with this unexpected explosion of global self-publishing. The people who don't know their apostrophe from their elbow are positively invited to disseminate their writings to anyone on the planet stupid enough to double click and scroll.""

It's a long-winded absolution for anyone who's ever felt guilty about judging others for absent apostrophes, and it's a rallying cry for everyone who believes that punctuation is the under-appreciated glue of the English language. I love English. I teach English. As I read this book, I felt like I was sharing a pint or five with the author. I could picture us in a pub -- gesticulating more wildly as the night wore on, both of us fired up and ready to join some English Language Army by the end of it. So many feelings were vindicated. At the same time, it was a bit draining. Yeah, erroneous commas do make me gnash my teeth, but I don't need eight thousand examples. After the eighth, the point is a bit moot.

Each piece of punctuation gets its own little chapter, and she briefly outlines the rules in between finding new similes to express her wrath for our world's ignorance. Even though you signed up for it, she does manage to feel like that aunt at Thanksgiving who's so wildly passionate about a great cause that you almost want to drown her in stuffing. It's not that you don't care about the dolphins too, but dear god, you've already donated. There's only so much to be said. This is not a book to own, I'll say that.

204,52333492,04/11/2009,,"A few years ago, on a website far, far away, I offered the following advice with regards to punctuation: ""Make it up as you go along - I do. After all: nobody knows what a semi-colon is used for anyway; so... just throw in anything that looks pretty, ok?""I wasn't joking. I'm from the generation(s) who weren't taught grammar or punctuation in school. At least, not in English anyway. Our German teacher once started a lesson with the words: ""Today we are going to learn about the dative case in German. You all know what the dative case is, don't you?"" Erm...no, miss, never heard of it. She was somewhat put out. Actually it might have been the accusative case, but who cares?Well, Lynn Truss probably would. In fact she had a similar experience herself because, even though she attended a grammar school a decade before I went to a bog-standard comprehensive, she wasn't taught punctuation or grammar either - except in Latin, French and German lessons. And yet she has become a stickler for punctuation.Although, as she admits: ""It's tough being a stickler for punctuation these days. One almost dare not get up in the mornings."" Shopping must be a bit of a drag as well, as she refuses to use the 'eight items or less' checkouts because it should be 'fewer' not 'less'. ! I daresay she is as disappointed as I am that John Humphreys doesn't use the phrase: ""the contestant with the fewer, or fewest, passes"" on Mastermind, as Magnus Magnusson always did.What really gets my goat is when people misspell a word and then put ""(sp?)"" after it. What they seem to be saying is: ""I don't know how to spell that last word, but I want you to know that I know that I don't know, just so you know that I'm not completely stupid. Although, obviously, I am far too lazy to look it up or even use a spell-checker. In other words: I don't mind if you think I'm lazy, as long as you don't think I'm so ignorant I don't know how ignorant I am, because I do...I just can't be bothered to do anything about it."" Peeple lik vat r idull ninkempoups (sp?).It's a sign of the dumbed-down tabloidized-times that no-one is embarrassed at being seen to be ignorant and lazy, just so long as you don't think they are effing stoopid. Kingsley Amis would call them berks. According to him: ""the world of grammar is divided into 'berks and wankers' - berks being those who are outrageously slipshod about language, and wankers those who are (in our view) abhorrently over-precise.""I guess I'm on the wanky side of that scale: I think punctuation should be about making things more convenient for the reader rather than the writer; but, like language itself, punctuation is bound to evolve over time. One change mentioned in this book is ""the tendency of 'trendy publishers' to replace quotation marks with colons and dashes"" - but that's fine by me: it can make passages of conversation easier on the eye, whereas quotation marks can look as fussy and old-fashioned as Grandma's antimacassars. But I digress...Lynn Truss is a very witty writer and, while her desire for better punctuation is obviously heartfelt, her tongue is firmly in her cheek as well: ""Why did the Apostrophe Protection Society not have a militant wing? Could I start one?"" she quips at one point. Hence this book is as entertaining as it is enlightening - more so perhaps, which is why it doesn't really work as a reference book (so if that's what you're after you might want to look elsewhere).Also its diddy size is a drawback at times as it makes for a pot-entially confusing lay-out because of the ex-tra hyphens which are required by the narrow width of the page.Sometimes I was left almost more confused - like the grammar in this sentence is? For example, my last English teacher insisted that ""however"" should always be put at the beginning of a sentence and followed by a comma. I was sceptical about this, however. And now Lynn Truss tells me this:""Linking words such as ""however"", ""nevertheless"", ""also"", ""consequently"" and ""hence"" require a semicolon - and, I have to say, this seems pretty self-evident to me.""Why a semi-colon? It's not pretty self-evident to me, however. Er, I mean: It's not pretty self-evident to me; however. Ugh no! I mean: However; It's not pretty self-evident to me. No, that doesn't look right either. Consequently(;-?) I'm going to ignore this advice just as soon as I've ended this sentence; I'm sure it's good advice, er, nevertheless.Punctuation-wise I'm more of an Alex Higgins than a Ronnie O'Sullivan: I get in some terrible tangles and have to rely on spectacular potting to recover. I hoped that this book would improve my positional play; and, you never know, maybe after a few more reads it will; but I had to read some examples a couple of times to understand exactly what she meant. For example, I'm still not entirely sure how ""slow moving traffic"" (as opposed to ""slow-moving traffic"") could be mis-interpreted. Pickfords' vans travelling at 20mph? Drivers weeping openly to sad music on their car stereos?""Eats, Shoots & Leaves is not a book about grammar."", she says, ""I am not a grammarian. To me a subordinate clause will for ever be (since I heard the actor Martin Jarvis describe it thus) one of Santa's little helpers.""It is a bit though. Although perhaps not enough to sort me out. Sometimes I am beset by chronic indecision as to what's right and what's wrong or whether it matters.And I'm now using far too many semi-colons.And now I'm using far too many semi-colons.And I'm using far too many semi-colons now.[Oh dear. Please delete as applicable.:]So there are things not covered in the book which I would like to have explained to me. Whether I was wrong to use 'which' in the last sentence rather than 'that', for example; but you can't have everything - where would you put it all?Dear Lynn,Is it ""that"" or ""which"" and when and why? Why does ""will not"" become ""won't""? Who decides on the why's and wherefores? Or should that be the why's and wherefore's? And why? Or wherefore?And is there a difference between: ""it's not"" and ""it isn't"" - or not?Does anyone really know for sure?Yours bewildered,Phillip.P.S.

205,2606903522,11/26/2018,4.0,"There will be missing, misplaced or just crazy punctuation all through this review. Don't blame me, Grammar Nazis, internet has give me a voice. Or forum. Or something. It's weird that Lynne Truss would bemoan the lack of punctuation in emails and other spaces on the internet and not mention a Grammar Nazi. Really, those are your sticklers, whom the internet has also given a voice to call random strangers idiots, illiterate, and illiterate idiots for mixing up its and it's. They probably wouldn't have done so in a face to face communication. So, it goes both ways. But anyway, I've been eyeing this book since its release. I've never read it, though I believe I have a copy back in India. It's amusing, laugh out loud whenever it refers to Martin Amis, whom I find a source of amusement (the author, not his work. I'm weird). I was born in India, with all it's British influence especially when it came to English usage. But I worked and live in the US, and now my punctuation is barely coherent. I do it when it pleases me, when I remember. But I suppose I should teach my son how to use a comma, a period, a semicolon. He's a child fully of the internet era, and at 5 already knows the exclamation point. This isn't a functional grammar book - for that I needed an exercise book with questions about sentence parsing and Santa's extended family.

206,2977852850,09/15/2019,4.0," A satisfying and informative introduction to the world of English grammar and punctuation.I'm ashamed to admit it, but I am a thirty- two- year- old woman with little understanding of English grammar. I'd bluffed my way through school and university telling myself and others, "" I've got the general message across, who cares about a misplaced punctuation mark here and there?"" The truth is, I cared. I found apostrophes abhorrent, tautologies terrifying, hyphens horrific and correct comma placement had me comatose. I thought this book might be the answer- I was wrong and right. Excited and eager to learn, I flew through the opening pages of Lynne Truss's ‘Eats, Shoots & Leaves'. It didn't take long, however, to become utterly disheartened. This disheartening is the direct result of the author's confessed sticklerism and snobbery. Some of her insinuations about people who have not grasped the particulars of punctuation, are quite frankly, rude and mean. I mentally deducted a star from my review and reluctantly continued; I am so glad that I did!!! Conversational in style, witty and cheeky; Lynne's book is full of interesting facts and anecdotes that WILL assist you in remembering the purpose of these little marks and why they are essential. There are some great stories and embarrassing faux-pas to keep the reader entertained right until the end. For anyone wanting a refresher or a beginner crash-course, I'd recommend this book- just swallow your pride and put-up with feeling like a simpleton for the first little-while.",0,0.3448,0.15,0.681,0.168,0.5765093537414966,NEGATIVE,0.9987
207,3140677362,04/29/2020,4.0,"When someone recommends a book there is a lot going on. There is something being said about the book of course but also about the 'recommender' and the 'recommendee'. Let’s assume the book has merit (#1 British bestseller) and the 'recommender' possesses a thoughtful and generous nature (To lend a book is after all an act of trust and regard). But what does a book in defense of proper punctuation have to say about the recipient? Maybe I’m overdue for a session on a couch in Vienna but my super-ego with a flourish pulled the word Nerd out of it’s hat.I have always been more comfortable with the term ‘Renaissance Man.’ However, my wife, upon discovering that I have my nose in a book about anthropology or in this case punctuation, will smile tenderly if not a trifle sympathetically and say lovingly, “You’re such a Nerd.”To make matters worse, as I read, I became increasingly aware of my own illiteracy and added to that, the reading itself was hard work! Obvious examples of punctuation errors often weren’t very obvious at all to me. The author did her best to soften the blow by presenting her case for ‘zero tolerance’ with dry British-humor: succeeding for the most part. The reader is assumed to belong to the ‘Us’ contingent, those who are civilized enough to appreciate the necessity of disciplining our thoughts and writing to proper punctuation. Opposed are the unwashed rabble of ‘Them’, who, comfortable in their ignorance, use it’s, its’ and its with blissful impunity. Did you know there are 17 uses for the comma? What an interrobang is? That there is such a thing as a ‘non-case-sensitive compound noun’? The verdict is clear, I am a Grammarian Barbarian!I am not holding the book or its author responsible. I learned a great deal about punctuation that will be of help and I had more than a few chuckles along the way. My greatest takeaway was how punctuation is essential in clarifying the meaning of the written word. Its main function is to create the inflections and rhythms of spoken language so that both complex thoughts and simpler commands or questions can be understood by the reader. I would recommend it for both Nerds and Barbarians alike.",0,0.9978,0.043,0.738,0.219,0.5033854166666667,NEGATIVE,0.9979

I decided therefore I should, perhaps, read a book about it to improve my use of it. Looking through various options, I settled for Lynne Truss’s (I learned this is the correct usage from the book by the way, ha!) Eats, Shoots & Leaves as it seemed not only informative, but also rather fun! I was right, this is probably the most fun you’ll have reading about punctuation. Truss covers all the basics; (now I’ve gone and used a semicolon too) she gives clear, simple explanations without going into extensive linguistic jargon and uses examples and amusing anecdotes to drive her point home. I agreed with the writer on some points, while on others – which were more a question of taste than punctuation accuracy – I agreed to disagree. With the book originally written in 2003, when the digital age was just starting to truly emerge, I wonder what Truss makes of it now. I think I’ll try to find some more recent articles of hers to see what she says. I did learn a few new things from the book (see above), but I’m not sure I’ve elucidated my punctuation issues which are mostly comma-related. I feel like I might have to look to a more tedious in-depth linguistic book to find out those 17 obscure uses of the comma. ",0,0.9764,0.029,0.847,0.123,0.4315910427021537,POSITIVE,0.9038

This would be fine if it was a comedy, or a satire of some sort but no. It’s a book fully about (British) English punctuation. My dad gave it to me for Christmas one year, but I only got around to reading it at the end of 2019 because I needed short books to complete my reading challenge. This was a light read that actually revealed that a dormant grammar monster lives within me. The author was ridiculously dramatic about her feelings towards grammar but I... kind of related? Apparently, my high school trained me to be very sensitive when it comes to grammar because even the author, a self-proclaimed grammar stickler, was lenient about some things I had strong opinions about. I don’t care; to make a pronoun that ends with “s” a possessive, you only add an apostrophe. Adding an apostrophe AND another “s” is unacceptable. Anyway, I love how this book made something that’s so dry and boring actually quite amusing. The only reason I dock it a star has to do with the fact (notice I didn’t write “the reason is because...” — I can still hear my English high school teacher’s voice telling me that’s redundant) that sometimes the author was a little full of herself. Here’s a grand little paraphrased quote: “while other teenage girls spent their time getting abortions, I was fixating grammar rules and watching game shows.” Wow. You can be as dramatic as you want to be, but that’s just insensitive and unkind. I’m guessing even when this book came out in the early 2000s that abortions weren’t something to joke about, especially like this. But maybe it’s some cultural difference between senses of humor across the pond, and as an American, I can’t appreciate it. I don’t know. There were a couple of other examples of insensitivity that made me question whether a joke can, perhaps, go too far in a book about grammar — nay, especially in a book about grammar of all bloody things.

Seriously, this is a great book for anyone who's interested in written communication, either writing or reading, since it focuses on punctuation, be it punctuation violations (some quite funny) or punctuation rules. The author is British, and while there are many commonalities between British English and American English, she is biased toward the Brits' usage - and that's OK. She devotes a chapter or section to each major punctuation symbol, including commas, colons, semicolons, periods, question marks, quotes, apostrophes, hyphens, exclamation points, and dashes, with very thorough rules for the proper use of each and some humorous examples of their misuse. The one thing I'm surprised about is the book's popularity. Evidently it's a huge seller in Britain, probably because it's used as outside reading in many composition courses, as a friendly, genial guide to what could be a tedious subject.

Truss's writing is very tongue-in-cheek, which makes this grammar book very entertaining to read. She goes on many tirades and rants about the current state of punctuation; some of which are entertaining, whilst others just miss the mark. I enjoyed her quick deliverance of the many grammar rules, but I thought some of the more abstract rules could have used more elaboration (such as in the case of quotation marks). Besides that, I felt the author didn't really take second-language practitioners of English into account. She holds every speaker to a certain standard, berating those who do not meet that standard, which just isn't feasible when not every English-speaker is a native of that language.

Peppered with her own humor, well-known authors' comments and tirades, she explains what has changed, what has disappeared from use, who cares about these things, and why we should preserve punctuation to ensure accurate, meaningful communication.

Three in succession are from p20: ""The reason to stand up for punctuation is that without it there is no reliable way of communicating meaning. Punctuation herds words together, keeps others apart. Punctuation directs you how to read, in the way musical notation directs a musician how to play.""I would have written it as follows:""The reason to stand up for punctuation is that without it, there is no reliable way of communicating meaning. Punctuation herds words together - keeps others apart. Punctuation directs you how to read in the way musical notation directs a musician how to play.""The comma difference is due to the order of the dependent and independent clauses. The dash in place of the comma is because the second thought seems to me to interrupt the first as if it were a full stop. However, a period cannot be used, because the second clause lacks a subject and so can't be written as a complete sentence. This rule is noted at the end of her book, so she's aware of it. However, she later sums up her position on subordinate clauses as ""Santa's little helpers."" Okay. I am still thrilled to have the apostrophe problem attacked. Also, bless her a million times over for fuming over the it's/its problem!!!!! I did not know that an apostrophe was meant to be used to denote plurals of words (""and's"" ""but's""), and though my instinct cries out completely against it, I will have to accept it, as I am in the wrong. Truss would have loved Dave Barry's ""Dear Mr. Language Person"" rule about apostrophes: http://www.miamiherald.com/living/liv... and anyone bothering to read a review of this book would love it too, so I've included it.The Evelyn Waugh quote on p30 is fantastic! ""Everyone has always regarded any usage but his own as either barbarous or pedantic."" Well said...and I believe I just illustrated the point with my aversion about the lack of heed paid to the rule of commas concerning dependent and independent clauses. "") (I had to throw in an emoticon just for Truss.)I LOVE her smattering of delightful nouns and adjectives throughout the whole book (berk, wanker, poncey, palaver, etc.) and think she and Mary Roach could be pals what with their constant parenthetical references. Parenthetical references/asides have such personality and make the author instantly intimate. I also love her position on p27, which is very well expressed: Somewhere between these positions [extreme ends of the spectrum] is where I want us to end up: staunch because we understand the advantages of being staunch; flexible because we understand the rational and historical necessity to be flexible. That helps sum it up for me, because I love linguistics and grammar. Since the two fundamentally disagree, that is a completely contradictory way to be. I have more than once been referred to as a walking contradiction, so I guess it quite suits me. (Please pardon the awful and unintentional rhyming.)I know Truss explicitly states that it's not a book on grammar, but I really wish she (or her editor) would have studied up on the subjunctive. I feel the same way about the subjunctive as I do about the apostrophe. (p154 ""...logic demands that the question mark goes outside the inverted commas."") No, No. PLEASE. I fully agree with her arguments on quotation marks. The British way is much better than the American. I tend to do it that way anyway, but I also prefer the Oxford comma in nearly all instances.

Certainly American spellings are creeping in to our shop signs... But in the case of our deteriorating understanding of commas and apostrophes, we have no one to blame but ourselves. (p. xxiii).""""Punctuation is no more a class issue than the air we breathe. It is a system of printers' marks that has aided the clarity of the written word for the past half-millennium, and if its time has come to be replaced, let's just use this moment to celebrate what an elegant and imaginative job it did while it had the chance... The disappearance of punctuation (including word spacing, capital letters, and so on) indicates an enormous shift in our attitude to the written word, and nobody knows where it will end (p. xxvi).""""If this satanic sprinkling of redundant apostrophes causes no little gasp of horror or quickening of the pulse, you should probably put down this book at once (p. 1).""""It's tough being a stickler for punctuation these days.... Everywhere one looks, there are signs of ignorance and indifference (p. 2).""""Dead punctuation is invisible to everyone else--yet we see it all the time. No one understands us seventh-sense people. They regard us as freaks (p. 4).""""Punctuation has been defined many ways. Some grammarians use the analogy of stitching: punctuation as the basting that holds the fabric of language in shape. Another writer tells us that punctuation marks are the traffic signals of language: they tell us to slow down, notice this, take a detour, and stop.... punctuation is 'a courtesy designed to help readers to understand a story without stumbling (p. 7).'""""What happened to punctuation? Why is it so disregarded when it is self-evidently so useful in preventing enormous mix-ups (p. 13)?""""We had been taught Latin, French and German grammar; but English grammar was something we felt we were expected to infer from our reading--which is doubtless why I cam a cropper over 'its' and 'it's' (p. 15).""""The reason it's worth standing up for punctuation is not that it's an arbitrary system of notation known only to an over-sensitive elite who have attacks of the vapours when they see it misapplied. The reason to stand up for punctuation is that without it there is no reliable way of communicating meaning (p. 20).""""If I did not believe that everyone is capable of understanding where an apostrophe goes, I would not be writing this book (p. 32).""""You know those self-help books that give you permission to love yourself? This one gives you permission to love punctuation (p. 33).""""It came to pass that Hear'Say's poor, oddly placed little apostrophe was replicated everywhere and no one gave a moment's thought to its sufferings. No one saw the pity of its position, hanging there in eternal meaninglessness, silently signalling to those with eyes to see, 'I'm a legitimate punctuation mark, get me out of here.'.... Cruelty to punctuation is quite unlegislated (p. 35).""""In Shakespeare's time, an apostrophe indicated omitted letters.... If only the apostrophe's life had stayed that simple. At some point in the 17th century, however, printers started to intrude an apostrophe before the 's' in singular possessive cases ('the girl's dress'), and from then on quite frankly the whole thing has spiralled into madness (p. 38).""""So what are the jobs an apostrophe currently has on its CV?.... 1. It indicates a possessive in a singular noun....2. It indicates time or quantity....3. It indicates the omission of figures in dates.... 4. It indicates the omission of letters.... 5. It indicates strange, non-standard English.... 6. It features in Irish names such as O'Neill and O'Casey....7. It indicates the plurals of letters....8. It also indicates plurals of words (p. 39).""""No matter that you have a PhD and have read all of Henry James twice.

Such a list of legitimate apostrophe jobs certainly brings home to us the imbalance of responsibility that exists in the world of punctuation (p. 46).""""I applaud all those who seek to protect the apostrophe from misuse (p. 47).""""Do people other than professional writers care, though? Well, yes, and I have proof in heaps (p. 48).""""Someone knows an apostrophe is required...but where, oh where (p. 52)?""""With modern names ending in 's' (including biblical names, and any foreign name with an unpronounced final 's'), the 's' is required after the apostrophe: Keats's poems, Philippa Jones's book.... if the name ends in an 'iz' sound, an exception is made: Bridges' score, Moses' tablets. And an exception is always made for Jesus: Jesus' disciples. However, these are matters of style and preference that are definitely not set in stone, and it's a good idea not to get fixated about them (p. 55).""""We may all be getting a little sick and tired of the apostrophe by now, so I'll just get a couple more things off my chest.... 'For every apostrophe omitted from an it's, there is an extra one put into an its (p. 61).'""""Evidently there used to be a shopkeeper in Bristol who deliberately stuck ungrammatical signs in his window as a ruse to draw people into the shop; they would come in to complain; and he would talk them into buying something (p. 66).""""Abolish the apostrophe and it will be necessary, before the hours is up, to reinvent it (p. 67).""""He seemed to believe there was no limit to the amount of clarification you could achieve if you just kept adding commas (p. 68).""""'This particular comma...was Ross's way of giving the men time to push back their chairs and stand up (p. 70).'""""More than any other mark, the comma draws our attention to the mixed origins of modern punctuation, and its consequent mingling of two quite distinct functions:1. To illuminate the grammar of a sentence2. To point up--rather in the manner of musical notation--such literary qualities as rhythm, direction, pitch, tone and flow (p. 70).""""On the page, punctuation performs its grammatical function, but in the mind of the reader it does more than that. It tells the reader how to hum the tune (p. 71).""""For a millennium and a half, punctuation's purpose was to guide actors, chanters and readers-aloud through stretches of manuscript, indicating the pauses, accentuating matters of sense and sound, and leaving syntax mostly to look after itself (p. 72).""""There was no punctuation in those ancient texts and that's all there is to it....just capital letters in big square blocks....if a text was slow to offer up its meaning, this encouraged not only healthy meditation but the glorification of God (p. 76).""""The heroic status of Aldus Manutius the Elder among historians of the printed word cannot be overstated. Who invented the italic typeface? Aldus Manutius! Who printed the first semicolon? Aldus Manutius! The rise of printing in the 14th and 15th centuries meant that a standard system of punctuation was urgently required, and Aldus Manutius was the man to do it (p. 77)>""""I'm sure people did question whether Italian printers were quite the right people to legislate on the meaning of everything; but on the other hand, resistance was obviously useless against a family that could invent italics (p. 78).""""The comma has so many jobs as a 'separator' (punctuation marks are traditionally either 'separators' or 'terminators')...endlessly organising words into sensible groups and making them stay put: sorting and dividing; circling and herding; and of course darting off with a peremptory 'woof' to round up any wayward subordinate clauses that makes a futile bolt for semantic freedom. Commas, if you don't whistle at them to clam down, are unstoppably enthusiastic at this job (p. 79).""""When it comes to improving the clarity of a sentence, you can nearly always argue that [a comma] should go in; you can nearly always argue that one should come out (p. 80).""""Lawyers eschew the comma as far as possible, regarding it as a toublemaker; and readers grow so accustomed to the dwindling incidence of commas in public places that when signs go up saying 'No dogs please,' only one person in a thousand bothers to point out that actually, as a statement, 'no dogs please' is an indefensible generalisation, since many dogs do please, as a matter of fact; they rather make a point of it (p. 81).""""'The use of commas cannot be learned by rule.'....1. Commas for lists....2. Commas for joining.... 3. Commas filling gaps....4. Commas before direct speech....5. Commas setting off interjections....6. Commas that come in pairs....

Sometimes the sentence is improved by including it; sometimes it isn't (p. 85).""""The big final rule for the comma is one that you won't find in any books by grammarians.... don't use commas like a stupid person. I mean it. More than any other mark, the comma requires the writer to use intelligent discretion and to be simply alert to potential ambiguity (p. 96).""""This is where the colon and semicolon waltz in together, to a big cheer from all the writers in the audience. Just look at those glamorous punctuation marks twirling in the lights from the glitter-ball: are they not beautiful? Are they not graceful (p. 105)?""""Nothing is straightforward in the world of literary taste. Just as there are writers who worship the semicolon, there are other high stylists who dismiss it--who label it, if you please, middle-class (p. 107).""""The first printed semicolon was the work of good old Aldus Manutius just two years after Columbus sailed to the New World (p. 111).""""The idea of the semicolon as an imperceptible bit weightier than a comma, and the colon as a teensy bit lighter than a full stop, is a wrong-headed way of both characterising the colon and semicolon (p. 113).""""Semicolons are dangerously habit-forming (p. 115).""""Colons introduce the part of a sentence that exemplifies, restates, elaborates, undermines, explains or balances the preceding part.... They set off book and film sub-titles from the main titles.... they separate dramatic characters from dialogue (p. 120).""""The dash is less formal than the semicolon, which makes it more attractive; it enhances the conversational tone; and...is capable of quite subtle effects. The main reason people use it, however, is that they know you can't use it wrongly--which, for a punctuation mark, is an uncommon virtue (p. 122).""""We must keep an eye on the dash--and also the ellipsis (...), which is turning up increasingly in emails as shorthand for 'more to come (p. 123).'""""There are times, however, when the semicolon is indispensable in another capacity: when it performs the duties of a kind of Special Policeman in the event of comma fights. If there is one lesson to be learned from this book, it is that there is never a dull moment in the world of punctuation (p. 125).""""Ever since it came along, grammarians have warned us to be wary of the exclamation mark, mainly because, even when we try to muffle it with brackets (!), it still shouts, flashes like neon, and jumps up and down (p. 137).""""Personally, I use exclamation marks for email salutations (p. 138).""""The question mark, with its elegant seahorse profile, takes up at least double the space on the page of an exclamation mark, yet gets on people's nerves considerably less.

289,115868668,08/08/2010,5.0,"Just call me “Ellen the Punctilious” from now on; because of Lynne Truss’ little book, I’m hooked on proper punctuation! Commas, periods (full-stops, in UK), parentheses (brackets, in UK), semi-colons and colons, and everything in between is covered within these 204 pages, nestled between words of wit and wisdom that inform as well as entertain.One of Truss’ goals is to show us why punctuation is important and what we can do to keep it alive. Is it in danger of watering down and eventually disappearing? You bet your sweet bippy, and Truss carefully explains this to us as we go along, using historical and literary references that go back to the beginning of the written word.A favorite quote: The reason it’s worth standing up for punctuation is not that it’s an arbitrary system of notation known only to an over-sensitive elite who have attacks of the vapours [sic:] when they see it misapplied. The reason to stand up for punctuation is that without it there is no reliable way of communicating meaning. Punctuation herds words together, keeps other apart. [end quote:], p.20How important is the punctuation? Here is a classic example from p.9:Dear Jack, I want a man who knows what love is all about. You are generous, kind, thoughtful. People who are not like you admit to being useless and inferior. You have ruined me for other men. I yearn for you. I have no feelings whatsoever when we’re apart.

Punctuation can be fun!Caveat: this book was written by a Brit, and although they released the USA edition that I read, it was still chock full of formula that we don’t use in America. Truss is disturbed horribly because we insist on putting our punctuation INSIDE the quotation marks. “Stop that, Lynne,” Ellen said. (See, INSIDE). She’s abhors the way we put periods after shortened proper nouns such as, Mr., Mrs., Dr., and Jr. And she calls the punctuation by their British names enough that if you don’t pay close attention, you might become royally confused half-way in. The only real solution for this problem is for the author to rewrite the entire book just for the Yanks—which I’m fairly certain will never happen.Still, a solid five stars for a helpful, informative, and sometimes laugh-out-loud-hilarious book.Ellen C MazeAuthor of Curious Spiritual Vampire TalesRabbit: Chasing Beth Rider, Top 100 Horror/Occult on Amazon",0,0.9324,0.105,0.763,0.132,0.5335626102292769,NEGATIVE,0.9474
290,1542305946,02/08/2016,3.0,"I have been interested in reading this book for a long time because I love the English language and all its formalities. I am a grammar Nazi--and a punctuation Nazi and spelling Nazi for that matter. So needless to say, this book seemed right up my alley. And it was . . . kind of.This book was, at times, funny, and I literally laughed out loud at some of her comments and examples. But I also got the feeling that Truss's vigor and violence were not just for show. ""If you still persist in writing 'Good food at it's best,' you deserve to be struck by lightning, hacked up on the spot and buried in an unmarked grave."" I, like her, am also a stickler for punctuation, but that's going too far; I simply shake my head at people who punctuate like that instead of wishing for their demise.Since Eats, Shoots & Leaves was written by a Brit and therefore includes British language rules, there were quite a few differences in how she writes compared to how Americans write, and she discusses those differences in her book, which I found to be helpful. Similarly, she has that dry sense of humor true of most Brits, and I only sometimes connected with it. Some examples and jokes she made were too much for me, and I was left wondering what their appeal was. This is probably the biggest disconnect I had with the book: there came a point where even I was thinking, calm down lady, it's not that big of a deal.One disagreement I did have with her was in the history of the use of the apostrophe. Her rant about the apostrophe's many tasks is unnecessary, as the apostrophe has one main task that all other tasks fall under: to indicate omission. Even when used to show a possessive in a singular noun (e.g. ""the girl's book""), the apostrophe still indicates an omission. Historically (as I learned in my English language classes at university), the suffix -es was added to words to show possession, and nowadays the apostrophe stands in place of the ""e"" in -es (e.g. ""the girles book"" became ""the girl's book""). Whenever an apostrophe is used in English, it almost always indicates an omission of something.Overall, this book was a nice refresher of the rules of English punctuation while providing lovely examples of historical use and humor along the way. Somewhere in the chaos of her rants, Truss actually does explain the proper uses of the comma, apostrophe, period, ellipsis, dash, bracket, quotation mark, exclamation point, question mark, hyphen, and even the interrobang. While not a book I would read again, Eats, Shoots & Leaves is still one I would recommend to any over-the-top English language fanatic like myself.We are like the little boy in The Sixth Sense who can see dead people, except that we can see dead punctuation.Find this review on my book blog: http://mystoreysofstories.blogspot.co...

291,200004546,08/18/2011,4.0,"Ms. Truss manages what some may consider an impossible feat: finding humor in punctuation. She freely acknowledges the unflattering image that those who are passionate about apostrophes, commas and semicolons present to the world: “we are unattractive know-all obsessives who get things out of proportion and are in continual peril of being disowned by our exasperated families.” But she revels in her “seventh sense” ability to identify missing apostrophes and the overenthusiastic use of commas anyway, and inspires the rest of us to do the same.Gleefully anthropomorphizing these dots and squiggles, Ms. Truss paints an amusing portrait of punctuation's home life. “In the family of punctuation,” she theorizes, “where the full stop [period] is daddy and the comma is mummy, and the semicolon quietly practises the piano with crossed hands, the exclamation mark is the big attention-deficit brother who gets over-excited and breaks things and laughs too loudly.” In Ms. Truss's world, punctuation marks have feelings and deserve to be treated with the same consideration we would offer any other misused soul. She tentatively wonders if it “seems hurtful to suppress the exclamation mark when – after all – it doesn't mean any harm to anyone, and is so desperately keen.” After enumerating the impressively long list of tasks which the humble apostrophe is called upon to complete, she implores her readers, “I hope that by now you are already feeling sorry for the apostrophe...frantically multi-tasking...dotting hither and yon, and succumbing to burnout from all the thankless effort.” Commas are “unstoppably enthusiastic,” semicolons are “upstanding,” and dashes are “handsome.” When Ms. Truss describes them so, it's hard not to see punctuation as having personalities all their own.For all her hysterical grammatical fussiness, Ms. Truss does advocate a middle ground between staunchness and flexibility when it comes to punctuation. If the intent of punctuation is to provide “the greatest clarity,” she asserts that “in some matters of punctuation there are simple rights and wrongs; in others, one must apply a good ear to good sense.” This is, of course, complicated by the fact that each individual stickler has his or her own personal punctuational pet peeve – whereas one can not abide Oxford commas, another goes bonkers at inappropriate hypenation. Nevertheless, she urges “Sticklers unite, you have nothing to lose but your sense of proportion, and arguably you didn't have a lot of that to begin with.”For more book reviews, come visit my blog, Build Enough Bookshelves.",0,0.8192,0.049,0.877,0.074,0.5930194805194805,POSITIVE,0.9704

The examples and ramblings of errors in punctuation are hilarious; with each chapter blending these examples with the evolution of the punctuation marks and intended uses. The book doesn't demand continued adherence to punctuation usage; instead it seems to say 'learn the basics, and when this is done learn to enjoy the flourishes that punctuation adds to language'. Now granted you will make mistakes, but hopefully it will move things in the direction of discussion and adaptive usage; rather than the under-usage generated by uncertainty.Unfortunately, the book is unlikely to be read by the very audience that it should primarily target. Though Lynne Truss states that this book is probably not meant for the audience which doesn't understand (or shuns) punctuation, it is hard to image that basic comma usage would be directed at the more able.I would have liked more prominent examples of punctuation errors, as numerous examples appeared to be generated by the author, and may indicate a lack of research.

295,1579918521,03/14/2016,1.0,"Eats, Shoots and Leaves is a book on misuse of punctuation which manages to contain more hot air than today’s presidential candidates. Each chapter is a long, grueling ramble on assorted punctuation marks and how their downfall will lead to the collapse of intelligible English. Truss views herself as a grammar snob, and the book definitely reads like that, with Truss sharing stories of her and others going to great lengths to correct grammar mistakes. The book reads like a long and overly pretentious tirade, with no real purpose than to incite others with the same feelings. Truss accomplishes with 204 pages what 20 can, so the book reads like she’s being paid by the word. Truss even says towards the beginning of the book that she’s not trying to embalm the language, yet I can’t find another way to describe what she’s doing. Truss’s attempts at snarky humor just come off as presumptuous and smug, as if being anal about punctuation is a volunteered hardship being taken on for the good of the people.Early in the book, Truss talks about her joy of finding others like her in the Apostrophe Protection Society, “Why did the Apostrophe Protection Society not have a militant wing? Could I start one? Where do you get balaclavas?” (Truss 4). Truss views herself as some sort of vigilante fighting the evil misusers of punctuation. She believes it is time to challenge the beliefs and methods of society. While things of the sort are often necessary to keep aspects of society intact, the cause must be worthwhile enough to get people’s attention. While Truss believes punctuation grammar is important, it is in a constant state of change. While the grammar is Shakespeare’s works may have been commonly intelligible in his own time, today it is hard to read due to changes in English over the few centuries. This same process is still going on today with every language, and wanting to protect punctuation marks isn’t much of a cause to rile everyone up as Truss tries to do.Honestly, only people who share Truss’s views on punctuation can really enjoy this book, it just comes off as pretentious and snide.

In this book, Lynne Truss has dealt with all matters related to punctuation in a humorous and engaging fashion. This not only removes the “boring” tag associated with the subject of punctuation but also gets people involved in punctuating well. The very title of the book is derived from a famous joke, which has done its rounds all over the world. In case you haven’t heard it, here goes…  A panda walks into a café. He orders a sandwich, eats it, then draws a gun and fires two shots in the air.  “Why?” asks the confused waiter as the panda leaves the café. The panda produces a badly punctuated wildlife manual and tosses it over his shoulder.  “I’m a panda,” he says, at the door. “Look it up”.  The waiter turns to the relevant entry and, sure enough, finds an explanation. “Panda: Large black-and-white bear-like mammal, native to China. Eats, shoots and leaves.” In case you are still wondering what that meant…the trick is in the comma placed after “Eats” in “Eats, shoots and leaves.” This comma implies that someone eats something, shoots, and then leaves the scene. The correct entry, of course, would be “Eats shoots and leaves” minus the comma after “Eats” to imply eating shoots ( as in bamboo shoots) and leaves( of plants and trees).  Now that I have killed the punchline and demystified the joke completely, wouldn’t you agree that a misplaced comma can totally change the meaning of a sentence or a phrase?
