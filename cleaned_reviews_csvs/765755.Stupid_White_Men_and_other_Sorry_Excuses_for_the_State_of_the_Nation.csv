0,12077422,01/09/2008,2.0,"I had to read this book for a class, and, lucky me, a few weeks before I had to have it read, Moore came and spoke at my school. I got tickets for me and a couple of my friends and bought the book at the door. Michael Moore is a rambunctious fellow for someone so hefty, and he gave a good speech or lecture or whathaveyou; I wouldn't call it inspiring, but to my 21-year-old mind still adjusting to the demands of big city livin' and the expectations of being a college student, I remember being fired up with all kinds of liberal smugness and that, as I lined up afterwards to have my book signed, I had really accomplished something. Like some subtle shift had taken place and the world was set on its correct path once again. A difference had been made. Anyway, when it was my turn to have my book signed, I looked into Moore's weary eyes and the traces of grey in the stubble on his jowels, and I wanted to thank him for giving me--not the tools for action, but the ammunition to loudly pretend to be an intellectual with half-baked political philosophy at the next campus-housing party. But I said nothing, and he just scribbled an illegible wave, like a frantic heartbeat on a monitor, onto the front page with a purple pen and slid my book down the table and I moved on.I should have just bought a Che Guevara t-shirt.",22,0.9321,0.068,0.807,0.125,0.3873015873015873,NEGATIVE,0.9357

But the book proved to be highly speculative and unsatisfying, and left me suspecting Moore's genuinity, a feeling which was enhanced by watching the movies Bowling for Columbine and Sicko. He seems to edit facts and figures to prove his point, in his books as well as movies, just like any politician. His humour is also too cynical for my taste. A humourist once wrote: ""For the rose bush of satire, the laughter is the flower and the criticism, the thorn. Remember, the flower is the adornment for the bush, not the thorn."" Moore's rose bush is almost all thorns.However, I give it two stars because I think Moore fights a worthy cause.",21,0.908,0.069,0.763,0.168,0.7485714285714286,NEGATIVE,0.9999

All kind of politics and politics of all kind, are not this definite. The machinations behind everything is too broad and everyone involved too greedy. But his take on money and war is spot on. Even if his solutions are a bit whimsical. He's also right about women being better human than men, for the most parts.The way they are, the behavior of those stupid white men, and this can also be used as a colloquial term for those in power regardless of the color of their skin and gender, the behavior is just so atrocious. I read this book in the November of 2006, when the world was weltered in blood from all the warring. Here I am reviewing it ten years later. The world has changed several times over since then, shape of its sound no longer recognizable and yet we are still at war with our own existence, still getting wounded for being here.

4,194284849,08/04/2011,5.0,"This book IS a little dated now. However, that does NOT detract from the simple fact that the presidency of George W. Bush, if one could call it that, was a farce from the outset. And that is what this book is mostly about. I won't go too much into detail and let the book do that. What I will say is that Bush Jr. should have been denied presidency on the grounds that it was and is a conflict of interest. Pure and simple! And the absolute low point in the history of the United States will forever be letting that buffoon and his crew of hired thugs cheat their way into office! Michael Moore was pretty much the only high profiler with balls enough to stand up and say ""Hey! This isn't right!"" and I commend him for that.I'm going to round up this review with a quote from another famous American. Something we all need to learn if there is to be an end to the tyranny.""You're not to be so blind with patriotism that you can't face reality.

5,295551362,03/16/2012,2.0,"President George W. Bush (born 1946) was the President of the US from 2001 to 2009. He became the president on the year that our President Erap Estrada (born 1937) was ousted from his seat. I recalled this while reading the book because I was then working as the Asia Pacific Purchasing Manager in my previous company, a multinational chemical manufacturer. Our Buyers across the region were invited over to have our conference here in Manila. During one particular dinner, my Australian team mate asked me: ""So, what's the latest Erap joke?"" [President Erap propagated these stupid jokes to endear him to the masses during the campaign.] So, I told him this one:
""KANGAROOS (DURING AUSTRALIAN STATE VISIT)Reporter: Mr. President, how was your visit to Australia? Erap: Well, it was nice. I saw many dangaroos. Reporter: Sir, you mean, kangaroos? Erap: No! Dangaroos! It was written: ""Beware, these animals are dangaroos(dangerous)!""
And the Australian fellow and many people on the table laughed and laughed (I did not know if it was a sincere one though since during business dinners you have to be polite to laugh if someone tells a joke, right?)But then, the same Australian fellow, turned his head to our Singaporean team mate who was the only one not laughing and he said: ""Any joke about your President Goh Chok Tong?"" But the Singaporean just clipped his shoulders and said seriously: ""Sorry, we don't make fun of our presidents.""Suddenly, total silence. I think it dawned on us that we were not doing the right thing. Singapore is a First World compared to most of the Asian countries that are struggling economically with all the crimes, pollution, political unrest, corruption and social injustices.That's why, I am rating this book with 2 stars. It's not totally pointless. Moore may have made good points in the book, e.g., Bush not really won the 2000 election over Gore, Bush may not be the most intelligent president, white guys also contributed badly to the state of the country or the world, etc. Moore even gave his solid, practical and doable suggestions for white men to survive the 21st century even given to the extent of going through, i.e., step-by-step, the procedure in using the toilet. That one got me really because I grew up in the island with no toilet cover and lid and nobody taught me how to properly use them. Urg, but true.Moore is a clever fellow and he knows his stuff. I also figured that this book Stupid White Men came out in 2001 and seven years after, President Barack Obama became the 44th (and current) President of the US. Was it also possible that the popularity of this book even have helped Obama's campaign by setting the mind of the voters that black men are better than white men because of this book's title? I dunno. That maybe because I have been reading too many conspiracy-theory novels. But still, why make fun of the president? ",11,0.8722,0.048,0.883,0.069,0.3890682234432233,NEGATIVE,0.9999
6,1950150,06/13/2007,3.0,"I was prone from the start to give this book a favorable review, because my politics are right there with Moore's. For readers like me, he's preaching to the choir. I found the book alternately entertaining and disturbing as facts, statistics, serious rants and cheeky humor flew off the page. Some passages made me want to jump up and help change the world; others made me feel that it's all too much and that I'll soon be hopelessly watching our nation unravel. I suspect the author's own moods fluctuate in a similar way.I'm only giving the book 3 stars despite my political and social agreement with the author. The book is frustratingly inconsistent. Moore has a tendency to pinball dizzyingly among fact, conjecture and hyperbole. He whips up his essays into a verbal froth, at times running head-on into generalizations that damaged my trust in him. Specific example: Moore's wholesale depiction of public defenders as inept bumblers, when instead he could have taken a more focused stance on the systemic problems and left the insulting generalization out. It's the equivalent of describing police officers as donut-eating fools. It earns a snicker from some of us, but we get nothing out of it.Bottom line: Moore has important things to say. Unfortunately, the people who need to hear these things are the ones least likely to read this book. Even if they did read it, the inconsistencies in Moore's tone and authority would likely make the whole work easy to dismiss. ",10,0.476,0.083,0.815,0.102,0.5705853174603175,NEGATIVE,1.0

9,1715655434,08/01/2016,3.0,"Given how utterly crazy the world of politics has become (again), it seemed appropriate to revisit Moore's bestseller, Stupid White Men, as the US gears up to the very real possibility of voting for one of the most despicable men in the world as its president. Despite being originally published in 2001, shortly after 9/11, much of this book still sadly rings true and it demonstrates in depressing clarity, how little seems to have changed in America (if anything, it looks like things have gotten worse from this outsider's point of view). Told in Moore's unashamedly loud and brash voice, Stupid White Men is a scathing criticism of mainly Bush policies with biting humour thrown in to make it more palatable and engaging, though I can appreciate it won't be everyone's cup of tea.

10,1400330529,09/24/2015,3.0,"Actually the first thing that struck me, was how current this more than ten year old book still is. Granted the names in politics have changed in the last decade, but most of Moore's critiques could land as squarely now as in the beginning- especially his critique of the increasingly similar two parties (he is talking about USA but it also struck me how much of his political insight works almost equally well for Australia).Moore is readable, funny, breaks things into short sections which is extremely user friendly. I sometimes found his humour jarring, I don't know if that is a cultural thing. Maybe as an Australian that almost never watches TV I am just culturally incompatible with Moore's brash brand of humour. Usually I love sarcasm, there was something so white, male, loud, stereotypical American about his way of speaking though that he lost me (mind you I suspect I would still have a beer with him if I met him).Many of his political insights seemed to me to be pure logic disguised as comedy. Here is wry comedy made me smile. Some of the advice that went with this (about emailing and calling politicians more or about running for politics) were sound advice that I hope everyone will take (I have considered running for politics but I think my small energies are better spent supporting other politicians who challenge the system). Moore's analysis on voting for Nader (why you would, why you wouldn't and different ways of deciding) was refreshing in both its logic and in his tolerance that not everyone sees it quite his way. I also agreed with him about being screwed over honestly or not- the material endpoint is the same either way.Sometimes he lost me by putting the comedy before the politics (I suspect there he will appeal to other people more than me). His comments about gender relations and race/nationality were a bit offensive coming from someone with his level of privilege for all that there was real critique and genuine comedy in there disguised as simply playing the fool. I also thought that at times by putting the comic agenda before the political one he got away with superficial, simplistic ""Answers"" that actually wouldn't work. I understand as a popular movie-maker/writer his main motivation is to entertain and to sneak in some information int he entertainment, not just to teach. But in those places I was struggling to keep reading (some of it as I say above was probably lost in cultural translation).Worth a read for people who think politics is ""boring"" or ""pointless"" as it argues persuasively that none of us can afford to be apolitical (and that by doing nothing we are in fact supporting the bastards who want to step on our necks). The false humility in the book has a sort of charisma to it too. Give it a go!",6,0.9926,0.09,0.74,0.17,0.4019909688013137,NEGATIVE,0.7587

However, this book is a very humorous and sometimes frightening satire of the state of the US today. And he's not a scholar, but then again, nowhere did I find proof that he professes to be. He posits important questions for discussion and, due to his popularity, is able to put these ideas before a large audience. He reminds me of a watered-down version of Noam Chomsky --- and that's good.Plus, those who read this book will find that they have at least been challenged to ""think,"" much more than watching some drivel on the idiot box.

Why weren’t you treated like any other drunk—why didn’t law enforcement do their job?8)	Why didn’t the republicans make as much noise about your adulterous affair as they did the democrats?9)	Why did you choose Dick Cheney to be your vice president while he had two drunk driving arrests on his record?10)	Why aren’t you honest about your cocaine use?11)	What were the three arrests about?12)	Why didn’t you complete your stint in the Texas Air National Guard?13)	Why did you go AWOL and suffered no consequences?Things I Learned1.

A man no one elected sits in the White House.4.	The pass two-years have seen the most layoffs since the worst years of the Reagan Renaissance devastated the country.5.	Freedom of choice is a thing of the past. We’re down to six media companies, six airlines, two and a half carmakers, and one radio conglomerate.

He could see where the economy was going to end up, and just how unequal and unfairly skewed the 'Land of the Free' actually was.All in all, an interesting book, one that would lead to a lot of fist-shaking and noise about what ails the US of A, but after the fists are shaken, there isn't much else one can do...",2,-0.1036,0.068,0.873,0.059,0.573529411764706,NEGATIVE,0.94

35,509303858,01/17/2013,2.0,"A criticism of the Bush Administration shortly after their election4 August 2015	Okay, I may not actually be writing this review (as I had done so a while back) but I am going over it again to try and correct some of the glaring spelling and gramatical errors (as I have been doing for most of my reviews – and I am getting quite close to finishing them off). Anyway, I am currently sitting in a flying coffin at 30,000 above Malaysia, on my way to Phuket where I will be using the time to tidy up a few more of my reviews, as well as visiting Salamanga at James Bond island. However, that is beside the point because I probably should be spending more time relaxing and exploring than writing book reviews – but then again I guess that is one of things things I like doing. Anyway, on with the review.	This book is quite dated since the Bush cronies are now gone and the Democrats, lead by Barak Obama, are now well into a second term in the oval office (though they were recently smashed is the mid-terms). However, just because this ultra-right wing conservative government has been tossed out of the door does not necessarily mean that things have changed, or that change is going to be effected overnight. Many people are now criticising Obama on the fact that when he entered office on the platform of 'change you can believe in' that all of the problems that plague the United States would be solved overnight. As became obvious, the power brokers in this neo-fuedal system were not going to lie down without a fight. Even the Health Care Reform was little more than a cobbled together attempt to move the United States away from the two-tier system that had evolved that simply gives the health insurance industry more money (namely by forcing the insurers to accept applicants – then again, a government funded system would result in huge losses to the private insurers as it would mean that people would no longer see the need to take out private insurance).	However, the legacy of the Bush era is a multi-trillion dollar debt, a sluggish economy, more people under the poverty line, millions unemployed, a two wars in which many have lost loved ones or have had their lives drastically changed due to a roadside bomb. In fact one could point to these two wars as the reason that the United States is struggling with a debt burden that is going to be impossible to pay. However, despite all of this, the elite still live in the multi-million dollar mansions, sip their pina colladas, and watch their broadway plays, while the middle class is slowly being destroyed and the ranks of the poor are ever increasing.	We cannot say that we were not warned. It is interesting that it was well known that Bush was in fact a very bad manager of money. He ran two companies into the ground, ran the state of Texas into the ground, and a year before his term expired, the American economy was pushed to brink of collapse. However the companies that were responsible for this were bailed out, and then the government was further required to cut back on spending on essential services while the directors of these companies simply went on with life as normal. In the end, as in every similar situation, a fall guy was found (Mardoff) and all of the rage and anger was focused on him while the real criminals simply went off scott free.	As for Bush's Christianity, that is something that I am not at liberty to make comment, though it is interesting that his mentors turned out to be the usual suspects when it comes to the Christian right in the United States. This is an anti-abortion, and in fact, anti-fun coalition that is trying to impose a rigid morality on the United States, still believing that it is a country that has been blessed by God because of its Christian heritage. If economic success is a sign of blessing, and blessing only comes because a country remains true to its Christian heritage, then maybe the economic miracle in China is nothing more than a fraud (and people actually seem to think that this is a case). Or how about Ethiopia, or Kenya? These two countries have a very strong Christian heritage, but struggle with endemic poverty. This idea is once again a part of the so called prosperity heresy (as I like to call it), and now I understand why these pastors live such luxurious lifestyles - it is simply to convince the members of their church that the prosperity doctrine does indeed work because God has blessed them with riches (despite the fact that these riches have simply come through tithing and selling merchandise that peddles this false doctrine).",0,0.9837,0.118,0.735,0.148,0.4100046685340803,NEGATIVE,0.9991

So, this is a going to be a slightly biased review.On the book:This book covered a number of topics related to the USA, particularly those related to the 2000 election debacle / coup d'etat / mess, Ralph Nader [that's one person who, in my opinion, definitely deserved to be the president of the USA on the basis of his life work / achievements but was never elected, thanks to the powers that be!], manipulation of public opinion by the mass media, racial politics, public school system, big corporations bull-dozing the set regulations / norms and then a few others that I cannot recall, off-hand.For a person like me, who's been in the USA for a while and continues to maintain interest in some of the social / political issues of that country, this book contains a treasure trove of information. Whether that information is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth is something I cannot comment on but, as always with Michael Moore movies / books, it opens up a topic of interest or a specific perspective/angle of that topic that most of the audience base may never have pondered on before; beyond that point, it is then up to that person to decide whether to (and how deep to) research that topic. Like I said, this book covered a number of such topics - that's what made this book particularly interesting for me.For everyone residing outside the USA, it is still worth a read, simply because most of the topics/issues discussed in it are universal and apply in other democratic and/or developing countries, as well. Knowing about the issues faced by the folks in the USA may help the rest of the world in avoiding the same pitfalls and work on finding viable alternatives instead.Additional Notes:1> Some other reviewers of this book have stated that 'Dude, Where's My Country?' is a much better book. So, that's going to be one of my next reads in the near future.2> Also, there's now a 'Michael Moore Is a Big Fat Stupid White Man' book which is supposed to be a critique of all-things-Michael-Moore.

136,336659861,05/25/2012,4.0," Before there was OWS  Michael Moore’s  Stupid White Men  is something of a classic in the tradition of righteously angry political satire/ gonzo journalism. What makes it interesting and relevant for today is its lessons for this election cycle, as it dissects what went wrong with the election of George W. Bush in 2000. First and foremost, Moore takes us through how Gore rightly did win the 2001 election (no matter how the mainstream media would like to spin it) and how that election was stolen from him through outright vote tampering and election fraud. Numerous facts are cited, but in a humorous way to balance the wonkiness. This exploration alone makes  Stupid White Men  worth a revisit this year, as another Stupid White Man aims to unseat our first black president, in an election that is rapidly becoming too close for comfort for most liberals (and we shouldn’t be so naïve as to think voter fraud will not at least be attempted, unfortunately). Since most Americans have tragically short memories and seem to forget all of the regressions we have made in a society under eight years of Bush II, we would do well to thoroughly understand what went wrong with that election to not have history repeat itself, since, it bears repeating, we’re not so far past issues of election integrity (there wasn’t exactly a rush to, say, fix the electoral college once and for all, or a new wave of funding to put better voting machines in the poorest areas, or even funding to encourage people in the poorest areas to vote, or funding to investigate how to make electronic voting machines—still all the rage with the Right—more secure). I digress, only to underline how regrettably timely election issues remain. It’s a worthy read, and valuable for future scholars who will no doubt be wondering, “How and why did they elect someone who may have been a functional illiterate, who did not understand or abide by the separation of church and state, and who was blatantly only interested in power for power’s sake and for lining the pockets of him and his cohorts, over the guy who invented the Internet? How and why did they vote against their own interests?” This book is a great social snapshot of, well, Stupid White Men going amok in late 20th century-early 21st century late-capitalist America, oppressing anyone in their path who might want to share in the American Dream and get a little prosperity of their own (or at least to get out of the crushing poverty that, every so often, tries to be repackaged and crammed down the throats of the working class as “necessary” “austerity” [or whatever the euphemism du jour is] to balance a budget perennially blown on wars, tax cuts, and other handouts for the wealthy). Hopefully in 20 or so years future historians will read Moore’s chronicling of the systemic, repeated inequalities and injustices hurled at black people, minorities, women, and prisoners with a kind of quaint curiosity of how we could let the military-industrial (aka corporate) complex strangle the larger interests of the people for so long. So while it may seem simplistic and gimmicky to blame the lion’s share of our nation’s social ills on Stupid White Men, Moore accomplishes just that, really breaking down (with laughs and facts to spare) where we took a wrong turn policywise in this country, discussing and contextualizing the Reagan era to early George W. with ease. And while George W. did implement enough social destruction before 9/11—the Grand Distraction—to make him reprehensible as a president, Clinton was impeached, and Bush went untouched, we’d do well to remember. (The book was finished pre-9/11, but after 9/11, Moore was put under a lot of pressure to significantly alter his text or risk not having it published at all.) Not to be accused of playing favorites, Moore spreads sunshine—the best disinfectant—on Clinton’s many, constant giveaways to the right (his (environment-and-labor slacking, welfare hacking ways), making him “one of the best Republican presidents we’ve ever had.” With friends like these, who needs enemies? (And how sad are we and how dim or view of history is that we so want to delude ourselves into thinking those were “the good times!”—they weren’t so good for America’s poor, disproportionately affected by the triple-whammy of layoffs, globalization/NAFTA, and welfare “reform” of the 90s—people who were not picked up by the tech boom of the early 2000s, despite perennial conservative claims that “a rising tide lifts all boats.”) Moore falters in over-simplifying some of the most intractable international crises, because as refreshingly outside-the-box as his views on Israel and Palestine, North Korea, and Northern Ireland are, and as shamefully unaware of the rest of the world as most Americans are, this chapter does distract from an otherwise tight book. However, I do understand the impetus for including it, namely that Americans think we’re in a bubble, not realizing that the world is always watching, looking to us for leadership. We pioneered labor laws, women’s rights, and civil rights…and then we let the Sharper Image make our moral compass, so to speak, stalling socially and materially while we gave corporations the right to not invest in society, allowing the gap between the rich and everyone else grow despicably wide while other nations leapfrogged over us in education, manufacturing, and technological innovation. Still, Moore speaks with more urgency and authority on domestic policy issues.Moore succeeds most in indicting the Democratic party and encouraging all those with a conscience and a desire to change the future to give up blind party allegiances and start paying more attention to the issues, start showing up to elections more, and –gasp—possibly considering voting for a third-party candidate where the Democrats are not in danger of losing to more conservative Democrats, aka Republicans. Moore does even to this day get a fair amount of flak for supporting Nader, but we would do well to remember that it wasn’t Nader’s numbers that gave us Bush in 2001. We owe that dubious pleasure to the manipulation of votes and further covering-up of that vote manipulation through Bush’s friends in high places (i.e., the Supreme Court deliberately perverting justice by halting the recount which would have proven that Gore had more ballots than Bush). Advocating for a third-party candidate (again, in races where it wouldn’t be tantamount to swinging the entire enterprise for the Republicans) is never a popular thing to do, but it does send a message to a Democratic party who has been largely bought-and-sold by the same sponsors (lobbyists) as the Republican party. And it is a question that generally does need to be picked up periodically in this country, namely, why can’t there be a viable national third party?Before OWS, Moore was one of the most vocal figures talking about the wealthy CEOs worth many times the average worker standing in opposition to the interests of—and dominating—the vast majority of the rest of us (though here he uses the terms 10 percent versus the 90 percent—as the middle class continues to shrink and wealth continues to be concentrated in the hands of the few, it’s no accident that now it’s the 1% versus the 99% in mainstream protest speak). The subtext throughout is that the vast majority of people not at the top have a great need to educate ourselves to see the common enemy and to also see the great suffering that comes from allowing capitalism to run unchecked by government—which is why a lot of people grow apathetic or distrusting of government.Apathy is an easy way out, however, an intellectual copout, and a form of surrender that affects far more than your individual self. Our political apathy is far more dangerous to our democracy than any particular figurehead, and discourse would be much improved—and far less insane—if people could stick to the facts (well-cited here). The Big Message, which occasionally gets slightly obscured by the wealth of information here as Moore tries—and, generally, succeeds—to take a holistic historical view of our predicament, is that we don’t have to fear minorities or gays, or women seeking abortions, or petty drug criminals, or your disabled neighbor, or your other neighbor trying to start a union, but the Guys in Suits who would sell us out for a campaign contribution and not look back, and then defund all of the things that make us a civilization (police, fire, schools, roads, hospitals, infrastructure, clean air and water) in order to pay back their corporate patrons (and Citizens United has only made this worse). What’s ripping apart the American social fabric, we’re reminded here, is not the people who need Medicaid and Medicare, but the people at the top fighting legislation that would provide health care for all, so that their insurance-company donors can continue to make a lot of profit by denying care. What’s lowering our quality of life isn’t people protesting for a rise in the minimum wage, but the corporations who would refuse to provide benefits for their workers or a living wage so they could afford to buy the products they are selling. We’re not losing elections because gay people want more rights, but because the people who want fewer rights for oppressed groups distort the issues, use “social issues” as a smokescreen to hide their offensive positions on jobs, the economy, and the environment, and discourage voting by flooding the media with their hate-mongering and fear, alienating moderates and independents. By reducing people’s confidence in the government’s ability to get anything done those who claim to be “social conservatives” accomplish their economically conservative goals, and we all suffer. The consequence? More civic duties are subcontracted out to the private sector, which lacks accountability and oversight, and which is repeatedly more wasteful than the government—again, not a story you’ll hear on the nightly news brought to you by Big Pharma and Big Auto.Hopefully we will progress as a society to the point where social issues will cease to become the distraction they are, rights (such as for gay marriage, medical cannabis and abortion) will be guaranteed federally (as they should be) rather than on a state-by-state basis (which is a travesty), and economic and environmental issues (which are not mutually exclusive ends) will return to the forefront (and not take the form of continued handouts to the private sector, but actually emerge as serious public investments in infrastructure, alternative energy, scientific and medical innovation, and green jobs, so that we may all participate in recovery and all share the benefits). Moore sprinkles in wit and satire along with still-timely action suggestions, such as bugging those who represent you to remember who put them there, and being the media (either by making your own media, or by taking corporate media to task). Moore is trying to engage a populace tempted to give up and write off government entirely after having their votes thrown in the garbage—he’s trying to heal a national trauma through a call to resist apathy. Sadly, where this book leaves off reminds us that Democrats, liberals, and progressives should take nothing for granted this election cycle: after all, Bush was re-elected even as massively hated as he was, due to complacency, apathy, false fear, and willful ignorance (it’s worth repeating). The takeaway: Not getting distracted by non-issues is admittedly hard to do with continued cuts to the very educational systems that would give people critical thinking skills, combined with the government weakening regulations to let media continually consolidate and be controlled by fewer and fewer players—but staying focused in times of mass manipulation is nothing short of a civic duty, and this is a timeless message. In an age where civics and history are no longer taught, courageous, pull-no-punches journalism like Moore’s is essential— and it’s a quick, fun read, to boot.In ten words or less: Still relevant and worth a spot in the liberal cannon.",0,0.7736,0.127,0.745,0.128,0.4623059728942078,POSITIVE,0.9998

Inflation, you know. Sometimes the term “stupid” is used when “conniving,” “evil” or even “intelligent” should be used. People does what they does because they can. Human behavior is a fascinating study. Why do people do what they do? Because they can… Because their behavior benefits them and theirs. After that is accepted, motivation may be considered. If you are shown that Bush stole the election, just wait until 2024. Chapter one is a brief warning of things to come. Florida was just a brief Disney World of your children’s dystopia. I learned a new word reading Lyndon Johnson and “The American Dream” by Doris Kearns Goodwin: Folie a plus. Look it up. It describes a personality Moore only brief discussed in chapter one. Chapter nine was particularly disturbing. A prison just down the road from me contains a couple or three thousand felons who will never get a paying job. It was built after a private prison contractor gave a small amount to a previous governor. The deal was done. A few more drug laws were passed. And, the joint was filled. Our county economic director said it was good for our county economy which still ranks 88 out of 92 for per capita income. Don’t be black and be caught with a joint.  (Funny anecdote, one of the local white judges, before he was elevated and moved to a class neighborhood, lived next to me and I thought I could smell grass burning when I sat outside. Maybe I was wrong... or, not…) Moore beat up Clinton in chapter 10 as well as Bill deserved. Think about it- you cannot get elected/reelected without the grace of Evangelicals, making this a dangerous county. If ol’ Bill had been a nice guy the first term, he would have been replaced by a Nazi the second term. (Look at Gerald Ford.) Every good Democrat needs to read chapter 10.

Probably left there by the same person.It was an interesting read, particularly as some of Moore's criticisms of the Democratic Party are still bang on despite the nearly 20 years since this was written. In other ways so much has changed, though mostly with the Republican Party.While Moore makes some very good points at time, a lot of this is undermined by some mistakes as well which are down to a simple lack of research. For instance, in the middle of a rant about how certain companies are spending money in schools to influence what kids think or buy, he makes a factually incorrect comment which is considered 'common knowledge' due to advertising campaign of another big business. So while this shows how much power that strategy holds, for Moore to be falling for it so easily makes you wonder what else he's stating that he hasn't fact checked and simply taken at face value.Then there was also the really big head-desk moment on page 178. There is says:""Usually we humans are able to shake our bad ideas. Remember 'The earth is flat'? We stopped pushing that non-sense six hundred years ago!""I'm sure it was a perfectly good example for Moore to use at the time and undoubtedly no one could have realized how badly it would age, but boy has it much as we might hope that it hasn't. It does give the book a bit of a feel of having been written in the good old days. If only Moore knew what was yet to come!",0,0.9019,0.064,0.845,0.092,0.410273937532002,NEGATIVE,0.6345

My mother thrust this upon me in the era before high-speed Internet was available for the average home, so it counted as my introductary foray into a world of nepotism and deceit. Much of what Michael said has been revealed to be factual, and its conclusions are sparse enough to allow you to overwrite them with your own opinions.It was a great shock to find out how Washington DC's most powerful figures were inextricably linked. My teenaged mind was genuinely appalled at the blatant crimes that have gone largely unpunished. Even after its release, nothing has changed; most of the information presented is still true for today's leaders. Michael did a wonderful job of drawing attention to the oligarchic nature of the American political system, but more work is to be done if we are to make proper use of the knowledge given to us in this precocious publication.If Stupid White Men was released today, it would be widely dismissed as ""old news"". I'm happy to have read this groundbreaking book when I did. It is a great piece of investigative journalism that exposes the fragility of our freedom in the hands of America's elite.

Strongly agreeing with the documentary when I was a young kid at fourteen or fifteen years old, when rewatching later more nuance and doubt was getting to me about the strong message from the documentary. In one way Moore has had an influence mostly by showing how you can have an influence with making a movie.This book has the same style as Moore's documentaries: critical, cynical, humorous but most of all a social justice warrior vibe avant la lettre. His message is strong, blaming the white men for all problems in the America of George W. Bush. Although it was an interesting read and as a Dutch person I now certainly never want to live in the USA, the evidence is anecdotical and always fell a bit short in his motivation.If you are a Democrat or a social justice warrior you will enjoy this book. If you like strong opinions and some insight in the opposers of Bush jr. in the early 2000s it is also an interesting read. Biggest critique is that the build up is a bit weak. Starting with a strong rant against Bush, Moore at the end of the book also calls out the Democrats and his role in the Bush election, I think his point would have been stronger if he put this parts together, making the whole white men rant a lot stronger, but the message stands.",0,0.9858,0.084,0.732,0.185,0.4077200577200577,POSITIVE,0.5942

The most appealing aspect is the title ""Stupid White Men"" and the fact that this is from a white man's perspective. Reading this in 2021 obviously means the book is outdated, but there is a bit of humour still found throughout the book. Moore writes about possible solutions to help better America (he even provides websites and links which is beneficial for American citizens who need help locating resources) ***Note: I am not sure if those links still work, or have been updated since this book was published. (I assume they were helpful when the book came out). However, some of his ""advice"" is obviously ridiculous, extreme and should not be actually considered.

Not much here besides the usual early noughties Bush whinges.

214,2867439764,06/23/2019,2.0,"This book is shocking. Not because of its writing or any supposed ""revelations"", rather it is seeing how the world it describes does not differ in any significant way from the world of today, seeing just how little has changed. I don't believe any book written today could have this impact, because this book was so clearly born out of a particular moment in time that it more authentically communicates that people back then ""really"" knew and cared about the same issues we care about today than anything that could've been written today. It's a carelessly written book appealing to people with little political understanding - no one else could gain anything from it - and therein lies its autheticity: this is really what people were talking about back then. And what progress has been made?Trump is just Bush without manners, without a face you could stand looking at, and without as many murders under his belt. The wound of 9/11, still fresh in the Bush years, has festered and produced the current political climate. So many of our current favorites show up in this book, at least in bit parts - school shootings, Halliburton, colonialism, Mitch McConnell, global warming, Californian wildfires, Tucker Carlson, the pay gap, ExxonMobil, systemic racism, Israel, voter disenfranchisement, Wall Street, tax cuts for the rich, the Koch brothers, corporate mergers, the War on Drugs, Saudi Arabia, mass pollution and destruction of the environment, the War on Terror, bafflingly viscious liberal hatred of progressive presidential candidates, NAFTA and Democrat's complacency in the war on peace and prosperity, just to name a few. It has ONLY gotten worse, as evidenced by a passage where Moore mentions he read that the North Pole had melted. The italics communicated a shock that to us in the year 2019 is almost unfathomable as, I am sure, some of us are surprised to know that there even is any ice there left to melt. The way we now treat this as a fact of life - which, sadly, it has become - is horrifying. There have been no improvements. It's utterly depressing.On a lighter note, in terms of the book's quality, there isn't much to say. The writing is nothing special, as is the fairly middling humor. It does an adequate job of informing you of the state of the USA in the early Bush years, although that also means that to those of us fortunate enough not to he American citizens, many of the things in the book are irrelevant. Then again, it was not written for us.From a political perspective, I wish it had been more radical. Does he actually... like Jimmy Carter? Why would any progressive appeal to America as an institution, this horrible genocidal Empire, built on slavery and colonialism, this nation of settlers which not only fails its own people, including the natives and the descendents of literal slaves brought in to help settle its stolen land, but continues to wage war on a global scale and serves as the ladgest arbiter of capitalism, punishing those who fail to adhere to its demands with murder, terrorism and genocide?The chapter ""Kill Whitey"" does occasionally border on virtue signalling (yes I'm using that term and I don't care) and uses the N-word a bit too liberally for my taste, as well as (at least as I perceived it) occasionally employing ""urban slang"" in a very... cringy way. ""The End of Men"" is also just insulting tongue-in-cheek gender essentialism of the Buzzfeed variety.In the chapter ""We're Number One"" there is some questionable both-sidism on the topic of Israel, something that has absolutely no place in this discussion. We know who are the aggressors and who the victims - those whose children are routinely slaughtered, who are driven from their homes, who suffer from random bombings and shootings, who live in an open-air prison/concentration camp with no access to running water or sewage disposal, who face Apartheid and genocide. His proposed solutions have been proven wrong over and over again over the past two decades - no one cares about the mass murder committed against peaceful protesters (and CHILDREN, for God's sake!) and the claim that ""the Jews"" are all alone in the world and that no one cares about them (which supposedly is responsible for ""their"" fighting spirit in killing every Palestinian they can) is laughable seeing as Israel is supported by the world's most powerful nation. Every attempt to excuse Israel's crimes against humanity has to be vigorously opposed, this fascist state and its people of European and American settlers do not deserve our sympathies. The rest of the chapter is, for the most part, utterly pointless, proposing various humorous solutions no one asked for to various conflicts he doesn't seem very knowledgeable about (then again, neither am I, so I could be wrong).The book's ultimate failure, though, is trying to find solutions within the framework of capitalism and current systems of power when it has now become apparent that we need to abolish capitalism not just to live bearable lives but also to ensure the survival of our species.",0,-0.9966,0.147,0.759,0.094,0.487027588813303,NEGATIVE,0.9975

If there has to be a big radical right, then there has to be a brash loud left?? Yes I like him, but that didn't stop me cringing slightly over several chapters.His attack on Bush, starting off that he claimed the Presidency in 2000 by coup and a corrupt Supreme Court seems very glib. Yes he had 500,000 votes less than Gore but Democracy is representative not a straight forward tally of people sticking hands in the air. In Britain we have had two elections in my life time where the winning party had less ballot crosses than the next lot. If Gore had been an overall choice of the people it wouldn't have come down to a few old Jewish people in Florida getting confused. His further attacks on Bush seem childish. Asking if he can read. The drink driving incident and possible cocaine use. Lets assume most people with a college education have at one time got high off more than beer, and not embarrass eachother by asking for confirmations.I was a bit hesitant when I read his ideas on Palestine as this is something I care deeply about. I didn't want him to be glib about this and to my surprise he was bang on. Make Israel earn their hand outs from American tax-payers by commiting to peace and not social cleansing. Diverting the funds to roads and public works in Gaza. This would show the Muslim world what a free dynamic Arab state looks like, and maybe just maybe they'd follow democracy also. I loved his analogy of how abused children often grow up to abuse, and this is with nation states. This was true with Cambodia and it is certainly true with Israel. I was nodding in agreement at what is undeniably this generations South Africa. Then he moves onto Ireland and it goes a bit wrong.I may look like I have a bias, but Irish terrorism is or was not the same as terrorism against Israel. That is not to say that any terrorism is justifiable. However, Irish Republicanism always had a democratic means to have complete home rule for the whole of Ireland. Sinn Fein just never received the support it wanted with most catholic votes going to the SDLP. Sinn Fein and it's army the IRA were essentially bad losers in the democratic process. Palestinian groups are generally kept out of the Knessnet. A political quango where one Ultra-Orthodox party keeps itself in coalition means the Palestinian groups feel they have no process apart from disobedience. Now for a country (USA) born of the mantra ""no taxation without representation"" to glorify in song and art the American Revolution, is it right to call Washington and Adams terrorists of the time? Maybe look to the moderate Palestinians and even feel a glow of patriotism as the try to live the original American dream. I've digressed here, but Mikeys answer to the Irish Troubles is for all Protestants to become Catholic. Brilliant! I can see no flaws to that. Oh he was joking? Well we don't laugh at things like that.I think Mr Moore is someone who is necessary as an entertainer but overly inflates his political importance. I have always been attracted to the left as it always seemed this was the side where we consider controversy and highlight solutions as well as problems.

He still destroyed lives, social support structures, and desired to do so. He's the precursor to Trump. ",0,-0.8066,0.119,0.776,0.105,0.3665895061728395,NEGATIVE,0.9997
221,80294749,12/08/2009,3.0,"I read Michael Moore’s book on the occasion of the second Bush administration’s departure from power and Moore’s condemnation of the first 2 years of the administration looks prescient given how things actually turned out. Moore suspected things were going to go badly but obviously he misunderestimated the magnitude. I also read it because Moore claims in a subsequent book that originally there was an effort to quash its distribution. And in what remote, obscure location did the publisher try to hide the books? – Scranton, PA.Moore is easily at his best in the opening chapters when he is reviewing Florida irregularities in 2000 and in tracing the loose confederation of Bush allies who ultimately decided the election in his favor. There are better accounts of the machinations (see Allan Dershowitz’s discussion of The Supreme Court’s actions for one) but they lack that crazed anarchist tone that Moore uses. One imagines Michael replaces computer keyboards on a fairly regular basis and that his trademark baseball cap hides the results of tufts of hair yanked out during writing sessions. Later chapters deal with pilots (they’re underpaid), teachers (they’re underpaid) and African-Americans (they’re underpaid). After listening to Moore scream about it, I agreed that pilots seemed to be underpaid but so are police, fire fighters and many other professions. Underpaid teachers are a frequent target of writers; many of them are far more eloquent and propose actual policy changes as compared to Moore who spends many pages complaining about American education and very few proposing any new direction. The material on race is again compelling but is handled much better (without all the arm-waving hyperbole) by writers like Taylor Cox. While there is little doubt about his feelings on the Bush 43 presidency and organized labor, Moore’s views on the environment and American industry are far less clear. He somewhat proudly doesn’t recycle and drives a van that gets 15MPG. Yet he criticizes the Bush and Clinton administrations on their environment policies. He relates that he drove a Honda for many years and appreciates the quality Japanese cars deliver. Yet he is very obviously on the side of the American auto worker. Once we pass the boundaries of the U.S., the level of thought declines precipitously. Moore suggests that the sectarian violence in Yugoslavia could be remedied by dropping Yugos on the country – a comment neither productive nor funny. Suggestions on dealing with the Middle East and other geopolitical hotspots aren’t much more valuable.The books eventually comes full circle with Moore taking credit (or blame) for the contested 2000 Bush victory. He details his involvement with Ralph Nader’s independent campaign and tries to show how his (Moore’s) support of Nader earned the Green Party enough of the votes that would have otherwise gone to Gore to swing the decision. The story feels more like self-serving hubris than historical record but it is very much in keeping with the tone of the rest of Moore’s work which largely center around his outrage rather than the manifest topic at hand.",0,0.9834,0.075,0.809,0.115,0.3872359340006399,NEGATIVE,0.9894

He discusses every social ill out there such as election fraud, judicial rascality, corporate greed, environmental recklessness, government complacence and connivance and everything evil you thought was going on in high places. This is conspiracy theory revealed, it is for real and it’s totally uncensored.Michael basically blames all problems facing his home town, State, Country and the entire planet on the efforts of Stupid White Men. Some of his reasons being that they own 90% of global wealth, they make all the guns used in legal and illegal violence, their companies make all chemicals and compounds that pollute the environment, he emphasises that no other race has dropped a nuclear bomb on an enemy except stupid white men.His writing style is informal – ok its way informal, almost casual, and he has got quite a mouth on him, so get ready for a few curse words…. And Yes, he used the N word too, in a good way though. LOL. He is also unafraid to take shots at himself so expect some self-mockery too. He tackles his weight, gait and the fact that all members of the Bush family tend to defeat him psychologically.

Just because you don’t eat the mad men is no reason to ignore the serious safety issue here.” In the first chapter titled A Very American Coup he described the American President thus “it used to be that politicians would wait until they were in office before they became crooks. This one came prepackaged”. In the 4th chapter titled kill whitey you find a sentence that goes “no black guy ever built or used a bomb designed to wipe out hordes of innocent people, whether in Oklahoma, Columbine or Hiroshima.

The book has it's thoughtful passages that lights up new aspects and views on American politics that I do appreciate as a European not too involved with foreign policies. As I read these passages I go:"" aah this is actually some good stuff"" but three sentences later Moore breaks out in an almost childish tantrum that I found a bit fascinating in the beginning of book but as the tantrums increased I couldn't help feeling vaguely irritated. I didn't see the points of these very emotionally charged passages and they did not increase his credibility as an author but portrays him as a crybaby that cannot manage his emotions like an adult. I was left with a feeling of disappointment as I finally closed the book, in high school psychology, my class viewed Fahrenheit 9/11 and it really blew my mind and awoke emotions that I didn't know I had in me (I wrote a 15 paged essay on the aftermath of 9/11 as a 16 year old where I throughly roasted Bush, the Iraq war etc and I had a good time) and Bowling for Columbine and another documentary concerning gun laws brought my expectations to high levels.

I have great respect for Michael Moore and had high hopes for the book.  Alas, I was very disappointed.  The book opens on its high point -- Mr. Moore's excellent characterization of how the first W.

In the recounting of the ""accomplishments"" of the administration, you'll be fascinated to know that many of the areas where spending is through the roof now were originally cut back . . . such as areas related to national security.  After that, the only other good section was the one about how racism is based on false beliefs about African Americans rather than personal experience.

If it were just humor, I would laugh. But the ""solutions"" seem to be seriously intended. For instance, the Middle East will become peaceful if Arabs learn to emulate Gandhi and use non-violent protest methods. Really? I wonder if he even knew that there are two groups of Muslims that are routinely waging war on one another.  In other places, I think he was trying to be humorous . . . but it didn't work well enough to be funny.

Many things Bush did in his time as president were thought to have been initiated by himself which is not the case... the lack of collective memory of these things shows once again what you can achieve with a winning persona. Lots of charm can get you a long way...And if the last few years and the elections now show something, is that history always repeats itself... and we the people are happy to bow to whomever is in charge as long as our rights are taken away with enough smiles and assurance that all will be better, because they have our backs.",0,0.9888,0.066,0.785,0.15,0.5810344827586207,NEGATIVE,0.7069

America is still convulsed by issues of racial equality. The Israel-Palestine conflict still burns. North Korea has not been brought in from the cold. There are many who detest the Democratic and Republican parties in equal measure.In some respects, Moore called it right. George W Bush was (in my opinion anyway) a disaster as president. The dodgy dealings with Dick Cheney's business associates look even more suspicious when they benefitted the most from the invasion and destruction of a sovereign state. Bill Clinton's complex legacy has come back to haunt his wife during her own bid for the presidency.But the book is also a time capsule. Moore talks about Enron as one of Cheney's corrupt corporate partners, as if this is surprising. That's because when the book was published, Enron had not yet collapsed, after it's 'creative accounting' was revealed. There is no mention of the Iraq War, the financial crisis. They were all in the future.The biggest omission gives this book most poignancy. This book was sat in warehouses, ready to ship to bookshops, when terror descended from the skies one September morning in 2001. Apart from an added epilogue, the defining moment of American history in the 2000s is completely missing.

His overall points more or less align with my own politics, and so I find myself wishing that the main voice for these issues in the early 2000's had been more reasonable overall instead of so hyperbolic about it, so the world could not just write him off the way they did Michael Moore.

Many parts are downright offensive, such as his comments on alcoholism.Some parts (let's be honest, several, but some are worse than others...but really it's probably most of the book?) are hopefully satire, but they aren't really amusing enough to be successful as such, and read as pure stupidity.

Some of them are trivial (like George W. Bush's three arrests--I think he gets to hold the record among the 43 presidents on that score); some aren't (the U.S. is number one in the number of international human rights treaties not signed).One thing Moore does that you would never see from his counterparts on the right is that he doesn't hesitate to criticize those of the liberal persuasion, as he is as damning of Clinton's environmental and business-friendly record as he is of Bush the Lesser's. You certainly won't find strong criticism of Bush in the current political right bestseller, even though it is warranted.This isn't a book to pass to your conservative minded friends, though, because not only are they going to dislike the message, they're going to hate the messenger and how he delivers the message.

Also, since 9/11 happened he believes that president Bush had a say in it. Michael Moore is really against him and wants to make a change because he thought it will make a big difference in our country.

According to Moore, at least, Bush didn’t actually win the election – in fact, he broke the law to make it look as though he did.The nuances of that, and what it implies, are too much to go into here, and so if you want to find out more then you ought to read the book.
