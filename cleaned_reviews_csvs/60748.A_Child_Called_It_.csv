0,67284483,08/13/2009,2.0,"This book was horrible. Period. A waste of my time. You see, what really pisses me off with this book is this: I have known kids that have come from horribly abusive situations that are more genuine than Pelzer is in his ""memoir."" The stories of his life in this book contradict one another, are extremely over-the-top and, dare I say, fabricated some. Now, before anyone wants to crucify me, look at the facts:His family members were interviewed and stated that this was pure fantasy. (I can concede that the family members may have lied.)He bought numerous copies of his own book to inflate sales records so that the book would have a better chance at getting on bestseller lists. (Again, I can concede that he was only helping his writing along by wanting his book to be seen by a greater audience.)However, and here is the kicker for me, if this story is true, then shouldn't just writing it and getting the story told redemption enough for Pelzer? A story of this magnitude should be told, there's no doubt about that. But it should be told with grace and humility. Pelzer should have approached this book as an avatar to the thousands of other kids out there that don't have a voice. Instead, Pelzer grandstands and makes the issue of child abuse seem like a sensationalistic piece of family trivia. Very disappointing.WASTE OF TIME",197,-0.902,0.109,0.822,0.069,0.5723684210526316,NEGATIVE,1.0

He is best known for his 1995 memoir of childhood abuse, A Child Called ""It"".It is the story of the early years of a boy's life, and a real and moving memory. It is Dave Pelzer's childhood, under torture and brutal starvation by his mother (who was unstable and constantly intoxicated). From the mother's point of view, her son was no longer her beloved child, he was a slave, nor a boy, but ""nothing"" and that was ""It"". The boy's bed, or old military blanket, was in the basement. His clothes were torn and frail. If the mother allowed him to eat, he would eat only the leftovers in the dog foods. ""David"" dreamed of finding a family, to love him and consider him their child. He endured years of struggle, deprivation and despair, to fulfill his dreams, and to leave something of himself in this world. ...عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «کودکی به نام هیچ»؛ «بچه‌ ای که صداش می‌کردند «اوهوی!»»؛ «سرگذشت پسری که میخواست زنده بماند»؛ «داستان زندگی من»؛ نویسنده دیو پلزر؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز چهارم ماه اکتبر سال2004میلادیعنوان: کودکی به نام هیچ؛ نویسنده: دیو پلزر؛ مترجم: حمید خادمی؛ تهران، معانی، سال1381؛ در141ص، مصور؛ عنوانهای دیگر: سرگذشت پسری که میخواست زنده بماند؛ کودکی به نام «هیچ»؛ موضوع کودکان آزار دیده؛ داستان دیوید جی پلزر از نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده20معنوان: بچه‌ ای که صداش می‌کردند «اوهوی!»؛ نویسنده: دیو پلزر؛ مترجم: امیرابراهیم جلالیان؛ تهران، آفرینگان، سال1383؛ در141ص، مصور؛ عنوان: سرگذشت پسری که میخواست زنده بماند؛ کودکی به نام «هیچ»؛ چاپ دوم سال1393؛ شابک9789647694155؛ عنوان: داستان زندگی من؛ مترجم: مهشید احمد پناه؛ اصفهان، مهرافروز، سال1386؛ در540ص؛ شابک9789649125435؛داستان سالهای آغازین زندگی پسرکی، و یادمانی واقعی، و تاثرآور است؛ داستان اراده ای برای زنده ماندن؛ و کودکانگی «دیوید پلرز» است، در زیر شكنجه‌ ها، و گرسنگی دادن‌های وحشیانه مادرش (كه بی‌ ثبات و دائم‌ الخمر بود)؛ از نظر مادر، پسرش دیگر نه فرزند دلبند او، كه یک برده بود، و نه پسر بچه، بلكه «هیچ» بود، و بس؛ بستر پسرک، یا همان پتوی سربازی کهنه، در زیرزمین خانه، قرار داشت؛ لباس‌هایش پاره، و بویناک بودند؛ اگر مادر اجازه می‌داد، تا غذایی بخورد، تنها تكه‌ های باقیمانده در ظرف سگ‌ها را، می‌خورد؛ «دیوید»، رویای یافتن خانواده‌ ای را داشت، تا او را دوست بدارند، و فرزند خویش بشمارند؛ او سال‌ها كشمكش، محرومیت، و نومیدی را تاب آورد، تا رویاهایش را، برآورده سازد، و چیزی از خود در این جهان، به یادگار بگذارد؛ ...؛تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 22/11/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 17/10/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی",141,-0.4559,0.056,0.904,0.04,0.3948717948717948,NEGATIVE,0.9056
2,3267435,07/19/2007,5.0,"Easily the most terrifying book I've ever read. I think I had literally repressed the memory of it, until I randomly happened across the title this week. I experienced this book in a fairly odd way, during a week-long cheerleading camp my sophomore year of high school. My coach was reading it and somehow ended up reading the entire book aloud to my squad during breaks and at night. Once she started, we were all addicted and spent every free moment listening with rapt and horrified attention. I remember with almost painful clarity the way in which we sat at her feet listening to this story of a boy who endured a long childhood of astonishing, sadistic abuse at the hands of his mother. Girls were crying for long stretches, and not being a crier myself, I listened in a sort of shell-shocked, wide-eyed paralysis. After every single part of the reading, I was convinced it couldn't get worse, that she couldn't possibly do anything worse to that little boy. And every single time I was wrong. I'm not sure I would actually recommend this book or not. It is good - very good - but reads with the sort of harrowing inhumanity of a Holocaust memoir. Not light reading, and not a feel-good ""I survived the odds"" story. It kind of just makes you want to go home and tell your parents that you love them, and then bawl your eyes out.

3,18471482,03/23/2008,5.0,"A Child Called ""It"" HCI, 1995 $9.95By Dave Pelzer ISBN 1558743669	One very common issue that goes around in our world is child abuse, it happens everywhere and it is something that is horrible and cannot be stopped. Dave Pelzer, the author of the autobiographical book, A Child Called It, shows the very dark corners of child abuse by viewing to the readers his horrific life as a young boy living with his mother that constantly abused him.	Dave Pelzer, who lived with his unstable, disturbed, alcoholic mother in a town in California during the early 70's, explains his story about his torturous unforgettable years as a young boy. Throughout the story, he does his best to survive from his mother and tries to stay alive from the pain of hunger, bruises and cuts he receives. The only thing that keeps him alive are his dreams, wanting a happy and safe family, and also being someone. 	It’s terrifying to think after reading this that, this really had happened to someone, it isn’t fake. This made me say to myself, “wow, life can be so messed up, but you can survive even the most horrible things, as long as you follow your dream, and keep it with you as close as possible.” I believe this is the message, Dave Pelzer is trying to reach out, not only to the people who get abused consistently, but also to those who suffer a great deal of pain from something terrible everyday. Once you have read the last word of the story, and closed the book, you will definitely know that this book has just changed your life, and your perspective of issues like these around the world, trust me, that is a fact.",83,-0.9533,0.156,0.742,0.102,0.6020588235294119,POSITIVE,0.7582
4,2730819,07/05/2007,1.0,"I did not like this book. But that's okay. You're not supposed to like it. It's a horrible, horrible book. A trainwreck of a book. I wanted to look away, but just couldn't. I know it's the first part in a trilogy, but I doubt I'm going to read the other two books. It was too, too depressing.Actually, the person I got most angry with was the father. The mother was obviously sick and needed help. There's no other explanation for the awful things she subjected her son to. But what's the father's excuse? He just stood by and did nothing? No, that's not true - he stood by and did nothing... and THEN he abandoned the family. I don't get it. Nowhere in the book was it stated that he seemed afraid of his wife, so why did he allow her to treat their son so horribly? You don't just stand by and let your SO practically kill your son, you just don't!There were two things I would have liked to know: 1) What made David different from the rest of his brothers? Why was he the one who was treated so horribly? If his mother had had some kind of reason, just something that set him apart, it would at least be part of an explanation even if it's no excuse, but it seemed totally random. I guess it was... after all, sick people often don't need reasons for doing as they do. 2) What happened to his mother afterwards? Did she get some kind of help? Were her other boys taken away from her too? The book ended in a cliff-hanger fashion which annoyed me. Too many loose ends.I don't recommend it. Most of you would never treat a child like that anyway, and if you would, no amount of reading about it would change your opinion that you're in the 'right'. The only time I would encourage reading it is if you know somebody you fear may be subjected to child abuse, or if you want to be convinced that you should become a foster parent.",72,-0.9955,0.207,0.706,0.087,0.6509188034188036,NEGATIVE,1.0
5,18786424,03/27/2008,5.0,"Oh my god, what can I possibly say about this book? When I first started reading this book last year, I was just so hooked to it and I just wanted to know everything about this book. It was all about this author's childhood gone horrible with the extreme abuse, the torture and suffering. I really couldn't believe my eyes, the author described like, everything he went through, all the pain he had to go through, how he felt and everything. I could really understand how he felt but one thing about this book I don't get at all is how his own mother transformed from a loving mother to a nightmarish, abusive mother so quickly. I mean, the author was only, like a little boy when his mother started abusing him.This book is extremely emotional and can make you feel so bad for the author and even cry so. This book was all about the author's childhood and how he survived through such abuse, starvation, and neglect. This also showed how bad things happen to good people - the author's own father didn't even help out at all - he was once a fun, loving fireman, turned into an alcoholic, carless father. The only way for the author to get help was through school but the only thing that kept him from telling the school the truth was his fear of his mother going after him and make his life last through hell forever; even though the school sort of already knew, from all the bruises on him, him stealing the children's food because of hunger, from his mother starving the author and how he constantly uses identical/unreasonable lies about his bruises and wounds. He was pratically stabbed in the belly and had to go through such pain. His faith and hope kept him going & he never let his mother win this sick game. In the end, he told the school the truth and he was finally taken out of the horrible home, with the abusive mother, two brothers that weren't treated horribly at all and the careless, alcoholic father - and put into a much better home - foster home.

6,3223208,07/18/2007,2.0,"I've sat with this book on my desk for a couple weeks, unable to decide what I would write for a review. I'm wholly torn between this being one of my most-asked-for and least-favorite-ever titles. I wish the amount of times I heard ""this was the first book I liked"" (and the amount of times it's been billed/stolen from the library) corresponded to its quality, but I truly found it very short on redeeming qualities. Eric's Goodreads review says pretty much what I would say. The writing was cliched and the ""plot"" moved along by way of ""one day,"" ""one Sunday,"" or ""later."" There was never any explanation attempted for the mother's instant transformation from idyllic homemaker to savage abuser (unless you are supposed to infer that it's alcohol's fault, in which case, talk a little about alcoholism). There is absolutely no process of recovery or explanation or psychological background, and the book leaves huge questions open, saying ""Please understand that many of your questions will be answered in the next two books in the trilogy series."" That made me want to throw it across the room. It's a great marketing gimmick for fiction, but not for a supposedly true story. That kind of self-exploitation leaves a bad taste in my mouth. As for ""truth,"" the NYTimes article ""Dysfunction for Dollars"" sheds some very interesting light on Dave's story:http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage...

7,17888720,03/16/2008,5.0,"Okay, this is going to be a short and sweet review since it's a non-fictional autobiography and you can't really critique things like characters and story. But I'm going to say what I can...This book was a hard one to read yet I couldn't put it down. There's a different something in Dave's story that will keep different people reading. Mine was: Why? I wanted to know why his mother did this. I wanted to know what made her do it. I wanted to know how she could to it. And I wanted to know why it was Dave she picked out of him and his brothers. What made Dave the one she singled out for such monstrous torture. But that's something people involved in child abuse cases ask themselves every day.You really do feel for Dave. You don't feel with him because there are moments so bad that he has to disconnect himself. I couldn't do that while reading it though. I almost felt that if I could send my anger and frustration and sadness and hope out there it would stop. Of course it was foolish of me seeing as it happened many years ago and he's a grown man who escaped his mothers claws.I was only annoyed by the fact that the book was too short and that dividing his story into three seperate books seemed unnecessary. Especially because by the end the reader has become so invested in Dave and feels like they're such a part of his life, they want to go with him as he continues on to the next, hopefully happier chapter in his life. Perhaps it was a publishers marketing scheme to get more money or something. Goodness knows it wasn't Dave's. His goal was to tell his story, thank those who helped him, and open a door to shed light on an issue that is often hidden away. All of which he accomplished magnificently.What we learn in Dave's story is that child abuse is real. It comes in many forms, but it's out there and it's up to those of us in the lives of children to stand up and be the voice for the abused. Another thing we learn is to not back down in that fight, of course there will be road blocks, but if you champion for a child as those special people in Dave's life did, you can help. You can save a life, heart, and soul. You can give a child hope.This book is a must-read I'd say. I of course went out and got the follow-up (I hate to use the word sequel with something like this) and read it right away. That's a review to follow later. If you are debating about reading this book I will just say that it is a hard read. If you're a mother it will probably be especially hard. If you have a deep compassion and love for children it will probably be hard. If you yourself have experienced abuse it will probably be hard. If you just have a heart it will be hard. But don't give up. It would be even harder to just quit in the middle, trust me on that. It's that end, despite being a beginning, that will bring tears to your eyes and a much needed smile to your face.",54,0.8824,0.088,0.815,0.097,0.4720723104056438,NEGATIVE,0.9999

In The Child Called ""It"", a true story that can bring tears to the eyes of anyone with a beating heart, Dave, the protagonist, is abused in the most horrifying ways possible. What kind of mother would want to hurt their own little child? David's mom's actions can prove that wrong. ""Once, I ate some leftover pork. Hours later I bent over in extreme pain ... While I was sick, Mother informed me she had purposefully left the meat in the refrigerator for two weeks, to spoil before she threw it away"" (Pelzer 63). The book tells of a little child, Dave, the protagonist, who goes through many troubles throughout the book. He lives with his crazy, obnoxious, abusive mother who would go out of her way to torture David. His father, who had once been his guardian angel, has left the family because of all the argument after arguments he had with David's mother. Dave's mother would do crazy things like, putting his hands over the oven, lock him in the bathroom with deadly chemicals, or she doesn't feed him for really long. This book can make me cry all over again every time ii read it. I can relate to the terror little David has to go through, because my mother wasn't much different from David's mom.

10,367798497,07/13/2012,1.0,"I'm a little annoyed...Tonight I read a book entitled ""A Chiled Called 'It'"" and I believe it's fiction, to say the least.""A Child Called 'It'"" is a story about a boy who survives horrendous over-the-top abuse at the hands of his mother. It basically reads as a long list of horrors that the author describes in grisly detail and sometimes depicts with startling clarity...My problems with the book are many, For the sake of brevity however, I'll just list a few:--He couldn't remember the color of his mothers eyes or hair, yet he remembered even the dates of certain abuses, the number of hits, the words said, and every fleeting thought. He remembers each abuse in vivid detail, clarity and full color descriptions. --He remembers too many specifics; One *tiny* example taken from the end of chapter two: ""... The green river was as smooth as glass. The bluejays scolded the other birds, and a warm breeze blew through my hair. Without a word, we stood watching the firebhall-like sun as it sank behind the tall trees, leaving bright blue and orange streaks in the sky. From above, I felt someone hug my shoulders...."" (Keep in mind that he was like 8 or 9 in that 'memory.' There are lots of these scenes throughout the book. Yes I remember certain things in my childhood quite vividly, but not *so* well that I could tell you when a warm breeze ruffled my hair.--After the first chapter (which is really the end of this story), the second chapter is devoted to describing the absolute perfect family in which he lived; perfect experiences and happiness in every way. There isn't even a hint of trouble like ""mother had a drink with breakfast every day for the whole vacation"" -- nothing like that.. Yet the first paragraph of chapter 3 reads ""My relationship with Mom drastically changed from discipline to punishment that grew out of control. It became so bad at times, I had no strength to crawl away -- even if it meant saving my life."" That's a hell of a jump there. Out of nowhere she starts drinking heavily and the abuse starts.--He recalls MANY times being shoved into a locked bathroom with a bucket containing Ammonia and Bleach. (This he called the gas-chamber game.) Each time it would happen, he'd be locked in there for a goodly amount of time.... And yet he suffered no permanent lung damage? He joined the service, and I'm amazed his lungs worked well enough to get him through basic training.--He describes his stabbing, and how his blood ""completely soaked through"" a number of shirts. And how he himself squeezed the pus out of it to rid of the infection that had set in. Pretty good for a (10?) year old.I don't know.. I just got a real funny feeling about the whole thing, and I've learned to trust my instincts, SO I turn to the internet, and for the past few hours have been searching and reading and searching and reading... I even watched a couple of interviews with Dave Pelzer (author / victim), and the man gives me the absolute impression of a charlatan. He speaks of his childhood abuses too flippantly, and seems more obsessed about book and ticket sales than he does about getting his story out.There is no doubt that child abuse happens. But just because it CAN happen, doesn't mean it happened to HIM. And even if he was abused as a child, I honestly believe he embellished his stories to the point of absurdity, and that is what makes me angry. Making up stories, or even embelishing on stories of abuse, cheapens what is *actually* happening to kids around the world.That is my opinion of this book: It's a fake. Just do the research, read the articles and watch the videos. Make up your own mind, but I'll bet you find his story is at least somewhat suspicious.

13,2888487388,07/09/2019,2.0,"Please note: Before I get into this review I want to make it very clear that I believe that David Pelzer was abused and did go through serious trauma as a child. However, by allowing this book to be published and available to the public, he has given room for the details of the abuse suffered, to be open to speculation. Warning of Spoilers.A Child Called It was written 1995, is a first-hand account of the abuse Pelzer suffered from the ages of 4 to 12, at the hands of his alcoholic mother. He describes how his mother withheld food and starved him, forced him to drink ammonia (I have reservations about this which I will get into later), stabbed him in the stomach (again, I am wondering about this), burned his arm on a hot stove, forced him to eat vomit and excrement and locked him in the bathroom which a mix of chemicals which he had to inhaled, repeatedly gassing himself, until he vomited blood and passed out (I seriously question the validity of this event).David also mentions in the book that his father did nothing to stop the abuse from happening, eventually leaving home, letting Dave battle with this mother alone. My opinionI have one or two serious reservation about the validity of David's recanting of the abuse he suffered. I don't understand how David simply didn't die at the hands of his mother. He describes not being fed for 10 days which I find very hard to believe as he was already malnourished. 10 days without food for a young child, you are running into organ failure and death. Leading on from this point I personally believe he exaggerated the details of other events such as:The drinking of ammonia, which will KILL a adult, never mind a starved, abused child, I have no doubt that if this was to have occurred his mouth and throat would have been seriously burnt, as would his stomach and liver. 100% would have required medical attention to stop further damage.The stabbing incident which apparently his mother has enough sense in her drunken state to have the medical skill to know how to be able to repair a stab wound to the stomach without having David permanently physically disabled, bleed out and die. The ""gas chamber"" punishment, this boggled my mind. David states that he vomited blood and passed out due to a lack of oxygen. How he didn't suffocate and sustain serious mental damage is nothing short of a miracle in my mind!!!!My last point on this is that David recalls the events that occurred with incredible clarity. This is why I believe he has massively exaggerated some points of this book. Trauma plays tricks on the brain, especially on a child's brain. A child who has undergone as horrific treatment as David described most likely won't be able to remember all the events described. If he did exaggerate or fabricate some of the incidents then this would explain the large amounts of detail.At the end of the day, what needs to be remembered is that A Child Called It has given voice to all the cases of child abused which otherwise would have gone unheard. It raised flaws in the social service system and highlighted how little we know of what goes on for children behind closed doors.That is truly powerful and explains why I gave the book at least some stars even though I question the validity of his claims.

And blessed be the book, it became mine asap. This memoir is one heartbreaking read narrating in details about the physical and emotional abuse of Dave Pelzer ever since he was 7 years old. Things never became better for this boy. His only hope, his dad, left him too unable to bear the taunts of his wife. I never would have thought how cruel and evil a mother can be towards her child. This has got to be one of the worst cases of child abuse I would ever read. I totally agree with the author that what's worse than the abuser is the one who was supposed to save you as the one silently watching you suffer and not doing anything about it. This is one of the best, hard-hitting memoirs I have ever read. But I do not understand the idea of leaving it so incomplete without a proper ending. Yes, I have to read the sequel to know how he got rescued.I appreciate how the book is written so well and cleverly for that matter.You can actually feel what he as a child went through. You really want to help him but as a reader you are so helpless. And moreover you know he would survive through it all. But you cannot help feeling broken each moment Dave became more broken. It's his strength and the will to survive each day and not his 'weakness' (as he used to feel) that makes this memoir so powerful. I do not read such memoirs to make myself feel better knowing how previledged I am or how lucky I am. But I do choose to read such memoirs and such books to know how we as human show our worse ways and be the worse as we can be. On the other hand, I come to know how we as human can deal with the worst possible conditions and how we can come out of such situations rather than cursing our fates. I am so thankful to the author for such a powerful memoir. (I deliberately left out any event or the details regarding the abuse in this review. I feel it is the right of the author to reveal or not regarding any information.)",35,0.6956,0.124,0.741,0.134,0.5235958485958485,POSITIVE,0.9812

Apparently, there is some doubt on whether the story is actually true, or whether the author merely made the whole thing up. I don't know enough about the controversy to speculate, so I will just give the author the benefit of the doubt and assume this is indeed a factual memoir of his childhood. If that is the case, then he most certainly deserves major admiration for having overcome such incredible adversities and for sharing his story. That being said, this book is very poorly written. It is essentially just one description of one abusive incident after another, and nothing more. There's no real introspection, and no explanation as to how he later found forgiveness, or why the mother was once a kind, loving parent and suddenly one day just went completely mad. A book that describes overcoming any kind of extreme hardship, ending with a message about hope and the ability of the human spirit to triumph, can be both moving and inspiring.

I really loved this book, but the subject of this book is hard to read. The way the book is written is easy to read, but the subject is not of people that gets upsets by hard to read subjects. My childhood was not great, and I had a Mother that had mental health issues and she did drugs/drink way to much. I was very lucky because I had a strong Grandmother that would not back down. My Grandmother always show up when things got bad because she stopped by our house on the way home everyday. She know something was going on. When I told my Grandmother I did not want to live with my parents anymore at the age of 10 years old. She went to mother and told her she was taking me to her house. She got my Mother to sign some paperwork two days later, and I never know what it was until I was 18 years old. It turns out my Grandmother give my mother her land for me. To this day I love my Grandmother with all my heart for want she did to save me. I wish someone strong will took on this child's mother. I also wonder while reading this book if the mother in this book had mental health issues, but I am not saying that gives her any reason to do what she did. What also made me love my Grandmother is she did not turn her back on my Mother that needed help. My mother was my Grandmother's daughter-in-law, so she did not have to do anything for her. But, I also learn when I was 15 years old my Grandmother checked on my Mother everyday after she took me to school. My Grandmother told me that my mother was sick and needed help to, and she could never turn her back on someone that needed help. I started to help my Grandmother take care of my mother when I was 16 until I was 20 years old. I stopped when I was 20 years old because my Mother took her own life. I do not have a lot of good memories of the time I lived with my mother, but I have found peace.

Now that I am finished reading it and have read some other reviews of the book on Goodreads, plus a NY Times article linked from another Goodreads review, I am inclined to believe the author is a liar.

He also tells everyone who listens that ""A Child Called It"" was nominated for a Pulitzer, when it really wasn't. Submitted for review, maybe. Plus, how are you going to believe someone can recall graphic scenes from their childhood, but not what their mother looked like? Would have been nice if the Times reporter had interviewed the teachers who reported his abuse (if, in fact those people and reports weren't fabricated) or if the reporter had looked for the police report taken when Pelzer was removed from his home.

19,786558266,12/10/2013,,"My book review is over A Child Called “IT” By: Dave Pelzer. This book is a true story about a child’s devastating childhood in which he experienced child abuse physically and verbally. David’s child abuse first started when he was only two and a half years old, and continued for ten years after that.David’s abuse came from his mother who once was a loving woman that cared for her children and was willing to do anything for them and her husband. Quickly all the good in his mother turned to bad.David’s mother was mentally unstable, was an alcoholic, and did drugs. She soon began playing cruel twisted ‘life or death’ games with David. She locked him in bathrooms with cleaning chemicals giving David no option but to inhale them, she nearly starved David to death, she made him sleep in the basement on a cottage, and she stabbed him, with refusal to take him to the hospital. David’s childhood was filled with multiple events involving abuse. David’s mom even stopped calling him ‘David’ and started calling him ‘It’ because to her he was nothing and worthless. This book provides you with amazing details making you feel like you’re there in person with David himself. This book really made me realize the difficulties people face in the world and not to treat anyone with disrespect because you never know what might be happening at their home. David Pelzer blew me away with A Child Called It. His life story brought so much sympathy to heart and tears to my eyes. I definitely couldn’t stop reading without wanting to know what was next in this amazing book.

Yet I must say this book is extremely poorly written. It is structured in a sense similar to a pointless shopping list: so first my mother did this to me, then she did this, I was starving, afterwards she did this and I felt so terrible. Pelzer basically just described, no scratch that, he stated the unfortunate things that have happened to him in sequence. There are no character traits or branches of the story. Everything revolves around his mother and punishments; the book touches on nothing else. There are also no literary devices. Normally I don't really care about that, but the lack of writing skills has, honestly, made this book quite bland.A little synopsis of the book: Dave Pelzer was born the third of five children. His mother, one day, suddenly changed into a completely different person: from a kind and lovely mother, she transformed into one who starved and tortured Dave.What bothers me the most is the improbability of Dave's statements. These punishments Dave had gotten since four years old or so are so radical and crude that I am skeptical of what have really happened. Of course, I have no rights to judge. Pelzer's account is just way too farfetched. These things *did* happen to him, just not to this extent.These are reasons for my claims:1. The mother treats all of her children but Dave compassionately and motherly, yet Dave is singled out. The book has never explained why the mother suddenly turned crazy and why Dave was the hapless scapegoat. Update: That is a likely situation, so I no longer doubt it.2. The father and brothers at first sympathized with Dave. Towards the middle, they just all pretended Dave was their slave, as their mother has said.3. The unusualness of Dave's punishments. His mother had starved him for more than ten days, made him eat soap, forced him to inhale a mixture of ammonia and bleach, attempted to burn his arm over a gas stove (or to be precise, asked him to lie down on it), smashed his head into his baby brother's diaper (with feces on it), stabbed him in the stomach with a knife, strangled him, submerged his head under water, etc. And by the frequency of these punishments inflicted on Dave, it is almost impossible that Dave is still alive today, living well in good mental and physical health.4.

He had to learn how to play his mother's games in order to survive because she no longer considered him a son, but a slave; and no longer a boy, but an ""it.""

His name is David Pelzer and he is the main character in the book. He gets abused by his mom everyday without a break. She takes her frustrations out on him for no reason. It is one of the saddest books I have ever read. In parts it is so sad you hardly hold back the tears for the pain that this little kid is feeling. It is even more sad because it is real. He has two brothers in the beginning and three in the end. His brothers treat him like a door mat and I dont know how he takes it without doing something. It is a great book none the less no matter how sad it is and I highly recommend it. It has some vile parts in it so if you are going to pick it up be ready. I will probably read this book again in the future over and over again. It is probably my favorite book. In one part David's mom is really nice to him and his brothers and in a few years she is treating his brothers the same but is beating him constantly.

She takes a bucket and fills it full of clorox and amonia and it forms this type of gas when mixed. She locks him in the bathroom. The first times she leaves the vent on which he gets to breath some fresh air. The second time she realizes that he is using the rag he is supposed to be cleaning with to cover his mouth and so she puts it in the bucket, she also turns of the vent. Amazingly he survives.

32,2455344584,07/12/2018,4.0,"Pelzer weaves a horrifying tale of abuse, neglect, and torture he undergoes as a child at the hands of his psychotic mother. What is most appalling about this book lays behind the truth of the story. Dave Pelzer’s entire tale comes together from the real-life experiences of the author. The bravery shown by one little boy left me speechless.The book begins when Dave is a tiny child. If I am not mistaken, he is around the age of four or five. He is young, naïve, and impressionable. The author lives with his parents and siblings in a modest home in Dale City, California. Everything starts off pretty well. Life is normal, humble, and happy. He does not have any complaints. Dave loves his mother deeply and admires his firefighter father.The story turns dark quickly. It goes from fun-filled days of going to museums, playing at parks, and genuinely enjoying life. Dave’s mother is hands-on, pleasant, and affectionate. These are happy memories for the author; however, it escalates. The book is not about an average normal family. The parents are drunks who get shit-faced over the weekends. There is no longer a nurturing provider to rely upon and the mother’s true nature has taken over. There is constant yelling, fighting, and upheaval. Then Dave becomes his mother’s target. She blames him for being a “bad boy” and the abuse gradually becomes something commonplace.The abuse in the story is all over the place. Starvation is number one at the forefront of the horror show this book is. Dave’s mother basically never feeds him. He is forced to eat leftover dinner scraps from his siblings if he is lucky. This leads to a fight for survival by digging through trashcans, begging neighbors, and stealing student’s lunches at school. He is physically beaten, worked to death, starved, and mentally brought down at every turn. The mother designs these twisted methods of torture through “games” that involve toxic chemicals, being burned, and nearly killed.Dave bears this all while witnessing his siblings being treated differently. They do not face the mother’s scorn. All of them are well-fed, have their needs met, and receive love from their parents while their brother is not even allowed to sleep inside the house in a proper bed. The basement is Dave’s home. He sleeps on a cot without pillows and blankets. It is often cold and difficult for him to deal with.I think what pisses me off the most about the author’s story is his father. All the abuse comes from the mother; however, the father does nothing to stop it. He tries to stick up for his young child but does not take enough of a stand. He is always fighting with his wife over the treatment Dave receives but never wins. The mother always gets her way because Dave’s father always ends up backing down.The entire book is filled with tragedy and stomach turning horror at the depravity a little boy goes through but there is also something very prominent that begins to show itself. The boy is brave, courageous, and does not give a you know what. Naturally, Dave ends up hating the very breathe his mother takes and develops a huge backbone. Through all the hardship he strengthens himself with plans for the future and makes it his mission to survive. Dave wants nothing more but to grow up and create a good life for himself where he is happy and content. It is quite inspiring!",12,-0.1253,0.11,0.776,0.115,0.5957323865218601,NEGATIVE,0.9728

It is a very short read but I seriously have to say that it is not the kind of book that you read for pleasure. Some parts of it were very disturbing, which when coupled with vivid details of the abuse that the author had to endure, making it one of the most depressing books I ever read.A Child Called “It” portrayed the childhood life of Dave Pelzer, where he was severely abused by his own mother. The way it was done was very sickening to the point where I feel like vomiting and crying. What kind of mother that willing to let her own son sleep with an empty stomach? What kind of mother that has a heart to beat her son till he passed out? What kind of mother that so sick till she can feed her son with poisonous stuffs? I cannot help thinking about all these questions throughout the book. The thing that I feel disturbing most was the fact that his father witnessed his son being abused but never once stood up for him. The way the author described his feeling towards his father’s indifferent behaviour was really heartbreaking. I cannot imagine myself living in his shoes and even if I do, I don’t know if I would ever make it out of it alive. The way that the author prevailed through this adversity was utterly amazing.With that being said, the high points given for this book is not because it was excellently written but more to the message that the author tried to convey in between the lines. I understand that there are some who question the credibility of his story as a whole but all I can say is that just because these heartbreaking events didn't occur in your life it doesn't mean that it won't happen to others. To me, this is a very good read in a sense that it makes me more appreciative of life and every other thing that have been trusted to me.Heartbreaking quote:Get one thing straight, you little son of a b*tch!

It's possible that the other two books go on to clarify some points and offer more of an ""inspiring"" account, but I'm certainly not wasting my time to find out!Ultimately I feel like all of the positive reviews are the result of any reasonable person's intense gut reaction to this kind of graphic violence being exacted upon a child. However, once one takes the time to get past their initial feelings of horror, one will realize that the book has little else to offer.Child abuse is a horrible thing and people need to be aware of the magnitude of the problem. This book, however, is NOT the right tool to use. Frankly, the poor execution of the book actually cheapens the experiences of the countless other nameless victims of abuse and oversimplified the complex nature of abuse that makes it so hard to identify and fight!If you were thinking of purchasing this book, do yourself a favor and instead donate that money to one of the many organizations that are struggling to eradicate child abuse around the world; they need it much more than Dave Pelzer.",8,-0.9868,0.171,0.724,0.106,0.5304064454064454,NEGATIVE,1.0

She was obviously a very disturbed woman but why was it that his brothers and his Father in particular, were unwilling or unable to stand up to her?As this all happened over thirty years ago, one can only hope that nowadays such horrific cases of child abuse would never have gone for so long. I really cannot understand why it was so very difficult for the school to rescue David from this situation, which they did eventually. It seemed to take them an eternity to gather the facts they needed!

After finishing it, there is NO doubt in my mind that this ""memoir"" is largely fabricated, or at least exaggerated to an extent that it doesn't even remotely resemble the actual events that took place. First, there's the outlandish claims (being stabbed in the stomach and taking care of his own wounds at the age of 10, being forced to drink ammonia, bleach, and feces on different occasions, being starved for 10 days straight, the list truly goes on...) Then, there's this recurring theme where Dave uses remarkable ingenuity for a 10 year old, painting himself as a hero and genius for getting small wins over his dreaded mother (which in turn is supposed to acquire sympathy from the reader). Let's not even mention the fact that both his brothers and grandmother refuted a majority of his claims. My main problem with this book, regardless if it's true or not (which it isn't), is that it's told like a veteran's war story. I don't know how this book would be inspiring to anyone suffering from child abuse, I think it'd be more of a trigger than anything (as much as I loathe using that word). Also, the fact that Pelzer has banked on this book and it's following sequels, which are also in talks for a movie, leads me to believe this was more for personal gain than ""closure"" or sincere help for children abused around the world. The only saving grace about ""A Child Called 'It'"" is that it did help alert many to what has been happening to children for a long time now. Are any of the cases as extreme as David's? Possibly, but they are few and far between. Unfortunately, I don't think David was one of them. I think he saw a market for this, and banked on kindhearted people's sympathy.

In every school, I have had at least one student, usually a reluctant reader, tell me how much they loved this book. For his ability to grab the attention of the finicky young reader, I will give Dave Pelzer three stars.His story of child abuse is incredible, but it's also come under a great deal of criticism. The veracity of his account has been called into question. The book's status as a New York Times Bestseller may be a manipulation of Pelzer's sales machine. The graphic descriptions of the abuse have been compared to pornography.David Plotz covered Pelzer in his article The child-abuse entrepreneur for Slate in 2000. Geraldine Bedell wrote about Pelzer in her article Child abuse as entertainment for The Guardian in 2001. Pat Jordan analyzed the empire of Pelzer's books in his article Dysfunction for Dollars for the New York Times Magazine in 2002.All three articles are good reads.In contrast, reading this book was a sickening experience for me.To begin, Pelzer's writing is infantile. While he may be channeling his younger self to portray details of his abuse, I found this device annoyingly simplistic.His figurative language is cliched throughout the book. ""I felt like an alligator in a swamp."" ""It was as though I was in a refrigerator."" ""When Kevin lifted his head and smiled at me, my heart melted."" ""I looked out the open car window at the sky. A dull gray blanket covered everything..."" ""I felt as if I were a man on death row, not knowing when my time would come."" ""I quickly wiped my tears and returned to the inner safety of my hardened shell.""Everything about his story is presented in black and white.He's regularly abused by his mother and his brothers never seem to witness any of it. While Pelzer has little contact with his brothers, when the boys are allowed to play together, they get along well. His father is a victim of the mother's abuse as well. When the father tries to help ""the Boy"" he's portrayed as a good guy. When the father increasingly shrinks away, complicit in the abuse, Pelzer paints him as the bad guy, a betrayer worse than the abusive alcoholic mother.I could see why children gravitate to this book. A true story about the worst case of child abuse in California's history told by the victim is the perfect voyeuristic invitation to read.And Pelzer writes so simply. He's a master of dragging out the details and keeping the reader wondering about what might happen next. Younger readers naturally react to this style. They may be shocked or they may be empathetic. They may be thankful for their family and all the love they do have.On the one hand, this engagement with younger readers does certainly give them the chance to better understand the plight of abused children. If the reader suffers from abuse, there's hope within these pages and a feeling of being less alone. If the reader's home life is more loving, then this book does open their eyes to the evils that do exist in this world.My biggest objections to this book, though, are the fear mongering and romanticization of abuse that occur within the various epilogues and concluding sections on child abuse.Pelzer references examples of child abuse in the most general terms. His generalizations about these other cases of abuse are never cited. He provides no sources. But he seems to suggest that any parent may become an abuser.This section reminds me of fairy tales meant to strike fear into children. His conclusions almost sound like a sick warning to children to be good or you might be the victim of child abuse. I'm not disagreeing that any child may be victimized. I'm objecting to Pelzer's peddling the fear that your loving mother or father might turn into a monster. Why create a culture of fear of all adults in our children?And then there's his conclusion about his life: ""Without abuse I might not be what I am today.""Yeah, no kidding. You might be an even better version of yourself who was nurtured and loved. Why is his romanticizing his abuse? Why is he glorifying such a hideous struggle?The last section of this book needs serious revision. Pelzer should consider how much of his own personal therapy he should be sharing with his reader.If he needs to contribute his success as an author to his triumph over abuse, that's fine and true. He's made quite the living selling his story. But his sweeping generalization that somehow his abuse has made him a better person seems psychologically twisted. He doesn't need to imply that to be a good person you must suffer. He doesn't need to create a suffering scale where those who take on more pain are more worthy of reward.Normally, I would not have picked up this book to read. Recently, I've changed positions at my school. As the new library specialist, I decided to branch out and read a book that engages so many reluctant readers.

58,1116525574,11/27/2014,5.0,"Dave Pelzer's A Child Called ""It"" chronicles the utterly horrific abuse the author suffered as a boy. His mother seems to have had a severe mental disorder and singled out Dave, literally torturing him, while treating his brothers relatively well. For instance, she often failed to feed him, sometimes going several days without giving him so much as a morsel. Young Dave resorted to stealing food from his classmates. Once his teachers learned he was the culprit, they labeled him a thief and told his mother, never suspecting that there might be deeper reasons underlying his behavior. His mother in turn responded by beating him. When the stealing persisted, she started making him gag himself once he got home. In one particularly gut-wrenching scene, she makes him dig his vomited food out of the toilet and eat it again. Dave is so hungry that he doesn't resist.As someone preparing to enter social work, my main takeaway from the book is that it's so important to scrutinize every situation, every detail. Social workers cannot take things at face value. A kid who is stealing food cannot simply be dismissed as a thief. More questions need to be asked. Had Dave's teachers asked more questions they could have saved him years of abuse.Another takeaway is how much the social work profession has matured. The social worker we meet in the book is preposterously awful. She never talks to Dave alone. Rather, she asks Dave, right in front of his mother, with his mother's hand resting on his shoulder, if she ever beats him. Dave nervously answers no, and this is enough to convince the social worker. Awareness of child abuse has grown, and it is difficult to imagine this sort of professional negligence occurring today.",7,-0.9942,0.194,0.758,0.048,0.3517142857142857,NEGATIVE,0.999

I won't even waste too much of my time going over it since I just went over another poorly written book and gave my thoughts on it already today.Does grammar mean anything to anyone now a days? The grammar here was just awful. The lines cliche, the discourse was off-it was just bad. I don't see how anyone could get through the awful grammar and still save room to ""feel"" what was going on in this story. The man should have gotten a ghost writer. His characters are flat and he tells his story vs showing it. It was like hearing a news report, I only said ""awwww"" because things like this are just horrible. Even while reading this book while being preg, with doctors telling me that me or my child might not make it, I still threw this book across the room and screamed that some people should realize that they just can't write.This book has been my inspiration though. Every time I think that I should give up on writing, I remind myself that if ""A Child Called It"" could get published, anyone can be published, even me.

I don't doubt that most, if not all, the incidents actually happened to the author, but what makes the story a bit unbelievable is the accuracy of the author's self-awareness as a child. It seems that the author is retrofitting some of his own thoughts and emotions as an adult onto his childhood memories of abuse. If I were to read it like a story, I wouldn't care.

74,779339712,12/02/2013,4.0," A Child Called It by Dave Pelzer is an autobiography about his terrible childhood after his life took a turn with alcoholic parents, an abusive mother, and a family who let it be. I say took a turn because she wasn’t always abusive. There was a time when they were a happy, normal family. His mom was caring and though she drank, often with his father, she didn’t let it get out of hand. Then things took a turn for the worst inexplicably. David was only 7 when his mom started beating him as she pleased. It’s like she got this sick sense of pleasure by watching him suffer and it was always him, never one of his 4 other brothers. His father was his salvation but he wouldn’t really do much he once sat and watched, at David’s mother’s command, as she rammed a spoon of ammonia in David’s mouth. This was one of the many “games” she’d play with him. She did this until she got tired and started commanding him to clean the bathroom and stay in there or else, and leave a bucket of Clorox and ammonia before closing the door, leaving him to breathe the fumes. She stabbed him a couple times, he was basically the family slave, he was to wear nothing but old dirty rags of clothes,she once made him eat is brother’s feces, she’d even starve him daily, once going ten days without food and more; she’d justify her behavior by saying was a “Bad Boy” and needed to be punished. His only escape was school, where his peers viewed him as a thief because, motivated by his intensive hunger, he would steal their lunches. His teachers just viewed him as a troubled kid, and since he’d make up an excuse for his bruises, they and the principal believed his mother when she had a conference with them and made up lies to make him look very bad; she succeeded. However, one year, one of his teacher’s substitute took a particular interest in him and before leaving reported it to the school nurse. The school nurse also had been noticing David’s behavior and started calling him in for body inspections, looking for bruises and such. He always had some kind of lie, an excuse, to protect his mom because he honestly didn’t want her to get in trouble. Despite all the cruel things she did and said to him, (after a few years she started referring to him as “it” and made everyone else do so), he loved her so much and would have forgave her if she had asked for forgiveness, would have pretended it never happened because all he truly wanted was for her to just love him, a child, the way a mom should. In this novel, Pelzer shows his courage and faith in his horrible situation, and though sometimes he wanted to give up, he didn't. He survived mentally and physically the abuse, and I believe he wrote this book for other victims of abuse. So they can know they aren’t alone, they can survive, and not to lose hope no matter how hard the circumstances. You can't have a rainbow without rain. This was an amazing book, and I love how its chapters are structured starting from before the abuse started to when he was free. I can almost feel what he feels and imagine myself in his situation. I definitely recommend it to both middle school and high school students. Although I don’t understand how his mom could abuse him like he was an “It”. She birthed and created him how could she not feel bad about hurting him so badly? How could she want him to die? I wish he would have wrote if he knew why or not. I think she had serious mental issues, and I wonder if she regrets what she did today. Even if she doesn’t, Pelzer has moved on. On the page before the epilogue he wrote his son has taught him the meaning of love; this makes me think she made him a great dad, who he is today, because I’m sure he did everything he could to not be even a little like his mom.",5,0.7453,0.15,0.69,0.16,0.5694146825396826,NEGATIVE,0.9999

After reading this story, I am now only sure of the permanence of one thing: 1) DeathFirst I am going to talk about the story, without taking the validity into consideration. This is easily the most horrific story I have come across in my entire reading career. Chance is quite low that I will come across a more horrific one in future. Imagine a world where you are not accepted by your family and your mother treats you like prison inmates. Hard, right? The central character went through worse than your imagination. The book depicts never-ending events of paramount and horrendous tortures by a mother on her child. Halfway through the book, I started skipping lines, hoping this would all end soon. Its too much to take in. Ignorant fathers and sneering siblings, coupled with these, makes it even worse.Now, when I finished it, I had a hard time figuring out what to believe. I can't imagine a family like that. Its simply not possible from my domain. Some weeks earlier, a video went viral in social media where a girl said she was subject to sexual abuse by her father. Some days later, her brother uploaded a video saying that she was a drug addict, missing from the house, and nothing she said was true. Her past social media updates showed that she actually had quite good relation with her father (which also covered the time span she mentioned in her video). But again, child abuse is not unheard of. So, you can't really be sure of anything.However, Pelzer really went into so much details about the tortures. At such age, I think its really difficult to remember such details unless a trauma like that really happened. However, I still don't find some events believable like going 10 days without food (is that really possible?). I found on internet that his sibling, Richard, also wrote an autobiography regarding his mother's abuse (will have to read that sometime). Though his other siblings have completely rejected the possibility of such abuses, its not uncommon for siblings to split when it comes to defending a sensitive issue.In the end, I can't really be sure of whether this story is indeed true. If it is true, I have no words that can convey my admiration for the writer. I can't imagine how he managed to survive through all that (I certainly couldn't have). If the story isn't true, I would lose all respects to Pelzer for making up such a horrendous story.

I was always so interested in how a mother and father could act this way to their child. Growing up, I knew I wanted to be a teacher and I would question myself about what I would do if one of my students was abused. Still to this day, I do not have a response to this question. I do not think I will ever be able to answer this question, until it occurs in my classroom.Subjects, Themes, and Big Ideas:	The main theme in the novel is abuse. There are many different types of abuse, all of which are covered in this book. The main type of abuse is physical because everyday David was trying to cover up some new mark his mother had made on him. Along with physical abuse, David was verbally abused. Both of these types of abuse combine to be emotional abuse. After a child is involved with these circumstances, the rest of his life will be altered. Characters:	David Pelzer is a 4 to 13 year old boy living in California. David has four other siblings, but none are ever really talked about. Sometimes, his brothers would be mentioned when David wrote about his school experiences. His mother, Catherine is an alcoholic and depressed; while his father, Stephen try’s to not notice what his wife is doing.Plot summary:	David was born on December 29, 1960. He remembered his mother, Catherine, being a very loving and caring mother in the beginning. She then began drinking and fell into a deep depression. As she became more depressed, she began to abuse David, and none of the other four siblings. His father, Stephen, witnessed these actions, but very rarely took action against his wife. The abuse became extremely cruel and outrageous. His mother began her abuse by starving and pushing Dave down the steps. By the time he was rescued, she had burned him with the stove, stabbed him in the stomach because he did not finish the dishes quick enough and referred to him as “It”, not David. Six months after David’s birthday, his father completely walked out on the family; leaving no hope for David, or his brothers. Two months later, about 1973, David was rescued by teachers at his middle school.Strengths (including reviews and awards):•	#1 International Best Selling Author•	Recipient of The National Jefferson Award•	JC Penny Golden Rule Award•	carried the centennial flame for the 1996 Olympic Games•	nominated for the Pulitzer Prize•	New York Times Best Sellers List for over six years	Drawbacks or other cautions:	The entire book is full of foul language and abusive situations. David real describes and elaborates all the ways his mother tortured him.

The author has won many awards he was honored as one of the Ten Outstanding Young Americans. It has 109 pages and took about 2 days to read because I didn't want to stop reading it. The main character is David, the author, his mother, his father, his two brothers and school teachers. The setting was year round, it took place mostly at Davids house and school. David's house was the setting. The protaginist is David Pelzer and he has to make many choices, he isn't allowed to eat and he gets beat daily. His mom makes him inhale bleach and wear old clothes. He wants to tell his teachers but he's scared beatings will be worse. The major conflict is the child abuse from his mother. His mother is the antagonist. The other characters are his dad, who is scared to tell his mom to stop so he leaves, his two brothers who his mom favors, and the teachers that try to help David. The author is trying to show child abuse is brutal. He was treated very bad and wants people to know that go through this aren't alone. The characters show that because his mother treats him horrible and he can't tell anyone or it will get worse for him. I disagree with all of his mothers desisions, she hides what she does to her son from everyone and he is scared to tell anyone, she hurts him bad. Hes stabbed and had to breathe in bleach.  I like this book alot because its something you can't put down. its a great story and i can imagine that its really hard for him. People shouldn't have to go through this type of things. The fact that a mother would want to hurt her own child is horrible. This book is inpireing and shows that people can survive very horrible things, you just have to believe in yourself and stay strong. I didn't dislike anything about it it was a very great book. I recommend this book to someone who likes sad stories. Its a book you cant put down. It is about child abuse so it is very sad but its a really good book. I don't like happy boks because theres nothing to look forward to, in sad/ scary books you don't know what will happen. They are just better to read for me because i can never put it down.",4,-0.9964,0.214,0.675,0.111,0.5967592592592592,POSITIVE,0.8314
89,20212328,04/15/2008,2.0,"A rec from Tolley. I'm glad I read it cos' so many people mention it and I'm glad to add to a repertoire of media about foster care etc. -- But -- I didn't really like it. It was written as if from the viewpoint of the 4 to 7 year old portrayed in the story. I think that tone was problematic given that it was written from Dave's adult memory. It would have read better in Dave's adult voice remembering and reflecting on his experience rather than trying to authentically transport himself back to his beingness as a 4 to 7 year old. I didn't really buy the child's voice thing. Though many of my own memories of trauma and otherwise are crisp and clear -- I can't pretend to remember what I sounded like -- how I articulated things as a 4 to 7 year old -- though I can tell you how I remember an event or a moment and how I remember processing it and what it means to me now. Keeping his past alive as memories and as reflections of memories would have made it much more real for me as a reader. I also found the book seriously lacking in reflection -- though there seems to be some promise of that to come in the introduction and mention of the sequel books that I have to say sound like they would be a chore to read at this point -- but for the sake of the repertoire -- I just might. I also felt like I didn't buy the fact that the boy called his mother a bitch at age 4 to 7. The classic thing is to side with your parents until you get older -- to see no ill in your parents even under the worst circumstances and to have a protective instinct even under the most abusive situations. This seemed to me to be an additive from the adult Dave that made the story less authentically told. Along these same lines, I found a certain level of emotion missing from the story -- the abuse portrayed is so awful -- the telling of it seemed rather unemotive. But maybe that part is the most real b/c how can you go through something like that and survive without turning yourself off quite a bit...",4,-0.9921,0.133,0.827,0.04,0.4379931972789117,NEGATIVE,1.0
90,18617283,03/25/2008,5.0,"A Child Called ""It"" is a real life story about a boy who was brutally beaten and starved by his mentally disturbed and alcoholic mother. At first, David Pelzer lived a healthy and normal life with his parents and brothers. His mother, however, unexpectedly transformed into a monster, venting her anger on her helpless child. David was submerged in freezing cold water, forced to eat his own vomit, slept in the basement under the stairs, stabbed, and forced to sit on a burning stove. These are just a few of the torturous games that his mother used to play. She treated him not like her son, but like an ""it"". David suffered both mental and physical abuse. In order to survive from his mother's sick games, David used willpower. Through all of her torturous games, David's inner strength began to emerge. This book is a perfect example of how the human spirit can provide strength in the toughest of situations. David's spirit helped him to survive through his mother's emotional and physical abuse. He refused to let his mother win. He had no one to help him so he learned how to fend for himself. His courage and determination saved him from all of the suffering that he endured at such a young age. David is a living testament of resilience. His faith and personal responsibility helped him transform into an emotionally healthy and competent adult. A large percentage of emotionally and physically abused children become abusive in their adult years. The abusiveness could be a cycle, passed down from generation to generation. Their rage and pain of being abused could be turned on themselves or the ones they love. David, at a young age, showed strong signs of being a planner as well as a problem solver. These character traits, along with caring adults (nurses, teachers, social workers, etc.), help him to become resilient. David's inner strength helped him turn shame into pride and rejection into acceptance.",4,-0.9536,0.233,0.576,0.19,0.4432437932437933,POSITIVE,0.9989

Some readers may think that this book is disturbing.The main character Dave Pelzer, was only 4 years old when his mother started not to be like a real mother to him. His mother was an alcoholic, so she was abusive. She had no reason not to feed him for days, dress him nicely, and bathe him. One morning before school, he has to do chores, if he doesn't get them done on time, otherwise no breakfast. He sleeps downstairs in the basement on an army cot. All day his ""mom"" has him sit at the bottom of the stairs. When he sits there, he thinks of all of the Good Times he's had.Every day for him is a Fight for Food. His mom has no reasons not to feed him. Sometimes he would have to steal food at school. He would always make careful plans, but those plans would fail. And his mom would find out about that.While his Father was Away, Dave had to stay in this ""madhouse"" of a home. Even though his mom took control of everyone in the house, Dave and his dad have a special relationship.I thought the ending of book was really heartbreaking because you never really knew what happened next. I couldn't understand why the author didn't add to the ending?I was struck by this passage ""I loved Father so much. I wanted to be with him forever, and I cried inside because I never knew when I was going to see Father again"" it shows that his father is starting to fade away from Dave's life and his father was his hero since nobody else was.I give this book 5 stars because if a book can make you cry, then it was a good book. I recommend this book to readers who like nonfiction books and those who like quick reader books.

I would feel much better to know it was untrue but disgusted with myself for reading it cover to cover, unable to tear my eyes away.I am completely horrified that children are(were) reading this book. Even if true, what possible benefit is there for a child to read it? I agree with other reviewers that there was no help in this book. Sure, we can read it and think, 'Wow. Look what he lived through. My life isn't (wasn't) so bad after all.' A child who is in an abusive home will not learn from this book how to get help.It really is the proverbial train wreck. I couldn't look away. It is unlikely to be a book that is started by a reader and never finished; it has that kind of horrific appeal. If true, the horror of it is extraordinary. I do not deny that the possibility of this kind of abuse exists; I am dubious of the possibility of a child surviving so long without help. I won't even say that I believe the family's claim that the story is fiction. I have known situations where the family claims ignorance or shock at their relation's accusations of abuse at the hand of a parent. It is possible for a parent to abuse one child and not the others. So, yeah, I can see where this story could have some truth to it. Perhaps it is exaggerated a bit in order to sell books; it wouldn't be the first time this has happened, nor the last.Basically, take this book for what it is: a fantastic (as in, 'wild' or 'unrealistic') retelling of events that may or may not have actually happened.

Suddenly the loving mother changed. She began to abuse David. David's mother was mentally ill and an alcoholic. When his father was at work she would treat David very bad. She would give him no food. He would steal food from kids lunch boxes, and when they caught him they told his mother. She beat him and gave him less food, and the kids at school hated him for stealing their food. David's father always tried to sneak food to David, he tried to convince her to feed David, but it was all useless. Even though his dad tried helping him, he made things worse. But to David his father was his hero. As time goes by, and things go worse for David he begins to hate everybody. He wants to be the kid who is loved and who is filled with happiness. His brothers beat him too, just like their mother. His father doesn't defend him anymore and leaves him. At that moment he hated his father for leaving him, and he wasn't his hero anymore. David at some point stops having hope, faith, and doesn't believe in God.  One day the nurse checked in with David. She saw all the bruises. She sees the bruise on his eye, his chipped teeth, the marks on his face, and the scar where his mother stabbed him accidentally. David returns to his classes until they call him back. He sees some of his teacher, the nurse, and a police officer. The police officer takes him to Daly City Police Station. Then he calls his mother and tells her she no longer has the custody of David, the San Mateo Juvenile Department does. Then the police turns to David and tells him that he is

But mothers say goes and father is not aloud to talk to the boy so when he can sneak it he does. Most of the time father is not home because he does not like the situation. That is when mother beats ""it"". When father is not home.The conflict of this storie is that mother treats ""it"" like dirt. Alls she cares about is stan and ron and its very unfair.

No child, or anyone, deserves this kind of treatment, and much less from someone supposed to protect and to love the child.I took two things from this book: The first is, when something awful happens to us, we have two options: one is to become bitter and to get revenge, which take us nowhere, but more destruction. The second, is to accept what happened, recognize that it hurt us deeply, and use it to help others surviving identical situations, healing ourselves in the process.The second thing I learn is that abuse is a circle, it passes from generation to generation. It doesn’t mean that the person abusing is “bad” but she/he also needs help to overcome her/his own deep pain. It is a terrible thing.Dave Pelzer has always refused to hate his mother throughout all his life. She always hated him, for no reason at all.

And Dave Pelzer brings this startling issue front and centre through this novel. As I read it, I was appalled at the crimes this child was subjected to. Child abuse continues to be a prevalent part of our society, but often it happens behind closed doors. We know child maltreatment is common, and yet we continue wandering in our bubbles; ignorant to an epidemic that is impacting one our most vulnerable populations. What makes this text both riveting and painful is that it is told from the perspective of a very young child. A Child Called ""It"" chronicles Dave Pelzer’s life from the ages of 4 to 12. As a reader, you realize that child abuse can abrupt in the most ordinary and loving households. A sweet family can quickly turn bitter given the right circumstances. I speculate, though I am not certain, that Dave’s mom was coping with a mental illness that made her victimize him. His mother's abuse transcends both physical and emotional boundaries: she beats, stabs, yells, isolates, and threatens her child. I was not only taken back by the abuse, but also the perception others - peers, family members, teachers - had of Dave. This child is lost and asking for help, displaying evident signs of mistreatment, and still, it takes awhile for someone to recognize his symptoms. As someone who works in the social service sector and aspires to become a registered Social Worker, this text proved to be profound. It reminded me why I read and how much books can increase our empathy. More than anything, I hope his story resonates with others who have lived through similar experiences because despite his tribulations, Dave acknowledges that he is who he is today as a result of his past.  His life continues in spite of the pain, and when I read this book, I was astonished by his resilience and strength, which seems to have established itself even in early childhood. Growing up, he perceives his house as a war zone and views his mother as an enemy. Regardless of the horrific abuse Dave is subjected to, he recognizes he can devise tactics to cope with the abuse. There is a powerful moment in the book where he iterates that this is a battle that he can win. But he also acknowledges that although he was lucky enough to come out of his trauma wounded but unbroken, many survivors of child abuse are not so fortunate. And thus, books like this need to exist because they remind those in similar circumstances that a dark past will not swallow up their bright future. In addition, Pelzer is able to raise awareness, offer hope, and make suggestions on how we can prevent child abuse.A must-read for anyone in the social work and education field.

After spending 5 years working for CPS I have lived through horrors similar to those Mr. Pelzer endured. He is truly an inspiration, he made it out and worked hard to break the cycle.

It is almost unbelievable that an adult could treat a child like this and that others in the family, especially Dave's father, could allow it.Dave's says that his mother was kind and loving during the first 5 years of his life, but suddenly she changed and targeted him for horrific abuse. She treated her other children well but starved Dave and made him work like a slave. Once she stabbed him and frequently locked him in a bathroom with a deadly combination of bleach and ammonia, or made him lay in a tub full of cold water for hours completely submerged except for his nose. David felt that she really wanted him to die, but he managed to survive by sheer will. Along with the daily torture, she starved him. In school he desperately stole from other student’s lunches, but at one point during the summer, he went 10 days without food.  I recently read Call Me Tuesday by Leigh Byrne and she also was the only one her mother abused. It is hard to understand how a mother could target only one of her children for her anger. To me, that indicates that there is a degree of control that makes the abuse seem even more heinous. I can understand how a parent who suffered abuse in childhood would have anger management problems and not have any parenting skills, but Dave’s mother's treatment of her other children demonstrates that she knew what was right. While this is a hard book to read, it is also very inspiring. Somehow, through fierce determination, young Dave manages to survive. Eventually, his teachers and principal had enough evidence to go to the police and David was removed but the story of how he survived is a tribute to the human spirit.",3,-0.9925,0.194,0.705,0.101,0.5434013605442177,NEGATIVE,0.9117
115,2207122003,12/07/2017,5.0,"5/A Child Called “It” by Dave Pelzer was one of the most intense books I have ever read. The author writes about his childhood and it is all about his abusive mother. David’s mother wasn’t always abusive, but slowly and surely she became more and more cruel and would also favor her other sons. The wicked woman did all sorts of cruel and unimaginable things such as starving him, choking him, stabbing him, etc. and yet Dave still manages to find hope especially when he is adopted to a loving family. This book was extremely sad and gruesome. Reading this book I could learn more about what others have to go through. However, even though it is a special book telling a special story I would not recommend this novel to anyone who cannot stomach gory details. It often times goes into extreme detail when it is describing the abuse David had to take. I was able to handle it, but that doesn’t mean everyone will be able to. Although, I do find it more positive than negative and that’s what made it such a great book to read. As Dave gets older, he decides that he isn’t going to take the abuse and he fights back. Throughout the whole novel, you find yourself rooting for David and his spirit that keeps him alive. No matter how horrible, I would still re-read this book because of it’s hopeful moral. The lesson to take away from this novel is to never give up and stay hopeful. Even though David had to undergo such terrible things, he remained hopeful and continued to fight for his life. This book is amazing and is definitely at the top of my “favorites list.” ",3,0.507,0.183,0.618,0.199,0.6531547156547155,POSITIVE,0.9932

Pretty much everyone has at least heard of this book, so I don't think I need to go on and on about how HORRIFYING Mr. Pelzer's childhood was. It really is remarkable that he grew up to be a healthy, well-adjusted, successful adult. At least, he seems that way. I guess one can never truly know. Of course, the writing itself doesn't really deserve mention, and that's not the point. The point, I believe, was to inspire, inform, and give hope. But I wasn't really inspired. I was shocked and disturbed by this book, certainly, and I do admire Dave Pelzer's survival. But inspired? No. Maybe it's meant to be inspiring more for people who have dealt with the burden of abuse in their own lives. There were also LOTS of questions that I wanted answered. What ever happened to the mother? What really made her turn the corner from doting mom to monster? Is it common for a loving mother to become abusive? How much of what she did can be blamed on/linked to her alcoholism? Was she abused as a child? Is it common for her to single out and heinously abuse some of her children and not the others? (David has a younger brother who has also published a memoir about his own abuse.) Was she ever arrested or publicly reprimanded in anyway? What ever happened to David's father, anyway? What kind of therapy (if any) did David have during his years of recovery? Despite a whole bunch of pointless afterwardses by various professionals, there were no answers in the edition I read. Maybe later editions are better in this respect. Still, I gotta hand it to the author. It's amazing what he's been through, especially if everything in this book is true.

Some say it is completely fictionalized, confirmed by family members even, and was used as ploy to sell books. I didn't realize that before reading it so that tidbit didn't really affect my judgment of the story. In fact, it wasn't until after I read it that I looked into it further because something felt ""off"" in the recollections.Hmmm. Child abuse and neglect are in itself horrible, horrible things. There is no need to state that. Anyone with even a shred of moral integrity knows this. I am 100% an advocate for anyone who has ever been victimized. 100%. To read an account of such depravity from a child's perspective is hard. It should be REALLY hard. However, some of the accounts here seem SO horrendous and SO hard to believe that it makes it, well, hard to believe. And since it wasn't believable I didn't connect with the characters. I felt very distanced. Maybe it's because I didn't quite understand what happened to turn it from a ""Brady family"" to the monstrous family it became. Or why only Dave was targeted. I guess some things are monstrous BECAUSE we can't understand them. I don't know. I'm not going to give a negative review of what could be, if not totally then maybe at least partially, a personal story of abuse beginning at a very young age. I don't want to cheapen or demean their story. Like I said, abuse it horrible. If Dave suffered through these atrocities then I am just thankful he made it out. I hope every child has a teacher, a counselor, a coach, a pastor, SOMEONE who can advocate for them when their voices just aren't strong enough.

David is a small, skinny boy because he never gets feed.His mom was once a strong, wonderful ,happy gal. All of a sudden she went i guess evil. She used David as a slave and gave him no love. She called him an IT and wouldn't feed him. She once made him throw-up his food, scoop it out of the toilet into a bowl,and make him eat it. It is terrible. She did so many things and once almost killed him. Everyone in his so called family where all against him at one point. David could't even play or sleep. If he ever did sleep he would in the garage on a cot. This whole story has changed the way I look at life. It shows you what some people have to go through and their fight for survival. The descriptions are really powerful and it makes you feel the little boys pain. This story is a true story one of the top abusive cases in Calafornia history.

119,18691335,03/26/2008,5.0,"Review:Starting off, this book is one my favorite books. Not only the book but the whole series keeps you updated in the abusive life of a child called 'It'. The juicy details of the harsh abuse is what reels you in this upbeat story.The book keeps you entertained by going day by day to tell you how the abuse from a mother and father could affect how a child acts in other situations. Throughout the book, the mother of 'It' performs horrible abusive actions towards him. On one occasion, she locks him in a closed room with a bucket of bleach. On another occasion, she holds his arm over the lit gas stove, forcing him to be scowled by the heat. The ignorant tone that the author, David Pelzer, uses to show the characteristics of the mother adds to the interesting abuse to 'It'. He uses words that describe terrible situations to explain It's feelings. The verbal abuse by It's mother forces him to act in difficult manner. The abuse gets so bad that the child can't even go to school anymore.Lastly, in the end of the book starts a new journey of 'It' that starts him off in a shelter. It ends in a big ordeal where a social worker is notified about the treatmeant of It. The ending journey keeps you wanting to read which brings you to the rest of the series. I like how he ends in a new journey because it leaves you hanging & suspicous.In conclusion, I would recommend this book to anyone of any age. It helps you be aware of the way some parents treat their children and how to notice child abuse. ",3,-0.9955,0.207,0.727,0.066,0.5667140151515151,POSITIVE,0.9877

His mother who played tortuous and unpredictable games.The games that left him nearly dead. He learned how to play his mother's games in order to survive because she no longer considered him a son, but a slave and no longer a boy, but an ""it.""Dave's refuge was going to school. At least there he would have a moment of respite from whatever his mother would create as a punishment. He would sometimes steal food, not knowing when or if his mother would allow him to eat again. Signs of abuse started accumulating and Dave's teachers intervened.  This was the rescue Dave had waited for and his teachers risked their careers by stepping in to help. Dave was placed in foster care at around age 12, living in various homes.Dave's case was identified as one of the worst cases of child abuse in California. His strong will as a child carried through into adulthood. He used his experience to better himself instead of letting it destroy him. He's written several books winning prized acclaim.

The book is a memoir about Dave's childhood, his struggle through life and school with an abusive mother who treated her other son like normal but tortured Dave for no apparent reason. He reflects on different ways his mother tortured him and how he tried telling people but no one believed him; however through all of it he never gave up faith in God.   Dave is inspirational to those who have been in his situation, he cried himself to sleep for several years and wondered why him. The book was a little difficult to read at some times because its hard to bare the thought of such a young boy being tortured by his own mother.For example at one point his mother locked him in the bathroom and closed all the vents she then came in with a bucket of ammonia mixed with 409. the chemicals released gasses that Dave would breathe in and it eventually began to burn his throat.  It opened my eyes and made me appreciate the life and especially the parents that I have been blessed with. The book is an example of never giving up a fight no matter what life throws at you. With abuse and violence being such a big problem in today's society ""A child called 'it'"" gives people hope, hope to get out of the pain they are being put through, hope for a savior, and hope for a new life.

It is difficult to assess it as a solo book, because I am sure there is much more to Dave's story and since it is less than 200 pages I am unsure why it wasn't all put together.It is a highly disturbing book and it is so hard to accept that this was part of the day-to-day life of this boy, as unfortunately so many others. This wasn't just abuse and neglect, it was blatant torture. For its message, because it is an account that needs to be told, it should be out there and people need to be sensitized to it.However, I have to say that, as a story, I was disappointed because it felt disjointed. There were lots of gaps when something must have changed to make David's parents change as well and we're left in the dark to that, as well as the changes in David himself. I craved for an account of a moment when David realized he was changing, something to make it more real. While I sympathize that young David must have known why things were happening either either, this is his account as an adult, and I believe it would have helped the reader immensely, not only to connect with him more but also to make us think that it could happen to anyone, and that maybe when we see something behaving a certain way or going through certain experiences we should pay closer attention. So that is the issue I had with this, but as I said, it's a book that needs to be read. There are certainly many children out there going through this, and they don't understand what is happening to them, or really believe they are a bad child and deserve what is happening to them.",2,-0.6012,0.074,0.871,0.055,0.5126121463077985,NEGATIVE,1.0
146,2545118170,09/29/2018,,"Personal Response: I loved reading this book. I always wanted to keep reading. It really caught my attention because the events that happened in this book could or have happened to other kids around this time period. Plot: In  A Child Called ""It"", David was a four year old boy, who used to be loved by his family. One day, his mother turned into a completely different person and started treating David different from his two brothers. David was a boy who wanted to be treated like his two brothers. He was abused by his mother several times throughout the book. There were times when David had wished he was dead so he did not have to deal with his mother anymore. David's father never physically made his mom stop abusing him. All he did was talk to her, which made her mad and she would take her anger out on David. His mother used to be a sweet, beautiful, woman. She stopped doing her makeup unless she had to. She always stayed home unless she absolutely had to go somewhere. David was to go to school every day and he would try to steal food from other kids because he was fed very little at home. David's mother found out and did not let him eat for ten consecutive days. He liked going to school because it was the only time he could get away from his mother. David's father eventually had enough of his mother and left, leaving David behind. David was so mad at his father for leaving. All David wanted to do was get away from his mother, and he lost his chance when his father left. David had to continue to live with his mother. He had to sleep on a cot in the garage with no blankets and no heat. He hated his life and he always thought to himself he would be better off dead.Characterization: David started as a four year old boy, who lived with his abusive mother and drunken father. He had to learn tactics to try and outsmart his mother and her tricks. Very seldom was he successful with them, but there were times he got away with it. David had to continue to be strong no matter what his mother did to him. Even though there were times it was almost impossible to be strong but he did. At the end of the book, David was in a parking lot of a restaurant and he watched his mom and two brothers go in to eat. When they came back they yelled at him. At that time, David just tried to imagine his life as something else.David’s mother was a woman who cared about her children as they started to get older. One day, it was almost like a switch flipped and she started acting differently towards David. She treated him differently than David’s brothers. Sometimes she wouldn’t let him eat, so he would go to school and steal food. When she found out she made him throw it back up when he got home. His mother would also take out all her anger on him when his mother and father would get into arguments. Throughout the book, she started treating David worse and made him start sleeping in the garage on a cot, with no blanket or any source of heat. Setting: A Child Called ""It""  took place in Daly City, California during 1970. During the 1970's abuse was mostly unrecognized and ignored most of the time. The events in this book really happened to the author. It was his childhood story. He explained everything in his life that happened with his mother and father.Thematic Connection: I think the theme of this book would be about child abuse, because it explained his childhood and how child abuse affected his life. Recommendation: I would recommend this book to any high school student because some of the language is intended for more mature students. I also recommend it to both genders because everyone should be aware of things that happen to some children. The scenes in the book that should be taken very maturely and seriously, along with. It makes students aware of what some children go through in their life and how they get through it. ",2,-0.9855,0.101,0.842,0.057,0.467538185085355,NEGATIVE,0.9186

Like many, I fall into the category of uneducated about child abuse. I lived in the dark because I didn't care to look into the horrors that I'd heard about on television. I never thought to look into it, and to be honest, I didn't want to. I didn't want to learn about what children had gone through and what some may have not survived. I was fine with looking the other way, and then my teacher decided to give me this book. At first, when I started reading it, I didn't know what to think. I knew I was going to finish it, but I didn't know how long it would take me. This definitely isn't a book that you can skip around a little. You need to read each and every word, and that includes the author's note and acknowledgments. Each word and each part of the book told another part of his story, and none of it should be ignored.I love this story this book told. While it showed the horrors of child abuse, it also shared an amazing survival story. Dave was just a little boy when all of this happened and started, and yet he survived.

It's written in very simple language, like it's written for children, and yet the content is chapter after chapter of gruesome child abuse and torture. There is some controversy about this story being exaggerated. I'm pretty certain that it's true. Why I think this is at the end of my review. I remember this being a very famous book when I was age 11-13. A lot of my classmates read it. Now that I know how gruesome it is, I'm surprised. It's not really ""a book for children."" Some of the things in this book are downright revolting, (like ""don't eat lunch while reading this book"" level of revolting.) The punishments are explained in a very graphic way. Nothing is left to the imagination. Stories of abuse should be told as they are, with no sugar coating, but nonetheless it's disturbing to read. As an adult reader, there's an added level: the most shocking part of this is that the father was there, witnessing his son's abuse, letting it happen. This is sadly a common theme in child abuse - one parent as abuser, other parent as enabler. It's horrifying nonetheless. There were many adults nearby who saw him but simply didn't notice the signs of abuse and neglect, or if they did, did not do anything. As an adult, there's something deeply saddening about that.  Writing Style Since it's a memoir I don't expect the events to be altered to be more palatable. I think however, it could be written better. The first few chapters about his mother before she became abusive seem overly sugary. If there is any part of this book that sounds exaggerated, it's this one. She was a perfect and loving mom until she wasn't. The transition into her becoming alcoholic and abusive is very abrupt, a la ""then one day, everything changed."" Maybe he writes this as it sits in his memory, but it feels like a hole in the story. With the insight of an adult writer he could give more explanation into why he thinks this happened. Yes, sometimes parents go from being mostly normal to very abusive (think Turpin family). As a reader however, I crave some kind of explanation or at least acknowledgment of this change. Even something like ""I don't know what happened to her to make her this way"" would fill that hole. The ending is so abrupt and unsatisfying. He went through years of unthinkable cruelty, and then he was saved, the end. Wait, wait, what happened after that? He wrote two more books, so presumably I should buy those to find out what happened next, but... come on, the book ends before you get the sense of relief that he really escaped and had a better life. One chapter about his transition into foster care would make this memoir so much better. It ends right before you can get the relief, let out the sigh, feel that there's a happy ending to this story. (There WAS a happy ending, he just didn't write about it in this book.)  This Story is True There is some controversy about the author exaggerating parts of his abuse (from family member and journalists). I don't believe the family members and I think the journalists are clueless. I believe this story is true or at the very least mostly true. Why? Dave Pelzer was placed into foster care after the police were alerted to his treatment. We start with this very basic evidence that he was abused badly enough to be taken away from his mother. The book ends with an afterword from his school teacher Steven E. Ziegler: “I was naive back then, but I was blessed with a sensitivity that told me there was something terribly wrong in David’s life. Food missing from other students’ lunches was traced to this thin, sad boy. Questionable bruises appeared on exposed parts of his body. Everything began to point to one thing: this kid was being beaten and punished in ways far beyond normal parental practice. It was several years later when I learned that what I was witnessing in my classroom was the thirdworse case of child abuse on record in the entire state of California.” Why I am sure this book is based in truth and not exaggeration is simply that everything in this book follows well known patterns of child abuse very accurately. Dave Pelzer's accounts follow closely a type of abuse called as scapegoating. When a parent scapegoats a child they blame that child for all the family's problems and take out their anger and stress on the victim. All the details of his abuse follow well known patterns in the psychology of child abuse. The fact that his mother treated him better when others were watching, that she started to be nice to him for a few days after accidentally going to far (the stabbing incident) and once he was better she returned to being abusive, she taught him ready made excuses so she wouldn't be caught, came up with justifications for why he deserved the punishment (classic abuser psychology). He saw school as an escape from abuse (classic child abuse victim), was too afraid to tell anyone what happened because of fear of what punishment he'd receive at home, started acting out in school, felt safe when other adults were around or when he was in public and not alone with his mother. He began to disconnect from his body and felt that when he was beaten his body was a ragdoll (read The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma to understand why this is a common trauma response.) His account of his childhood falls so inline with the patterns of child abuse that either he knows this topic from experience or he came up with an expert fabrication of it and nailed it. I don't think any part of it is fabricated. He follows some of the patterns of torture survivors that reminds me of the book Man's Search for Meaning when he describes using whatever tactics he could to buy time as his mother abused him, how the abuse got so severe that he no longer had a sense of degradation. He would eat scraps from the dog bowls because he was so hungry that his survival was the only goal. The punishments in this book remind me of accounts of child abuse in books like: The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of TraumaToxic Parents: Overcoming Their Hurtful Legacy and Reclaiming Your LifeThe Gift of Fear: Survival Signals That Protect Us from Violence. If you question the severity of his abuse just because you want to believe sadistic parents don't exist, you're misinformed. There are (sadly) countless examples of similar parents. Just look into two other famous California child abuse cases: Genie the feral child the recent Turpin Case if you have trouble believing that parents can do gruesome things to their children.  Claims of Exaggeration  So one of Dave Pelzer's siblings wrote his own book chronicling the abuse he underwent as the new family scapegoat, A Brother's Journey. The other siblings, who were not aubsed, claim that these books are exaggerated/ fabricated. How interested that the siblings who were treated well believe their mother wasn't abusive, and the two who were treated badly think she was. Coincidence? This is also a classic pattern in abusive families. The family members who were spared the abuse deny that their was anything wrong with their family and try to convince the victims that actually they are the problem (look into ""gaslighting"" to understand this phenomena more). As for journalists - the main claim is that he published the book when his parents were dead. Yes, and? He published a book about his childhood abuse after his parents died. Is it somehow better to publish this book when your parents are alive so you can place your family under public scrutiny and re-ignite the abusive dynamic you escaped? This criticism is weak. I suspect it's more  wanting to believe it's not true rather than  believing it's not true.  Final Verdict  I think it's important for books like this to exist. Even if we want to believe that we live in a perfect world, we don't. The reality is that the danger is not ""out there"" somewhere. Most child abuse happens at home, usually by the child's parents. ""Most trauma begins at home; the vast majority of people (about 80%) responsible for child maltreatment are children's own parents"" from trauma expert, Bessel van der Kolk source It's good to confront the truth and to hopefully be better at spotting the signs of child abuse (like many people in this book failed to do). This kind of book should exist in the world, I just think it wasn't executed in the best way. 3.4 stars",0,-0.9998,0.217,0.675,0.108,0.5629042791358966,NEGATIVE,0.9999

183,840845785,02/01/2014,1.0,"Yeah, so I'm about to be that bitch who comes down hard on A Child Called ""It"". Here we go. I'm going to say it - I don't believe this author. I think Dave Pelzer made up this story. I truly do. I was forewarned by the author himself at the beginning of the book to expect the book to be written in the perspective of a juvenile who experienced severe abuse for x amount of time - okay, I get that. You are trying to create an honest recollection of the environment and set the scene for the reader, so I wasn't expecting it to be the most well-written thing I've ever encountered. And yeah, it was pretty terribly written - but in different ways than I expected. First: there was literally no explanation for his mother's abuse. One day, she is likened to the Brady Bunch mother, she is the queen of mothers, she is the greatest thing since mothers started mothering - the next page, she is feeding Pelzer a dirty diaper. …What? What happened? I feel like I missed something huge? I guess you could argue that Pelzer doesn't KNOW why his mother changed, but you'd think he would allude to some of the changes in behavior that led up to it, because I don't think she snapped overnight? I don't know. His father … who he hates/is his hero/he hates/is his hero … I don't know what to even say about his brothers and father. It seems absolutely insane to me that his father wouldn't call the police on the mother himself, seeing as he had the freedom to come and go as he pleased, therefore wasn't really tethered to her … but that's just merely my opinion. But for someone who claims that he would be left in cold baths to suffer for hours, his siblings parading their friends by to come look and laugh at him while he shivered naked in the bathtub - you cannot tell me that one of those kids wouldn't have gone home and mentioned this in even an offhand way to their parents, instead of just asking what the ""bad boy"" did wrong now … ? An entire little colony of people knows about this child's suffering, and no one is bothering to help? Okay. Sounds right. I have never been abused by a parent, thank God, so I am sure it can be argued that I don't understand what abuse does to one's psyche, and how and why one can recall certain things with ease over others. But to have such incredible recollection and vivid memory about each and every thing that happened to you, yet not even be able to remember what your mother looked like ... well, it just kind of smells like BS. And honestly, there were several times that Dave fudged his own story/truth/whatever you want to call it - such as the big exciting moment where he got to come and be part of ""the fold"" again before the social worker visited, and he mentioned that he got to eat at the table for the first time in two years - and then in the next few pages makes a remark about how he was only treated similarly when company came over, which clearly refers to other times during that two year span that he was allowed to the table. Little things like this just nagged the shit out of me throughout this book. I feel like people want so badly to sympathize with a sad story that they are willing to overlook some really pertinent red flags here … and what that all just really boils down to is an extreme disservice to the millions of children worldwide who are actually suffering from child abuse every single day. After finishing the book, I started sniffing around on the internet … my research confirmed my suspicions about Mr. Pelzer even more, sadly. I hate to say that I'd like to believe that his story is true, because I obviously would NEVER want anyone to suffer that kind of abuse. But if a word of it isn't … that's disgusting on a brand new level. The good thing about this book is that maybe it brought awareness to anyone who might not have been aware of child abuse and how frequently it occurs, and to what hellish extents. So awareness to any cause that deserves it is never a bad thing, obviously. So I applaud him for writing a book that could open eyes. But to profit from it and potentially not be telling the truth about it … that's where I have a problem. I would be curious to know if Pelzer has ever done any charity work or made any donations to any foundations that work with abused children. For further reading, I encourage you to check out the following link**:http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/28/mag...**I think he would be much better off donating to children who have suffered as he claims he has, instead of making sure his books stay on the NYT lists.

187,1555780259,02/21/2016,5.0,"As predicted this was a hard one for me to read and it took me a long time to get through it, mostly because it hit a little too close to home...I won't go into the question if Dave has really experienced all that is described in the book or not. If even half of what he's written happened to him, it is more than any child should ever have to endure.A little story of my own: A few years ago, I confronted a mother in a store who yelled at her small boy and was dragging him behind her. The boy was about 3 or 4 years old and crying horribly. She rounded on him and raised her hand to slap him. The boy cowered and pleaded with her not to hurt him. I looked around the store and saw others turn away from the scene, pretending not to notice. Before she could hit him I stepped in and caught her arm. She sneered at me that I shouldn't stick my nose into other people's business. I looked at the boy who was rocking back and forth on the floor and saw bruises all over his arms - old and new ones. I called the police and asked a security guy to help me stop her from leaving until the police arrived.Later I asked the police what happened to the little guy. They couldn't tell me much but they said that he was brought to the hospital and there they discovered cracked ribs and cigarette burns all over his body. They assured me that he was now in the care of the child protective service and safe.Why am I telling you this? Even if Dave didn't experience all of those horrible things himself, he still gives voice to a matter a lot of people still ignore or are ignorant of. This book helps to raise the awareness of child abuse and might cause people to pay attention to what's happening around them. That's enough for me.I've read some reviewers complain about the lack of insight into the whys and wherefores and the style of writing. In the author's note Dave remarks that this book ""depicts language that was developed from a child's viewpoint."" And that ""the tone and vocabulary reflect the age and wisdom of the child at that particular time."" I don't think I have to say anything more to that. As to the lack of insight - again I'm stating the fact that this is told from the child's point of view and how in the world could a little kid explain why his mother changes her behavior seemingly overnight. He's just on the receiving end of this change without any clues to why it happened in the first place.Some readers couldn't understand the inconsistency of the child's feelings towards his parents - switching from love to hate and back again -, or the wish to tell someone in contrast to the need to protect your abuser. Again, you have to remember while reading this that we're witnessing the confusion of a kid (age 4 to age 12). You don't understand why you're not worthy of the love of someone who is supposed to love you unconditionally but you still love them nonetheless. It takes a long time to break a kid's basic trust and turn an innocent love into anger and hate. And even then you have bouts of doubt and ask yourself if your mother isn't right after all and you are the one to blame for all that is happening to you. A child's conditioning (aka brainwashing) is hard to change once it's set and often the mind games can be more severe than a beating. For a little kid parents are always right, they know what they are talking about, they know it all. Now imagine a little kid getting told over and over again that he's bad and at fault for what is happening to him. Of course he believes it and starts to hate and question himself.What really angered me was the behavior / reaction of the teachers and the father. The teachers have known or at least suspected for a while. Why did it take them so long to act? And the father... OMG! If he hadn't known at all I could forgive him. He wasn't home often and the child wouldn't tell because he wouldn't want to be the cause of problems between his parents (see brainwashing). But to actually witness the abuse of his child and not intervene is just... I don't even know what to say to that. And on top of it all, he was a firefighter, someone who risks his life to rescue others. Shouldn't he have had some sense of justice and honor?So, this book is definitely not light reading material and it gives you no clues into the dealing with the aftermath. It is an insight into a case of horrendous inhumanity which happens in one form or another far more often than you might think.",2,-0.9853,0.125,0.783,0.091,0.5185843396369711,NEGATIVE,0.857
188,2203695639,12/04/2017,4.0,"Before reading this book, please know that this book is heartbreaking but definitely an eye opener. Throughout the book you learn about the hardships of growing up in an abusive household through the perspective of David Pelzer.  First off, all of these terrible things that happened throughout the book actually happened to the author himself. It's very hard to believe that this isn't fictional as the the author describes the pain he went through after his loving mother was transformed into his worse nightmare.   In David's first few years of life he was content. His family loved him and they were super close. One day, everything changed and the abuse began. After David's first grade year, he was held back. But, he wasn't held back because he wasn't smart enough, he was held back because his mother believed he should not pass. From this day on, David was constantly reminded he was a bad boy. At this point he was not severely abused, but occasionally hit or sent to the corner. Although this seems like nothing, slowly but surely, the punishment for being a ""bad boy"" became worse. After a few months of mild punishment, it became worse. David became the family slave. He could not play with or even look at his other brothers. In addition, he wasn't allowed to go anywhere with the family outside of the house and wasn't even allowed to have dinner with them! His brothers didn't do anything to stop this and neither did his father. During this time David was either locked out in the garage alone or was forced to do chores. If he didn't complete the tasks to his mothers standards, his punishment was brutal. Everyday after school his mother would have a new ""game"" ready for him.Some of these games consisted of constant hitting while others were much worse. Since getting food was a constant struggle for David, he began stealing food from school and other kids at school. This solution worked well for David, until he got caught and the school called his mother. His mother didn't want David to have ANY food so, when he got home he was first beaten and then was forced to throw it up and eat it. Since David was so hungry still he found another solution. He ran to school in the morning and quickly devoured some food. This then gave him plenty of time to digest the food before returning home later that day. Although David thought this was smart, his mother soon noticed him gaining some weight and he was then poisoned with anemia, beaten and was once even accidentally stabbed. After months of suffering Davids excuses for showing up at school with bruises no longer worked. The school questioned David and he had to tell the truth. Davids mother no longer had custody of him and he was put into a foster home. I would definitely recommend this book! This isn't an easy read but it definitely teaches you a lot about how terrible and awful people can be. I gave this book a four out of five stars because some parts are very brutal and hard to read. Theres nothing I would change in the book itself except the ending. Although this book is one of a few in a series, he ended was very random and I would have enjoyed it more if it left more of a suspenseful cliffhanger that could leave readers thinking.",2,-0.9981,0.212,0.696,0.092,0.480277477152477,NEGATIVE,0.9986
189,3598610056,10/17/2020,1.0,"I believe A Child Called ""It"" is a made up fantasy and not a memoir, to say the least.I don't want to say this man was NEVER abused. If someone cries abuse I'm not going to say they're lying. I will, however, apply logic and reasoning to what they're saying and try to separate the truth from exaggerations. Every child is known to exaggerate but there is always a vein of truth within their stories.I tend to believe one of two things: the stories are greatly exaggerated or he was a troubled youth and made mountains out of mole hills. I tend to believe the idea that his stories were greatly exaggerated.The author/victim couldn't remember the color of his mothers eyes or hair, yet he remembered even the dates of certain abuses, the number of hits, the words said, and every fleeting thought. He remembers each abuse in vivid detail, clarity and full color descriptions.but he remembers too many specifics and here's an example taken from chapter two:""... The green river was as smooth as glass. The bluejays scolded the other birds, and a warm breeze blew through my hair. Without a word, we stood watching the firebhall-like sun as it sank behind the tall trees, leaving bright blue and orange streaks in the sky. From above, I felt someone hug my shoulders....""Being stabbed in the stomach, eating feces, being stuck for an hour in a bathroom full of bleach and ammonia (This he called the gas-chamber game.), no food for 10 days (believable ONLY if he was given access to water), having a diaper mashed in his face, forced to eat his own vomit, burning an arm over the stove, whipping him with chains, making him wash dishes in scalding water, drinking ammonia and Clorox, forcing him to lay in freezing water for hours, general physical abuse of punching and hitting, the list goes on. I know there's no such thing as ""traditional abuse"" because abuse is unique to each case, but some of these incidents go past abuse and into sadistic behavior which would spill over into other areas of the mother's life. A sadistic personality is not something someone can keep hidden for long (which is seems she did: normal one day and then psychotic the next). Also most of these incidents a healthy, grown man wouldn't survive, namely stabbing to the stomach, sitting in an enclosed space with bleach/ammonia, lying in freezing water (assuming 32 degrees or below) for hours, and force-fed ammonia and Clorox. It's not physically possible for a healthy man to survive that, let alone an abused child??A stab to the stomach is something that requires immediate medical attention and from what I remember, he cleaned and sutured it himself all before the age of 9? so while he's bleeding and in pain, he's tending to his own medical needs. That doesn't make a whole lot of sense but let's move on. Bleach and ammonia create a very toxic gas (chlorine gas which was used as a chemical agent in WWI) that causes respiratory distress and after repeated exposure can cause severe health issues and even death. Many men from WWI died from chlorine gas but a little boy survived. That doesn't make much sense either???And finally, being force-fed ammonia and Clorox. Both are poisons and both kill. Simple as that. Even a tiny amount can cause extreme harm to child and he reports it happened multiple times??I've been googling the author/victim for the past hour and I even watched his interview with Oprah and the man speaks of his childhood abuses too flippantly, and seems more obsessed about book and ticket sales than he does about getting his story out.....Yes, child abuse happens, but just because it CAN happen, doesn't mean it happened to HIM. And even if he was abused as a child, I honestly believe he embellished his stories to the point of absurdity, and that is what makes me mad. Making up stories, or even embelishing on stories of abuse, cheapens what is *actually* happening to kids around the world.",2,-0.9985,0.178,0.76,0.062,0.5515637610976593,NEGATIVE,0.9989

191,1805727011,11/07/2016,5.0,"A Child Called “It”By: Jackeline Cuellar	Have you ever wondered how many children in the world are getting abused by their children? This book by Dave Pelzer tells a very nerve racking, sad, and frustrating story. This book is based on a real story and full of many plot twists.	In this book you will meet a little boy named Dave, his mother that beats him very very brutally, his family and what goes on in school. You will read all about what Dave had to experience and what his whole life was about. The world he lived in he was treated like nothing. Nobody ever really cared about him but the teachers at school. You will come across the most harsh things that Dave’s mother had him do. His mother acted like he did not even exist. He slept in his basement with nothing but an old army cot and his clothes were very torn. There is a period in the book where your hopes get very high and you have lots of hope that something good will happen to Dave. This book will trick you into thinking many things. At the end of this very sad novel, Dave’s father goes away and Dave is still stuck with his brutal mother and all he can do at this point is pray and hope for the best and give it his all.The ending leaves you at kind of a cliffhanger because you never actually know what happened to Dave after the novel is finished.	After reading this novel I can conclude that the theme of the story is heart touching. The theme “heart touching” may sound like if the novel is about a happy story but it honestly is not. I very much believe that this book is heart touching because while reading this book you could almost feel everything the little boy is going through. You could feel his loneliness, how much he is starving and how hard he is suffering to try to make it alive each and every day. Dave’s mother makes him suffer very very bad. While reading the book I came across a part of the chapter where you could almost feel his pain. This part of the book I could not believe. According to the author, one day when they got home, his mother made him lay on top of the burning gas stove with no clothes on. As a reader I thought to myself, this little boy did nothing to be treated like this. He should have lived a very great life and his mother should have treated Dave as equal as he treated his other siblings. I also had to ask myself that what came to his mother’s head when she was doing all the terrible stuff to her own child? Dave’s struggle to survive was what made me have so much feelings while reading this novel. He intended to never give up and he also kept to his mind that he would survive his mother’s brutal abuse towards him.	“A Child Called “It” is a very great title for this nonfiction novel. I feel this way because the fact that the title gives you a hint that throughout the story the child is an “It”, this lets you know that something is going to happen to the child because in the title they do not mention the child’s name. There were many parts of the book that got me very angry because of the horrible things that the mother did to her child. This book made me cry because I could not imagine how this child felt while experiencing all of this. There were only a few parts of the story that I really enjoyed because there were parts where Dave did not have to get abused and he had the chance to get rescued by someone. 	Hands down one of the best novels ever. I was so emotional while reading this book. I highly recommend this book to children 13 and up. I could not put this book down for several hours. On a scale from 1-5 I totally give this book a 5 out of 5.",2,0.8945,0.119,0.749,0.132,0.5704054580896687,NEGATIVE,0.9686
192,127405912,10/22/2010,5.0,"Kayne KulmanRomaniuk/MoyerReading/L.A Book Review 319 October 2010 The Wide Window: The danger is just beginning! The Wide Window, by Lemony Snickets, is a story about three main characters named Klaus, Sunny, and Violet. These characters go through more danger, sorrow, and adventure than anyone else in the book. Their new home is on the brink of a cliff dangling by a few pieces of wood and nails. Soon their house falls and when it falls Captain Sham pushes Aunt Josephine, the guardian of Klaus, Sunny, and Violet, out the window. The Wide Window is a very captivating book because there are a lot of details, very well explained, and the characters are very easy to visualize.I have never read any other book that has so many details. The book, The Wide Window, allows the reader to understand the message that the author is trying to give. One reason you know he’s describing many details is when he says, “when Violet is putting her hair back you know she’s thinking because she doesn’t want her hair in her face. Also, in the first book, The Bad Beginning, it explains Count Olaf really well. For example, his tall skinny body, pointed head, and shinny eyes. This character reminds me of Mr. VanderPloeg. He teaches science and social studies in 6th grade. The reason I think he reminds me about him is because he had really shiny eyes and a pointed by. The author, Lemony Snickets, has a writing style that captures the reader’s attention. He captures the reader because he can really put so much danger in this story like when Captain Sham pushes Aunt Josephine out the window into a lake full of leaches. There’s another part of the story when the house is breaking down and Captain Sham made Aunt Josephine write a secret note so Klaus, Violet, and Sunny can find out where she went. When she got lost Violet, Klaus, and Sunny went to try and find Aunt Josephine by reading the secret note saying, “Curdle Cave”Lemony Snickets is a writer that has made the characters in the book really stands out to the reader. His audience is able to create images through the reader’s mind. For example, we know when Violet is thinking because she ties her hair up in a ponytail. Sunny is my favorite character because she is always saying things that no one knows what it means. Klaus, and violet can tell what she is saying because they have been around Sunny for such a long time. Another thing that I like about Sunny is she is always smiling just like me.The Wide Window is a very captivating book because there is a lot of detail, very well explained, and the characters are very easy to visualize. This is an important book because we should be thankful we don’t have this kind of family. No one wants to have this family because there is always a person following them trying to kill them. My life is definitely not like this one because no is trying to kill my parents and me and we haven’t died.Reflection  I feel that I deserve a B or an A because I really worked hard on this book review and hope I get a better grade than last book review. The easy part about this writing assignment was that I knew what was going on and had a good thesis statement that I can use throughout my written review.",2,0.9847,0.06,0.82,0.12,0.4578592042877757,POSITIVE,0.9996
193,1242292402,03/31/2015,4.0,"Have you ever met a person or read a book about a neglected and beaten child. Well in this autobiography, Dave Pelzer was neglected in so many ways he was even referred to as ""it"". He was also excluded from the rest of the family to the point were he was basically a stranger who lived in the basement that was mistreated. Other than the disturbing parts this book was actually a good book and I really enjoyed it and I couldn't help but turn the next page.Dave Pelzer was first the spoiled child in his family until his mother started drinking which caused him to be neglected, and tortured in my words. Dave Pelzer was beaten everyday, he had to sleep in the cold basement by himself and he was starved but his father decided to bring him food some days and sometimes talk to him. He was starved at home so much when his father wasn't around he stole food from his school so he could eat, but once the school called to say he had stolen the food his mother made him throw it up and then beat him for eating when he didn't ""earn it"" as she said. Then one day the nurse noticed he wore the same clothes. She then noticed the bruising's and marks from his beatings but ,his mother always made up excuses he was required to say if anyone asked until the nurse knew he was beaten when he had a stab wound no excuse could save. She decided to help him and got school officials involved. The characters motivation was his father. His father would try to talk to his mother from beating him and he would acutually care about him but not enough. I couldnt understand why the father left because i think he should have tried to help dave more because when Dave's Father was around the mother was was not as harsh as she was when he wasn't but when the mother stabbed dave instead of the father helping him he left. I wish that dave got a reason for being treated so bad he deserves one but there is really no reason for him to actually be beat treated so wrong but i wish that Dave knew what he did. The mothers actions were not believable when she tried to burn him. I felt she was doing to much and at that point i wanted to know a reason to. Also dave has brothers i dont understand why his mom only picked him of all to beat i didnt understand. The other boys according to the book had a ""luxurious life"". I rate this book 4 stars because it was a good book it was detailed and it introduced me to a new view on children or anyone who gets abused because i once had a person who i knew be abused but i didnt know how detailed it could get. I recommend this book to people above elementary school and to people like me who dont know a lot about abuse and abusive people.

Although it is really sad and has a lot of detail on child abuse is one of my favorite books. I wouldn't recommend it to someone that gets depressed over sad things that happen to kids. Also I like that it is based on a true story, the author suffered a lot in his childhood and he explains in detail how it was. If someone is really sensitive to this type of topics I would not recommend it to them. The book has a strong, detailed reading that some people can not take. This might lead to something bad if the right person does not read it. The book is so detailed it makes the reader feel like they are living that moment. In my opinion I felt like I was in part of the scenes imagined in g everything that was happening and how the boy felt about everything his mom did to him. The starting of the book it's confusing because it starts at a current time and then later it goes back in time. The story might get confusing but you have to keep up so you won't get lost. The first chapter is the most important chapter because it explains everything in detail and how everything started. The tone of this this book is sad because the story in it is sad. Also it has a depressing tone. The author makes the reader feel sad and depressed as they read the book. Me personally, I felt really bad for the boy as I was reading this book. I can not imagine a kid suffering this much like this boy did. In the middle of the story the mom feels bad for the both and she starts being kind with him. At this point the reader gets really surprised about what is happening and the reader gets an idea of what the outcome is going to be but this outcome changes completely. Throughout the whole book there is just a sequence of events that tells the little boys story. The boy really suffered a lot due to his mom. The story is told from where the boy is seven years to when he turns eleven. There is other factors in the story besides just the boy suffering from child abuse. Also, the boy suffers from bullying at school and he doesn't seek for help because he is scared to do so. The story ends with a sad ending. I did not like the ending because it does not have a specific ending. The ending has to be made up by the reader. In this case the reader has to define the ending. I would like for the ending to \have ended differently with more specific ending. Also I can think that there might be a second book following the first one. The second book should have Dave’s story of what happened after he turned 12 years old and how he became an awesome writer and how he did it to survive the following years of his life.

196,500106864,01/08/2013,1.0,"This was recommended to me by counseling group friend, and so i felt obligated to read it. Where do I start? Maybe with Pelzer's forward, in which he reminds us to remember that the language and style is form the perspective of a boy from 4 to 12 years old. Thanks for coming off condescending to your readers. The insult to injury was that I wasn't ever convinced this was from a child of that age's perspective. If it was, that's a damn smart 4 yr old. And one that has some kind of vivid memory- which is entirely possible, considering the premise of the traumatic experiences vs the good ones, but not convincing enough.Next, it doesn't matter if the accounts in this book are exaggerated, real, or whatnot. Because someone, somewhere *has* been this abused (for an entirely real account of such abuse, The Girl in the Window article is a recommended read: http://www.tampabay.com/features/huma... ) But it reads like a laundry list of some of the worst scenarios a person could imagine. Where is the hard psychology in this book? I can speak from experience that the sudden mental shifts in the mother are plausible, as my own mother descended quite quickly as a paranoid schizophrenic who threatened violence and had severe mentally abusive shift sin behavior. But the thing is, my own mother has a background as a cause, where in the mother here seems like the most cartoonish, ultra malevolent, over the top sadistic villain. And that image may have been stolen by the famous case- Sylvia Linkens, whose aunt, Ruth Chandler, sadistically abused her in 1965 in some similiar ways as this book. The family hierarchy and time period between stories is almost perfectly parallel. In the long run, I didn't hate the book. It was interesting from a hypothetical psychological perspective, and the flip-flopping of emotions is a powerful statement on how the brain reacts to situations of severe abuse. I filled in my own gaps that the author left out to try and understand where such circumstances originated from. The one star is because the author failed at the point of the book. There's no why,and whatever point he was trying to make, real or not, feels thin, surreal, and merely a manipulative ploy. ",2,-0.996,0.204,0.714,0.082,0.5923054587688733,NEGATIVE,1.0

This book was a difficult book to read especially since I'm a mom of a handsome, brilliant, smart autistic child. I would never DREAM of treating my son with such brutality and cruelty, it's disgusting. So in this book this little boy started off with a loving mom, dad & brothers. Then one day his mother started treating him with disgust and cruelty. When he turned to his dad for help, his dad would tell him to be a good boy for his mommy and not to make her mad. His own father was scared of his mother. But his mother didn't treat her other kids the way she treated ""Dave"" that way. It didn't matter what he did because he became her punching bag, her slave, her maid. She had him doing all the household chores. And he did them all in a timely fashion with hopes that his mother will reward him with food. FOOD! This little boy was starved and beaten every single day. He would steal food to feed himself and when his mother became suspicious of him stealing, she would stick her fingers in his mouth and make him throw up his own food. Then to make it worse, she'd make him eat it!I can't even let my son go to bed without eating dinner, and on days he doesn't eat dinner I have him eat some snacks. But to starve him for being a ""Bad Boy"", I could never. This book was an emotional book to read. This little boy should have been given a proper life with a loving family but instead he received nothing but hell to live with. I personally wish his mother pays for all she did to him. I give this book 5 stars and it's definitely a Good Choice for Reading.On a side note. So many people on GR's are saying how this is made up. Now maybe that's true or not but for someone to make up a story like that would have to be demented. And you guys forget that he wrote this as he saw it in the eyes of a young boy.

If the story is a fabrication, then perhaps it will give strength and hope to others that are going through child abuse. I will admit, like others that have critiqued some of the author's abuse experiences, some seem unsurvivable and perhaps were exaggerated (I know that aspiring Navy Seals going through BUDS have died of hypothermia from standing prolonged periods in cold water and in my current occupation I have seen people nearly die from suicide attempts by taking a drink of Clorax bleach and were only saved from asphyxiation by their burned swollen throat by paramedics able to get an airway tube down their throat in time). Perhaps luck, divine intervention, the will to live, etc. could have played a major role in protecting this child from death. Like many others that have reviewed this book who have shared some of their personal stories and related their abuse to some of the author's experiences, I too had a rough childhood with a dysfunctional family consisting of an alcoholic (but loving and caring father who provided) and a physically abusive mother (who I suspect has mental health issues and I have long since no longer welcome in my life) who mentally and physically abused my brother and I. Some of the abuse experiences that the author described were similar to those inflicted on me and my brother (but were drastically toned down when compared to the author but would not at all be found acceptable). The day my mother and father divorced and my brother and I went to live with my dad was one of the best days of my life.

My heart goes out to all those who are in some type of struggle at this moment. After reading this boy’s story, I could not emphasize enough in this review how much I fell in love with this book. The multiple attempts and survival stories shared by this boy gives me the courage to step up for any kid in a similar situation.Throughout the book, it was difficult to pick one of the most drastic events because the mother treated her kid so horribly that I could not bear to read. One of the most heartbreaking actions the child’s mother made him do was when “mother then ordered me to climb up onto the stove and lie on the flames so she could watch me burn” (Pelzer 41). Just reading the things the mother made her kid do was so hard because I could only imagine the pain the poor kid went through. He could not speak out against his mother and that is what hurt me the most. There was no way around this pain.In search of finding solutions, the kid sadly has no other resort than to blame himself. It’s tearing when a little boy that is abused like this blames himself. He confirms, “at the core of my soul, I hated myself more than anybody or anything. I came to believe that everything that happened to me or around me was my own fault because I had let it go on for so long” (Pelzer 136). Imagining that a little kid says this is heartbreaking because it’s never the kids fault but the situation is so bad for him that he has no other solution. Overall, the way Pelzer wrote this book was magnificent because of the feelings he portrayed through his words.

It is clear that David's mother is an extreme sadist and suffers from a severe case of schizophrenia. A piece of evidence about his mother being schizophrenic is: "" She reached across the seat and seized my chin, lifting my head towards her. Mother's eyes were bloodshot and her voice sounded as if she were possessed "". Tragically, such a painful thing happened in secret without anyone doing anything about it. Everyone who witnessed the suffering of David without doing anything to stop it is to blame, especially his father. Child abuse is a crime and treating such a hideous crime with silence is even worse. No creature at all no matter what deserves such treatment. I salute David for surviving the hell he lived and for the courage of sharing his story. David, you inspire us and succeeded in spreading awareness on child abuse. I am sure your story helps many people who suffer alone in silence. I would like to say to the people who doubt the credibility of David's story that I don't blame them. I passed through stages of doubt too while reading the book and this is completely normal. It's our human nature to refuse to believe that such things exist and to live in denial towards such cases.

Dave was starved and tortured almost to the point of death. He had two brothers who were fed and treated normally.

It is truly horrible that a child should ever be treated like this for even a day and that it continued for years is unimaginable. I commend Mr. Pelzer for having the courage and will to overcome his childhood, something that must have been very challenging on many levels.Despite the compelling story and the good that the book has apparently done, I didn't love it. It was not especially well written, which the author says is a result of using the language and vocabulary of a child. While I certainly do not question the stories of abuse, I wonder if some of the details might have become slightly blurred between childhood and the writing of the book, as would certainly be understandable. I guess that from my sheltered view, it just seems that some of what he suffered was not survivable.Despite any flaws the book may have, raising awareness of abuse perhaps might lead someone to step in and help another child, and not wait and expect someone else to solve the problem. Still, help must be done with care because, as explained in the book, done badly, no matter how well intentioned, it can lead to more abuse for the child.I haven't read the remaining books of the trilogy yet but think that perhaps it would have been better to publish the three as a single book, or at least the two about his young years.

206,3679091722,12/05/2020,5.0,"A Child Called “It”, is an autobiography written by Dave Pelzer and what he went through as an abused child. His mother, Catherine Roerva was just like any ordinary mother in the beginning, but as time progressed and she saw her husband less and less, while indulging in alcohol, she brutally suppressed Pelzer by beating him unremorsefully, burning him while having him sit on the stove so she could see his flesh burn, starving him, poisoning him with ammonia, and even once stabbed him. Pelzer describes her behavior from going from a sweet mommy to a mother. The once caring mother had been gone and his father Stephen Pelzer, at first attempted to prevent the beatings, then he snuck food to him, and finally he was lost in alcohol and watched the abuse take place without saying a word. He had three siblings, however he was the only pinpointed one. Nevertheless, on top of all the stuff he had to endure at home, he went through bullying at school, and at many points wanted to get his mother to kill him so the torment could end.Some of the themes in, “A Child Called It,” are survival, dehumanization, bystander effect, and courage. The theme of survival is presented very early on and becomes the main center throughout the book. “Mother can beat me all she wants, but I haven’t let her take away my will to somehow survive” (pg. 4). His will to live is evident throughout the story, because, even though he has nothing and is desperate and hopeless, he continues to fight and not give his mother the satisfaction to see him die. He even learns to treat his wound after being stabbed, and steals from other children’s lunch boxes to calm his hunger, since mother would ‘forget’ to feed him at dinner. Even though he describes his hunger as , “I’m so hungry I could eat a horse,” (hyperbole), which really allows the reader to see how strong his hunger was and almost allows the reader to feel it, Pelzer continues to find new ways to gain that access to food. There’s one thing he holds firmly to and that’s to survive.Dave’s mother’s dehumanization, can be seen by her treating him less than a human and more like an animal. “Mother” would send him down to the basement to sleep on an army cot, and refused to let him eat with the family at dinner time- only feeding him leftovers. It went from her calling him, “The Boy”, to her calling Dave, “It”. Catherine Roerva stated, “You are nobody! An It! You are nonexistent! You are a bastard child! (Repetition) I hate you and I wish you were dead!” (pg. 144). The author’s use of repetition allows the reader to see how his mother is taking out her anger on him, by repeating the word “you” (pinpointing one child). She refuses to call him by his name and the use of the word “you” also displays that; it also shows how much she hates him through the harsh words that she’s telling him. His mother once stated, “You’ve made my life a living hell!” (pg. 28). She wanted to show him what hell was like. During his first time being in the bathtub punishment where he had to submerge his body in ice, cold water, he described his experience as, “I felt like an alligator in a swamp” (pg.67) (simile). The author’s use of a simile allows the readers to see how, by comparing himself to an animal, this emphasizes the theme of dehumanization. His mother treats him so much like an animal that he begins to feel as though he were one.The theme of courage can be seen as early on as the title, “A Child’s Courage to Survive”, this is paralleled with Dave’s will to survive by refusing to lose hope or faith. Although it would’ve been easy for Dave to lose hope, he displayed courage to keep himself strong during his abuse, and by doing that, he knows that Mother hasn’t truly beat him in her game. “I had beaten her. I had bought a few precious minutes. I use my head to survive. For the first time, I had won! I knew, for the first time, that I could survive. That day I vowed myself that I would never, ever again give her the satisfaction of hearing me beg her to stop beating me” (pg. 42-43).The bystander effect becomes apparent throughout the book when his father would stand there and watch his son get beat mercilessly, without a single word of interference. His siblings know it’s better for themselves if they avoid Dave at all times, and even cooperate to get him in trouble. His school teachers see his bruises and his malnourishment, but it takes them years to call the police, which is why Pelzer’s abuse went on for so long. “She informed me the papers were my blankets, and the floor under the table was now my bed. Again I shot a glance at father, but he acted as though I was not even in the room” (pg 67). “During recess, I would go over to Stan’s first grade class to play. At school we were the best of friends; however, at home, we both knew I was not to be acknowledged” (pg 26).The Russian River was a place filled with happy memories for Dave, but as his mother attempted to feed him his infant brother’s feces, those happy memories were blinded and he felt, “A river of tears roll down his cheeks” (metaphor)(pg 41). By comparing his tears to a river, we can see how the once happy memories he held of the river turned to tears, because of his mother’s actions. “In the years before I was abused, my family was the Brady Bunch of the 1960s” (pg 17) (allusion). Through the author’s use of allusion, comparing his family to the Brady Bunch in the beginning of the book, it allows us to see the drastic change that occurred in his family, from being happy to a living hell.Throughout the memoir of, “A Child Called It,” we can see how Dave was abused by his mother and the drastic change that alcohol brought upon their lives. We can see all he had to go through for YEARS, and how people stood by and watched- including his family members. Nonetheless, even though he was dehumanized, treated like an animal, and despised, he never truly gave up and continued to hold firmly onto the small will, hope, and dream that this would one day all be over, displaying courage and survival. I love this book, because it’s something that is actually common throughout the world, yet there are people who don’t speak up about it.I feel like this book brings awareness to that and allows us to merely see all the incidents a child can go through and what a single person can prevent by speaking up. Now, here we are reading his book and bringing awareness to child abuse through his amazing but horrible story. If you were a fan of, “A Child Called It,” by Dave Pelzer, then you’ll love, “The Lost Boy,” and, “A Man Named Dave,” since these books go more in depth about his child abuse and later on foster care. They also discuss what he had to go through as a young adult and how he made a living for himself from having nothing to something. ",0,-0.7766,0.129,0.745,0.127,0.4989707591790923,NEGATIVE,0.6608

I've had a lot of friends tell me stories of things they've undergone and frankly you don't have to undergo a horrorshow of sadistic torture for it to still be called abuse and for it to still be something a child (or adult) shouldn't have to suffer though.After hearing people and speakers talk about such things, reading this kind of book feels intrusive. And even though it's been years since I read it it left me with ugly mental images I'd rather not have in my head at all.So now that I've read this and a few other ""child abuse misery memoirs"" - I'm done, I get the genre, that's enough. I don't have to read any more. I found nothing enjoyable about suffering vicariously along with the narrator.

His mother was a strict but kind mother until Dave started bringing home bad notes from the teachers. It is about his survival through her ""games"" that are bad enough to kill him, and he gets close to it many times. Mother is a mean lady who makes her son clean until his knuckles bleed, and if he doesn't get done in time, she won't feed him. Dave is a smart, stubborn, trouble making boy that wants to be dead. He is treated badly by his mother that makes him work constantly until he falls to the ground, crying from her beatings. Father is a firefighter who is Dave's ""Superhero"" and helps him get food and survive. He soon becomes a drunk who cares about nothing but drinking and his work. The conflict is that Dave starts becoming a bad child and soon gets beat, worse and worse, by his mother. All he wants is to be dead!The resolution is that Dave acts badly enough, he gets put into foster care and doesn't have to live with his mean family. I think this book is a life lesson. If you think your life is bad, try living as Dave. I think this book is not appropriate for anyone younger than 13. I would recommend this book to people that like novels and want to know what it is like in Dave's perspective. ",2,-0.9916,0.22,0.674,0.106,0.5494663382594417,NEGATIVE,0.9999

I realize and recognize the serious abuse he endured, but I fail to see the reason he published a book about it. At the end there were a few short pages about how he is doing now, but nothing about the recovery process. Over and over throughout the book I found myself wondering when it would end. And when the end came I was still left with a hundred questions. It felt like a pointless and time consuming book for those looking to get a thrill out of violence. The thing that confused me the most was that on the back and first page he added all these reviews that said things like ""This is the most serious case of abuse ever reported"" and again I found myself asking ""why is that in here"". So if you like to read about little boys being horribly beaten and starved, then go ahead, this is the book for you. But if you're looking for a book about recovery or statistics and facts, or even just something that will teach you about the history of child abuse, then pick up a book for people who give a damn about not letting this kind of thing happen again.

I think years ago when I read this it was unfathomable to me how this sort of abuse could have gone on unreported for years, but I think I have a better grasp on it now. In any case, at least it does highlight the atrocities of child abuse and draw sympathetic attention to its victims. The writing is shit, but I can let that slide, as it's reviewed by the the guy who does Chicken Soup for the Soul and let's be honest, that's no great work of literature.The rereading experience leaves me feeling slightly grubby, like Pelzer has played me for sympathy.

284,2819669850,05/13/2019,,"Personal ResponseI thought  A Child Called “It” by Dave Pelzer was really sad. I didn’t like how depressing the story ended up being. I thought this was a very informative book because I learned that my complaining is nowhere near the pain the author had to deal with. I hope that the author finally found peace to what he endured. PlotA Child Called “It” by Dave Pelzer was a true story about the survival of a child that was one of the worst child abuse cases ever reported. David Pelzer had been starved and also suffered from torture, which began when he was four years old. David was only allowed to eat the leftovers of his brother's cereal. His mother would never drive him to school. He would normally be forced to run to school. David was called to the nurse's office because someone reported his injuries to her. This had become a routine that way she was able to look at his injuries. One of the times the nurse called in the principal due to the extent of his injuries. David's mother had started to drink and was becoming depressed. During her drinking binges, his mother had taken out her negative feelings on David. It quickly progressed to beatings. One of these beatings caused David to get a broken arm. Soon, the abuse started to turn into mental punishments. When his mother gave birth to two more boys, the punishments had become harsher. David was excluded from all family events. Oftentimes, David was not even allowed to sleep in the house. His mother never tried to hide the abuse she had done to her son. She forced him to go to school in clothes he had been wearing for months at a time and told him what to tell to anyone who asked about his bruises. When teachers became suspicious, his mother had given excuses to get out of interviews or she convinced David the worst was over, and that she would never hurt him again. When his father was home, the punishments were never as severe. David lost hope of being saved and thought he would be stuck with his “family” forever. He eventually stopped caring about avoiding his mother's rage. Months after David found the strength to pray, he was rescued by teachers at his elementary school. David grew up, became a father, and made peace with the horrible abuse he suffered as a child.CharacterizationDavid Pelzer was only four years old when the book started. He lived with his abusive mother and father who hadn’t done anything to stop the abuse that occured. While he lived in that household, he had to figure out how to outsmart his mother. It was very rare that his attempts were successful. David had to have a strong mindset in order to get through the abuse, but it was hard at times. Near the end of the book, David had thought about what it would be like to have a different life.David’s mother had loved all of her children. Something had switched and she had begun to go on drinking binges and would act completely different towards David. She was not the same to his other brothers. She would not let David eat, sleep indoors, and send him to school in clothing he had already been wearing for months. Throughout the book, her abuse had escalated and she had taken away any source of comfort David had left. SettingThis book took place in Daly City, California during 1970. During this time, child abuse had been unnoticed and was ignored a majority of the time due to the author’s school being fairly large. Social services Abuse left a huge mark on David Pelzer’s life because it happened to him. He felt the pain of child abuse first-hand from his parents.Thematic ConnectionOvercoming child abuse was a huge theme of this book. It was prevalent because the author explained how his whole childhood revolved around the constant abuse he had gone through and how it shaped his life. He described how his mother made him wear clothing he had already worn for months. He also stated he had told his teachers stories of how he got his bruises.RecommendationI would recommend this book to any high school student. I gave this recommendation because it was a very mature book with mature content that should not be read by younger students.

This book was definitely very detailed while David was telling his abuse stories as a young kid. This story shows how people who are doing wrong can get away so easily if they don’t ask the person who is actually the one being hurt. I would 100% recommend this book to teenagers or adults who love autobiographical books. Plot: David is the main character of the story that is an ordinary fifth-grade student living in Daly City, California in 1973. David is hit the morning he is sent to the nurse's office for a visit about the bruises his teacher had seen on him from his mother Catherine Pelzer. While being checked, the nurse sees multiple bruises which lead to the police being involved. David also has a stab wound. David is taken away by police where he thinks he is being arrested but in reality, he is being taken to “freedom” from his abusive mother. He’ll never have to see her again. David then flashes back to the late 1960’s when he was a young kid living in California with his two brothers, Ronald and Stan Pelzer. David loves his mother and father- who is a firefighter and works long hours. David’s mother is a kind, loving woman and treats him greatly. As time goes on, however, Catherine begins drinking more. She also becomes more abusive towards David. For example, one night while David’s father is out, his mother hits him, seriously hurting David and his arm. The next day David’s mother takes him to the hospital claiming falsely that David fell out of bed; making David say, “I'm a bad boy” over and over again; making David repeat the first grade even when he is a bright student. David notices the little things like his mother doesn’t treat him wrongly around his father and siblings. Catherine is asked to come into the school after David’s principal notices bruises and wants to talk to her on how they got there. David’s mother gets away with her abuse like normal, but now David finds out she is pregnant with another baby (who is named Russell). David is then started to be starved to death while his mother denies him any regular meals. Another abuse incident happens with a diaper and feces smeared all over his face but its stopped when his father and brothers Stan and Ron come home. One punishment David faces when he is a child, he is forced to wear the same clothes every day to school to be embarrassed. David gets to the point where he starts stealing food at school to survive; his mother starts putting ammonia in the trash to stop David from eating it. Catherine makes David eat plain ammonia in front of her leading to a burning tongue and a painful night of sleep. Another incident is David being stabbed. His mother drunker than normal, stumbling while holding the knife and accidentally stabbing David in the chest. Now David is in fourth grade and the abuse is still continuing only harsher than the years before. She beats him with chains, hits him, and forces him to vomit and inhale ammonia. His mother gives birth to yet another baby boy named Kevin, whom David falls in love with immediately. A couple weeks later his mother apologizes for abusing him and starts treating him like the other boys. When a social worker comes it all hits him; his mother was being nice so he wouldn't tell the truth. He lies to the officer anyways and says everything is fine because he was scared of his mother. Fifth grade comes along and everything starts to go downhill. His mother and father begin arguing non-stop. Eventually, his father has enough so he leaves them for good. While at school, David is constantly being bullied by classmates that are saying he should just kill himself. This is when he gives up on life completely. When his father left his mother, he knew she could do whatever she wanted to him now without being stopped. Finally, David is taken away at school by the police. He immediately knew then that all abuse finally will come to a stop. Characterization:Catherine Pelzer is the abuser in the book. She is being shown as a monster but David tells the readers that his mother never used to be like this. David tells the readers that Catherine, or Mother, was a kind, loving woman to him until she started drinking when he is in the first grade. The drinking turned his mother Catherine into the monster. David Pelzer is the victim to the abuse in the book. He tells us the story of his life and how he goes from being a normal kid to bring to the victim to extreme abuse. David tells readers multiple stories about his mother abusing him while also stabbing him in the chest when he was young. This story is David’s childhood of abuse to freedom. Impact of Setting:I would have to say the impact of setting would be when David was taken away by police officers in school to never go home again which happens in the first chapter. This chapter takes place in 1973 in Daly, California. I believe this is an impact because David lived in a big city so they never really noticed his abuse fully until he was in the fifth grade. They all believed he was just a troublemaker. Then the book goes back into time readers can see all the events that happened to lead to him being “free” from his terrible mother. Theme: The theme in The Child Called “It” would have to be overcoming the various forms of child abuse. This book tells us the plain facts about the truly horrible physical, verbal and emotional abuse inflicted on David by Catherine Pelzer as a child. David overcomes by fighting the battle of mental and physical abuse from his mother.Recommendation:I would recommend this book to anyone who loves true stories. This book is very detailed and about the abuse that one kid goes through his entire life before finally winning when the school has seen enough. The Child Called “It” is a highly detailed and very visual story. I would recommend this book to older middle school students and high school students who are into visual books but also true stories about someone's life.

286,2134539597,10/16/2017,5.0,"Personal Response: I enjoyed A Child Called “It” by Dave Pelzer, because it told a real life story of his childhood and how he was abused by his mother. This gave me an inside look on how bad it could be for some children. It was very emotional and real to me when I read this book. Plot: His book began with him getting checked over by the school nurse. He lied about his bruises, just as his mother told him to do. David got taken away from his family to be in a more safe environment. He got taken away because his mother would always beat him and torture him. She hated David, but she loved her other children. David was the family slave. He had a time limit to which he had to finish doing the dishes, and if he didn’t meet that requirement he got tortured. He tried to not let it bother him. David went days without food and his mother did not care. His dad tried to feed him but eventually got caught by his wife and they fought. His parents always fought, and it was usually about David. He was sometimes forced to throw up and eat whatever he threw up if he ate food. His mom did this to find out if David was stealing food. She accidentally stabbed him one day. He had a big cut in his stomach that got infected, but David tried to fix it. One day, everything seemed to change. He was treated nicely. He got food from his mother, and he even got nice clothes to wear. A social worker came over to check over the house and to ask David questions. Nobody liked David at school. He was the kid with gross, raggy clothes, and the one that stole any food he could find. David was an outsider, he had no friends. His teachers were worried about him when he came to school in gross clothes and bruises. He always got checked over and everything he said was wrote down. He finally got taken away from his bad family. Characterization: At the beginning of the book, David was afraid of his mother and what she would do to him. Towards the end of the book, it became a routine for him to do certain things. He learned to not be afraid of her. He started to not show emotion towards her or the things she would do. When he grew up, he put his past behind him and made sure his kid lived his best life. David’s Dad stayed with his mother for long time. He went through a lot just to try to help David out the best he could. He eventually had enough of everything David’s mother did to him so he moved out. Setting: A Child Called “It” takes place in San Diego, California in the early 1970’s. The setting was important because it showed how easy David’s mom could get away with the things she did. If that were to happen now people would take more notice to it to try and help the child. Thematic Connection: There are a lot of themes in A Child Called “It”, but a main one is losing hope. This is evident when the main character starts to realize that he is going to have to live through beatings and punishments until he can get away when he is an adult. Recommendation: I would recommend A Child Called “It” to freshman and beyond because of the events that occurred in the book. The events were more mature and high schoolers would be able to understand them better. Both females and males would enjoy reading this book, because anyone could relate to the main character. I would give this book five out of five stars. ",0,0.846,0.1,0.792,0.108,0.4903507936507936,POSITIVE,0.591
287,2208291608,12/08/2017,4.0,"Personal ResponseI read the book  A Child Called “It”  by Dave Pelzer. This book was very sad, and I did not want to read it at times. Despite being about child abuse, this book was important. It taught that child abuse is a real thing in the world today. I thought the author did really well describing all the horrible details that happened to the main character. PlotDavid Pelzer lived with his father, mother, and brothers. The family went on many vacations together. They went camping and also went on picnics. One day, something went horribly wrong. David’s mother started to beat and slap David. She made David wear the same clothes every day for a year. David would go multiple days without getting a meal. David would steal food just so he could eat. His mother made him throw up his food to see if he stole anything. One day, David’s mother accidently stabbed him. She gave him water and new clothes. She never took him to the hospital. After a few days, the wound became infected. David tried to treat his wound himself. David’s father never stepped in to stop the abuse. He would leave or just look away whenever it happened. David’s brothers helped beat David when they were older. His mother became very nice one day. She allowed him to eat at the table with the family, play outside with his brothers, and let him sleep inside the house instead of on a cot in the garage. David thought the abuse was over. The next day, a social worker came to their house. She asked if David was ever beaten. After the social worker left, David’s beatings started again. At the end, David was taken away from his horrible family. CharacterizationDavid was the main character in the book. In the beginning, he would show fear to his mother. He would allow her to beat him. Towards the end, David tricked her at her own games. He would not let her win. He showed no fear. He also gave up on his father. At first, David’s mother was very nice to all her children. She became an alcoholic. After her addiction to alcohol, she started to abuse David. She never hurt any of her other children. The only time she was nice to David was when a social worker was there. She continued to abuse him, until he was taken away from her. SettingThis book took place in California. The time period was the late 1990s. The setting was important to the book, because the author wrote about how the family used to go on picnics and camped at popular landscapes in California. The time period was important because child abuse wasn’t as common back then. People did not expect it as much, so they didn’t watch closely for the signs. Thematic ConnectionThe main theme of this book was overcoming of fear. In the beginning of the book, David was afraid of his mother’s abuse. Overtime, he became used to it. He did not want to appear weak in front of her mother. RecommendationI would recommend this book to high schoolers and older. I think both genders would like this book because it taught an important message. I think readers would understand the fact that child abuse is real. This book also contains mature scenes and language. I would give this book four out of five stars.",0,-0.9951,0.143,0.794,0.063,0.4908413926499032,NEGATIVE,0.9998
288,2242753395,01/04/2018,4.0,"""A Child Called It"" by Dave Pelzer is truly an inspirational story. The book follows Dave's (David) young childhood in one of the most severe child abuse cases in California. As the story moves, we see David's persistence and determination to never let his abusive and alcoholic Mother completely win in her torturous and unpredictable ""games."" Even though at the time David was only in elementary school he constantly shows maturity, determination, and imagination through his unspeakable times, making him someone people could aspire to be. This book talks about some severe topics and situations. There also is a little coarse language and so although this book my not be appropriate for younger children, I completely recommend it. The story shows David’s determination, perseverance, and willpower to overcome his rough family life. In the end readers see that he does as Dave and his son go back to the vacation spot where his mom took his abuse to the next level.In his early years, David was so happy. He had happy parents and siblings. He played a lot and loved going on vacations with his strong dad and beautiful mother. One day, as his parents fought and drank more and more, the punishments began. It started with an occasional timeout and being called a bad boy, but gradually, the punishments escalated to hitting and torturous “games”. David was even held back in first grade because his mother didn’t believe he should be able to pass. Soon David was no longer considered part of the family. He did all the chores and when he wasn’t doing that, he was told to wait on the stairs to the garage and not move. He wasn’t allowed to play, talk, or even look at his siblings, and wasn’t allowed to eat with the family. He was also timed when doing chores and if he didn’t finish in time, he was punished and deprived of food. David constantly looked up to his father and felt that his father was his protector. His mother never hurt David in front of him, and his father always tried to help. This resulted in them fighting even more and eventually, his dad left. His mother blamed him for this and the punishments got worse. Some of her games included him sitting on the stove and getting burned, getting his little brothers dirty diapers thrown at him and having to eat it, and always being deprived of food.At school David would be made fun of for his looks and smells, but he really didn’t care. He was constantly in trouble for stealing kids food and always tried to find new ways to get food. This resulted in more punishments and more abuse from his mother. Some times the abuse was so bad he would cough blood. He was even stabbed once. Through this all David never broke. He never let his mom win in her games. He always kept going.After years of this, David showing up to school with bruises, cuts, bumps etc. him lying to the nurse about where they came from and always going through the same routines, the excuses didn’t work. When the nurse brought it up, David was called down to the teachers lounge. In there the nurse, principal, teachers, and a police man questioned him about where he got them. David reluctantly told the truth and was taken away. He was put into foster care and never dealt with that abuse again. This book was not an easy read, and dealt with very real and serious topics. I would still recommend it because it teaches you that no matter what happened in your past, you can choose to give up or keep fighting like David did. I gave this book four out of five stars because even though it was so good, some parts were pretty brutal/harsh and hard to read. I wouldn’t change anything about this book. I loved how it tied things together at the end with the story of how David overcame his past and went back to the vacation spot, where his mother beat and tortured him, with his son. I have not read the other books in the series, but if it is this I’m powering and inspirational, I can’t wait to read them.",0,-0.9907,0.15,0.741,0.109,0.4981339254615117,POSITIVE,0.8373
289,2623264647,12/21/2018,5.0,"PERSONAL RESPONSE:I liked the book,  A Child Called It by Dave Pelzer because there was a lot of action. I did not like this book because of how David’s mom abused him. She was a terrible mother and did not like David but she treated her other three children a nice way. I, honestly, think this book was not a good book because it was very sad. PLOT:	Dave Pelzer was a fifth-grade student. He lived with his parents and his two siblings. David’s mother hit all the time and made him do all the chores at the house. He always had bruises all over his body. He also wore the same clothes to school every day and his classmates made fun of him. Dave started stealing food from his classmates because his mother did not feed him. His classmates and his mother called him the bad boy. The school was like heaven for David because it was the only place he would not be with his mother. His mother fell into mental illness and alcoholism. All of her anger turned upon Dave. One day his mother, accidentally, stabbed him. He was really injured, but she did not take him to the hospital. His mother locked him in the bathroom with a chemical so he could not breathe very well. Dave was not allowed to sleep in his own bedroom like the others. He had to sleep in the garage because he was not welcomed like his brothers. His father spent less time at home, and, Dave’s mother started to be more abusive. His brothers and his dad just sat there and did not try to stop his mother from abusing him. Instead of him defending Dave and his other children, he abandoned his family. Finally, a teacher talked to him. He confessed to her that his mother hit him and made him sleep in the garage. She also starved him to death. The teacher then called the police who talked to Dave. He was taken away from his mother because she was not a good parent. He went to foster care where he lived a better life away from his mother. CHARACTERIZATION:	Dave Pelzer was the main character of the novel. He was abused by his mother around the age of four until he was twelve. He was a very smart kid, but his mother treated him like he did not mean anything to her. Dave’s mother was abusive. She suffered from mental illness and was an alcoholic. She starved her own child and made him do all the chores at his house. Dave’s father protected Dave from his mother in the beginning of the book. He became an alcoholic and allowed his wife to abuse Dave. He, /eventually, decided he was going to leave his family because he could not tolerate his wife anymore. SETTING:	The story took place in Dale City, California during the 1970s. In the 1970s they did not have the same laws as today. It has changed a lot in the past years. Most of the story took place in Dave’s house and his school. The setting was important to the plot because his house was where his mom abused him and school was the only place he felt safe.THEME:	The theme was survival because Dave had to survive from his abusive mother. He also survived the bullying from his school because he wore the same clothes every day. Another theme was dehumanization because Dave’s mother did not treat him as a human. She treated him like an animal, or even worse. She did not even use his name. She called him It.RECOMMENDATION:	I think a good audience for A Child Called It would be high school boys or girls. It was not a challenging book. I think high school girls and boys would be able to understand the book. I think teenage girls and boys would like this book because it was a true story about a little boy being abused by his mother. I do not think anyone younger should read this book because of the violence. ",0,-0.9989,0.198,0.741,0.061,0.5167322643343052,NEGATIVE,0.998
290,2207120815,12/07/2017,4.0,"#3 The absolutely heartbreaking book, A Child Called “It” by the abused child himself, Dave Pelzer is a heart-wrenching story of a child with an extremely abusive mother that does unthinkable things to her child. His mother likes to do tremendously sickening things that leave him nearly dead. From starving him for 10 days, to brutally beating him, all the way to torturing him in a room of gas. He wasn’t even considered part of their family anymore, he couldn’t eat with the family, he had to sleep in the garage, he couldn’t even talk or even look at any of the members of his family. His mother wouldn’t call him by his name. His mother called him “The Boy” which soon progressed to only being called “It”. He was treated like a slave. He either had to earn his food or steal leftover scraps from the family’s meals. Living life was pure torture but all the boy wanted was for his mother to love him. When his only safe place, his dad, left the family, his mom treated him even worse than before to the point where the little child didn’t even want to be alive, he just wanted her to kill him and it be over with. This book was the saddest book I’ve ever read, for a mother to treat one of her children like that just makes me sick. The worst part is, she does it for absolutely no reason. I cried many times while reading this because I felt absolutely terrible for this child, not only was he young when it all started, but he had to watch his brothers be treated like kings. He had done nothing to make his mother hate him. I was hurting for the boy, living life like that would be beyond terrible. What’s really sad is he gets treated worse than the most terrible criminals there are, at least they can eat 3 meals a day. I’ve never starved for 10 days and I complain when I haven’t eaten all day, it makes you realize how lucky you are that you get food. Reading this book made me extremely grateful that I have such good parents who feed me, give me clothes, and never have beat me. For such a young kid to want to be dead is terrible. Kids shouldn’t want to die, especially because of their own mother, the one who’s supposed to love you and protect you the most. After his dad leaves, promising he would get them both out of the situation of mother, it was extremely heartbreaking. To lose the one person you loved the most would be so hard. His dad left Dave to live with his terribly abusive mother after promising he would save him from her. I don’t think I could live life without the one person that kept me safe. I didn’t like all the detail of the disgusting stuff his mother did to him but it really helped me realise just how bad he was treated. I think we could change people’s lives just by treating everyone better. David's life would have been a little better just by having someone that will be kind and love him. If people wouldn’t have judged him and been rude to him based on his appearance and actions, maybe he wouldn’t be as lonely and hurt. You never know what’s going on in someone else's life so we shouldn’t be rude to them. They might be going threw something really hard and you could be making it worse for them. If we were nicer to everyone we could change so much in this world.",0,-0.9965,0.21,0.656,0.133,0.6672799422799424,NEGATIVE,0.9981
291,2683575242,01/21/2019,5.0,"Personal Response: A Child Called It was definitely one of the saddest books I have ever read. This story was interesting and I could not put it down. Even though some of the events made me want to cry, it really made me open my eyes and realize this has happened to children. I loved the book.Plot Summary:At the beginning of the story, Dave Pelzer, a 12-year-old boy, is getting an exam. Dave lies to the nurse about the bruises covering his body, but she knows his mother beats him. Then, the book switches to Dave’s early childhood. His mother is kind and is happy. Dave’s father works most of the time and his mother would take him and his brothers on day trips, teaching them any lesson she could. Eventually, his mother starts to punish him more and more. Dave’s mother never hits him in front of his father. His father just tells him to be a good boy. School is Dave’s safe place. Unfortunately, the abuse does not get better. She starves Dave, burns him, and she even shoves a bar of soap down his throat. Dave steals food from anyone he can. His mom later finds out and makes him throw up the food when he gets home. A few nights go by and his mother threatens him with a knife. She actually stabs him and attempts to help him for her sake. When Dave’s father comes home, he told him about the accident. Sadly, he does nothing about it. One day his mother starts treating Dave better. He is happy, but he gets his hopes up. The only reason she is being nice is that a social worker is coming to visit their family. The abuse continues and his parents separate. It gets so bad that Dave wishes he was dead. At the end of the story, it flashes to the future where he is with his own son looking back at everything he has overcome. Characterization:Dave goes through many emotions and evolves throughout the story. At the beginning of the story, Dave is happy and enjoying his life.

In the story, it never reveals why she acts the way she does. His mother is someone Dave never wants to be. Setting: The story took place in Daly City, California in the 1970s. A Child Called It was about the author’s life. The characters were usually at school or in their home. The setting was important to the story because in the 1970s social workers were not aware that child abuse was happening, or it does not happen very often. The setting was described where all the abuse happened and how he barely managed to get through it.Theme: Survival is one of the main themes throughout the book. Dave has to focus on how to survive his mother’s abuse and starvation. Dave has to steal from people just so he can feed himself. He also learns how to take care of his own wounds from his mother. Everything Dave does is to survive.",0,-0.9894,0.157,0.73,0.113,0.5309829059829061,POSITIVE,0.9659
292,2217887018,12/18/2017,4.0,"“A Child Called “It”” , by David Pelzer is a story about a young boy who throughout his childhood was severely abused by his mother. The young boy and main character of this tragic and true story is David Pelzer himself this book is an autobiography written by David Pelzer about the life threatening challenges he was faced with at a very young age. David once had a very normal and perhaps happy life, he had a family with his two brothers, mother, and father, he lived in a nice house and was loved. But as the story develops readers come to the tragic realization that life for David will not remain that way. The change between the love and hatred that David was given developed slowly that its hard to spot exact places where David did anything to deserve what his future held. He still lived in the same house but that seemed to be the only thing that remained from his former life, David now lived with a father who watched him get nearly killed, made promises he couldn’t keep, drank much more often, was rarely home, and who listened to the sick and twisted ways of his wife blaming things on David just like the rest of the family. His two brothers now saw him through the eyes their mother had forced them to treating him like trash and never showing him any sympathy, and worst of all his once loving, fun, and nurturing mother was now a monster and someone he would never love again she caused him pain to the point were he almost died many times and when he wasn’t near death he wished he was just to escape her. She beat him and starved him out of pleasure and frequently called him a bad boy punishing him for things such as responding the wrong way or not cleaning fast enough. She hated her own son and often expressed that through her actions and words and caused all his other family members to also hate him leaving him alone and helpless in a hell hole that had once been his home. Her sick and horrifying games took everything away from David causing him to see things as food and simple interactions as luxuries. The only reason he survived was because he grew used to the ways of his mother behaviors and how that would effect the level of abuse he would endure that day, he had reactions he knew would please her, and limited but some defense. But mainly he had the hope of potentially escaping, this hope was found in his dreams where his father would come to safe him and take him away from his mother forever or he would find a new family who truly did love him. Although as the story continued this hope slowly yet noticeably disappeared and it seems along side this his chances of survival do also. Yet readers wonder does his hope, faith, and determination have the power to safe his life?I don’t know who to recommend this book to on the basis of enjoyment as it is a book about child abuse so it focuses on some hard topics that are tragic in our world today. But I do recommend this book because of the fact that it is well written and the hard topics it focuses on are something we should all acknowledge and correct. Anyone looking for an autobiography and would like to read a first hand view of what a person being abused feels like and has to go through and their struggle to survive can find that within this book. Although it is sad and horrible to think someone could do these things to another person this book is good and I feel I benefited from reading it. One writing technique the author used that I liked was how he began the first chapter with the events that would occur in the end and then gave the backstory throughout the majority of the book, I liked this because it allowed readers to build our own characters and views about them before actually being told who they were. It also showed that no matter how bad it got for our main character eventually he would survive. Another writing technique was the amount of detail used to describe the emotions and thoughts of the main character, since the author had experienced his story first hand he was able to go past making a character to writing every fear and thought the main character had since it was him as a small boy who I doubt could forget the details of such a traumatic experience. Being told these all of things allowed us to really get to know the main character and build a connection with him throughout the book, readers will fight for him all the way through the end. Although most people haven’t had to endure what David has readers get a glimpse into how terrifying it really is. I gave this book a 4/5 because although it was well written and overall a good book, I do not believe it was perfect and the constant seriousness of the danger David’s life was in can cause some people to think perhaps parts could’ve been made up to improve the story. Although I don’t believe that it makes you wonder could a human being be capable of this much torture to her own son?",0,-0.9804,0.163,0.69,0.147,0.5598370543314365,NEGATIVE,0.9935

ZieglerAthena KonstanPeter HansenJoyce WoodworthJanice WoodsBetty Howelland the school nurseTo all of you, for your courage and for putting your careers on the line that fateful day, 5th march 1973 you saved my life.This book has 184 pages and 16 chapters in it.Synopsis: As a child dave pelzer was brutally beaten and starved by his emotionally unstable, alcoholic mother, a mother who played tortuous, unpredictable games that left one of her sons nearly dead. She no longer considered him a son, but a slave: no longer a boy, but an it. His bed was an old army cot in the basement, his clothes were torn and smelly, and when he was allowed the luxury of food it was scraps from the dog's bowl. The outside world knew nothing of the nightmare played out behind closed doors. Dave dreamed of finding a family to love him and call him their son. It took years of struggle, deprivation and despair to find his dream and make something of himself in the world. A child call 'it' covers the early years of his life and is an affecting and inspirational memoir of one child's determination to survive. This book is about one boy fight for life through child abuse at the hands of his mother who made him clean the full house and use to beat him and not give him food and she use to make him late for school and has to tell the school where the bruises come from and he says he fall but then he tells them what really happened and the social worker and police rescue him and her goes in to foster care where he finds love and he given food every day and does not get beaten.Review: I found this book really easy to get in to and hard to put down once l started reading it and l found this book upsetting that any mother could do that to their own child. I wonder why she only did it to dave and not his brothers. His father did not beat dave just his mother did. Dave's father ended up leaving his mother and I wonder how he survived all the things that happened to him it is a miracle that he did. I think his brothers was scared of their mother after seeing what she did to dave. I can not put in to words how upsetting this book is and it is a good read and l was glad to read dave lived to tell his story and l wish l could rate this book more then five stars because it is worth more then five stars. I think dave was really brave speaking out about the abuse and writing his story in a book for people to read is also raising awareness for child abuse.About The Author: An author best known for his 1995 memoir of childhood abuse, A child called it.

294,2728810656,03/03/2019,5.0,"A Child Called ""It,"" but David Pelzer is not an easy book to read. The book chronicles several years of the early life of David Pelzer. In his first four years of life, his world is almost idyllic. David’s mother is a stay at home mom who loves her children. David father is a fireman and loves his kids. David’s loves playing with his older brothers. However, at the age of four David’s mother had a dramatic and bizarre change in personality and specifically in how she viewed and treated David. The book never explains our attempts to analyze the mother’s mental condition, but her behavior becomes sadistic toward her youngest son for the next eight years of his life. David’s mother had a serious drinking problem, but even in the light of this problem how she treated David as compared to all her other children is bizarre. David’s mother continued to show a level of respect toward her husband and other children – or at least relative to how she treated David.David’s father was too weak to stand up to his wife. In the early years he tried to support David or argue his case, but eventually, he put up the flag of surrender. Over time his mother's mistreatment of David takes a toll on David’s family. Eventually, the marriage breaks up, and David is left with no hope of a protector as his father moves out.To say the mother treated the family dog better does not capture depravation of her behavior toward David. The range of torture applied to David seemed only to be limited by her imagination. The acts included burning him on the stove, stabbing him, poisoning his with Clorox and ammonia, and much more. Through all this abuse David was relegated to be the family serf – he did not eat with the family, he was forced to sleep in the cold garage, and often was not fed for days at a time. David was expected to work for his mother daily. His assigned tasks often had time limits with the punishment of no food if he did not complete the work in the set time. David is saved by one of his teachers when he is twelve and is removed from the family. This book is the first in a series of 3 by Pelzer – so I will have to read the next book to learn how he makes out in the next stage of his life. However, the book's epilogue makes it is clear that David was able to survive his extreme abuse, join the U.S. Airforce and have a family of his own. Many other “Davids” do not survive the abuse and if they do, they are not able to enjoy the success David obtains in his life. Though this book is very difficult to read of, I am glad I did. Understanding that children today are in similar situations to what David endured is an education we all need.",0,-0.983,0.137,0.774,0.089,0.4528679653679654,NEGATIVE,0.9981
295,2739669760,10/10/2019,4.0,"I have put off reading this book for years. I just knew that it would be a book that just completely guts you and leaves you heartbroken. I wasn't wrong.This is a story about David, a little boy who endured the worst kind of abuse throughout his childhood at the hands of his mother. She starved him, beat him, burned him, made him drink chemicals, tried to make him eat literal shit...this bitch was majorly fucked up. He was 1 of 5 children and while his other brothers were treated like kings, he was, in the words of this book, treated as the family slave. This was a very short book that I read within just a couple of hours. To say that I enjoyed it would be a lie, but it did open my eyes to how bad abuse can be. I do wish that he would have included more of the story. It left me with a few unanswered questions. I want to know why his mother turned on him so quickly and violently. I believe that she may have some sort of mental disability that worsened with her alcoholism. In the beginning, she seemed like the best mother that any child could want, why did she single him out and hate him so much? Since I very much intend on reading the next book, hopefully my questions will be answered.After doing a bit of research on the author, I realized that this book has gotten a lot of hate. I see that some people believe that he lied about his childhood, or exaggerated the truth. Well, I refuse to be a part of that. In a certain part of this story, his mother called him an It. (Hence the name of the book.) She didn't even see her son as a human being, just a worthless thing. So, forgive me but I 
WILL NOT
 take his story away from him. If I did, I would be a part of the problem. Even if he did fabricate some of the story, at least it brought child abuse into a new light. So many people live their day to day lives not knowing how fucking horrible someone else's life has been. Or, they think that child abuse is just a child being beaten, when in reality it can get so much worse.I recommend this book not because it's good, it's a truly heartbreaking story. But, I recommend this book because I feel that everyone should know what can happen behind closed doors and some of the signs to look for with an abused child.

296,2827785863,05/20/2019,3.0,"I would first like to start by saying that I commend David for being able to speak on his story and the things that he went through growing up as little boy. No child ever deserves such a thing. I’ve come across some brutal comments regarding whether or not his story is true or even fabricated to make the story line seem more real then it truly is. Personally I don’t feel as though that anyone who isn't the author himself has a right to comment whether this is his truth or not because that is something we may never know. Granted, there were some really harsh, disturbing, gruesome parts of the story and it can come across as if it were exaggerated but child abuse is something serious and everyone has a different story. Dave Pelzer spoke his truth and with that he was able to connect with his readers, shed some light on something that some might overlook because they have no idea about. A child that endures abuse feels as though they are going through it alone with no one to help them out and that is a terrifying. Pelzer helped to shed some light on those who are blinded to what is going on but also taught his readers that have experienced something similar to never lose that courage and fight that you have within yourself because good things will come.  Although there were positive things that came with the book and I can understand why Pelzer wanted to write the book in the perspective of a little boy going through child abuse, it caused it to feel like some of the story was still left out. While reading some of the others reviews I noticed some others felt the same way. At the end of the book I still had so many unanswered questions and some things just didn’t make sense to me. Some parts of the book I may say were a little graphic and vivid and maybe a little bit too extreme for most people to handle. All in all it was a good book and I would rate it three out of five stars because the idea of the book itself was inspiring as they wanted the book to be. It sent across a message that allowed people to realize that there are people in this world who have experienced far from what we have and how we choose to move forward in life is up to us. You can choose to let it defeat you or you can choose to prevail, how the story ends is up to you. ",0,-0.9462,0.112,0.807,0.082,0.6176542207792206,NEGATIVE,0.5901
297,3072772889,12/04/2019,5.0,"Personal Response:  The Child Called Itwas a very heartbreaking story. The book makes me think about all children in the world that are suffering through abuse and to scared to tell anyone. It's sad to think that a mother could treat one of their kids so bad that her child feels that he/she is worthless and does not belong in this world. The question for this character in this book is, why wouldn't he just run away and never come home? This book for me is an eye opener, because people need to seek out their friends or family who are acting weird or different from usual. People need to look out for those families that treat their children poorly and if they see something that society doesn't approve of happening, say something. Plot:The Child Called It, is the story of David Pelzer, who was brutally beaten and starved by his emotionally unstable, alcoholic mother. His mother played torturous, unpredictable games, games that left him nearly dead.In the beginning of the book, the boy is telling the reader that his mother wasn’t always abusive and drunk The father used to be home more and spend time with the boys, and Davids brother played with him and treated him like a brother. That only lasts for a few years since the father starts going to work more and never is home. The mother gives up on trying to be nice and gives up on trying to look nice. David would go to school and teachers would notice his marks from his mother and they would feel sorry for him.The only time David feels happy is when his father is home. His mother wouldn’t beat David when he is home. Father started coming home less and the mother’s beating got worse. The mother burns David on the stove. She mixes chemicals together and makes it so he can't breathe. She tries to drown him in ice cold water. She also throws knives at him when she is very angry. The father always promises David that he would move away with him but he didn't. David wishes he was just dead. This story is about one of the most severe child abuse cases in California history.  Characterization:David is the main character. He is a young boy trying the best to survive the abuse of his mother. David is smart child but the problems he faces at home are distracting him from doing good in school. David is also very strong mentally but very weak physically. He is strong mentally because he always finds his way around things. He is weak physically because of all the beatings. David is a very forgiving person, he forgives his mom every time she’s nice to him for couples for some reasons.David's family are the other characters of this book. His mother is a heavy alcoholic and likes to take her anger out on david. She knows how to put up an act too. She can act completely different when there are other people around. David’s brothers completely ignore him or they try to embrasses him more than he already is. His father used to be his hero and save him from his mother. After a while, he gives up on protecting David. Setting:	Most of the main events that happens in this book are at his home in Dale City, California in the 1970s. The home is very important because it is where all the action takes place. The home is where David is being killed by his own mother. Some of the book is at the school where David goes and feels happy because he is away from his mother. Recommendation:I would recommend this book to people who like real life stories. People above the ages of 12 because of the torture and the language used. It focuses on an abused child’s ability to endure physical and emotional abuse. I would also recommend this too who love drama.",0,-0.9326,0.139,0.742,0.119,0.5619811656005685,NEGATIVE,0.7378
