0,2297912402,02/17/2018,4.0,"PsychoanalysisThe Interpretation of Murder is an intelligent and considered crime thriller, probably trying to create the first instance of 'serial killer profiling' before the science was developed. The murder of a young woman is followed by a similar attempt using the same modus operandi, however, this lady (Miss Acton) survives but it leaves her with amnesia. Detective Littlemore needs to find out what she knows before the killer strikes again or comes back to finish the job. Littlemore works with her doctor, Dr Younger, to assist in the case. Dr Younger is acquainted with Sigmund Freud and quite fortuitously involves him to help in the case. This creates an interesting and intriguing perspective and introduces a new dynamic to the typical murder mystery. I felt quite drawn to the idea that Freud could have assisted in a murder investigation. I can’t attest to the accuracy of the science of psychoanalysis but from a plot perspective, I felt it was weaved in quite well and wasn't heavily applied. I quite like the notion that Freud when visiting New York in 1909, assisted a murder investigation using his newly famed techniques.There is also a great attempt to recreate the atmosphere and landscape of New York City at the turn of the last century and perhaps this was overemphasised, almost to the point that the author had invested a lot of time researching that period, and wasn’t going to be short-changed.The narrative has a more sedate pace than most murder mysteries but I think that’s the pace of a deep-thinking and analysing Freud. Freud's contribution provides some benefit in solving the crime and finding the killer.This wasn’t the best murder mystery but still provided an entertaining read. I would recommend the book.",46,-0.9322,0.162,0.696,0.142,0.3903939393939393,POSITIVE,0.9997

I could so visualize that. This is my new ""You gotta read this book"" recommendation. The Freud, Jung and Shakespeare inclusions was an added bonus.

Don't get me wrong, I love potatoes, but give me the steak! Interpretation of Murder is a side dish and not a potato side dish, more like peas or carrots or something.Reading the author's notes at the end of the book gave me a better appreciation of the novel. I respect that it was well-researched, but to borrow from the same analogy, I like a little history with my story, not the other way around. This book was sort of textbookish, though not quite as much as the ""Devil in the White City"", which was also not as good as I'd hoped.The author (or publisher or someone) goes out of his or her way to compare this book to ""The Alienist"". It compares, but palely. I didn't really care that much about the characters. Most of the characters were based on real historical people, but the character I liked the most was the detective, who was completely fictional.I'm torn on rating this one. It's either a two or a three star. It's interesting, but not too. It's well-researched and I like that, but I don't like it enough to make that criterion carry enough weight to help it sail to the top of my rating scale. It was an obvious copy of a great book. If it would have been a great copy then I would have given it a higher rating. I guess I'll have to go with a two star. It might have got a three and probably earned it except that I expected more out of this book.

3,16778920,03/01/2008,2.0,"Sigmund Freud, along with his protege Carl Jung, arrives in New York for a series of lectures at Clark University in Massachusetts. A young woman is murdered, apparently by a serial killer. Another young woman, Nora Acton, is suffering from amnesia after another attack by the same criminal. Dr. Stratham Younger, a high society Freud acolyte, undertakes a psychoanalysis of Nora, in the hopes of unraveling the mystery. I wanted to like The Interpretation of Murder. I really did. It had an intriguing premise: a murder mystery, set in 1909 New York City, with Freud, Jung, and Ferenczi as characters. (I realize this description is probably more or less congruent with some people's vision of Hell, but it's right up my alley.) But if there's anything worse than a mystery that isn't especially clever, it's a mystery that thinks it's clever when it isn't, and this mystery is nowhere near as clever as author Jed Rubenfeld thinks it is.Rubenfeld has ambition, but unfortunately, doesn't have the writing chops to keep up with it. The reader forges ahead, puzzled, as Rubenfeld throws out approximately one zillion plot lines, none of which seems to have much to do with the other. Freud, Jung, and Ferenczi arrive and talk a lot about various psychoanalytic theories and analysands. Younger psychoanalyzes Nora (Hey! Doesn't Nora rhyme with ""Dora""? My word, I think it does! What a coincidence) and talks a lot about his family life and his fascination with Hamlet, in more or less equal measure. We learn a lot about the history of turn of the century New York and the dynasties that ran it. Then a sinister series of anonymous letters threatens to ruin Freud's reputation. Harry Thaw, confined in an insane asylum in New Jersey after murdering architect Stanford White, receives mysterious visitors wearing signet rings. And so forth.Unfortunately, Rubenfeld isn't a skillful enough novelist to craft these plot lines into something coherent, so the reader is given, well, a series of plot lines that eventually lurch to an end. (In fact, I'm still at a bit of a loss as to what Freud and Jung were doing there at all.) Add to this sorry mess a host of clunky dialog, points of view that shift clumsily (sometimes in the span of two paragraphs), and a lot of pedestrian writing, and you're left with nothing more than a run-of-the-mill mystery doing its best to masquerade as something far more sophisticated than it actually is. I gave this novel two stars instead of one simply because the book's premise was enough to keep me turning the pages until the end (and also because Rubenfeld is obviously no fan of Jung, which makes him okay in my book).

We have New York of 1909 - an exquisite setting with blue flame lights, caissons, Madams and balls. We have the who's who of Psychology debating the innermost working theories on Psychoanalysis - Freud and Jung being the forerunners. We have a murder mystery and an attempted murder - grounded in psychoanalysis and detective work keeps changing colors. On top of this we are trying to understand Hamlet's To be or not to be. Most of these are real events across time built into the narrative. The author trundles on admirably making sure the book is intellectually stimulating for almost 75% of the book. Frued's Oedeipal complex as the foundation of psychoanalysis was something I knew, but in application, it was a different interpretation. At around 80% I started feeling the book itself was a ink-blot test with changing forms but then it crash landed with a rather undoing explanation which was clever, but not logical. When I read the author's notes on the historical liberties taken - I felt admiration for the author's efforts. There are too many real people/incidents in this work of fiction and bending of timelines was a necessary piece of genius.

5,2695662947,12/16/2019,4.0,"More reviews on https://mohammedsreview.wordpress.comThe story is set on 1909 Manhattan, New York when Sigmund Freud and his companions was visiting USA to attend a conference at the Clark University. When a dèbutante is found dead on her own penthouse and the very next day another young beautiful heiress Nora Acton is found strangled to a chandelier and viciously wounded and top of this she can't talk and enable to recall the recent events that happened to her. Dr. Stratham Younger who will now perform the psychoanalysis on miss Nora acton to find the puzzles that will make a full picture and help to identify the criminal.Most of characters are from real world and most of the story is based on real facts. The story is mostly narrated from a first persons(Dr. Younger) point of view. Loved the way how the author have managed to link the neurological theories to solve a murder case from two perspectives. One from Dr. Statham Younger influenced by Sigmund Freud himself, and another from the detective Jimmy Littlemore's perspective.Sigmund Freud undoubtedly one of the most influential man from the last century, and probably and controversial theory he had give is about Oedipal Complex in his famous book that published back in 1899 The Interpretation of dreams. Oedipal complex is the core of this story. Sigmund Freud along with Carl Jung , Sándor Ferenczi and Abraham Brill did travel to attend a conference at the Clark University which ""The Triumvirate"" (Consists of Charles Dana, Bernard Sachs and M. Allen Starr ) did try to prevent Sigmund Freud to attend the conference cause they had oppose  idea about Oedipal Complex, though they failed in the process. Nora Acton who is one of the main characters of this novel is based on Sigmund Freud's Case book of Dora. Also George B. McClellan who served as New York city mayor at that time had a important role in this plot. There are other historical characters who had a significant role on the overall settings. It's evident that a lot had happened at 1909 at the New York city and everything and every signal people who were part of these event had some sort of their share on this whole plot. It's amazing how the author have managed to use all those historical characters and real events that happened to stage a fictional murder case. Incredibly complex plot, use of the real characters,use the neurological terms,liked the detailing of the story,sometimes it may seem to make the story becoming sluggish but the this book demands those detailing's. it's simply worth reading.Rating : 3.9/5",11,0.3426,0.043,0.899,0.058,0.4265312701482914,POSITIVE,0.9921
6,582164658,04/05/2013,1.0,"Such a disappointment. I really thought I'd like this because initially it looked like it might be a blend of history, psychology, literature, & criminal investigation. Those things did provide some satisfaction, but at times it read as if the author had simply copy/pasted his college papers on Freud or Hamlet into the text, resulting in a dry, disjointed lack of continuity.Mostly what ruined this story was the unnecessarily detailed descriptions of the sadistic sexual assaults, described in prolonged lip-smacking detail. Yuk. Also repellent is the therapist's subsequent eroticization of his patient, the very young female victim who'd been assaulted & traumatized. In addition to portraying the disturbing lack of ethics on the part of the therapist (our hero?) as if this is no problem, clearly the author has no clue about the state of a survivor after a traumatic attack. Directly after a sadistic sexual assault, suddenly the victim is hot for her rescuer? Absurd.This novel started with a great idea for an intricate historical/psychological mystery but was ruined by drying it out, dumbing it down, & injecting gratuitous torture porn.",9,-0.995,0.312,0.592,0.096,0.4860846560846562,NEGATIVE,1.0

The girl’s consciousness was fading. She tried to speak. There was a question she had to ask. It was there; it was gone. Then she had it again. ‘My name,’ she whispered. ‘What is my name?’""... So, is Nora still a victim when she is empowered by a sympathetic listener?""Feel like there's class conflict in the book: psychoanalysis versus interrogation, Jung versus Freud; Acton versus Banwell; Chong versus Leon; Malley and Betty, etc. Or interest and smart bout how has the author's mix of fact and fiction, remembering me with previous New York novels, such as The Alienist, Ragtime, Dreamland: A Novel, Paradise Alley, etc.So, let's open the door...Jed Rubenfeld takes his place in literary entertainment with grand eloquence in his first novel, The Interpretation of Murder, published by Henry Holt. This dandy psychological murder mystery is chockfull of history, biography, and geography. This would overwhelm a lesser writer, but Rubenfeld’s mastery of the subject matter, pacing, and sheer storytelling verve propels the reader into New York 1909, and puts the reader into the chase for a vicious, sadistic killer.The novel begins as Dr. Sigmund Freud arrives in New York to deliver a series of lectures on the – at that point – very controversial subject. Dr. Stratham Younger, an American psychoanalyst, is appointed by the university to act as liaison officer for Dr. Freud. Several key members of Freud’s group of therapists are with him, including Carl Jung, the father of psychoanalysis’s most ambitious student, who ultimately tries to overtake his mentor’s glory.Soon after Dr. Freud’s arrival, Dr. Younger is summoned to a case involving an attack on 17-year-old Nora Acton, daughter to two influential people in the city’s high society circles. The victim of a sadist, Nora was choked, whipped, and cut with a knife. The experience has left her with amnesia and bereft of voice. Dr. Freud offers the opinion that her case would be an excellent choice for Dr. Younger.As he pursues therapy with the young woman, Dr. Younger finds himself entranced with Nora’s beauty and vulnerability. However, Nora’s returning memory proves false when she accuses the mayor’s friend, George Banwell with attacking her. Banwell is a married man and a rejected suitor of Nora’s who – she says – won’t take no for an answer. However, the night Nora was attacked, Banwell has the perfect alibi: he was with the mayor.The mystery continues getting richer and deeper as Littlemore proceeds on a parallel course that turns up other clues. As it turns out, Nora wasn’t the only woman attacked, tied up, strangled, and whipped in such a manner. At least one other woman was, and she’s now dead. However, her body has gone missing from the morgue. Littlemore doesn’t know if the corpse was sold to the medical schools or if its disappearance is part of a cover-up.Rubenfeld sets each scene with deft assurance. While reading the novel, I easily could imagine the city. I stood on the docks and awaited Dr. Freud’s ship, and could even smell the man’s harsh cigar smoke. As the story progressed from the luxury hotels and high society events to the narrow, twisting alleys, and to houses of prostitution and police holding cells, those scenes filled without thousands of extras came alive.In the afterword, Rubenfeld acknowledges using the New York City geography as he needed to, but very few changes took place. The book is elegantly resourced and researched according to the time, place, and social mores. Rubenfeld’s depiction of Freud is based on a familiarity with the man through a thesis he wrote while at Princeton. Later, at Julliard, Rubenfeld studied Shakespeare, and Hamlet – which maintains a presence throughout the novel as well – becomes a topic that will interest many readers even if they’re not well-versed in the subject.Taking his marks from the current successful thriller-writers, Rubenfeld gracefully intertwines Dr. Stratham Younger’s first-person narrative with third-person viewpoints of other characters (including the marvelous Detective Littlemore). The book would have been interesting through the eyes of Dr. Younger alone, but by building in the larger cast of characters, each with their own parts to play, the story takes on added dimensions that really incite the reader to turn pages.An investment of time is required through the first quarter of the book. Rubenfeld sets a number of things into motion and takes time to make his New York expansive and deep, the characters rich and vibrant .(Detective Littlemore creeps in from nowhere, it seems, and very nearly succeeds in taking over the book at one point.) But after that initial investment, you need to block out the time to finish the novel because you’re in for a late night. Rubenfeld exercises a siren call, working dexterously with a small cast of suspects, pulling blind after double-blind, with enough twists and turns to satisfy a James Patterson or Jeffrey Deaver fan.The Interpretation of Murder is truly a magnificent book - sprawling, epic, and jaw-dropping all at the same time. Anyone who can put it down 150 pages from the end has more willpower than I. After Littlemore figured out how Seamus Malley met his death, the plot simply explodes into action, and I had to struggle to keep up with all the twists and turns, which ultimately made perfect sense.The mystery is satisfying, but so is the commentary on society at the time, the resistance of scientific thinking to psychoanalysis, and even the relationship between Freud and Jung. I can only hope Rubenfeld gets more opportunities to return to this exciting world and bring his readers more adventures of Dr. Younger and Lieutenant Littlemore.",8,0.9954,0.095,0.76,0.145,0.4597707466825113,POSITIVE,0.5134

I didn't think the author did enough to connect Freud and his ideas to the actual mystery though, it was all a big vague. Although I read the whole novel, it was a struggle and I didn't really care who was apparently murdering young women by the end. That said, it is well written and the scenes and characters are well developed. I guess I just didn't connect with the story itself.There is a fair bit of sexual content in this book including references to incest and thoughts of incest.

I was juggling three books at the same time and could only get to this by late Friday and even then could finish it by a Sunday evening. Contrary to my own prejudice, even after having real life intellectual giants like Jung & Freud as part of the star cast, the mystery at the center of the plot was pretty straight and bland. One reason could be that even after branding this as a mystery starring Freud, the psychoanalyst and his even more famous protege continue to be more of an awe inspiring drapery hung in the background than being actively involved in the goings on. I guess there was only so much artistic freedom that the author wanted to use in his plot. I am not much familiar with either Jung or Freud ( their literature or their personalities) but here in this plot Jung is more of a petulant and sulking child almost all the time. He behaves like a patient with perennial constipation for someone with an extremely perceptive mind. I do not know how much of that is true !

Littleton, the story of Clara, of Nora, of Younger, of the mayor and the coroner... the actual meat of the mystery was a very good, strong mystery.

25,41730787,01/03/2009,4.0,"This novel is about a murder mystery of Elizabeth Riverford, a young socialite in the impressive Balmoral Hotel, Manhattan and the reputedly accurate recounting of a visit made by Dr Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung to New York in 1909 to speak at American Universities in an age when psychoanalysis is in it's infancy.Although not directly involved in the murder, Dr Freud offers advice to the budding psychoanalyst, Dr Stratham Younger, as to how to treat one of the murderer's surviving victims. The young lady, Nora Acton, has lost her voice and cannot remember the details of her attack, but her injuries are remarkably similar to the murder. Dr Younger finds himself becoming increasingly attracted to the lovely Nora, whose inner thoughts are darker than even Younger can sometimes cope with and involve sexual perversions, convoluted twists and turns and even lies. The detective investigating the murder takes a leading role in the narrative too, which makes this story multi-dimensional and deals with both ends of society, including the union problems of sweatshop workers. Mr Rubenfeld's account of what New York looked, smelled and felt like during the turn the the century when skyscrapers started to rise out of the busy streets was absolutely fascinating. Added to that the fact Dr Younger was also a nephew of Mamie Styvesant Fish and is invited to one of her socialite parties, gives us yet another dimension to this story which I found particularly compelling.Added to the mix of characters are the wealthy industrialist who thinks he is completely beyond the law, together with the Mayor who is in his pocket, a well meaning but inadequate coroner and various city workers who are out for themselves and for whom the truth is a distant concept they have no aspiration for.Carl Jung is portrayed as having serious personality order of his own which degenerates into downright insanity, but the amiable Dr Freud seems unaffected by his raw ambition and seems to want to protect the man. Freud himself also has a physiologically weak bladder, which I felt didn't add much to the story but I'm sure the author had a reason for it.I found the descriptions of the building of the Brooklyn Bridge and the terrible conditions the workers lived, and died in fascinating. As well as the Caroline Astor/Mrs Vanderbilt feud, Gramercy Park and the houses of the wealthy it served, the onset of mechanical taxicabs in New York – green ones not yellow, was so atmospheric I could see it.This story lots to offer to mystery lovers as well as devotees of old New York and the followers of Freud and Jung.My only criticism of the story would be that the author pontificates at length on the meaning of Hamlet's 'To be or not to be' speech and his procrastination in killing his uncle and has complicated theories which I couldn't help feeling had no place in this story other than to pad out an already very long book – over 200,000 words.I would heartily recommend it for all the reasons I stated earlier and felt my skimming through the 'Hamlet' parts didn't detract from my enjoyment of the book at all.",2,-0.881,0.129,0.753,0.118,0.4738711170626063,POSITIVE,0.9996
26,90999571,02/22/2010,3.0,"Jed Rubenfield’s book borrows quite a few things from the famous non-fiction book The Interpretation of Dreams by Sigmund Freud. To start with, the title is intentionally made to look like a spoof on the original book. The author and psychologist, Sigmund Freud is one of the characters in Rubenfield’s book. Several real characters like Carl Jung, Abraham Brill and George McClellan, Mayor of New York City appear in this fictional book.To begin with, I liked the idea of creating a fictional story out of real-life incidents and characters. The author has a disclaimer that while some of his characters are real and some characters are fictional, the story itself is completely his imagination. Freud visited America only once in his lifetime and is said to have been disappointed with his visit. Rubenfield picked up this fact and weaved his story around it. Around the time when Freud visits America, a young woman is brutally murdered. The next day, another woman is almost murdered in the same way leading to speculations that a serial murderer is on the prowl. The second victim loses her voice and her memory of the incident and this results in engaging Sigmund Freud and our male protagonist Stratham Younger, both psycho-analysts to help the victim rediscover her voice and her memory so that she can identify her attacker. A detective and a coroner are assigned to resolve the case. While one thread about solving the case is going on, the book parallely talks about the protests and revolt against the rising fame of Freud and his teachings. Anti-Freud gang threatens Freud and his followers to abandon their visit and this adds to the mystery factor of the book. Rubenfield paints many characters in a way to make them as possible suspects and this piques the curiosity.I could go on and on about the story since there are so many things going on about the book. The plot is brilliant. I liked the author’s idea of placing an imagined plot on real-life incidents and characters. The very fact that Freud is a character in the book increases the curiosity quotient of the book. The characters are pretty good. Younger, the main character, has enough layers to make him interesting. The detective, Jimmy Littlemore, adds some humor to the story and comes across as an intelligent and warm-hearted detective. The victim, the beautiful Nora Acton, is based on one of Freud’s patients.The story moves pretty fast but gets complicated somewhere in the middle of the book when there are multiple threads running, all related in some way. It becomes tedious to remember the numerous names and their motives and their connection to the murder. The climax is good and fitting for a murder mystery novel. Many loose ends are left untied which thus because of which the book doesn’t give you a sense of satisfaction after reading it.For anyone looking for a murder mystery, this is a must read. For anyone slightly interested in psychology, this book will whet your appetite slightly. If you are like me, pick up this book just because Sigmund Freud is in it.",2,-0.6236,0.09,0.814,0.097,0.4526567182817184,POSITIVE,0.9934
27,100530314,04/28/2010,3.0,"This book's summary is a bit misleading in terms of Freud's overall role in the events of the book. In any case, I still really liked the story. The main character of the book (there actually are two, but since his story is told in the first person, I'll label him as the lead,)is a young psychiatrist who is an avid follower of Sigmund Freud. He is charged with hosting Freud and several of his followers in New York before bringing him to Boston for a lecture at the university he teaches at.During this time in NY, Freud is called to assist in a case involving a young society girl who was attacked in her house and is suffering amnesia. Since his stay is temporary, he has the young psychiatrist take on the case. The second storyline involves the murder of another young woman and a young detective is assigned to work with the city coroner to solve the murder. The two stories intersect as it seems the attacker of both women is the same guy. Freud's involvement in either of these cases is limited to a few pieces of advice, but a separate thread throughout the book involves an attempt to discredit Freud and his theories before his lecture.I enjoyed the setting of the book, as well as the characters. I wasn't bothered by the tone of the book, switching from 1st to 3rd person, in the least, as many times it was like 2 separate stories. This book is fast paced and has a cast of many characters that keeps the story moving along. It's part detective novel and part musings on Freudian theory and what his stay in America might have been like.My only real complaint about the book was that I was unclear of what the deal with Carl Jung was supposed to be. I felt like the story was leading up for him in some way, but died out at the end. I'm not familiar enough with the subject to know if this was the author's fictional guess as to his relationship with Freud or if the guy was actually a bit crazy. I felt that storyline could have been given a better conclusion.One other thing, maybe someone can answer this; I don't know if it was my copy of the book or what, but on page 264, when the detective and Dr. Younger are going down the elevator shaft to the caisson, part of the dialogue seems to skip and I was left wondering what I missed. Younger tells the detective about a young patient who exhibited sexual feelings for her father, to which the detective is disgusted. Then Younger reply's ""Well, I-"" and is interrupted by, I assume the detective saying ""Katie bar the door."" The doctor yells ""all right"" and then apologizes to the detective and then goes on to muse whether his father would have lost control like that. I completely missed where this part of the dialogue came from; and I want to say there were a couple of other parts of the books where I got confused as to the conversation thread. Nothing big to affect my rating, just thought it seemed weird.",0,-0.9862,0.115,0.82,0.065,0.3931987043689173,NEGATIVE,0.5542

I had never read anything similar to this before, so I decided to give it a bash.I mostly enjoyed the plot. There were a great deal of things going on all at once and I appreciate calamity like this in novels, but because of this very reason I feel that a lot of these threads weren't properly tied up at the end, and I was left feeling quite disappointed in this.There wasn't a great deal of character background provided, and where there was, it was quite sparse. We learn that a main character's father has killed himself in the past, but are given no more information on the subject at all.The book was extremely well-researched in order to be historically accurate, but it seems to me that Rubenfeld has concentrated mainly on this, rather than other aspects, such as giving his characters some more meat on their bones. His author's note at the end goes into great detail about how much research he did and so on. I doubt anyone cares.Due to Freud being an integral character, there was a great deal of psychology dialogue throughout the novel. Although it was interesting in places, the majority of the time it became incredibly tedious. I am a massive fan of Shakespeare, but the lengthy analyses of Hamlet and his Oedipus complex tired me too, and I felt the length to which Rubenfeld details this was slightly extreme.I enjoyed the mystery in the novel until it all went a bit Scooby Doo at the end, which ruined the whole thing for me.

There is also a difference between using antisemitism as a vital piece of the story to express the sociopolitical treatment of the Jews and having a really antisemitic character as a plot device.

Rubenfield has managed to fall into neither trap and has merged the real with the fictional (events, science, literary criticism, characters & dialogue) seamlessly enough to make this seem like a credible explanation of the historical events as well as a good murder mystery. And he has the grace to let you know exactly what liberties he has taken with the truth at the end of the book, something this person who has learnt a lot of history from novels appreciated.Only problem is that I now wish even more that I had a ticket to go and see Hamlet at the RSC this summer (and no, it's got nothing to do with David Tennant or Patrick Stewart) - reading it is just not the same.",2,0.9577,0.068,0.783,0.149,0.4513888888888889,NEGATIVE,0.9853

His take on America's evolution in the past century was not only painstakingly researched but also borderline accurate within the lines of fictional liberty, of course. The author has also skillfully ignited the debate over Hamlet, Freud's Oedipus Complex (which to this date repulses a majority of the psychologists), and the parallels between neuroscience and psychoanalysis, all this while staying within the limit of the plot.

Instead of dumping these labyrinthine of complex theories on the reader the author connects it all to its contrasting characters, which is why I highly recommend it to the interested readers.

The interpretation of Murder is such a tale.Dr Sigmund Freud travelled to the United States of America to give lectures at a university. During that time a murder mystery unravels and a ferocious detective along with a Freud’s disciple take on to solve the case. This is a basic premise of the book, and on that, it delivers well. The story is compelling and even though there are no major twists in the tale, the ending is very convincing.He has done painstaking research to describe the city of New York of 1900s. The rich families, the social connections show up in his writing, and so does the rise of electric taxies the labour strikes and whatnot. New York sounds like a very bustling place based on his writing. His writing is very fluent apart from the occasional rarely used words which were hard for me to follow. Overall, I think I enjoyed his writing.The lead character is shown to have an interest in Shakespeare, and quite often he references the iconic line from hamlet, To Be or Not To Be. Towards the end, the author gives out an interpretation of that line and its a well-written part of the book. That, and his interpretation of Freud’s Oedipal complex, are the two highlights of the writing in this book.Thankfully, the author has given a separate note segregating the fact from fiction and that is very helpful for someone who is not well-versed with the history of New York. It was my gripe when I saw Tarantino’s movie Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, that the work of art should have some context to help the uninitiated, which this book has.Spoilers ahead.Although he has put in a lot of threads together to create a sense of whodunit, eventually you realise that they are not really well tangled. The perpetrators are quite different from the triumvirate, and there are really two different stories that take place. The overall involvement of Freud in mystery-solving is kept quite minimal.

This is the first fictional book that I have read where an actual living character plays such a major role.

The very next day a similar attack takes place on Nora Acton, another 17 year old in her own house. She manages to scream out before the murderer could finish his work, and so the murderer has to flee. When the police attempt to interrogate the girl, it turns out that she has lost her voice and cannot remember anything that took place the previous day. That is when the Mayor of New York on learning that Sigmund Freud is in the city invites him to have a look at the girl. After examining the girl, Freud tells Younger to take over the case and helps him solve it. While Younger runs psychoanalytic treatment on Nora, Detective Littlemore attempts to trace down the murderer based on the clues that he finds on the body of the murdered girl before it mysteriously disappears. As expected, there is a romantic angle introduced with Stratham Younger and Nora Acton as the protagonists.The story, being set in the early 1900’s New York, describes the architectural and the industrial revolution taking place at that time quite vividly. Also, the author has described the social strata and the general mindset of the people during that time quite succinctly. This was very important because it explains why the parents of the victim are so eager to cover the assault on her.The book touches with a lot of psychoanalytical theories prevalent during that time. But, it mainly deals with the Oedipus complex theory which was propounded by Freud. This theory deals with the feeling and desires of any person to possess the parent of opposite sex and eliminate the parent of the same sex. The main plot – and several sub plots – deals with this same theory.Most of the fictional characters described in this book are well sketched. However, their behavior is not quite consistent throughout the book, which makes you wonder whether the author changed the climax at the last moment. The behavior of other characters ofcourse is based on their real life counterparts. While Freud, Jung, Ferenczi and a few others existed in real life too, a few characters have been based on other real life characters. Quite a few events described in the book did take place in real life too; like the parting of ways between Freud and Jung. However, while in reality this event took place a few years after 1909, in the book this event has been shown as having occurred during their visit to America. There are a few other events which have similarly been postponed or preponed in order to accommodate them in the book. However, since these are related to the main plot of the book, I will not mention them here.The biggest fault with the book is that the flow of the book is all confused. One moment you will have Younger having psychoanalytical sessions with Nora Acton, the other moment you will have Littlemore struggling on to find the murderer. The scenes tend to change with each paragraph, which is not something that you really want. Most readers would prefer a particular scene to go on for atleast 3-5 paragraphs. It’s almost as if Jed Rubenfeld is trying to create too much of mystery. And there he lets the reader down. Basically such books are supposed to be read while travelling and other hectic activities. However, the haphazard structuring of the book means that you can get lost easily. In fact, I would strongly recommend that you read this book only if you have time on your hand. If you plan to read this book haltingly, with a break of say a 4-5 days between two readings then it may be hard to keep up with the plot. Another fault, as I mentioned earlier, is that the characters are not consistent throughout the book. What I mean is that, during any character’s interaction with any other character, there is no hint given that he/she may turn out to be different. This is an error most mystery writers try to avoid since the surest way to lose readers is by creating a mystery so unfathomable that the reader cannot guess the solution by himself at all.All in all, I would say the ‘The Interpretation of Murder’ could have been a much better book than it eventually turned out to be. Should you read it? Well, as I said, read it only if you can keep up with the confusing storyline, or else just give it a skip.",0,-0.9905,0.084,0.866,0.05,0.3923359943521234,POSITIVE,0.9012

On the surface is the story of Dr. Freud's first time visit to America, being shown around New York by American psychiatrist Dr. Abraham Brill and Dr. Stratham Younger, alternating with the mystery of a potential serial killer on the loose, targeting rich debutantes. Underneath, the author presents his characters' and his own ideas and opinions on the theories of psychology and psychoanalysis, of the human mind and behavior. And because of Dr. Younger's passion for Shakespeare, there is also a literary layer wherein he dissects the existence Hamlet and the meaning of his famous question: ""To be or not to be..."" using psychoanalysis and Freud's principles of sexual repression.Chronicling the parallel the events of Freud's visit to America and growing conflicts with Carl Jung, and the mystery of the murdered and assaulted debutantes, the narration in the novel alternates between third person to Dr. Younger's first person point of view - Dr. Younger being the only character involved in both stories.Though a work of fiction, most of the characters in the novel are real or based on real people who were involved in the actual events described in the novel, or in similar events that took place during the characters' lifetimes. In fact, the only fictional characters in the novel are Dr. Stratham Younger, and some of the characters involved in the murder mystery, including Detective Littlemore.According to the author, Jed Rubenfeld, he did intensive research on the events, architecture and culture of New York in the early 1900's as well as the works of Dr. Sigmund Freud and Dr. Carl Jung. Rubenfeld also stated that he drew heavily from Freud's, Jung's and the other psychiatrists' research papers, letters, and other historical documents to create their dialogues, discussions and debates presented in the novel.Freud's visit to America with Carl Jung and Sandor Ferenczi to lecture at Clark University is also a real event. Though it is a well-known fact that Dr. Freud developed a certain disdain for America during his first visit, it is not entirely known what had caused these negative feelings. After his first seemingly traumatic visit to New York, Dr. Freud never returned to America.The Interpretation of Murder gives readers a glimpse of the culture and society of New York at the turn of the century, illustrating the general fear of the irreversible changes brought on by groundbreaking and controversial principles of psychology and human behavior.Normally I am turned off with novels about real people in fictitious events and situations, but Rubenfeld's execution of Freud's, Jung's and the other historical figures' involvement in the murder mystery aspect of The Interpretation of Murder was carefully done and in good taste.

In this instance the comparison is a little more apt, since the detection is set early in the 20th century and involves not just one but a bunch of mentalists -- in this instance psychoanalysts, among them Freud, Jung and Ferenczi, visiting the US so that Freud could deliver a series of lectures and receive an honorary degree. Foremost among these men, in terms of the novel, is the youthful, tyro US psychoanalyst Dr Stratham Younger; it is he who, with ambitious young NYPD detective James Littlemore, solves the case of a young woman found seemingly murdered by a sexual sadist in a doughty Upper West Side apartment block, with a second, similar but fortunately not lethal attack on another young woman soon after in a house adjacent to Gramercy Park. That survivor, Nora Acton, becomes Younger's primary love interest, even as he recognizes that what's going on is, at least on her part, merely transference.  The tale's carried along often with Younger as first-person narrator, often in traditional novelistic third person, and sometimes in the form of highly entertaining third-person infodump, filling in historical and/or psychoanalytic details. In any of these three modes, the text's enormously readable and the mystery engrossing; more accurately, it's the unraveling of the mystery, with layers of understanding of the truth of it being gradually revealed, that engrosses, for the mystery itself is not what it seemed at the outset. In parallel there's an unveiling of the true depths of Nora Acton's personality, through both Younger's stumbling psychoanalytic efforts and his direct romantic interest, that's equally involving. As background we have two linked sets of politicking going on, one concerning the administration of NYC, the other being rooted in the antagonism of traditional US mentalists toward the upstart Viennese discipline with its focus on matters better swept under the carpet.  Unfortunately, the explanation of what's really been going on comes as something of an anticlimax, since it piles implausibility upon implausibility; the fact that it has to be fleshed out to fill perhaps thirty or forty pages in an attempt to stop us throwing the book at the wall in outright disbelief is an indication of the problem. Luckily Rubenfeld's prose was still sufficiently smooth to keep me reading, but it meant that I came away from the book with a far less favourable opinion of it than I'd have thought possible an hour earlier. But it's a sign of the book's strength otherwise that I was genuinely disappointed to discover from the notes at the back that both Stratham Younger and Jimmy Littlemore were, unlike Freud, Jung and the rest (whose roles are fairly minor), entirely fictional characters; they were both that well created on the page.  Rubenfeld has published a follow-up, The Death Instinct, and I'll be keeping an eye out for it. ",0,0.988,0.058,0.82,0.123,0.4238993710691823,POSITIVE,0.9654
58,114803459,08/01/2010,4.0,"Reading the interpretation of murder one has to remind themselves that this is only Rubenfeld’s first novel. Given the authorative yet easy reading style of interpretation of murder I would almost believe it if Jed had published another name.Interpretation of murder is a murder conspiracy mystery set in the early 1900s, and based around the famous psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud’s only visit to the U.S. Coincidental (or is it?) to his arrival in the U.S. a young woman is found murdered and shortly thereafter another found assaulted in a similar manner to the murder of the first. Freud and his disciple Dr Younger (our protagonist) are drawn into the investigation when Younger agrees to treat the assault victim in an attempt to glean some information about the murder.  Rubenfeld Mixes a brilliant concoction of historical facts and fictional intrigue and produces a brilliant novel which covers themes from the psychoanalysis of Shakespeare’s Hamlet, love and jealous obsession, to the intersection of science and politics.There is an unusual choice of narration in the interpretation of murder – a combination of 1st and the 3rd person perspectives, and not in the common thriller style of having most scenes from our main character with a few scenes that the reader needed to see without the presence of the narrator (usually of a melodramatic antagonist stalking some damsel in distress). Many scenes of this novel remain in third person even when the scene includes Dr Younger (our protagonist) that Rubenfeld manages this style of narration without confusion and achieves their goal of not only successfully including many main characters but connecting the reader to each, is almost unbelievable from this novice’s perspective.Despite a compelling plot and fascinating psychoanalysing, there are a few problem points in Jed’s novel. Some of the humour verges on slapstick, mostly when we read scenes from the coroner and detective assigned to the murder case – and while there is some good literary irony, these scenes don’t sit well with the mood and themes of the rest of the novel.Plus the scenes of the mysterious ‘triumperant’ are clichés birthed from earlier decades best left in the past.Overall however interpretation of murder is an excellent novel, particularly recommended for those with an interest in psychology/psychoanalysis.

With pieces of the investigation coming from all sides, we are lead on a trail through the human psyche. Freud has always been an interesting man. Being a psychology student, I have come across him and his theories over and over again, they never cease to intrigue yet repel me. His Oedipus theory is only one of several yet it must be one of the best known, and talked about. And this book is no stranger to the theory, though it is slightly modified. While reading this book I realised (yet again) just how odd yet unable to prove/disprove Freud’s theories really are. They things he summarises are totally weird yet its all we talked about during A-levels (oddly enough he hasn’t been mentioned during my degree, wonder why?) and its one of the reasons I chose to read this book. The first thing I liked about ‘The Interpretation of Murder’ was the way in which it was written and the fact that several characters stand out, Detective Littlemore, for example. I enjoyed the way that the story is told from different angles and how conclusions were reached by different people almost simultaneously. The slight skewing of the Oedipus theory and the questioning of the theory itself by Younger, lead to some questions of my own which I think is a must for a good book. The bouncing around of suspects was a good pager turner too. Overall I really liked the book, even if Freud annoys the hell out of me at times.

One thing I really appreciated about Rubenfeld's writing -- which was especially obvious when read out of order -- was the change in the characters over the 10 years between their appearances.

It's not surprising that the book has already been sold in 20 different countries, and is already something of an international publishing phenomenon. The secret, of course, is in plotting, and few carry this off as adroitly as the author does here. But there is some wonderful historical detail here also, and a conjuring up of real-life characters that is very intelligently done.Despite the outward success of his visit to the USA, Sigmund Freud always spoke as if some trauma had befallen him there. He blamed the country for physical ailments that afflicted him long before his visit. Freud's biographers have been bemused by his reaction, wondering whether some terrible unknown event might have happened in America that could explain this. The Interpretation of Murder is strikingly written literary thriller constructed around Freud's American visit.

If you're looking for a fairly mundane and straightforward detective story with virtually no surprises, look no further.

It was deeply misogynistic the whole way through which is not surprising given it’s basically Freud fan fiction (why. Why did I read this?) but the sections on how Nora obviously must have been sexually excited by being assaulted as a fourteen year old was both unnecessary and disgusting. Parts of this read like an undergraduate thesis on Freud sandwiched between peculiar episodes of someone imagining what their psychologist heroes (plus some random useless extras) might be like if they got to hang out with them. Younger is a vile protagonist whose long creepy lingering descriptions of how much he wants to bang Nora make me feel as though the author has never actually met a woman in his life.I threw this book across the room and frankly I wish I’d thrown it out the window. ,0,-0.7132,0.141,0.738,0.121,0.5456140350877192,NEGATIVE,1.0

After a while, I began to find Younger's Hamlet comments rather interesting, as I've read several Shakespearean plays, and had a giggle at Freud's pyschoanalysis as I quite frankly, thought that it was a load of crap. The mystery however, I really enjoyed. I thought I knew exactly what was going on but it turned out to be far more complex than I had expected. I think that Rubenfeld could become a great mystery writer - if he left out deep pyschoanalytic and literary-analysis comments, which many of us common people either don't understand or aren't interested in. I have a feeling that it is Freud and Younger's thoughts which have put people off this book.

However, Freud's presence was more of a backdrop and I don't think it was necessarily consequential to the story. Having said that, I appreciate that the author must have carried out a lot of painstaking research and it was interesting to read his Author's Note at the end, to see where fiction and fact meet. I think that the fictional parts of the book were the strength, particularly the characters the author invented. Hugel, Nora, Younger and especially Littlemore provided many humorous and touching moments. I felt the explanation of the mystery was a tad convoluted but it was a satisfying read and I also enjoyed the analysis of Hamlet that ran through the book.

107,1977835455,06/03/2017,4.0,"Jed Rubenfeld is a modern-day Renaissance man. A professor of law at Yale University who has also taught at Stanford and Duke, he is an expert on constitutional law, privacy and the First Amendment. He studied theatre and Shakespeare at Julliard and wrote a thesis on Sigmund Freud during his senior undergraduate year at Princeton. He is also the author of six books, two of which are novels. It seems as though there’s nothing he can’t do. If I didn’t admire him so much, I’d be horribly jealous. (Well, maybe I can do both at the same time.)The Interpretation of Murder was his first novel. It’s a very intricate weaving of true events and characters with fictional events and characters. Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Sandor Ferenczi, Ernest Jones, Abraham Brill – all real life figures in the early 1900s movement of psychoanalysis, which was new, controversial and in competition with neurology – mingle with the fictional Elizabeth Riverford, Dr Stratham Younger, Nora Acton, George and Clara Banwell, Coroner Hugel and Detective Littlemore. There’s a miniature essay at the end of the book clearly outlining what’s real and what’s not and the artistic licence taken, which is a good thing because the blending of them is seamless.When Elizabeth Riverford is murdered in an apartment at the exclusive Balmoral building in New York, Coroner Hugel and Detective Littlemore are assigned to investigate the case. On the same night as her death, Dr Stratham Younger meets Dr Sigmund Freud as he steps off the George Washington steamship for what is his first (and turns out to be his last) trip to the US. Dr Freud is there to advance the cause of psychoanalysis through a series of university lectures and Dr Younger is one of his American devotees.Later the same week, Nora Acton is apparently targeted by Elizabeth Riverford’s killer but survives when the murderer is disturbed. Miss Acton is unable to remember who attacked her and has lost her voice to boot. When Dr Younger hears about the case at a society event, he volunteers Dr Freud’s talents in order to help the debutante recover both her memories and her ability to speak. Knowing he will be in the country a short time and that recovery could take a while, Dr Freud appoints Dr Younger to perform the psychoanalysis.Coroner Hugel determines conclusively that whoever killed Elizabeth Riverford is the same person who attacked Nora Acton and when, after a few sessions With Dr Younger, she identifies George Banwell as her assailant, it seems like case closed. Except for one thing. George Banwell, a wealthy property developer married to Miss Acton’s best friend, has an airtight alibi for the time of Elizabeth Riverford’s murder. He was dining outside of the city with New York Mayor, George McClellan. It’s a head scratcher. And when Miss Riverford’s body goes missing from the morgue, it becomes difficult to prove there ever was a murder, let alone a murderer.It’s not a straightforward murder mystery. Jed Rubenfeld, through his main character of Dr Stratham Younger, delves into the real life history of the tumultuous relationship between Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, the true meaning of “to be or not to be” in Hamlet and alternative theories of what the Oedipus complex actually means. It’s mostly superfluous to the plot and while I found it fascinating, I can understand that some might not.In the end, the plot turns out to be a little bit convoluted but it almost doesn’t matter. The writing is wonderful and the research impeccable. New York just after the turn of the twentieth century is a character all on its own, beautifully portrayed and perfectly used. Along with society matriarchs, rebellious daughters, immoral fathers, psychotic psychiatrists, corrupt officials, madams and prostitutes with hearts of gold, and determined discoverers of the truth, it all makes for an intriguing set of circumstances. Because even the fictional people feel real.It took me a while to read this book but unlike some others that seem to drag on and on, I really didn’t mind. I could have happily spent a lot longer engrossed in its pages. And I imagine that it’s the sort of book that you could get more and more out of on second and subsequent readings and also the kind of book that different people could take different things from.

108,3187415597,02/12/2020,3.0,"I picked up The Interpretation of Murder by Jed Rubenfeld at the book exchange at my local train station. Having just finished it today, I'm very conflicted about it, since I really enjoyed it, whilst at the same time finding its treatment of, presentation of and attitudes towards women absolutely appalling.I do like the premise - a gap in the historical records of Freud's trip to America and a seemingly unreasonable attitude of Freud's towards America after this trip. The book seeks to propose what may have happened during the trip to upset him so much. However, the main plot of a young psychoanalyst being asked to consult on a murder actually has very little to do with Freud, and the subplot about the threat to Freud's lecture series at an American university has no real connection to this main plot thread, so seems a bit by the by.The way the story comes together is clever, if rather too convoluted for my taste, and the writing is pacy and compelling. Though, at least to begin with, the author seems very keen for the reader to know just how much research he's done into the society and geography of New York in 1909, including large passages of exposition and description.And so on to the women... They are dismissed, mocked, disparaged or objectified throughout. Even the coroner's reaction to the corpse at the start is couched in terms of her beauty, which is a bit icky. The protagonist falls in love with his 17-year-old patient. And, when she tells him she's gay, his response is to try to kiss her. I hate the way their relationship progresses and ends up, particularly with her incredibly convenient 18th birthday...The point of view shifts in the narrative are also a bit offputting. Dr Younger gets a first person POV, but also appears as a character in some of the third person perspective scenes, and the number of POV characters overall gets a bit too many towards the end.There's basically only one character in the whole thing who isn't awful, and that's Detective Littlemore, who at least treats everyone with due respect, is actually nice to people, and manages to get leads in the case by doing good deeds and keeping to his principles. So, it seems like the author know what a good person is - he just decided to make most of his characters terrible for some reason.There's a lot of monologuing to explain everything at the end, which is always a bit tiresome, and there were so many twists to the story that it was difficult to follow in some parts of the explanation.So, it's really sounds like I didn't enjoy it at all - but I did, for some reason!

If I had been reading it instead of listening to a CD in my car, I doubt I would have finished it. It was just too long and tiresome. I have read at least one book about Freud and have an educated person's working knowledge of his theories. I have read Hamlet three or four times. I've read entertaining historical fiction and nonfiction about this era in New York. All of these have interested me greatly. This book is not without merit: At times, the story and characters are engaging. At times, the discussions about psychoanalysis and among psychoanalysts were interesting. But there was way too much of this in the book to support the mystery. Throughout the book, there were bizarre resolutions and incidents that were just not believable or did not fit. More could have been done to make these fit in. They made for distracting instead of satisfying reading. I knew fairly early on which character was responsible for most of the bad behavior. I found I didn't like any of the female characters, which makes me suspicious of the author's perception of women, but then, just barely liked one or two of the male characters. A lot of work went into the book, but much of it should have been parked in another book or on the cutting room floor. Let go of Hamlet! Cut out and edit the extraneous characters and factoids you just couldn't bear to leave out. Eliminate one whole red herring that simply didn't work. Incorporate the other red herrings more seamlessly. Drop the bad guy club and the details about Jung and Freud and the other psychoanalysts. Their roles could have been more deftly written. There may be two books here that could include some of what I'd cut from the mystery. ",0,-0.8758,0.088,0.848,0.064,0.4451714951714952,NEGATIVE,1.0

Jed Rubenfeld's book reads not only part essay but also part mystery, talking about Freud's only trip to America and applying Freud's psychoanalysis theory to the mystery itself. The characters themselves were interesting to read about. Seeing and reading about Freudian theory through the eyes of Younger was refreshing and offers a new way of understanding the man's ideas. I would have to say, however, that the moments were Rubenfeld delves such theories are at times heavy enough to slow down the pacing of an otherwise thrilling mystery. Undoubtedly, though, such passages are well-researched. Overall, the beginning was a bit hard for me to get through. As said before, the psychology parts were enough to slow down the pacing, so much so that I had to put it down and pick it up the next day. However, after reaching the 100s, the pacing ramped up, and I couldn't stop reading until the very end. Finally, the mystery's conclusion was unexpected. Not so much for Clara (I felt it either had to be her or her husband, and I ended up with both!), but for Hugel. The coroner's introduction had me thinking that he was an uptight but righteous man. Incorruptible. Yet, in the end, I find out that he was an accomplice, a man capable of being bribed just like all those corrupt officers Hugel himself hated. I should have suspected something was up when Hugel gave up on the case so readily, but I never actually thought he could be a part of the crime.

112,3693428878,01/04/2021,1.0,"Overall the book is undeniably a good murder mystery, with several suspects and a few plot twists. However, Freud is a very marginal character in the story, barely being involved with the main story line and mostly being discussed in regards to the developments surrounding the translation of his work into English and the introduction of psychoanalysis to American doctors. As it was maybe to be expected, Freud's Oedipal complex is widely discussed and integrated in the main plot. What I found especially inappropriate and frankly disgusting was the application of the Oedipal complex in regards to all of Nora's (the surviving victim) experiences. The particular instance where it is stated that she ""obviously must have been excited"" when she was assaulted at only fourteen years old was genuinely appalling and unnecessary. In addition, whilst Nora is thoroughly analysed and judged throughout the book, not one attempt is made to analyse the assailant nor there is any judgement towards the atrocities he commits.Furthermore, as much as I appreciate this work is historical fiction, and the characters' opinions are mainly supposed to be in line with the mentality of the time, the amount of misogynistic and racists remarks throughout the entire book did bother me. In conclusion, despite the mystery itself being very intriguing, the book comes across as very misogynistic and often racist, and the integration of Freud's theories in the plot felt forced and often extremely inappropriate. Unfortunately, in this case the intriguing mystery is not enough to outweigh the bad, reason why I would not recommend this book unless you are a die-hard fan of Freud's work and are not bothered by all the aforementioned issues.

The concept is solid, but instead of the gripping thriller one expects from the 'blurb', what one receives is an overcomplicated and tedious novel, in which Freud features very little, and which zips back and forth between the first and third person faster than Mo Farah can run the 100 meters. I found this so hard to get into, it started unbelievably slowly and didn't pick up pace much throughout. I did enjoy, however, the character of Jimmy Littlemore, who added a touch of comedy to an otherwise rather dull effort.

212,296308340,03/18/2012,2.0,"The book began thus: “There is no mystery to happiness…” Well, there is no mystery in the book either. Except the reasons for even writing one that is so shallow in places where it should have been deep.The book begins on an extravagant note to anyone who has read the back cover of the book. The abstract of the book sounds grand, makes it appealing and makes you wish you’d get through it in no time. But, alas, the story fizzles out just like the carbon dioxide of a just-opened soda bottle.And so we enter ‘The Interpretation of Murder‘ with Dr. Stratham Younger, the narrator, waiting at a harbor for a certain gentleman, who the reader hopes is going to play a huge role in the book, Sigmund Freud. The description, of the unrest at the harbor and the arrival of Freud with a party, is all very well. A few more pages into the book, we are told that a girl (Elizabeth Riverford) is murdered; she is donned in almost nothing and has grotesque marks on her body; all very well too. And it makes the reader wish that there is a good reason for someone going after her throat in such a romantic fashion. Too bad, that the reason is not a very good one.Sigmund Freud arrives in early 20th century New York to deliver lectures at Clark University. I might add though, the description of the Big Apple in that era was very vivid. As it does happen in most murder mysteries, the timing of the murder and the arrival of Freud on American soil, cause Freud to get involved in the investigation. (This one is a no-brainer; you ought to guess it while you’re reading.) What is a little tiresome is the wait for Freud to enter the investigation, and add that little spark, to what is until at this point of time in the book, a wayside murder. Sadly, Freud just plays, what our readers have likened, a ‘Dumbledore to Harry’ to Dr. Stratham Younger in the book; and nothing more. He comes in when Younger needs a little help, he chips in his two pence to what Younger has discovered, and goes back into the wings.The second time, the killer fails to kill a certain Miss Nora Acton, and she proves to be the only witness who can be interrogated to nail down the murderer, albeit with a lost voice. Miss Acton can’t seem to remember anything from that night and neither is she able to speak. Thanks to a lot of convoluted twists in the book and some added masala by the author, Miss Acton is being resorted to psychological treatment by Dr. Younger to determine more about the killer.Simply the story is this:Nora Acton was tortured, but not killed, by Mr. Killer who has already killed another girl- She has lost her voice – Dr. Younger is brought in to treat her – Freud is helping Younger as and when he can – A certain Mr. Littlemore is investigating this case on behalf of the Police Department of New York – A certain Mr. and Mrs. Banwell enter the scene, as the building in which the murder takes place belongs to them (They are also affiliated to the Actons) – Younger and Littlemore eventually solve the case.At the mention of Mr. Littlemore, we have to stop a bit and give Littlemore the credit he deserves. By general consensus, he is THE finest and only lovable character in the book. Very measured, smart and a quick thinker- just like the detectives you are damned to like. One of our readers, Hardik Kothare, says about Littlemore, “My favourite character was Jimmy Littlemore. One of the reasons is his ability ‘to get a girl’ immediately…how could he do it? Damn! I am jealous! Haha.” Yes, he is undoubtedly a high point in the book. And whilst reading the garbled story, you find yourself hoping he would jump in and save the falling-apart story line.Some other mentions that the book review is incomplete without:The author has used the Oedipus Complex as the base for the book. He uses it to explain what’s going on with Nora and that immature mind of hers. Not only Nora, the author has also explained the reasons why Hamlet behaves like he does, on the basis of the Oedipus. (Yes, Hamlet, the one sketched by the Bard)That portion is a little stirring. Just a little. Rubenfeld has struggled with the Oedipus all along the book. And come to think of it, the book was based on the theory.A certain high of the book is Dr. Stratham Younger’s theory that most great inventions took place at the turn of a century. It makes you sit up and read while the rest of the reading is so tiring and forced.Once again, the description of Mrs. Clara Banwell was another small jump in the book, and how she is with Nora through here treatment on and off.Carl Jung arrives with Sigmund Freud and his character is totally wasted. Could have done without it.As a Bollywood measure, a group of three men calling themselves the Triumvirate enter the scene. They behave like they are going to pull off a stunt, but they don’t quite do anything as such. Could have done without it too.To wind up, one can say that there is nothing you take away from the book. It is a sluggish read. For those who have read Freud, it is just an overview of what the man was. They story is not gripping and neither is it educational for those who have not read Freud.-Sameen",0,0.9786,0.078,0.816,0.106,0.4292459605921144,NEGATIVE,0.9993

The inclusion of Sigmund Freud and his team/fellow psychoanalysts was an interesting take on a mystery- but he wasn’t used. He was there to give advice to the main character, like a father figure, or to be vilified by Carl Jung. For someone who is such an important figure in this form of science it was disappointing to see him pushed into the background. It was also disappointing to discover the murder wasn’t actually a murder at all. This book definitely didn’t meet expectations but I had never heard of it and I was intrigued which is why I picked it up in the first place. I did start to enjoy it towards the latter half of the book, even if the start did bore me, and I’m glad I eventually finished it. I would take this book with a pinch of salt.

293,1181298092,01/26/2015,4.0,"Interesting, but almost barely worth commenting on. Psycho-babble.I decided to read the book before moving on to No. 2 in the series, just to get some ideas about the author and what to expect. It seems like the author is heavy into H.G. Wells, Arthur Conan Doyle and Shakespeare, besides being an expert on Freudian psychtherapy, is the impression I received.The second book is more interesting to me because of the terrorist bombing angle, and the obvious correlations to the recent Boston Marathon incident (although the book was written beforehand). Turns out these kinds of anarchistic doings with explosives have occurred many times in the past, in Los Angeles, in Chicago, and in New York if you study over history (the author gives brief mention to these other incidents as well and you can research them further on your own), and not for the first time in 2001 on 911 as one had been led to believe. Rubenfeld can make his stories interesting, even if he can't rise above the times or attitudes he encounters during those periods. This one seemed very illogical to me, for the simple reason that it involves a ruse. At the start of the book, a male character is stalking a female one, but it turns out to be a hoax (actually it is a reverse of this, if I read the book correctly). Attempting to put together all the end explanations was a bigger mental chore than was warranted for me. One merely accepts the truth and seeming angle that was put forth earlier in the book. Even though the guilty parties are finally found out and brought to justice, the carnage has been done. The book can't walk away from this fact, and that makes it a tragic ending. Not even Hamlet could sort this one out. There seems to be too many subplots that are unconnected, which creates a sense of confusion. The evil trio of shadowy agents in America, opposed to Freud's new pyschotherapy theories, that are suspected of having somehow been involved in the murder turn out to have nothing to do with either this murder that never actually happened, or with the other shadowy one that actually did. Huh? You better be prepared for a let down here. None of this is going to make perfect sense to the reader, but very contrived for emotional gusher effects. The reported murder is so sexually implicit and disgusting in brutality that it leaves the reader no where else to turn to. Finding the murderer then becomes an exercise in trying out some of Freud's theories on a second person attacked by the same demented sex deviant but who survived it with only burns and cuts. She has temporarily lost her memory of the attack, and any would be knowledge of the attacker. Can her memory be restored through psychotherapeutic methods? Here again, the woman's memory suddenly comes back on its own, and she is hostile towards being a patient rather than a victim. Why set the scene of a man stalking someone early in the book, if no man is literally stalking someone and the main suspect has an air-tight alibi of having been with the mayor during the time of the purported murder? It is the fear of what might happen in the future rather than what has already happened that eventually makes sense of the events, and that so disturb the reader's sensibilities when the hoax is revealed to be a skillfully worked out plot by the two women involved. Apparently, one of the women dressed up as a man to put everyone off the trail.  The book did contain some exciting scenes, such as when Littlemore and Younger, detective and doctor duo (reminiscent of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson), pursue evidence that has been moved underground or underwater (H. G. Wells inspired adventure). Their artificial air chamber used to go down below is rapidly filling with water, and the race is on to see if they can get back to the surface in time. To heighten the suspense, the doctor character is missing for quite some time, and suspected to have transpired. This turns out not to be the case, but the evidence that the detective and doctor went down to find is not conclusive, merely some clothing items and not the missing body itself, which raises the question of the importance of that section at all. That's the kind of problems I found in reading the book. Nothing seemed to add up until the very end, and then it all seemed anti-climatic, with all the air released from the balloon in a sudden pin prick moment that was not what one was expecting. Freud's Oedipal leanings are shown to be false, or at least misleading. The father envies the son, more than the son envies the father, according to the narrator, who had been one of Freud's followers until he received his contradictory revelations during the course of the novel. But does it matter who is envying who? It's a bit confusing, as I said. ",0,-0.9978,0.152,0.769,0.079,0.4417763949013948,NEGATIVE,1.0
