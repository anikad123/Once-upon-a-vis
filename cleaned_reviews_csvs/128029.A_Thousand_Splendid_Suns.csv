0,5279786,08/29/2007,5,"August 2007I was riding in a cab in Bombay recently, and a bookseller on foot approached me at a traffic light with a stack of books. I did my best not to look at the boy, but I couldn't help it. He was waving several books in my face and something caught my eye. I thought my glance was discreet, but he saw me look.. and it was game over. The light turned green right then and the boy starts running with the cab yelling 'Memsahib! Memsahib!'. We're picking up speed.. I'm so scared he's going to get his foot runover so I grab whatever I could from my wallet and somehow get it into his hands. In return he tosses a random book at me through the window as he's getting further & further away from the cab. I look to see what I ended up with. It was A Thousand Splendid Suns, which I was planning on buying anyways. The cab driver asked me how much I ended up giving the boy. 'A hundred and fifty rupees,' I said, which is barely $4. The cab driver says in return, 'You paid a hundred rupees too much!'. Hardly, I thought to myself. That boy worked his butt off. The best part is because the book is bootlegged it's full of typos and random fonts. Love it. In case I ever discuss the book with you and my recollection of the story is completely different from what you read, you'll know why.January 2008Read the book on my way to Vietnam a few days ago. Loved it, although it was missing a few pages here and there :). Coincidentally, the friend I'm traveling with brought the same book on our trip so I had access to the missing pages. (And another coincidence - our Mekong Delta guide was carrying a copy of the Kite Runner. We were like some sort of Hosseini fanclub floating down the Mekong in our longboat...haha). I have a few thoughts on this book, I'll write them out in more detail soon. I'm heading back to Bombay in a few days...maybe I'll run into another bookseller on foot :).",1662,0.9792,0.037,0.866,0.098,0.4027657527657527,NEGATIVE,0.7663

""A face of grievances unspoken, burdens gone unprotested, a destiny submitted to and endured.""
This must have been the longest time I had waited to review a fiction after finishing the book. Even after a week, I still haven't fully recuperated from the emotional blow of A Thousand Splendid Suns... Painful, heartbreaking, but quite beautiful in a very sad way. Hosseini has improved upon what he did with Kite Runner, if that's even possible, in every conceivable way imaginable to give the reader another masterpiece! I loved every little thing about this book.
""Learn this now and learn it well, my daughter: Like a compass needle that points north, a man's accusing finger always finds a woman.""
When I finished Kite Runner before, it became clear how impactful Hosseini's story telling is: It was tragic yet beautiful in a unique way. I had thought I was prepared to pretty much anything the author could throw at me after that. But A Thousand Splendid Suns, for me, was a far more difficult read. Unlike in Kite Runner, Hosseini does not hold back when it comes to unfolding Mariam and Laila's story. Saying that reading through the abuse and other privations of the two protagonists was shocking would be a huge understatement. Everything felt too real to be consoled otherwise. In the Afterwards section, I did come across about Hosseini's work in UNHCR, and maybe it's his firsthand experience that made the portrayal this authentic. 
""It's our lot in life, Mariam. Women like us. We endure. It's all we have.""
The author continues to use his simple, and straightforward writing style which suits perfectly to the atmosphere he creates in these stories. But, even if one finds the writing style to be lacking in flavor, when the story telling is this good, most would never be bothered by anything else. And when you add Hosseini's flawless character development, it's impossible not to fall in love with this book. But where I saw the most significant improvement is in the plot, which stole the spotlight away from character department. The life story of the two protagonists -Mariam and Laila- allows the reader to peak in to a couple of lives heavily affected not only by war, but their journey amidst various domestic difficulties, providing the reader with another unique opportunity to empathize with Afghan people, and specifically from a woman's point of view this time. Instead of coming across hateful stories about Taliban and terrorism in general, it's enlightening to see the events from a perspective like this, which enables any reader to understand the bitter reality, along with the fact that countless thousands of people are experiencing worse circumstances in such countries. Even though it is fiction, I think it's commendable, and remarkable, what Hosseini does with these stories, as they help shift any reader's opinion about the people who are affected by wars in such countries.
""People, she believed now, shouldn't be allowed to have new children if they'd already given away all their love to their old ones. It wasn't fair.""
Everything else that was good about Kite Runner is still here, from pace, flow of events, and handling of emotions to the ending. Oh, that ending! I rarely admire a sad ending, but Hosseini is definitely the exception. During the middle part of the book, even though I loved everything, I didn't see myself giving a rating higher than 4-stars, but the concluding chapters broke me down and changed everything. Now I feel like there aren't enough starts to do justice.
""As she closed her eyes, it was not regret any longer but a sensation of abundant peace that washed over her.""""One last time, Mariam did as she was told.""
It's not every day that I get to shelf two consecutive books from the same author as all-time-favorites. Honestly, I was not expecting this to be better than the first, and thought there might even be some repetitiveness. This is anything but that! If you loved Kite Runner, it is most likely that you will have an even better reading experience with this ATSS. However, be warned that the emotional impact this delivers is far more profound, leaving one with tears for quite a while. Unlike with Kite Runner, the luxury of hiding the despicable actions of villains, which left many horrific events to readers' imagination, is gone. But at the end of the day, just like with Kite Runner, it's worth every second... it's worth the heartbreak... it's worth evert tear... Another must-read-for-all from Hosseini.
""A young Mariam is sitting at the table making a doll by the glow of an oil lamp. She's humming something. Her face is smooth and youthful, her hair washed, combed back. She has all her teeth.""


""The little girl looks up. Puts down the doll. Smiles. Laila jo?""

3,2879034999,07/17/2019,5,"Amazing!Heart-Wrenching!Important!In a world where people tend to make assumptions about people and places based on the news, preconceived notions, prejudice, etc., this book needs to be read. I think a good portion of the American population hears ‚ÄúAfghanistan‚Äù and they think it is a country full or terrorists and unreasonable Muslim extremists who all band together to plot the downfall of anyone not like them. A Thousand Splendid Suns shows the progression of life in Afghanistan from the Soviet takeover in 1980s through post 9/11 Taliban control. All of this is through the eyes of two women trying to live a normal and peaceful life just like anyone in the world wants. You will see that despite the extremists and unreasonable values of some, most of the Afghani people are no different than you and me.Hosseini is a fantastic writer. Not only is the story enthralling, but the way he writes is engaging and easy to follow. I was never bored or confused. When I was not reading the book, I was thinking about the book and could not wait to get back to it and find out what happens. Sometimes you find the perfect book where the writing just falls into place with a click ‚Äì that happened with this one. While the story takes place far away and the life discussed unusual for me, he made it very approachable and understandable.The characters were great. The ones I was rooting for I was REALLY rooting for. The ones that I despised I REALLY hated. When I get this invested in the characters, it is a sure sign of a great book!I will end with this warning: while a great and interesting book, it is, at times, difficult to read. There are situations and scenarios that are upsetting and may trigger lots of emotion. If you are extremely sensitive, it may be difficult to make it through. But, if you can, I think it will be worth it in the end.If you have not read this book yet, I think you should give it a try. The experience is very likely to be eye-opening and maybe even life-changing.",437,0.9513,0.088,0.782,0.131,0.6658249158249158,POSITIVE,0.9998
4,402938197,08/29/2012,4,"It was a warm, sunny day in Montenegro and I was about to set out on a boat trip. I felt certain that a combination of sightseeing and the people I was with would keep me from having much time to read, but I packed a book anyway just in case there was time for a chapter or two in between stops. A Thousand Splendid Suns happened to be that book. And at the end of the day, when I staggered off that boat, blinking at my sudden exposure to reality, it wasn't because I'd been mesmerised by the stunning architecture and history lessons, no, it was because Hosseini stomped all over my heart. I'm not even sure how I found enough hours in the day to take a boat trip around Montenegro and read this entire novel, but somehow I finished this in the few hours I had... simply because I had to.My initial reaction was a furious, teary promise to myself that I would have to give this book five stars - I think it's impossible for the mind to win a battle with the heart in that level of heat, especially when you're used to English weather. But afterwards, I managed to reclaim some of my sense and sanity, which is when I finally began to acknowledge this book's limitations. For one thing, I think it's extremely generous to place this book in the ""literary fiction"" category. I am certainly no book snob (give me a delicious page-turner over some pretentious waffle any day) but I find myself comparing A Thousand Splendid Suns to another book about a country and culture I was only vaguely familiar with - The Poisonwood Bible - a book which I also read on my trip. The latter is a far more complex, ambitious work that brings something which, to me, felt entirely fresh and original. Hosseini's story, on the other hand, is not groundbreaking and I recognise many of the scenes and characters from other books.What it is, however, is incredibly emotional, sad, uplifting, infuriating and memorable. It's lessons on the history of Afghanistan and the rise of the Taliban might be basic but they are nothing if not compelling. I came away feeling like I learned something. What I did learn was truly horrifying, it painted details into the very vague images I already had in my mind that I had gotten from various British newspapers. But I also really liked the affection for his birth country that shines through Hosseini's story; his faith in the ultimate goodness of these people who witnessed society and order crumbling around them.The ultimate tragedy of this story, for me, is how everything could have been very different for Mariam and Laila if people had just acted a little faster, stopped worrying about their pride a little earlier, and trusted a little more. I really liked the range of emotions both women experienced and they way the author showed this. I know some readers thought it was wrong for Mariam to be jealous of Laila at first, but I actually really liked the complexity. Rasheed may be a bastard but he was the only thing in the world that she had at that point, and on some level it made sense to me that she would want to claim him for herself.While I believe Mariam and Laila experienced complex emotions and were well-developed, Rasheed did not get the same treatment - a fact which I'm torn about. On the one hand, I think Rasheed would have been a better character if he'd been developed beyond him being the most villainous villain in all villaindom. On the other hand, I think Rasheed's evil personality offers an important distinction between him and Jalil (and the other men), one which is needed in a book that looks at the cruelties women suffer at the hands of men. The difference between Rasheed and Jalil is important. The latter is a man who acts badly because his behaviour is shaped by the society he lives in. Rasheed, on the other hand, is a mean and violent brute who completely abuses the power handed to him as a man in this society. These differences between Rasheed, Jalil and the other men (Tariq, Laila's dad, etc.) show there is not one type of man in this society, that wife-beating is not simply a part of the culture, that even in a patriarchal society you can choose what type of man you want to be.I admit this is far from a perfect book, but it is a good book. It's a book that seems to swallow you whole but spit you back out in pieces. And, just to mention, I keep intending to read The Kite Runner again because I think studying it at school ruined it for me, but so far, I much prefer A Thousand Splendid Suns.",430,0.9806,0.119,0.727,0.154,0.6072560425685424,POSITIVE,0.5002
5,47227372,02/22/2009,2,"It's apparently becoming something of a tradition for me to trash books that are not only widely loved and praised, but were specifically recommended to me by friends. Khaled Hosseini's ""A Thousand Splended Suns,"" I'm sorry to say, is going to get the same treatment. (Forgive me, Rose.) ""Splendid Suns"" has been so widely read by this point, I won't bother recounting the story, and instead simply list my objections:- Hosseini seems incapable of creating characters with much depth to them. E.M. Forster, in ""Aspects of the Novel,"" talks about books having round characters and flat characters, with round ones being more like people you'd encounter in the real world, and flat ones being more of caricatures used to move a book's story along. The only character in ""Splendid Suns"" who approaches roundness, and he's a relatively minor character, is Mariam's father, Jalil. Everyone else is either a villain without any positive traits (Rasheed) or a hero who can do almost no wrong (Laila, Tariq, Mullah Faizullah). Even when Hosseini is depicting a child who has every right to behave badly given his circumstances (Zalmai), he can't help but depict the child as almost evil. The New York Times review of ""Splendid Suns"" said Hosseini ""creates characters who have the simplicity and primary-colored emotions of people in a fairy tale or fable."" That's pretty generous of the New York Times. I'd say Hosseini may not be able to create three-dimensional characters.- While I appreciate Hosseini's attempt to teach a few decades of Afghan history -- a history few readers likely know in much detail -- grafting that history onto the story of one family makes for a rather creaky novel. To impart the history, Hosseini goes back and forth between giving the history through third-person narration, in Wikipedia-like prose, and putting it in his characers' mouths via dialogue -- dialogue often spoken to people who would already know the history. As a result, you sometimes get characters saying things like, ""As you know, the Taliban forces men to grow their beards long and women to wear burkas."" The cut-and-paste history lessons make the novel painful to read at times.- Hosseini routinely uses ""harami"" (bastard) and other words from the characters' native languages in his dialogue, followed by the English translation, apparently in an attempt to bring readers closer to the Afghan culture. But it usually feels incredibly superficial, especially when the words being used aren't foreign concepts, but rather basic words -- ""brother,"" ""sister"" and the like. Hosseini and his editors also seem to forget about the trope, and cut back on the use of the foreign words in the book's later chapters. I wish they had done the same throughout the book.- The relationship between Mariam and Laila feels completely artificial. Mariam's initial hate for and jealousy of Laila never feels remotely justified, especially given how awful her husband Rasheed is anyhow, and their coming together later feels rushed and unrealistic. Even after they form a friendship, they never seem to grow quite close enough to fully explain why Laila misses Mariam so much towards the novel's conclusion. Hosseini fails to lay the groundwork needed to justify Laila's emotions in the novel's last chapters.- Almost the entire book is unrelentingly bleak. Don't get me wrong, I understand Afghanistan wasn't exactly Disneyland over the past few decades, but I think there were more lighthearted moments in the Book of Job than in ""Splendid Suns."" I don't mind reading a depressing novel, but Jesus. Reading ""Splendid Suns,"" I kept thinking of that old workplace poster: ""The beatings will continue until morale improves.""I didn't completely hate ""Splendid Suns"" -- the story moved along nicely, and it gave me a little more insight into a culture I probably should know more about -- but I don't think I'll be following this one with ""The Kite Runner."" Khaled Hosseini probably doesn't need me as a reader, though. It seems he has plenty of fans.",399,0.9892,0.096,0.764,0.14,0.5389966573510877,NEGATIVE,0.9979
6,29678856,08/09/2008,4,"A Thousand Splendid Suns, Khaled HosseiniA Thousand Splendid Suns is a 2007 novel by Afghan-American author Khaled Hosseini. It is his second, following his bestselling 2003 debut, The Kite Runner. Mariam is an illegitimate child, and suffers from both the stigma surrounding her birth along with the abuse she faces throughout her marriage. Laila, born a generation later, is comparatively privileged during her youth until their lives intersect and she is also forced to accept a marriage proposal from Rasheed, Mariam's

8,65245266,07/28/2009,5,"A Thousand Splendid Suns, Khaled HosseiniA Thousand Splendid Suns is a 2007 novel by Afghan-American author Khaled Hosseini. It is his second, following his bestselling 2003 debut, The Kite Runner. Mariam is an illegitimate child, and suffers from both the stigma surrounding her birth along with the abuse she faces throughout her marriage. Laila, born a generation later, is comparatively privileged during her youth until their lives intersect and she is also forced to accept a marriage proposal from Rasheed, Mariam's husband. Hosseini has remarked that he regards the novel as a ""mother-daughter story"" in contrast to The Kite Runner, which he considers a ""father-son story"". It continues some of the themes used in his previous work, such as the familial aspects, but focuses primarily on female characters and their roles in Afghan society.ÿπŸÜŸàÿßŸÜŸáÿß€å ⁄ÜÿßŸæ ÿ¥ÿØŸá ÿØÿ± ÿß€åÿ±ÿßŸÜ: ¬´Ÿáÿ≤ÿßÿ± ÿÆŸàÿ±ÿ¥€åÿØ ÿØÿ±ÿÆÿ¥ÿßŸÜ¬ªÿõ ¬´Ÿáÿ≤ÿßÿ± ÿ¢ŸÅÿ™ÿßÿ® ÿ¥⁄ØŸÅÿ™ ÿßŸÜ⁄Ø€åÿ≤¬ªÿõ ¬´Ÿáÿ≤ÿßÿ± ÿÆŸàÿ±ÿ¥€åÿØ ÿ™ÿßÿ®ÿßŸÜ¬ªÿõ ¬´Ÿáÿ≤ÿßÿ±ÿßŸÜ ÿÆŸàÿ±ÿ¥€åÿØ ÿ™ÿßÿ®ÿßŸÜ¬ªÿõ ¬´Ÿáÿ≤ÿßÿ±ÿßŸÜ ÿÆŸàÿ±ÿ¥€åÿØ ÿØÿ±ÿÆÿ¥ÿßŸÜ¬ªÿõ ¬´Ÿáÿ≤ÿßÿ±ÿßŸÜ ÿÆŸàÿ±ÿ¥€åÿØ ŸÅÿ±Ÿàÿ≤ÿßŸÜ¬ªÿõ ¬´Ÿáÿ≤ÿßÿ± ÿÆŸàÿ±ÿ¥€åÿØ ÿ®ÿßÿ¥⁄©ŸàŸá¬ªÿõ ¬´Ÿáÿ≤ÿßÿ± ÿÆŸàÿ±ÿ¥€åÿØ ÿ±ÿÆÿ¥ÿßŸÜ¬ªÿõ ŸÜŸà€åÿ≥ŸÜÿØŸá: ÿÆÿßŸÑÿØ ÿ≠ÿ≥€åŸÜ€åÿõ ÿ™ÿßÿ±€åÿÆ ŸÜÿÆÿ≥ÿ™€åŸÜ ÿÆŸàÿßŸÜÿ¥: ŸÖÿßŸá ŸÅŸàÿ±€åŸá ÿ≥ÿßŸÑ 2007ŸÖ€åŸÑÿßÿØ€å Ÿà ÿ®ÿßÿ± ÿØ€å⁄Øÿ± ÿØÿ± ŸÖÿßŸá ÿß⁄©ÿ™ÿ®ÿ± ÿ≥ÿßŸÑ 2008ŸÖ€åŸÑÿßÿØ€åÿπŸÜŸàÿßŸÜ: Ÿáÿ≤ÿßÿ± ÿÆŸàÿ±ÿ¥€åÿØ ÿØÿ±ÿÆÿ¥ÿßŸÜÿõ ŸÜŸà€åÿ≥ŸÜÿØŸá: ÿÆÿßŸÑÿØ ÿ≠ÿ≥€åŸÜ€åÿõ ŸÖÿ™ÿ±ÿ¨ŸÖ: ÿ®€åÿ™ÿß ⁄©ÿßÿ∏ŸÖ€åÿõ ÿ™Ÿáÿ±ÿßŸÜÿå ÿ®ÿßÿ∫ ŸÜŸàÿå 1386ÿõ ÿØÿ± 461ÿµÿõ ÿ¥ÿßÿ®⁄© 9789647425384ÿõ ŸÖŸàÿ∂Ÿàÿπ: ÿØÿßÿ≥ÿ™ÿßŸÜŸáÿß€å ŸÜŸà€åÿ≥ŸÜÿØ⁄ØÿßŸÜ ÿßŸÅÿ∫ÿßŸÜ€å ÿ™ÿ®ÿßÿ± ÿßŸÖÿ±€å⁄©ÿß€å€å - ÿ≥ÿØŸá 21ŸÖÿπŸÜŸàÿßŸÜ: Ÿáÿ≤ÿßÿ± ÿÆŸàÿ±ÿ¥€åÿØ ÿ±ÿÆÿ¥ÿßŸÜÿõ ŸÜŸà€åÿ≥ŸÜÿØŸá: ÿÆÿßŸÑÿØ ÿ≠ÿ≥€åŸÜ€åÿõ ŸÖÿ™ÿ±ÿ¨ŸÖ: ÿ≤ÿßŸÖ€åÿßÿØ ÿ≥ÿπÿØŸàŸÜÿØ€åÿßŸÜÿõ ÿ™Ÿáÿ±ÿßŸÜÿå ŸÜ⁄Øÿßÿ±ÿ≥ÿ™ÿßŸÜ ⁄©ÿ™ÿßÿ®ÿå 1387ÿõ ÿØÿ± 488ÿµÿõ ÿ¥ÿßÿ®⁄© 9789648155297ÿõ ÿπŸÜŸàÿßŸÜ: Ÿáÿ≤ÿßÿ± ÿÆŸàÿ±ÿ¥€åÿØ ÿ™ÿßÿ®ÿßŸÜÿõ ŸÜŸà€åÿ≥ŸÜÿØŸá: ÿÆÿßŸÑÿØ ÿ≠ÿ≥€åŸÜ€åÿõ ŸÖÿ™ÿ±ÿ¨ŸÖ: Ÿæÿ±€åÿ≥ÿß ÿ≥ŸÑ€åŸÖÿßŸÜÿ≤ÿßÿØŸá ÿßÿ±ÿØÿ®€åŸÑ€åÿõ ÿ≤€åÿ®ÿß ⁄ØŸÜÿ¨€åÿõ ÿ™Ÿáÿ±ÿßŸÜÿå ŸÖÿ±Ÿàÿßÿ±€åÿØÿå 1386ÿõ ÿØÿ± 451ÿµÿõ ÿ¥ÿßÿ®⁄© 9789648831879ÿõ ⁄ÜÿßŸæ ÿØŸàŸÖ Ÿà ÿ≥ŸàŸÖ 1387ÿõ ŸæŸÜÿ¨ŸÖ 1388ÿõ ÿ¥ÿ¥ŸÖ 1389ÿõ ÿπŸÜŸàÿßŸÜ: Ÿáÿ≤ÿßÿ± ÿÆŸàÿ±ÿ¥€åÿØ ÿ™ÿßÿ®ÿßŸÜÿõ ŸÜŸà€åÿ≥ŸÜÿØŸá: ÿÆÿßŸÑÿØ ÿ≠ÿ≥€åŸÜ€åÿõ ŸÖÿ™ÿ±ÿ¨ŸÖ: ÿ¢ÿ≤ÿßÿØŸá ÿ¥ŸáŸæÿ±€åÿõ ÿ™Ÿáÿ±ÿßŸÜÿå ŸÖÿßŸáÿßÿ®Ÿáÿå 1393ÿõ ÿØÿ± 428ÿµÿõ ÿ¥ÿßÿ®⁄© 9786005205503ÿõ ÿπŸÜŸàÿßŸÜ: Ÿáÿ≤ÿßÿ± ÿÆŸàÿ±ÿ¥€åÿØ ÿ™ÿßÿ®ÿßŸÜÿõ ŸÜŸà€åÿ≥ŸÜÿØŸá: ÿÆÿßŸÑÿØ ÿ≠ÿ≥€åŸÜ€åÿõ ŸÖÿ™ÿ±ÿ¨ŸÖ: ÿ≠ŸÖ€åÿØÿ±ÿ∂ÿß ÿ®ŸÑŸà⁄Üÿõ ÿ™Ÿáÿ±ÿßŸÜÿå ÿ®Ÿá ÿ≥ÿÆŸÜÿå 1394ÿõ ÿØÿ± 407ÿµÿõ ÿ¥ÿßÿ®⁄© 9786009484492ÿõ ÿπŸÜŸàÿßŸÜ: Ÿáÿ≤ÿßÿ± ÿÆŸàÿ±ÿ¥€åÿØ ÿ®ÿßÿ¥⁄©ŸàŸáÿõ ŸÜŸà€åÿ≥ŸÜÿØŸá: ÿÆÿßŸÑÿØ ÿ≠ÿ≥€åŸÜ€åÿõ ŸÖÿ™ÿ±ÿ¨ŸÖ: ÿß€åÿ±ÿ¨ ŸÖÿ´ÿßŸÑ ÿ¢ÿ∞ÿ±ÿõ ÿ™Ÿáÿ±ÿßŸÜÿå ÿØÿ± ÿØÿßŸÜÿ¥ ÿ®ŸáŸÖŸÜÿå 1386ÿõ ÿØÿ± 464ÿµÿõ ÿ¥ÿßÿ®⁄© 9789641740070ÿõ ⁄ÜÿßŸæ ÿØŸàŸÖ 1387ÿõÿπŸÜŸàÿßŸÜ: Ÿáÿ≤ÿßÿ± ÿÆŸàÿ±ÿ¥€åÿØ ÿ®ÿßÿ¥⁄©ŸàŸáÿõ ŸÜŸà€åÿ≥ŸÜÿØŸá: ÿÆÿßŸÑÿØ ÿ≠ÿ≥€åŸÜ€åÿõ ŸÖÿ™ÿ±ÿ¨ŸÖ: ŸÜÿßŸá€åÿØ ÿ≥ŸÑÿßŸÖ€åÿõ ÿ™Ÿáÿ±ÿßŸÜÿå ŸÜÿ¥ÿ± ⁄Üÿ¥ŸÖŸáÿå 1386ÿõ ÿØÿ± 433ÿµÿõ ÿ¥ÿßÿ®⁄© 9789643623920ÿõ ÿπŸÜŸàÿßŸÜ: Ÿáÿ≤ÿßÿ±ÿßŸÜ ÿÆŸàÿ±ÿ¥€åÿØ ŸÅÿ±Ÿàÿ≤ÿßŸÜÿõ ŸÜŸà€åÿ≥ŸÜÿØŸá: ÿÆÿßŸÑÿØ ÿ≠ÿ≥€åŸÜ€åÿõ ŸÖÿ™ÿ±ÿ¨ŸÖ: ŸÅ€åÿ±Ÿàÿ≤Ÿá ŸÖŸÇÿØŸÖ (ÿπÿßÿ®ÿØ€å)ÿõ ÿ™Ÿáÿ±ÿßŸÜÿå ŸÜÿ¥ÿ± ÿ™Ÿáÿ±ÿßŸÜÿå 1389ÿõ ÿØÿ± 487ÿµÿõ ÿ¥ÿßÿ®⁄© 9789642911158ÿõ ÿπŸÜŸàÿßŸÜ: Ÿáÿ≤ÿßÿ±ÿßŸÜ ÿÆŸàÿ±ÿ¥€åÿØ ÿØÿ±ÿÆÿ¥ÿßŸÜÿõ ŸÜŸà€åÿ≥ŸÜÿØŸá: ÿÆÿßŸÑÿØ ÿ≠ÿ≥€åŸÜ€åÿõ ŸÖÿ™ÿ±ÿ¨ŸÖ: ÿ≥ŸÖ€åŸá ⁄ØŸÜÿ¨€åÿõ ÿ≥ÿßÿ±€åÿå ÿ≤Ÿáÿ±Ÿáÿå 1386ÿõ ÿØÿ± 447ÿµÿõ ÿ¥ÿßÿ®⁄© 9789642981038ÿõ ÿπŸÜŸàÿßŸÜ: Ÿáÿ≤ÿßÿ±ÿßŸÜ ÿÆŸàÿ±ÿ¥€åÿØ ÿ™ÿßÿ®ÿßŸÜÿõ ŸÜŸà€åÿ≥ŸÜÿØŸá: ÿÆÿßŸÑÿØ ÿ≠ÿ≥€åŸÜ€åÿõ ŸÖÿ™ÿ±ÿ¨ŸÖ: ŸÖ⁄ò⁄ØÿßŸÜ ÿßÿ≠ŸÖÿØ€åÿõ ÿ™Ÿáÿ±ÿßŸÜÿå ÿ®Ÿáÿ≤ÿßÿØÿå 1389ÿõ ÿØÿ± 320ÿµÿõ ÿ¥ÿßÿ®⁄© 9789642569939ÿõ ÿπŸÜŸàÿßŸÜ: Ÿáÿ≤ÿßÿ±ÿßŸÜ ÿ¢ŸÅÿ™ÿßÿ® ÿ¥⁄ØŸÅÿ™ ÿßŸÜ⁄Ø€åÿ≤ÿõ ŸÜŸà€åÿ≥ŸÜÿØŸá: ÿÆÿßŸÑÿØ ÿ≠ÿ≥€åŸÜ€åÿõ ŸÖÿ™ÿ±ÿ¨ŸÖ: ŸÖŸÜ€å⁄òŸá ÿ¥€åÿÆ ÿ¨ŸàÿßÿØ€å (ÿ®Ÿáÿ≤ÿßÿØ)ÿõ ÿ™Ÿáÿ±ÿßŸÜÿå Ÿæ€å⁄©ÿßŸÜÿå 1386ÿõ ÿØÿ± 432ÿµÿõ ÿ¥ÿßÿ®⁄© 9789643285623ÿõ ŸÜÿßŸÖ Ÿà ÿπŸÜŸàÿßŸÜ ⁄©ÿ™ÿßÿ® ÿßÿ≤ ÿß€åŸÜ ÿ¥ÿπÿ± ÿ®ÿ±⁄Øÿ±ŸÅÿ™Ÿá ÿ¥ÿØŸá: ¬´ÿ≠ÿ≥ÿßÿ® ŸÖŸá ÿ¨ÿ®€åŸÜÿßŸÜ ŸÑÿ® ÿ®ÿßŸÖÿ¥ ⁄©Ÿá ŸÖ€åÿØÿßŸÜÿØÿü ÿØŸàÿµÿØ ÿÆŸàÿ±ÿ¥€åÿØÿ±Ÿà ÿßŸÅÿ™ÿßÿØŸá ÿ®ÿ±ÿå Ÿáÿ± Ÿæÿß€å ÿØ€åŸàÿßÿ±ÿ¥¬ªÿõ ÿ®€åÿ™ ÿ±ÿß ¬´ÿµÿßÿ¶ÿ® ÿ™ÿ®ÿ±€åÿ≤€å¬ª ÿØÿ± ŸàÿµŸÅ ¬´⁄©ÿßÿ®ŸÑ¬ª ÿ≥ÿ±ŸàÿØŸá ÿßÿ≥ÿ™ÿßÿ≤ ŸÖÿ™ŸÜ ⁄©ÿ™ÿßÿ® (¬´ÿ¨ŸÑ€åŸÑ¬ª ÿ®ÿß ÿÆŸÜÿØŸá ÿ®ÿ±ÿß€åÿ¥ ÿØÿßÿ≥ÿ™ÿßŸÜ ¬´ŸÖŸÑ⁄©Ÿá ⁄ØŸàŸáÿ±ÿ¥ÿßÿØ¬ª ÿ±ÿß ÿ™ÿπÿ±€åŸÅ ŸÖ€å⁄©ÿ±ÿØÿå ⁄©Ÿá ŸÖŸÜÿßÿ±Ÿá Ÿáÿß€å ŸÖÿ¥ŸáŸàÿ± ¬´Ÿáÿ±ÿßÿ™¬ª ÿ±ÿß ÿØÿ± ŸÇÿ±ŸÜ ŸæÿßŸÜÿ≤ÿØŸáŸÖ ŸÖ€åŸÑÿßÿØ€åÿå ÿ®Ÿá ÿπŸÜŸàÿßŸÜ ⁄Ü⁄©ÿßŸÖŸá ÿß€å ÿßÿ≤ ÿπÿ¥ŸÇ ÿÆŸàÿØ ÿ®Ÿá ÿ¢ŸÜ ÿØ€åÿßÿ± ÿ®ŸÜÿß ⁄©ÿ±ÿØŸá ÿ®ŸàÿØÿå ÿßŸà ÿ®ÿ±ÿß€åÿ¥ ÿßÿ≤ ⁄ØŸÜÿØŸÖÿ≤ÿßÿ±Ÿáÿß€å ÿ≥ÿ®ÿ≤ ¬´Ÿáÿ±ÿßÿ™¬ª Ÿà ÿ®ÿßÿ∫Ÿáÿß€å ŸÖ€åŸàŸáÿå ÿ™ÿß⁄©ÿ≥ÿ™ÿßŸÜŸáÿß€å€å ⁄©Ÿá ÿ¢ÿ®ÿ≥ÿ™ŸÜ ÿ¥ÿßÿÆŸá Ÿáÿß€å Ÿæÿ±ÿ®ÿßÿ± ÿßŸÜ⁄ØŸàÿ± ÿ®ŸàÿØŸÜÿØÿå ÿ®ÿßÿ≤ÿßÿ±Ÿáÿß€å Ÿæÿ± ÿßÿ≤ÿØÿ≠ÿßŸÖ Ÿà ÿ¥ŸÑŸàÿ∫ ÿ®ÿß ÿ≥ŸÇŸÅŸáÿß€å ÿ®ŸÑŸÜÿØ Ÿà ŸÖÿ≠ÿ±ÿßÿ®€åÿ¥ÿßŸÜ ⁄ØŸÅÿ™Ÿá ÿ®ŸàÿØÿõ €å⁄© ÿ±Ÿàÿ≤ ¬´ÿ¨ŸÑ€åŸÑ¬ª ⁄ØŸÅÿ™: €å⁄© ÿØÿ±ÿÆÿ™ Ÿæÿ≥ÿ™Ÿá Ÿáÿ≥ÿ™ ¬´ŸÖÿ±€åŸÖ¬ª ÿ¨ÿßŸÜÿå ⁄©Ÿá ÿ≤€åÿ± ÿ¢ŸÜ ⁄©ÿ≥€å ÿ¨ÿ≤ ¬´ÿ¨ÿßŸÖ€å¬ªÿå ÿ¥ÿßÿπÿ± ÿ®ÿ≤ÿ±⁄Ø ŸÜÿÆŸàÿßÿ®€åÿØŸá ÿßÿ≥ÿ™ÿå Ÿæÿ≥ ÿßÿ≤ ÿ¢ŸÜ ¬´ÿ¨ŸÑ€åŸÑ¬ª ÿÆŸÖ ÿ¥ÿØ Ÿà ÿ≤ŸÖÿ≤ŸÖŸá ⁄©ÿ±ÿØ: ¬´ÿ¨ÿßŸÖ€å¬ª ŸæÿßŸÜÿµÿØ ÿ≥ÿßŸÑ Ÿæ€åÿ¥ ÿ≤ŸÜÿØ⁄Ø€å ŸÖ€å⁄©ÿ±ÿØÿõ ÿ®ŸÑŸáÿõ €å⁄©ÿ®ÿßÿ± ÿ™ÿ±ÿß ÿ®Ÿá ÿ¢ŸÜÿ¨ÿß ÿ®ÿ±ÿØŸá ÿßŸÖÿå Ÿæ€åÿ¥ ÿ¢ŸÜ ÿØÿ±ÿÆÿ™ÿå ÿßŸÖÿß ÿ™Ÿà ⁄©Ÿà⁄Ü⁄© ÿ®ŸàÿØ€å Ÿà €åÿßÿØÿ™ ŸÜŸÖ€åÿ¢€åÿØ)ÿõ Ÿæÿß€åÿßŸÜ ŸÜŸÇŸÑ ÿßÿ≤ ŸÖÿ™ŸÜÿ™ÿßÿ±€åÿÆ ÿ®ŸáŸÜ⁄ØÿßŸÖ ÿ±ÿ≥ÿßŸÜ€å 08/07/1399Ÿáÿ¨ÿ±€å ÿÆŸàÿ±ÿ¥€åÿØ€åÿõ 20/05/1400Ÿáÿ¨ÿ±€å ÿÆŸàÿ±ÿ¥€åÿØ€åÿõ ÿß. ÿ¥ÿ±ÿ®€åÿßŸÜ€å",256,0.4939,0.012,0.967,0.021,0.3833333333333333,POSITIVE,0.9953
9,32775607,09/13/2008,2,"To my editor:Khaled here. As I was reviewing my final draft of ‚ÄúA Thousand Splendid Suns,‚Äù some questions occurred to me.1. Could I make the characters any less complex? Despite my efforts, I feel I haven‚Äôt fully achieved the one-dimensionality my readers seemed to love in ‚ÄúThe Kite Runner.‚Äù Specifically, I‚Äôm afraid I may have given Rassan one or two potentially sympathetic moments early on despite his overall abusive personality (although I more than make up for it). I don‚Äôt know whether my readers can handle that level of complexity. Fortunately, aside from that minor lapse with Rassan, I think I managed to keep my characters and their relationships pretty simplistic, although there‚Äôs always room for improvement in that regard!2. Do you think I included enough graphic violent scenes, or should I add another ten or so?3. Are my characters stereotypical enough?4. Pretty clever the way I stuffed the facts of recent Afghani history into my characters‚Äô dialogue whenever I could, don‚Äôtcha think?5. Speaking of dialogue, I‚Äôm wondering whether I can inject a little more of my agenda into the characters‚Äô conversation or introspection, or maybe structure the plot around it a little more. Any ideas?6. Isn‚Äôt it great that Afghanistan is such a hot topic that mediocre writers like me can make a buck by pandering to people‚Äôs intellectual pretensions?With hopes for another bestseller, Khaled ",242,0.9892,0.016,0.813,0.171,0.6016129032258065,NEGATIVE,0.9855

"" One could not count the moons that shimmer on her roofs,Or the thousand splendid suns that hide behind her walls."" 
There are very few books that make me feel a tempest of emotions: make me happy and proud at one moment and break my heart in the next; make me chuckle at a few scenes and leave me in tears later, make me love a few characters and hate the others- and this is one such book.The novel focuses on the life of two Afghan women-Mariam and Laila who come from different walks of life. Laila enjoys her school life, and is absorbed by the thoughts of her crush Tariq. She's beautiful, confident, smart, strong and playful. Mariam, on the the other hand is the illegitimate daughter of a businessman  Jalil . She faces a lot of social problems and rejection but she is headstrong and the real  hero  of the story.  About Jalil well, I had a lot of mixed opinions: marrying Mariam off to Rasheed made me feel disgusted, but the (view spoiler)[ emotional letter he wrote at the last  (hide spoiler)] took me by surprise.The characters in the book struggle for their survival in a harsh and obstinate society: They are wounded due to wars, relationships get tough and abusive, their property is destroyed; despite all this, they stick together, which is something I admired. But the  best  part about this book is the way Mariam and Laila show relentless pursuit and resilience and face all obstacles, especially considering how women are treated in their place- it filled me with pride and I was in love with their headstrongness. I was hooked, right from the first chapter. This book was pretty much like a rollercoaster- I felt a surge of emotions- anger, remorse and joy coursing through my veins with every passing chapter and I kept turning the pages to know more and before I had an inkling about it, I was done. The story was enticing, the narration was flawless, each chapter had a twist so intriguing I was compelled to read it multiple times.My heart beat fast reading about he struggles faced my Mariam and Laila and the ending just got so heartbreaking I was almost in tears. I have humongous respect for Khaled Hosseini and I'm looking forward to reading more of his books.",218,0.8884,0.14,0.692,0.169,0.5250052910052909,POSITIVE,0.9993

‚Äò‚ÄôLearn this now and learn it well, my daughter. Like a compass needle that points north, a man‚Äôs accusing finger always finds a woman. Always.‚Äô‚Äô

‚Äò‚ÄôThis is what it means to be a woman in this world.‚Äô‚Äô
It is difficult, so difficult to read a book you don‚Äôt want to touch. A book that gnaws at your heart and spits out the pieces with glee. Because even though you know the truth, you don‚Äôt want to face it. You are not ready, you are not prepared. You refuse to ‚Äò‚Äôlive‚Äô‚Äô in a world that jumps from the pages, so eloquently depicted, so horrifying and tangible. You refuse to believe that there are still parts in the world where women‚Äôs value is lower than a speck of dust, a drop of urine. You refuse to face the reality of a world where Rasheeds and Jalils exist instead of being torn apart and thrown to the dogs.Words are cheap when it comes to this novel. Every literary remark is void and pretentious. And the road is still too long. This is living Hell‚Ä¶
‚Äò‚ÄôWhere I come from, one wrong look, one improper word, and blood is spilled. Where I come from, a woman‚Äôs face is her husband‚Äôs business only.‚Äô‚Äô

‚Äò‚ÄôYou will not, under any circumstances, show your face. You will cover with burqua when outside. If you do not, you will be severely beaten.Cosmetics are forbidden. Jewellery is forbidden.You will not wear charming clothes.You will not speak unless spoken to.You will not make eye contact with men.You will not laugh in public. If you do, you will be beaten.You will not paint your nails. If you do, you will lose a finger.Girls are forbidden from attending school.

Always. You remember that, Mariam.""This story chronicles 30 years of Afghan history; from Soviet invasion, to the Taliban, to post-Taliban. This story is told from the perspective of two women; born a generation apart, with different ideas of love and family, two very different childhoods, they are bought together by loss and by war. This story shows both the dangers that Mariam and Laila face- on the streets of Kabul and in the home. This story shows the important bond of friendship, and how strong this is especially when faced with difficult decisions or scenarios, and how this bond of love will effect the next generation.""Where I come from, one wrong look... and blood is spilled. Where I come from, a woman's face is her husband's business only I want you to remember that.""My heart bled for Mariam's childhood. She held little freedom and was sheltered from most of the outside world. She knew very few people as well and had a mother who refused help for a mental illness (labeling it as the jinn taking over her body). Mariam had little luxuries and was denied an education by those around her... These exact things that most of us take for-granted. On the other hand, Laila had siblings and a father that absolutely adored her. She also had friends her own age with whom she truly cherished, and had the privilege of an education.However, both women's lives are brought together through tumultuous events, leading them to both have the same fate and live in a very unhappy household, where abuse and violence takes place at the hands of their controlling husband, Rasheed.Laila never would have believed that a human body could withstand this much beating, this viciously, this regularly, and keep functioning.The level of control and subordination of these women shocked me. Reading parts of this book left a stale taste in my mouth over the abuse and learned helplessness these women face.Singing is forbidden. Dancing is forbidden. Attention women: You will stay inside your homes at all times.. if you go outside you must be accompanied by a male relative. You will not, under any circumstance show your face.... Girls are forbidden from attending school. All schools for girls will be closed immediately.Hosseini does a fantastic job at describing the rules that both men and women face under Taliban rule, and Shari'a law. It's almost hard to believe the inequality and the restriction of freedom the women in this story faced- it made me feel like my stomach had plummeted to my feet... It also made me incredibly angry, my fists curling on more than one occasion. On the whole, this book is extremely thought-provoking and not easy to digest, however, it also inflames the human body with emotion; heart-breaking, heart-clenching and the story hits you like punches to the gut. This book will resonate with some people who have lived through war-torn countries or under the terrifying Taliban rule, or, as in my case, it will be a learning experience. For example, learning Afghan history and the shifts in the treatment of women culturally. It also makes the reader consider their own privilege compared to the stories of both Laila and Mariam. I think the most stunning thing about this novel is that whilst Mariam and Laila are fictional characters, it applies to so many women out there (for example, around 65 million girls globally are not in school). Hosseini may be writing fictional characters, but these are the stories of an army of resilient and brave women who have lived and breathed this life. He makes the reader aware.This book provided devastation and loss, as well as hope and love and beauty. Hosseini approaches the plot in a very realistic way and it is written beautifully. This is an unforgettable read for me and the stories of Laila and Mariam will stay with me for a while.One could not count the moons that shimmer on her roofs,Or the thousand splendid suns that hide behind her walls.",182,0.9863,0.075,0.811,0.114,0.5591839641839643,POSITIVE,0.9444

‚Äòthey would make new lives for themselves - peaceful, solitary lives - and there the weight of all that they had endured would lift from them, and they would be deserving of all the happiness and simple prosperity they would find.‚Äô
what a beautiful sentiment, that trials and suffering can help lead up to something more - more hope, more happiness. this story is a testament to the will-power and resilience of women, as well as a wonderful portrayal of friendship, family, and love. such a powerful book and a must-read for everyone. ‚Ü† 4.5 stars",180,0.9957,0.073,0.616,0.311,0.6278040141676505,POSITIVE,0.9991

18,3161731,07/17/2007,4,"Suns is part historical fiction, part social commentary and part kick-in-the-throat storytelling. A friend of mine said that Suns is a metaphor for Afghanistan but I found it illustrative of Afghanistan's weary and violent history; I found it brutally educational. When I had studied in Germany in 1987, I lived in an international dormitory. I asked my neighbor, Hyder, where he was from, he leaned in to me with a devilish grin and hissed ‚ÄúAfghanistan!‚Äù While others found this amusing, the effect was completely lost on me; I had no perspective at the time and was completely clueless of both international and domestic politics.Although not as gripping and revelatory as Kit Runner, this novel certainly packs punches that will knock the literary wind out of you. Khaled tells us the story of two women and their struggles for life in a society that thinks they should not live. What I find ironic about such societies is the obvious struggle between valuing women as life givers while depleting their worth because they are not men. What I love about Suns is that Khaled does not once point out the obvious sociopolitical conundrums of these ridiculous and ill-founded attitudes. Khaled tells these women's story and leaves the reader to wince, tear up and sigh; one time I had to catch my breath.I really enjoy Mr. Housseini‚Äôs transportive narrative and I was entirely engulfed in the lives of his characters.

20,1546894636,02/13/2016,5,"  Each snowflake was a sigh heard by an aggrieved woman somewhere in the world. All the sighs drifted up the sky, gathered into clouds, then broke into tiny pieces that fell silently on the people below. As a reminder of how women suffer.  Poignant, stunning, and impossibly heartrending, A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS was one of the best and most meaningful books I've read because it embodies all the themes and values regarding gender identity and disparity that has been much debated by society for a long time. It reminds me every day that in a world full of prejudice, there is still beauty. That in a world full of hatred, there is still selflessness. That in a world full of suffering, there is still hope.I'd like to start off by saying that I absolutely loved this book. With every page I read my heart was in my mouth and my stomach felt like it would drop to my shoes any moment. But I loved this book. I loved this book. It is a beautiful and enlightening story filled to the brim with hope, even beneath its painful, heart-wrenching emotional rawness. How strange, because this was a book where I dared not to turn the page, but I kept flipping and breaking my own heart anyway.   ‚ÄúA man's heart is a wretched, wretched thing. It isn't like a mother's womb. It won't bleed. It won't stretch to make room for you.‚Äù  A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS tells of the oppression of women in Afghanistan and the injustice with which they are treated -- of how their only way to social status and approval is to bear a male heir. Mariam, one of the main characters, is one of the saddest characters in literature. Born a bastard child to a very wealthy man, she has faced being called ""harami"" (an insult) her whole life, been shunned and discriminated and thought of as ignorant and worthless, even by her own birth father and her family. Finally, she is married off to a man named Rasheed, who is violent, rude, abusive and just plain mean (honestly, I wanted to kick him in the face throughout the whole book). He sees her only as a tool for breeding his heirs and mistreats, r*pes and severely abuses her, when it is found out that she is sterile.But despite life being, for the most part, unfair to her, and despite facing nothing but hardship her whole life, Mariam's personality is so beautiful that it completely broke my heart. Unfazed by the betrayal of almost everyone she knows and the misfortune that she is constantly granted, Mariam remains resigned, but most of all an extremely resilient, selfless, humble, and kind person. When Rasheed takes a second wife, Laila, the two women despise each other at first, but soon unite against their husband's verbal and physical and emotional abuse. Mariam, being self-sacrificial, often tried to protect Laila and bore the brunt of Rasheed's anger.The book ended in the most heartbreaking way possible and yet it was so fitting to Mariam's utterly stoic, compassionate and sacrificial personality that I just sat there and bawled. I couldn't help it. I somehow knew in my bones that Mariam would make the ultimate sacrifice - (view spoiler)[ to turn herself in to the Taliban and be sentenced to death so that Laila and her children could go free and find happiness with Laila's soul mate, Tariq. I loved Mariam then, loved her because she was a flower even with all the acid that life had thrown at her; she'd never let her kindness wilt, and at the end she was thinking of not her own, but Laila's happiness. I didn't stop crying for days.   Mariam wished for so much in those final moments. Yet as she closed her eyes, it was not regret any longer but a sensation of abundant peace that washed over her. She thought of her entry into this world, the harami child of a lowly villager, an unintended thing, a pitiable, regrettable accident. A weed. And yet she was leaving the world as a woman who had loved and been loved back. She was leaving it as a friend, a companion, a guardian. A mother. A person of consequence at last. No. It was not so bad, Mariam thought, that she should die this way. Not so bad. This was a legitimate end to a life of illegitimate beginnings.   (hide spoiler)]Suffice it to say that I was a complete wreck after reading this. I'm still a complete wreck. I thought at first that A Thousand Splendid Suns would be a book of brutality and depression - but it is not. It is an unabashed display of the beauty of the human spirit, and the resilient strength of the two female main characters in this story made me truly realise that what defines a woman are her actions and values, and nothing else. When I turned the last page it occurred to me that this story is as much a reflection of the strength that women are capable of as it is a tale of hope; a tale of how flowers can grow even in the most barren cracks, and hearts find ways to connect even amidst a brutal regime and a country torn apart by war.  ""Like a compass needle that points north, a man's accusing finger always finds a woman. Always.""  ",140,0.9202,0.149,0.687,0.164,0.5850996376811594,POSITIVE,0.9996
21,510847248,01/19/2013,5,"I started this book with high expectations. I had been overwhelmed with every conceivable emotion when I read the ‚ÄúKite Runner‚Äù and just couldn‚Äôt believe that his second book, ‚ÄúA Thousand Splendid Suns‚Äù, could possibly be as good.So it was with trepidation and yet excitement that I read this book. I had left the last dozen or so pages to read until the following morning, as I didn‚Äôt want to quite let it go, and as I sat there at 7 a.m. on the terrace, with a cup of coffee in my hand, I slowly finished the book. I breathed in deeply on reading the final sentence and looked down the valley, past the foothills at the Pic d‚ÄôAnie, part of the magnificent Pyrenean mountain chain. The sun would be rising over the hills within the hour as I looked in the direction of Afghanistan, wondering how many Moslems had already prayed that morning in the mosques, with their prayer mats facing towards Makkah in Saudi Arabia.This book was an extraordinary, contemporary, social document covering Afghan history from before the Soviet war until after the Taliban rule. The violence that ensued from this period in time resulted in the inevitable violence towards women. I abhor any form of violence and live in fear what will happen should another war occur. To see in what low-esteem and contempt the average Afghan viewed women, especially the Taliban, quite shocked me, and yet I ‚Äúlived and breathed‚Äù this book. Women were worth nothing.I think the reason this book had such a profound effect on me was due to living in Saudi Arabia for sixteen years and I could relate to a certain extent to what the women had to endure. Under the Qur‚Äôan, men were entitled to have up to four wives, and they were supposed to treat them all equally. Then a man could just arbitrarily state ‚ÄúI divorce thee‚Äù three times and that was the end of the marriage. Many women were just cast out from the family home and led a miserable existence begging on the streets. What was remarkable about these women, however, was their instinct for survival and they still managed to laugh and joke. The author‚Äôs own words were concise and to the point of life in Afghanistan at that time:‚ÄúFor almost three decades now, the Afghan refugee crisis has been one of the most severe around the globe. War, hunger, anarchy and oppression forced millions of people‚Ä¶‚Ä¶to abandon their homes and flee Afghanistan to settle in neighboring Pakistan and Iran.‚ÄùThe book is basically the powerful story of two women, Mariam and Laila, whose lives become indelibly linked because of three men: Jalil, Tariq and Rasheed.Mariam was the illegitimate daughter of Jalil, living with her mother Nana in an isolated place outside of Herat. She really loves her father and decides that she wishes to live with him instead of her mother, with disastrous consequences; the upshot being that Mariam is forced to become the wife of Rasheed in Kabul.Laila is a good childhood friend of Tariq and they finally fall in love with far reaching results when Tariq leaves with his family for Pakistan. Laila, who‚Äôs a great survivor, and philosophical, as is Mariam, then becomes Rasheed‚Äôs wife.For the two women, life with Rasheed becomes a living hell. I kept on thinking, I just want something really evil to happen to this despicable creature (I have worse thoughts than that but best to keep quiet on that and not write them down).In reality Tariq, the childhood friend of Laila, is the catalyst in the book. I really admired him, he was my favorite character, and he was brilliantly portrayed.The writing style is simple as far as I‚Äôm concerned and there is an over excess of violence. However, the attention for detail is remarkable and this runs throughout the book: When Laila is recovering at Rasheed‚Äôs home after a bomb attack, Mariam sees a complete and utter change in her husband. He becomes unusually kind and gentle, and he is seen to be courting Laila.The humiliation of both Mariam and Laila at having to wear the burqa, thus putting them into insignificance to the outside world; the husband being the only person allowed to look upon their faces.The incident when Rasheed ‚Äúmakes love‚Äù to Laila for the first time. She to all intents and purposes is a virgin. She has a knife, cuts her finger and leaves some blood on the bed under where they were sleeping.Laila cooking a rather bad meal for Rasheed and the end results with the stones.Laila, Mariam and Rasheed with the shovel. This nearly blew my mind.Mariam in jail, refusing to see anyone, and then her journey to the football stadium. I had the most incredible feeling of time just stopping at this point and had great difficulty in turning the page. But then this happened to me on innumerable occasions throughout this wonderful book.I‚Äôm always intrigued with the titles of books and this one was no exception. This originated from a poem written by Saib-e-Tabrizi in the 17th century and is quoted by Laila‚Äôs father Babi when the family had decided to leave Kabul. He could, however, only remember these two lines:‚ÄúOne could not count the moons that shimmer on her roofs,Or the thousand splendid suns that hide behind her walls.‚ÄùI just absolutely loved this book. However, I‚Äôm not happy having purely the Kindle version and so I‚Äôve ordered the hardback. I still get more pleasure from a book.And I have Khaled Hosseini‚Äôs third book to look forward to in a few months: ‚ÄúAnd the Mountains Echoed‚Äù. Can this be even better? Is that possible?

The Plot Mariam, the unwanted child of Jalil, lives with her Grandmother until her death and is then sent to live with her natural father and his many wives and children. Rejected and spurned from this new family, at fifteen, she is betrothed to marry a man many years her senior, Rasheed a business associate of her father.

Yet there are no protestations of love for either women and as a bully, an abuser and violent man he hides behind his status in society to inflict unimaginable mental and physical cruelty on his wives. In a society that offers them no protection and importantly no voice, they decide to take matters into their own hands, and either escape from Rasheed or kill him, and as such they make a decision that neither women will regret but one that will have devastating consequences.‚ÄúOne could not count the moons that shimmer on her roofs, Or the thousand splendid suns that hide behind her walls.‚Äù, because to live with their husband was to not live at all. Review and CommentsA Thousand Splendid Suns was a brilliant but heart-breaking story, the writing was stunning, and the plot treat was inspired by true events was fantastic. The characterisation although fictional was believable and authentic. However, it was the inspiration and knowledge that the mistreatment of women is commonplace is what made this such a tearful read. Women in many societies accept and even embrace the only environment they know. Some, are even happy in it, and it is not for us to judge any society to say what is right. Except this, if women do want a voice, the freedom to work and be educated, then society should consider to not do so is suppressive, suffocating and sometimes brutal. And so, applause for Khaled Hosseini who has given them a voice through his story and an in insight into a life that is all too real for many women. A letter of regret that Miraim never got to read speaks of her father‚Äôs regret ‚ÄúMay God grant you a long and prosperous life, my daughter. May God give you many healthy and beautiful children. May you find the happiness, peace, and acceptance that I did not give you. Be well. I leave you in the loving hands of God.

But this one turned out to be quite disappointing for me.The high rating of 4 stars still may be attributed to the simplistic yet straightforward and effective writing (yes, it's the writing that makes everything work for me to actually like a book in the first place) that made the characters, the story and the ending quite believable.But it's the lack of character development (of the seeming) main character that hugely left me unsatisfied when this book ended. The book was no struggle for me to read but the unnecessary repetitive too much violence towards the female characters was something I feel that wasn't really required.I get it that in order to emphasize how the female characters were suffering the writing tried to show now and then how it is and how it could be but for a book this long and leaving timelines hidden (yes, I would say this made my read rather unsatisfactory) as much of the earlier lives of the characters, specially of the main female character, was described with such details and anticipation and then it suddenly felt like (maybe reading fun spoilt for ya here as was for me) the story jumped directly towards the end and not much was said and done of what happened in between. I found it hard to accept the characters getting old (with what happened in between questionable thoughts) and seemingly too comfortable with how things were and the ending mocking me like everything happened for the best (like who I was to question things when the characters are okay with their lives). I wanted so much to connect with the characters but sadly, I couldn't. It seemed like the heart was taken out and hidden somewhere else (maybe a half of it was hidden in The Kite Runner and the other in And The Mountains Echoed) and maybe its shadow wasn't just enough for this book.

Why do we keep on reading about these hellish landscapes where humanity is long dead? Maybe it‚Äôs just the devil within, that makes many of us stop and stare at road accidents; maybe there is a cathartic effect, showing us that however bad things are, they could be worse. Or maybe it is the fascination of watching the human spirit soar above the inhuman universe. Most probably, it is a combination of all three.Taliban-ruled Afghanistan is a dystopia with a difference: instead of being hatched in the brain of some gifted writer, it is one which existed, very near to us in time and space. For the second time, Khaled Hosseini trains his spotlight on his unfortunate home country-however, whereas in The Kite Runner it was only a plot device for the protagonist‚Äôs personal redemptive journey, here it is one of the main characters, this land of A Thousand Splendid Suns.This novel is the story of two women, and through them, Woman in general; as she exists and endures in most parts of the world. Marginalised, a vagina in her youth, a womb in her womanhood, and a pair of hands for sweeping and cleaning in her old age. Created by God as an afterthought as a playmate to His star creation which He made in His own image.Mariam is a harami, born on the other side of the blanket to the wealthy Jalil Khan and his housekeeper Nana. Nana accepts the fact they are outcasts, while Mariam doesn‚Äôt. She demands her share of her father‚Äôs love, which he is ready to give on the sly ‚Äì the problem is, she wants it publicly. Her insistence on visiting her father at his town house ends in her mother‚Äôs suicide. Orphaned Mariam, an embarrassment to her father and his three wives, is married off at fifteen to Rasheed, an elderly widower‚Ä¶ with whom she endures a loveless and abusive marriage. She is also an object of shame to him because she consistently fails in carrying a baby to term.Laila is better off as far as family is concerned ‚Äì she has an educated and loving father, a mother who is much more considerate than many others (even though she is slowly on her way to madness because of her missing sons who have gone off to fight the Soviets), and a charming friend, the one-legged Tariq, who is fast becoming much more than a friends as the children mature. However, her world slowly starts to unravel as Afghanistan‚Äôs war with the USSR is won and then the various resistance groups starts fighting among themselves. One of her best friends meets a horrible death, another friend is married off, and Tariq leaves for Pakistan with his family. Ironically, when her family finally decides to move to Pakistan, a stray missile lands on her home killing both her parents. The injured Laila is taken in by Rasheed; with ulterior motives, it is soon revealed. However, she has no option but to become the second wife of the lecherous old man as she is carrying Tariq‚Äôs illegitimate child: and the news of Tariq‚Äôs death has come from across the border.As Afghanistan moves through the Civil war era to the Taliban era, the two women, initially hostile, form a bond. The bond is strengthened when Laila gives birth to a girl and loses glamour in the eyes of Rasheed, making her a fellow-sufferer with Mariam: and Mariam simply loves Aziza, Laila‚Äôs daughter, all the more because she is a little harami like herself!Things slowly spiral to a climax when Tariq returns. It seems the story of his death has been manufactured by Rasheed. In a climax slightly reminiscent of a Hindi movie in the best Bollywood tradition, Mariam puts paid to her brute of a husband with a garden shovel, as he is trying to strangle Laila. Laila escapes with Tariq and her children, while Mariam confesses to her crime and receives the Taliban‚Äôs swift and brutal justice.In the last part, we find Laila returning to the Taliban-exorcised Afghanistan, where she makes a pilgrimage to Mariam‚Äôs birthplace and unexpectedly receives the money left for Mariam by her repentant father. With it, she revives the orphanage and school where Aziza had been given shelter during the worst years of her life. We leave the story with the news of her third child growing inside her ‚Äì whose name is already fixed (we can all guess what it will be!), should it turn out to be a girl.  *Khaled Hosseini is definitely not a literary writer. His style is emotional: the story is given all importance, not the way it is delivered. There were complaints (rather justified, IMO) about the lack of dimension of the characters, especially the villain, in The Kite Runner: Hosseini was accused of playing up to the gallery by vilifying the Islamic world for the benefit of a largely Western audience. In hindsight, I have to reluctantly agree, even though I loved that book.A Thousand Splendid Suns is slightly better in the sense that all the characters are better drawn. The Taliban are shown as human beings, even though believers in a barbarian philosophy. Rasheed is unabashedly evil, however: but that has nothing to do with religion or geography ‚Äì SOB‚Äôs like him are a dime to dozen in almost all third-world countries. However, the women protagonists are well-etched. Thankfully, they fight back even when the dice is loaded against them.The novel follows a beaten path: there are very few surprises. The narrative structure is linear, and the author does not challenge the reader at any time within the narrative. The result is a story which flows at breakneck pace, loaded with emotion. We root for the good guys and boo the bad guys at all the appropriate places. And in the end, when Mariam cracks open Rasheed‚Äôs skull, we stand up and applaud. But I do not care if the emotion is cheap ‚Äì I thoroughly enjoyed it. One needs to load up on junk food now and then!The most noteworthy thing about A Thousand Splendid Suns is the way Afghanistan is portrayed: one weeps for the destruction of a beautiful country, gang-raped and mutilated by hordes and hordes of marauders. One wishes that the current tenuous peace holds, so that she can get back on her feet. *Once a taxi driver here talked to me about his family back in Pakistan, on the hilly borderland near Afghanistan. These areas are still outside the police scanner and largely controlled by the Taliban. He told me how his brilliant daughter was forced out of school by armed men on pain of death. He had wanted to make her a doctor, and now she was confined to sooty pots and pans in the backyard. The poor man was almost in tears.I remembered him when Mariam brought down the shovel the second time on Rasheed‚Äôs head.

(Throwback Review) Khaled Hosseini tells us the story of millions of daughters, sisters, wives, and mothers through Miriam and Laila. We can see how the Taliban had shattered Afghanistan in this novel. The author has beautifully depicted hope, tragedy, and violence amid the war. The way he tells the history of a country through the eyes of two women is simply brilliant. This is a must-read book for everyone and can be considered one of the few books that can change the lives of people in the best possible way.

While I complained about the heat during bedtime, these girls feared they would wake up tomorrow without a home and a family or worse, would not wake up altogether. What hurt me most is the thought that although the characters and settings may be fictional, the events in the entire story did take place in Afghanistan and may still be taking place in other places around the world. Call me selfish, but the story made me appreciate my life even more.It is a heart-wrenching yet inspiring story that haunted me for days but from the very bottom of my heart, I thank the Mr. Khaled Hosseini for his unrivaled bravery and generosity for writing A Thousand Splendid Suns, a story about a woman‚Äôs strength, resilience and will to have a place in a society of endless wars and conflicts and where laws and social rules seem to conspire against her. This is a story that shows how a woman can be beaten, spit on or even stoned to death and yet her spirit and faith won‚Äôt waver. She will continue to fight for the ones she loves without complaint and will continue to weep and bleed for the love of her country.  I love how the lens of the story starts by zooming in on a small village, on one small character whose role in society seems of least significance and then zooms out onto the bigger picture, showing the conflicts in the country as a whole and how in the end, the small character will mark a huge place in the society. Even though this was one of my saddest, heaviest reads this year, I still look forward to reading the rest of the books written by the author.‚òº On a much lighter note, happy birthday to one of my most awesome, most wonderful friends, Masooma.

29,99507478,04/21/2010,5," Beutifully Written, Poignant and moving. A novel that deserves to be read and re-read.I first read A Thousand Splendid Suns in 2010 and was so moved by the story of Marian and Laila that I planned on re-reading it within a year but the best laid plans and all that.....Finally came up in an online book group read and just couldnt wait to read it again to see would I react the say way as I did seven years ago.A Thousand Splendid Suns is an incredible chronicle of thirty years of Afghan history and a deeply moving story of family, friendship, faith, and the salvation to be found in love. An amazing sense of time and place along with memorable likeable and dislikable characters and a plot that is educational and emotionally draining makes this novel the incredible read that it is and the reason for my 5 Star rating in 2010 and again in 2017.While I remembered most of the characters and the story line, it was still a great read second time around and knowing that the discussion with the group would be lively and challenging added an extra bonus to reading this for a second time.A compelling and heartbreaking story that stays with you long after you finish the novel and this is one book that makes me thankful for the life I was born into.A wonderful read and a book that everyone should read at least once.",105,0.9971,0.014,0.732,0.254,0.5826388888888889,POSITIVE,0.9998
30,17913471,03/16/2008,2,"a good story. it was easy to read and went really quickly. liberal white women will love this book. thank allah i'm an uptight radical. hosseini was disappointing for me for several reasons...1. this text and the kite runner are touted for their 'brave and unapologetic' look at the hidden lives of those suffering/maybe surviving in (the predominantly taliban-controlled era) afghanistan. whatever. this is the same story is the same story is the same story. i think the one woman even gets to paint her fingernails in the end. the topic is not so tired but the way it's addressed is- woman sold/war-torn into abusive patriarchal muslim culture, woman persevere, woman get comeuppance. well, the young pretty one that is loved by another male character- but i'll attack that later. if mid-east gender injustice is your thing, read ""woman at point zero"" out of egypt by saadawi or watch ""osama"" about afghanistan. both of these address these topics in much more eloquent and interesting ways and without (or at least done better) the false feminism.2. speaking of false feminism- this book is about women in relation to men. the plot and character development consistently rely on a male character. at one point it attempts to make the story about the relationship between the women, but, nope, back to relying on dudes. the women characters barely exist if it weren't for the men in their lives. boring.3. it perfectly fits into the western literary canon. the narrative is linear and pov is labeled by chapter. it's been written for a western audience by a non-western author about a non-western topic, i want it to respect my intelligence and write in a non-western style. it lacks the cadence and artistic quality of middle eastern literature that makes these horrible stories alive and therefore devastating (as they should be).4. the characters and their fates are generic and predictable. the story line follows popular heteronormative tropes about what is a worthwhile destiny and consequently a valuable life. one woman, mariam, is beheaded for killing her husband while trying to save the sister wife, laila. mariam is old, infertile, supposedly unattractive and up until this point has had no radical ideas of her own. laila however is young, beautiful, educated, fertile, rebellious, and has another man that she can run away with whom loves her. the sequence of events suggests to me the same old ideas about what is a livable and grievable life. boo. i don't like that this story tells me that this makes sense, that mariam has to die as a symbol because her life was recognized as less valuable and ergo less livable.i've dealt this book a good deal of hateration it might not totally deserve but i feel like if you're going to be hanging around the new york times book list you should live up to it. leave the western style to white dudes. um, but, good story though...",88,0.9775,0.101,0.752,0.147,0.4259740259740259,NEGATIVE,0.9896
31,10240480,12/10/2007,5,"Book ReviewA Thousand Splendid SunsBy Khaled HosseiniReviewed by Tom CarricoIt‚Äôs amazing that this author has the #1 fiction paperback (The Kite Runner) and the #1 fiction hardback (A Thousand Splendid Suns) on ‚ÄúThe New York Times‚Äù bestseller list. The Kite Runner has sold over four millions copies since its release in 2003. It is a hauntingly written novel set in war-torn Afghanistan. It is exceptionally well plotted and opens the window on a part of the world that very few of us are familiar with. The two boys in The Kite Runner are from different socio-economic circumstance but forge a friendship which transcends politics, war and economics. Even though this story is set in Afghanistan, it is a story of childhood betrayal and its consequences and could really have been set anywhere. It is a great story wonderfully told, however, and the fact that it takes place in a land few of us understand makes it educational as well as entertaining.To use a baseball metaphor, if The Kite Runner was a home run, A Thousand Splendid Suns, the author‚Äôs second effort, is a game winning walk-off grand slam. The author has managed to tell the modern history of Afghanistan: from the end of the monarchy to the invasion of the Soviets to the chaos of rule by the war lords to the tight fisted maniacal rule of the Taliban to the post-9/11 return to some semblance of relative normalcy. The author again uses the device of telling the stories of two main characters of differing backgrounds, this time women. The first, Mariam, is the illegitimate daughter of a wealthy businessman in Herat. The book opens with the story of Mariam‚Äôs childhood. She is sequestered on the outskirts of the city in a clay hut with her mother. Her father visits once weekly and servants from his house bring basic supplies. Mariam‚Äôs mother is understandably bitter and the tension between mother and daughter is palpable. Eventually Mariam is given in marriage to Rasheed, an older shoe-maker from Kabul, mainly to remove the embarrassment of her very existence from her father‚Äôs world. This man is domineering and abusive and Mariam‚Äôs inability to conceive causes her to quickly fall out of favor.The second main character is Laila, a beautiful young girl who grows up as a neighbor of Rasheed and Mariam in Kabul. She has a childhood friend, Tariq, a young man who lost a leg to a Soviet land mine. As these children mature, they fall in love. Tariq‚Äôs family decides to run from the warlords who by now bombarding the city. During the hysteria of their pending separation, the two young lovers conceive a child. Once Laila realizes she is pregnant and has no idea how to contact Tariq, she also marries Rasheed and convinces him that the child is his. Needless to say, the relationship between Laila and the forlorn Mariam starts out poorly and gets worse. Eventually they are brought together by their shared victim status and their mutual disgust and hatred for Rasheed. The resolution of the conflict between these two women is riveting and, well, painful. You get the impression that there aren‚Äôt too many happy endings in Afghanistan.While the author tells these two women‚Äôs stories, he also gives the reader a fantastic and comprehensive history lesson. The modern history of Afghanistan is complicated and the author uses some of the secondary characters to deliver this lesson. Laila‚Äôs father is a school teacher and is very interested in politics and a lot of his dialogue is opinion about the current state of affairs. Laila‚Äôs two older brothers fight for one of the warlords against the Communists and are both killed. Rasheed is a businessman who tries to manipulate whatever political system is in charge at the moment, which also gives insight into the political and social climate through all of these regime changes.This is not an easy book to read. Over and over again, it is heart breaking. The cruelty to women is incomprehensible. The status of medical care during the rule of the Taliban is clinically detailed by the author (who is a physician) and graphically described when Laila presents to the only hospital in Kabul which is allowed to treat women and has to undergo a Caesarean section without anesthesia because the Taliban won‚Äôt fund the women‚Äôs hospital. Khaled Hosseini has a writing style reminiscent of Ernest Hemingway. He writes in short, brutal sentences which conjure images that the mind can‚Äôt even comprehend. He always uses the perfect word or phrase. He alludes to Hemingway in one section when Laila‚Äôs father is reading The Old Man and the Sea. A Thousand Splendid Suns is also a fight against impossible odds, a story of hope when the situation is hopeless, and the resilience of the human spirit.I think that this book is destined to be a classic. It is critically important for every American who has an opinion about war, freedom and human rights to read this book. It‚Äôs easy to forget the citizens of a country as it is repeatedly trampled over the decades. This book puts very real faces on people caught in the crossfire of a conflict they did not initiate. It describes conditions and situations which those of us living in the comfort of 21st century America cannot comprehend. This book is at once entertaining and horrifying, edifying and humbling, compulsively readable and appallingly shocking. It is terrific.A Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseini is available in hardcover from Riverhead Books.",85,-0.4684,0.126,0.747,0.127,0.524824520717378,POSITIVE,0.9951
32,1551842845,02/17/2016,4,"Though not as popular as Khaled Hosseini's The Kite Runner, ""A Thousand Splendid Suns"" is an extremely important novel with a huge number of interesting themes which are explored in its rather short amount of pages. In this family saga and moving tale of friendship, hate and love at the same time, Hosseini abbreviates several decades of important history into a fictional story spanning more than thirty years.It's a depressing novel, consisting of a rather dark atmosphere and many chapters which will leave you gasping for breath due to the sheer amount of brutality and inhumanity some characters seem to love carrying out. What I found most intriguing in this novel was the way Hosseini managed to provide a lot of information about the history of Afghanistan, a country which has been dominated by war and destruction for such a long time. At times he came close to sounding like a nonfictional correspondent of the events with his prose, but fortunately it never felt like the author was trying to pour infodump out on his readers.""A Thousand Splendid Suns"" is a tough book to review, simply because it deals with so many socially relevant issues that it feels like nitpicking to talk about the writing and the characterization. It's an important book which I can only encourage everyone to read as soon as possible, considering that it offers plenty food for your thoughts and leaves you pondering about themes and questions which you may not have thought about in such detailed precision before. My biggest problem with the novel was mostly about the main characters Laila and Mariam, who - thanks to the rather detached and neutral writing style - felt very difficult to connect or relate to. I started rooting for these characters throughout the course of the novel, though that's rather obvious to say considering the fate these two women had to endure in the course of the plot.As a final note, I think this book - or Hosseini's other books in general - should receive more attention by the public. Nowadays, especially here in Germany, there is a lot of displeasure directed towards foreigners and their cultures, not necessarily people from Afghanistan, but the Middle East and Far East in general. Hosseini manages to introduces his readers who are not familiar with the cultures described in this novel to a different world, a world I personally didn't know as much about before reading ""A Thousand Splendid Suns"" (and still wouldn't consider myself knowing a lot about). Khaled Hosseini's writing transports the important message that no matter where we come from, we are still all humans. Here in Germany and probably in many other places on our planet as well, people often tend to forget that coming from a different culture does not mean those humans are worth any less than we all are, and I think Hosseini's writing has the strength to remind more people of this fact. We are all human, and everyone deserves to be treated as such - no matter which cultural background you belong to.",86,0.991,0.06,0.802,0.139,0.5673430735930737,NEGATIVE,0.884

34,1455936135,11/30/2015,5,"I felt a little intrepid about reading this novel because I loved The Kite Runner so much, but A Thousand Splendid Suns is equally superb. The plot centers around the lives of the two distinct protagonists, Mariam and Laila. Mariam is the illegitimate daughter of wealthy businessman Jalil but is forced to live with the stigma of being a ""harami."" She lives an isolated life with her mother, but her father visits weekly. Mariam's adoration for her father and desire for his acceptance leads to a fateful change in her entire existence. After tragedy strikes, Jalil, in his weakness, forces Mariam to marry Rasheed, an older man, and move to Kabul. Laila, on the other hand, leads a very different life. She has been raised in Kabul and has friends and a wonderful childhood sweetheart. Her father dotes on her and encourages her education. Unexpectedly, the two women's lives become intertwined by a cruel twist of fate. The novel spans over three decades and is set against the backdrop of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the ensuing internal conflict for control, and the eventual rule of the Taliban. These conflicts are central to the course of events that shape the characters' lives. As well as being a master storyteller, Hosseini has an undeniable ability to create vivid and memorable characters. After reading before bedtime, I would awaken still thinking of them. Somehow they became ingrained in my memory. For me, this is what separates a good book from a great book.A Thousand Splendid Suns is an extremely emotional read. I experienced every emotion imaginable- sorrow for the victims of Rasheed's cruelty, denial at the news of Tariq's demise, tenderness for the bond between Mariam and Laila, and indignation at Mariam's fate. I was ultimately reduced to tears when Laila travels to Herat, a beautiful moment.Memorable quote:She remembered Nana saying once that each snowflake was a sigh heaved by an aggrieved woman somewhere in the world.

35,1011928781,08/08/2017,5,"4.5‚òÖ‚ÄúAll day, this poem about Kabul has been bouncing around in my head. Saib-e-Tabrizi wrote it back in the seventeenth century, I think. I used to know the whole poem, but all I can remember now is two lines: ‚ÄòOne could not count the moons that shimmer on her roofs, Or the thousand splendid suns that hide behind her walls.‚Äô‚ÄùSo reminisces Laila‚Äôs father, a free-thinking professor in Kabul when Laila was a child. He is a champion of women‚Äôs learning, talks about the universities, the women who are doctors, thinkers, activists. ‚ÄúAlmost two-thirds of the students at Kabul University were women now, Babi said, women who were studying law, medicine, engineering.‚ÄùBut before we meet Laila, we meet Mariam, the illegitimate child of Jalil, a successful businessman in Herat, a city near the border with Iran, where more traditional customs are followed. He has three wives and their children all living in his home. Nana, Mariam‚Äôs mother, worked for him and he refused to add her to the family when she fell pregnant to him, but he provided meagre support in a primitive hut in the bush. Mariam adored Jalil and his visits.She is curious and interested in everything, but her mother says ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the sense schooling a girl like you? It‚Äôs like shining a spittoon.‚Äù She tells Mariam she needs only one skill.‚Äú‚ÄòOnly one skill. And it‚Äôs this: tahamul. Endure.‚Äô‚ÄòEndure what, Nana?‚Äô ‚ÄòOh, don‚Äôt you fret about that,‚Äô Nana said. ‚ÄôThere won‚Äôt be any shortage of things.‚Äô‚ÄùThat pretty much sums up what Mariam can expect from life.Laila is considerably younger and lives in the city of Kabul, goes to school, is clever, reads, mixes with friends and her best pal, Tariq, who‚Äôs lost a leg. He‚Äôs another bright kid, and they clown around a lot together as kids do. As they get older, they begin to develop an attraction for each other, but fighting comes to Kabul.I won‚Äôt attempt to cover who was fighting whom, or which countries were supplying arms and aid to which sides. Suffice to say, once the Soviets were pushed out of Afghanistan and the various factions were striving for supremacy:‚ÄúThe Mujahideen, armed to the teeth but now lacking a common enemy, had found the enemy in each other. Kabul‚Äôs day of reckoning had come at last.‚ÄùBy this time, Mariam had ended up in Kabul, so we now have two heroines to worry about. The author explains in his notes that when he wrote The Kite Runner, he wrote it for himself, as he wanted to tell the story of two boys and a father/son relationship. This time, he wanted to tell a story of two girls and a mother/daughter relationship. I have to say, he‚Äôs done a satisfying job of getting into the heads of the characters, both as girls, and as women, so they seemed like real women to me. As their paths cross, Mariam and Laila form a powerful relationship.The bombing and shootings are relentless, and the terror is real, with ‚Äúbodies dragged from the rubble, the hands and feet of children discovered on rooftops or the high branch of some tree days after their funeral.‚ÄùHow women and families endure is beyond me. Men are subsidiary characters, but because of the nature of the extreme Sharia laws instigated by the Mujahideen, men are all-powerful. I mean ALL powerful. Hands are chopped off, people are strung up in public, grisly beatings are regular. Women must be covered and can go nowhere without a male member of the family. Men must wear beards a fist-length below the chin in length, and beards are measured, non-conformists beaten.But the stories told about the past and the stories looked forward to in the future are wonderful. The author was born in Kabul. He spent part of his childhood there and describes the delightful places he remembers. There is more than a passing reference to the glory of that part of the world for centuries before this and the possibilities for future generations if the world pays attention.It‚Äôs not all as grim as I‚Äôve made it sound, and it is a way to begin to understand how resilient people are and how much they will ‚Äúendure‚Äù before they feel they must leave their homes and their history if their children are to survive.Brute power should have had its day by now, but, sadly, it seems not.",79,0.9968,0.051,0.824,0.125,0.5439678178963894,POSITIVE,0.7797
36,531571198,02/09/2013,5,"After reading the book I was speechless for about two hours. It was as though I was unceremoniously dropped back into my life after a volatile flight in a time machine which took me unexpectedly to Afghanistan. I met Miriam, Laila, Rasheed, Tariq - gentle, brutal, sadistic, happy, sad people in one place - ordinary people, who make mistakes, like you and me.I was thinking about the 9/11 attack on the Twin Towers and the media coverage it received all over the globe and the outrage the rest of the world had to endure from the Americans who never experienced the effects of war on their own turf. Then a book like this comes along to describe the effects of missiles and rockets used by all countries in the world, including America, on ordinary people's lives elsewhere where hundreds of thousands of people die in the rest of the world yet their stories are never told in quite the same elaborate news coverage. Their hurt, destitution, fears, destroyed lives never make the headlines. It simply does not suit the international media agenda to do so. Khaled Hosseini explains the horror of modern wars on ordinary people's lives in detail and a much needed new dimension is added to the history of the world. Another book which changed many perceptions in the world is Waris Diri's ""Desert Flower""- about the female circumcision practice in Africa and Asia.The ordinary people of a country who write their stories bring the real history of a country and its people alive, as it should be. To tell the history of this country Hosseini uses characters which could have been anyone anywhere: an abusive sadistic husband Rasheed, a despised, rejected young woman Miriam, a happy well-educated Laila,her gentle childhood friend Tariq, a caring, yet gutless, absent father Jalil, and a splendid description of the Bamiyan Valley to capture the hearts and minds of the reader. The narrative could have been about any war-torn country in the world where hope and the human spirit endured and survived. And where people slowly start to rebuild their lives from nothing. Where the masters of war created rockets with the main purpose to destroy, the ordinary people took the rocket shells and planted them with flowers! That is basically the message in the book: it doesn't matter what happens to us, we will rise above it. With that said, one wonders what would have been the reaction of the world if the American-designed Atom bomb exploded on New York and not Hiroshima. The question should be asked of Russia, Britain and France as well, who manufacture and sell just as many armament to the world as America. And we as 'blessed' westerners should ask ourselves why we allow this terrible things to happen to other countries where we not only sell the weapons, but also send troops into combat, simply to defend and protect our own agendas. Why do we turn our backs on the horror of lives such as the characters in this book? Why are people(readers) not willing to face the day-to-day experiences of the Afghanistan situation? Will we think the same if it happens in our own backyards? I think not.It is interesting so see how readers avoid reality and rather bash a book like  ""A Thousand Splendid Suns"" than face the truth in the situation. Fortunately the story resonated all over the world and more people got a very intimate insight thanks to Khaled Hoesseini. The reader simply will not be able to walk away from this book without a new perspective on Afghanistan in particular, and modern warfare. The author used simple words to narrate a simple, straight forwards message to the world and he did it brilliantly. It is a beautiful story of hardship and hope. Hope triumphs. As it should. I simply loved this book! It is one of those books which manages to lure 'blessed' westerners out of their own little worlds, their own comfort zones and enrich their souls and lives on a monumental level. When we can experience another country this way, by being invited into the hearts and minds of the citizens through their own words, we become really blessed people. The message is just as powerful as the one in ""The Kite Runner""",79,0.9926,0.077,0.801,0.123,0.5691315754952118,NEGATIVE,0.9818

The travails of women are graphically depicted here, the madness of near-constant warfare, the psychosis of uneducated extremists, the extreme sexism of an entire culture. No fun. The betrayals are as constant as are the two women‚Äôs hopes for better. Self-defense is considered a crime, freedom an abomination, brains blasphemy. This was a very fast but very uncomfortable read. Hosseini trods a familiar path, using the individual experiences of his characters to tell of the history of Afghanistan, and it is a sad telling. Bring your hankies. Although I expect the stories Hosseini tells have legitimate bases in the experience of real people, they seem too Dickensian, or worse, to feel true. How many times can characters be beaten down before we cringe at the next offense and become reluctant to turn the page? It is a familiar enough methodology, but wears. How great is the power of endurance? Will there ever be a reward for surviving?The title refers to a poem about Kabul: One could not count the moons that shimmer on her roofsOr the thousand splendid suns that hide behind her wallsPresumably the splendid suns here are the people who endure, or not, despite all. Are they really splendid, or merely victims of organized, if varying, forms of psychosis? What is clear is that the events both outside and inside those walls are mostly far less than splendid.

46,1454246231,11/28/2015,5,"Oh my god, this book. Where do I start? The picturesque scenery. The nuanced characters. The well thought-out story line. See, that's the thing. I loved everything about this book, and that does not happen often. The book is so beautiful, my reading experience was surreal. There is no doubt that Khaled Hosseini is a master of the written word. His language is simple, yet the sheer beauty of it is astounding! Yes, beauty. I think that is the perfect word to describe this book. Not good, not great, not even excellent, but beautiful. The book made me laugh and cry and scream and shout. It made me fall in love with Tariq. It made me weep for Mariam, a woman so misunderstood, so helpless, that she never really got anything from life. It made me want to cuddle Aziza and Zalmai. It made me want to befriend Laila. It made me want to kill Rasheed. And Jalil. I was there, in Kabul, in Herat, witnessing this as it happened. That. That was the depth of Hosseini's writing, and if that's not beauty, I don't know what is. And the characters! So wonderfully complex and layered. So perfectly imperfect. Mariam, the illegitimate child that no one wanted. A child only a mother could love, as they say. A girl forced into a marriage she didn't really want. A woman, who suffered more than anyone should, and for no fault of hers. A human, whose noble sacrifice shall forever be remembered. Mariam was strong; perhaps the strongest of them all. Even in death, her strength never wavered. A woman who could never become a mother herself, but was, ultimately a mother to all. A woman who gave up her life so that others could live.Laila, the beautiful, intelligent girl. Laila, who grew up surrounded by love, only to have it all taken away from her. A girl forced to marry a man when she was pregnant with another man's child. A woman who had the guts to stand up to the misogynistic chauvinist man she called a husband. A woman who stood up for what was right. A mother, willing to sacrifice anything for her children. A mother, who kept trying, because her children needed, nay, deserved a better life. Mariam may have sacrificed her life for Laila's happiness and future, but Laila sacrificed her happiness so her children could have a future. Authors? Authors? If you're looking to portray strong, independent female characters, then look no further. Laila and Mariam may not have fancy degrees, but they're who we should be promoting as feminists today. Tariq, the best friend, the lover, the husband. I love how this book revolves around two women and the people in their lives. Tariq, the friend who protected Laila at all times, no matter what the cost. A son who never let his parents down. A boy faced with perhaps the hardest decision anyone had to make, much less a teen aged boy. A man who knew the value of the love he shared with another. A lover who came back. A father who accepted even another man's child as his own. A husband who would travel to the ends of the world for his wife. Rasheed, the quintessential antagonist. But was he really? He was just a man who stood by his beliefs. A man who wanted a child. A man mourning the death of his child. A man wallowing in his own guilt. Yes, he was violent. Yes, he was a chauvinistic pig. And yes, I hated him. But did I somewhere, deep inside, understand what he might be going through? I guess so. Because even a violent sadist like Rasheed found, in the depth of his heart, love. Love for the son that he knew was his. Love for his child. How Afghanistan transitioned from a country where beautiful women went to work in skirts and sunglasses, to a country where female surgeons had to operate in a burqua has been portrayed wonderfully. The sights of Kabul, the street food, the toys, the cars, and the shoes. Mariam's kolba in Herat, and Jalil's mansion. The kind of restricted freedom that Laila realises they have in the beautiful hill station that is Murree. And then there's the part where, towards the end, you find out that Jalil regretted marrying off his daughter. His final penance.I will shamelessly admit that I cried like a baby through this book. Happy tears, sad tears, angry tears... whatever. But I think that is the sign of a good book; if at the end of it, I know that I felt what the characters felt, I'm happy. Khaled Hosseini managed that alright! ",68,0.999,0.132,0.624,0.244,0.6193438408227139,POSITIVE,0.9998

And don't keep any sharp objects near if you don't wanna spend the rest of your life in prison because you'll definitely want to murder someone.‚ÄúI'm sorry,"" Laila says, marveling at how every Afghan story is marked by death and loss and unimaginable grief. And yet, she sees, people find a way to survive, to go on.‚ÄùThis book follows the story of a young girl named Mariam Jo and the hardships she faced in her life because she committed the worst mistake of her life and that is being born as a female. And what's worse? She is the illegitimate child of a rich man. What do you think the man does when Mariam's responsibility falls on him? He marries her off to a man who is 30 year older than her daughter. A man who beats and mentally and physically abuses Mariam throughout their marriage because she can't give him a son. I fucking hate Rasheed. Men like him are the reason why every girl/women is fighting for their rights.""You see, some things I can teach you. Some you learn from books. But there are things that, well, you have to see and feel.‚ÄùLater in thi book we are introduced to Laila, another young girl who's given the chance to get educated and spend a happy childhood, yet she suffers from gender discrimination. Her brothers go to fight in the war while she is supposed to stay at home and suffer the repercussions. Things go worse for her when the one she loves go for away from her reach and is left with the choice to either marry a man who already has a wife or risk losing the child growing inside of her. ‚ÄúA man's heart is a wretched, wretched thing. It isn't like a mother's womb. It won't bleed. It won't stretch to make room for you.‚ÄùBeing a girl myself and liking men written by women, this was the first book where I loved the way how beautifully womem are portrayed by a male writer in this book. Both womem in this book suffered both physical and mental abuse, however instead of getting weaker they turned out to be much stronger. I was so happy when Mariam smashed Rasheed's head however the consequences were just too heartbreaking. And Jalil's letter? All I wanted to keep crying. Like I should be hating him for what he did to Mariam but my damn emotions couldn't be kept in control.I will not lie and say that I know what's the condition of this country this book was set in was or is at the current moment. I will not say that I understand what the women, girls and all the people are going through at the moment. But I really hate whatever they are going through. I wish I could help them in any ways.

51,773281399,11/24/2013,2,"I'm beginning to think Hosseini is a one-trick pony.Perhaps because I read this book immediately after I finished The Kite Runner, but this was just more of the same. Just swap out ""little boys"" for ""women"" in this book, and you've got about the same concept.To be vague, but give you an idea of what's going on in this book: - People are blown up. Their various body parts are found on rooftops and are gathered in the streets by their weeping mothers. - Girls of 14 and 15 are sold into marriage by their fathers to men who are 45. - A woman with a horrible life commits suicide. - A man rapes his wife. - A man beats his wife. - A man rapes his wife. - A man beats his wife. - A man beats his female child because he hates that she's not a son. - A man gets a second wife, who is promptly raped. - Wife 1 is beaten again. - Wife 2 is beaten again. - Wife 1 and Wife 2, and girl-child are tortured. (This is different than the normal beatings.) - Repeat the beatings and rapes about 50 times. Sometimes with belts, sometimes with fists, sometimes with strangulation. Most of this is described in detail. - A man has a kidney stone problem. A man dies of cancer. (Both seem to be favorite topics of Hosseini.) - (view spoiler)[ Abused wife finally can't take any more abuse after 20-some years and murders husband. She is executed publicly for this. (hide spoiler)]...The reason that this book was WORSE than The Kite Runner is that in the Kite Runner, Bad Awful Things happen two or three times. In this book, Bad Awful Things happen on almost every single page. There is no relief, no break from the brutality. It is relentless.While this relentless, tireless hell might indeed be truly reflective of many women's lives in Afghanistan, it is gruesome and emotionally battering to read about. Eventually you are just cringing while turning each page and praying for the book to be over soon, but you are sad because you realize that there's more than a hundred pages left of this savagery.Combine this intense sadism with a hearty dose of Nicholas-Sparks-like plot twists and you have a book that is deliberately and callously designed to rip your heart out.I feel like Hosseini is purposefully being emotionally manipulative and I don't appreciate it....Do you think this is in any way enjoyable to read? No, it isn't. If I am flinching while reading the book - not at one chapter, at every chapter - filled with dread and fear at what disgusting abominable thing is going to happen next - then this is not a good book....As for Hosseini writing good, believable female characters: well, they're not UN-believable. However, I see nothing special or especially creative or insightful about saying ""This is a woman who is in an unhappy marriage with a man 30+ years her senior who beats and rapes her daily and is a sadistic bastard."" This is not very imaginative.This is not compelling, and while I of course sympathized and hurt for the female characters in this book, I did so more because they were living in hell rather than because I thought they were 3-dimensional characters who lived and breathed to me....Did you like anything?Hosseini has an amazing knack for illustrating Afghanistan in a way that it is alive and vibrant.That's about the best thing I can say for the book.",60,-0.9993,0.251,0.677,0.072,0.5437142857142857,NEGATIVE,0.9997
52,2459071965,07/20/2018,5,"This book is a masterpiece in every way you could possibly imagine. I seriously cannot fault it. As this is the third reread of this incredible book, I will try not to write too much in this review. The very first time I read this, it took my breath away, with the rawness, the despair but also the love, and the way in which it shines through, even in the darkest of times. With this reread, I discovered little things that I couldn't remember from my first experience with this, but, I had the same emotions, and I was given all the feels. If you are looking for a book, that will give you the feels, then look no further. I don't think I have ever cried so much whilst reading a book. Hosseini is a wordsmith, and his words are lyrical and his descriptions really speak to your heart. Numerous times, I read a page or so, and I felt that familiar lump in my throat, and the prickling in my eyes. It was all I could do to stop myself from crying.The way all of the characters lives so smoothly intertwine with one another's is wonderful. They are all well developed and each of those characters have their own harrowing and difficult story to tell. Even though the theme of the story is violence, and a lot of it is towards women, I think Hosseini tackles this difficult and sometimes silent subject masterfully.

53,2632410315,12/30/2018,4,"Last review of 2018! Happy New Year everyone!I have very mixed feelings about this book. I appreciated Hosseini's fabulous story-telling skill which had me hooked to the book. However, I have worries in two areas: one, character development, and two, how the history of Afghanistan provided an overarching framework for the experienes of the main characters. As regards the first point, Mariam and Laila seemed somewhat 'wooden' to me esp. in the first part. I almost felt as if Hosseini hadn't spent enough time in the company of his characters, so to speak, to make them come alive, but that he was using them to make a point. (view spoiler)[To bring an example, what mother would commit suicide because her daughter went off to spend some time with her father? I'm not saying that mothers don't commit suicide, of course they do, but usually it's for far more complex reasons than we have here. Nana, by contrast, seems intent on causing her daughter guilt, a massive, solid, unshiftable amount of guilt, which makes her less believable as a character. ] (hide spoiler)]As for the secod point: I can't help but compare his book with Pachinko which I read earlier this year and totally loved. There, Min Jin Lee integrates the story of the characters with the history of Korea admirably. Every event referenced is presented through its impact on the characters. Here, the integration does not work as well. Take for example, George W. Bush's war on Afghanistan after 9/11: the air bombings are referenced through a brief exchange between husband and wife, one of whom says, ah, this might be a solution to the problems of Afghanistan, while the other protests that the bombs fall on the innocent and the guilty alike. I undestand that the author would not want to be seen as taking sides, but I still think it's preferable not to reference an event at all if there is not enough space to do it properly.All that said, I still feel I owe Hosseini a debt of gratitude for humanising Afghanistan, making it less a country of goats and burqa-clad women, and more a place like any other, whose people had needs, wants, desires, and aspirations for fulfilling lives before these were bitterly crushed by war. If there is a message that this book manages to put across quite potently, this is that there is no redemptive aspect in war, no vain hope that something better will come out of it. For this reason, I'm glad that this book has had such enormous success even though I still have a few qualms about its literary merit.",66,-0.9368,0.14,0.744,0.116,0.4320214338507022,NEGATIVE,0.9979

I loved  The Kite Runner  and this book is also beautifully written and is a masterpiece. The Story telling is perfect and at no moment I feel bored or thought of putting it away.The book stretches over decades and talks about the Afghan history in which the soviets invaded and the Taliban took over and time after that. The writer makes it easy to picture the areas of Afghanistan and the Afghani culture. The story in this book is told from the perspective of the two women named Mariam and Laila. Both the women with a completely different childhood but fate brought them together. The characters in the book are fictional. But the story of the life of Laila and Mariam is too heart breaking and I felt sad for the whole day while reading this. Makes me grateful for the life I am living but saddens me when I think of there are many people out there who still have tragic lives similar to Mariam and Laila.The writer talks about many important topics such as how the war destroyed lives of so many innocent Afghanis which were forced to go to different countries to find shelter. The rules in the society which restricted the freedom of the women. They violence that they had to endure. Also about the women education in Afghanistan, where they were restricted to go to schools. I loved the character of Laila‚Äôs dad who believed and had a dream of educating his daughter.   ‚ÄúA society has no chance of success if its women are uneducated...‚Äù This book involves everything and is very interesting to read but could be quite depressing and sensitive to some readers.
