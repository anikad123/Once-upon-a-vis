Clarkson is not an especially strong writer, his all-flash, no-substance writing style becoming grating after a while... except here, where it's softened by the genuine love Jeremy has for his subject. The grown man's engineering nous writes in locked step with his childlike sense of wonder, and you can't help smiling to yourself and thinking, ""Yeah... that's right!"" as he describes your favourite machines. Pick it up for a domestic flight and you'll barely feel the plane touch down at the other end, and you'll wander through the terminal basking in the warm glow of human accomplishment.",4,-0.3069,0.076,0.875,0.049,0.4909951159951158,POSITIVE,0.9775

28,1148645270,12/31/2014,2.0,"I like Jeremy Clarkson. His dry wit and ""grumpy old man"" outlook, contrasting with Richard Hammond's more boyish enthusiasm, make ""Top Gear"" an enjoyable hour's viewing on BBC2 on a Sunday evening. It makes for a decent column in The Sun once a week as well, with this latter also proving that it's not just cars he can write about the same way.He's been doing the columnist bit for a while now, though, as evidenced by his previous book ""The World According To Jeremy Clarkson"", which was essentially a collection of his writings in the Sunday Times. That wasn't just about cars, but it was all about a grumpy old man poking fun at and holes in various topics.Clarkson has narrowed his scope slightly with ""I Know You Got Soul"", as this is a book all about man's creations, the machines. Clarkson picks the ones he feels have a certain something that elevates them above the rest; the ones that have touched the hearts and minds of the public and become more than mere nuts and bolts.Perhaps surprisingly, given Clarkson's past history, there are very few cars mentioned. Maybe after so many years of writing and talking about them, he can't see them as much more than just a machine. It is in the air and on water that Clarkson manages to find most machines with soul.The style is pretty much the same all the way through, with Clarkson picking his machine and talking about it. There is usually a bit of general history, about how, when and why the machine in question was originally designed and made and of his own experiences with that particular machine. Whilst doing so, there is the occasional dig and snide remark and, even more occasionally, something genuinely funny, as is Clarkson's way. The only major difference between chapters is that sometimes he has more to say than at others.Whilst this does delight at first, seeing Clarkson back on his usual subject, more or less, it does wear thin pretty quickly. What makes Clarkson so enjoyable for me in the other forms I come across him in is that there isn't too much of him. In the form and size of a book, he does get a little wearing. He comes across as a little bit snobbish, presenting information as if he knows it and you don't and he's not about to let you forget it. His dry wit and habit of grumbling and finding fault even in the things he's holding up as the greatest of examples amuses at first, but soon gets annoying and you wish he would just give up and actually find something he really likes.One thing that is noticeable is that he seems to find less to say about things as he goes deeper into the book. It feels like he had a few machines he was truly passionate about, but there weren't enough for a book, so he had to add a few more he wasn't quite so keen on. Then, when the publishers said it wasn't long enough, he had to throw in a few more just because he thought he could make a point out of them.As with other books I've read, particularly things like ""The Darwin Awards"" and the books of collected newspaper columns by John O'Farrell and by Clarkson himself, this is really a book you need to dip in and out of. If you try to read it as a novel, it just gets a little repetitive and dreary. Had I read this over the period of a week or two, dipping in an out, I don't think it would have annoyed me as much as it did reading all in one go, thanks to a 3 hour delay on the Underground.If you're a fan of Clarkson, be that because of his humour on ""Top Gear"" or his general grumpiness as on ""Grumpy Old Men"", I suspect you'll enjoy this, although it would still be better read in bits and pieces. If you're a fan of all things mechanical, I suspect you'll also enjoy this, but if you're not a fan of Clarkson, it may just annoy you. If you like neither, you've possibly not even considered buying this book and that would be by far the best idea.Although good in parts, the title makes the style of the writing seem somehow ironic. Towards the end where Clarkson seems to be running out of ideas and the constant repetition of the same style is getting wearing, it all feels quite mechanical. This is a book about machines with soul that feels almost as if it was put together by a robot and by the end it feels, in total contrast to its title, strangely soulless.This review may also appear, in whole or in part, under my name at any or all of www.ciao.co.uk, www.thebookbag.co.uk, www.goodreads.com, www.amazon.co.uk and www.dooyoo.co.uk",0,0.9983,0.044,0.814,0.142,0.4321960486322189,POSITIVE,0.5515

I laugh at one column, nod in agreement at another, shake my head in disbelief at some and generally have a good time reading them.

I guess the thrust of this book is to start a laddish pub debate along the lines of ""of course, the Spitfire is better than the Hoover Dam"" which would descend into ""my Kia van is better than your Tefal toaster"" - a nonsensical debate, the folly of which is all too apparent even while you're reading this book.

His description of the scientific principles are simplified and analogically enriched enough to make them quite understandable. In addition, he of course exhibits his signature cheeky charm and British humour.The use of illustrations is also very effective because the way he describes the machines sometimes makes you want to stare at them in awe. His personal experiences with the machines were quite interesting to read as well; this man is clearly living the dream of playing with cool new “toys” all the time, and I’m glad he is sharing his experiences.He does follow the same pattern in every section, which resembles that of an opinion piece in a newspaper, but I think the pattern works well because you know what to expect. However, I did follow the advice of not reading the whole book in one sitting and agree that it probably is better that way. I certainly learned a lot from this book, not only about the features machines, but about the histories of aviation and warfare while also having a good time.",0,0.9953,0.011,0.747,0.242,0.5397289218717789,POSITIVE,0.9995
