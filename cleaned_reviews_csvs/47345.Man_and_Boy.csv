0,109954554,07/04/2010,4.0,"Truth. That's what I kept thinking as I was reading this book. It's true and it's raw. It's sad and it's happy. Tony Parsons has a certain way of making the characters so real. I felt I knew Harry Silver. Really knew him, as a friend.I guess stories like this don't really need to be complicated to really draw readers in. In the first few chapters I was devastated when Gina and Harry break up. I actually felt pain for Harry during his tiny mid-life crisis when he sleeps with another woman. The book puts across the reality that is life. That relationships can't be all romance all the time. The fact that people do fall in and out of love. The pressure that people have in today's society to be happy and romantic all the time. I don't know why people kid themselves into thinking being with someone is an easy task. It's really not, espeically when you're with eachother for life and have a family.It made me empathise with little Pat, a child of divorce. The majority of my friends and exfriends have had divorced parents but they never really talk about it. What it was like when they intially split up. I'm so very lucky to have parents that have stayed together. The book brings to light the horrendous damage that divorce can bring upon a child and a parent. The quote that really got me;""You need a license to drive a car. You need a license to own a dog, but anyone can bring a child into the world."" It's true. Of course I'm not at liberty to really give my oppinion on parenting and in some cases- love itself. I'm only seventeen.I've kinda veered off the point of this review. In a nutshell, I totally loved it. The truth of life that nothing is really a happy ending. It's sad, but true and that's what I really like in a book :)",14,0.9847,0.082,0.748,0.169,0.5842752485609627,POSITIVE,0.997
1,25732474,06/28/2008,2.0,"This is an engaging, smooth read and I would have rated it higher had I never read/seen ""Kramer v. Kramer."" I really felt this was borderline plagarism and was very surprised the author could get away with recreating so much of that story, right down to details like carrying the child when he is injured on the playground. I am also surprised that 25 years later this story plays well. When Kramer came out, most men didn't have a clue about real hands-on parenting and a man with custody was unheard of...the ""Mr. Mom"" stories made great fodder. Today, I'd be hard-pressed to think of a young father who does not fully participate in every aspect of parenting (not housework mind you...we haven't come THAT far!). The protaganist does have some self-discoveries that were not covered in Kramer, but mostly it is the same book.",12,0.7707,0.013,0.9,0.087,0.494094304388422,POSITIVE,0.9919

I did, I think because I'm a woman, feel irritated by the main man's somewhat blasé (in my opinion) attitude towards his and other male characters' misdemeanors.

And, although I would never spend my time with someone as unrealistic and whiny as him, the thing is that there are people who really cannot see the faults in their actions and somehow manage to make themselves victims. This is probably why someone would not like this book, you got to be very understanding with Harry. It was not easy getting close to the last 50 pages to see that he really does not see past his own problems and identity crisis. Furthermore, the biggest dissapointment was the portrayal of Gina's character after she went to Japan. Somehow, her lifelong dreams were presented as selfish and whimsy acts while her love for Pat was diminished to a level of mere custody fight. To conclude, I gave this book 4 stars because I read it through Harry's eyes and feelings. Not the feelings I would have after cheating on my partner but the feelings this hopeless romantic had. Not the feelings I would have everytime I see my father but the feelings this insecure young man had. And I would recommend everyone to do the same, just try to understand him.",6,-0.7143,0.097,0.831,0.072,0.5342592592592593,NEGATIVE,0.9992

Meet Harry, happily married with a little boy and a good job. He cheats on his wife and she leaves him and also his contract isn't renewed at work. His wife is very upset as she gave up her dream to go to Tokyo to be with Harry and decides that she's going to go as a result. She leaves their son behind and Harry now has to be a parent to his son, a job that took him 10 minutes a day previously. He does step up to the plate and makes a go of it but still feels like the injured party in the whole situation. This was annoying. I mean, Harry seems like a nice enough guy but apologise to your wife and accept you did wrong. And no, you don't get a medal for being a single father for a short time. Gina annoyed me to an extent too, she just left her son and went to Tokyo, Seriously? Harry's parents were likable though and added a nice tough. I'm glad Harry accepted the challenges in raising his son, but he had little choice anyway. And the book ended the way I thought it would so there is an element of predictability.One this I didn't like was - they are in England but mum is 'mom' in the book. And they talk about soccer.

10,336868149,05/26/2012,4.0,"Man and Boy by Tony Parsons is the story of how a man becomes a father to his son, and a son to a father. The affection Harry feels for his family, all of it, is obvious from the first page. As evident is Harry’s sense of self. He comes to realise that what he feels isn’t always enough, though. Approaching his thirtieth birthday, Harry is lost in between. He is no longer a child, but does not feel properly mature. He is married, but is unsure what that means. He loves his family, but isn’t quite sure why. But, Harry knows himself, even if ‘himself’ baffles him, and that thread is what makes this story so brilliant: Harry’s utter honesty. He makes mistakes and owns up to them. He feels and is ready to share that fact. He loves unconditionally, which is both uplifting and heartbreaking all at once. A month before his birthday, full of BIG questions and doubts, Harry makes a mistake. Then, within the course of thirty days, he loses everything he considered important. Over the next six months, he gains it all back, but not necessarily in the same form. Harry learns to be a father, not just a man with a young boy. He begins to understand his own father. He figures out what is important, and who, and he learns what love is. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Harry’s voice was so real. At times, his observations were funny, at others, wrenching. I forgave him his mistake. I hated his wife. I cheered Harry’s successes and secretly plotted Gina’s failure. I loved that none of the characters were heroes (except for the possible exception of Harry’s dad). They were all ordinary people and could be wholly uncompromising. Not a one of them changed their mind for the sake of the plot or story; they were all themselves to the end. Even Harry—though he grew. At the end of the book, he was still Harry, still ‘himself’, but a much more content version. There is a sequel, Man and Wife. I am not sure if I want to continue the story, however, as I was satisfied with who Harry was at the end of this chapter. ",3,0.9941,0.09,0.721,0.189,0.5596031746031747,POSITIVE,0.9764

On the other hand, while most will love to have that kind of life, they do not realize the sacrifice that comes with it. Harry threw it all away after a one night stand, now he struggles to being a single parent and his ex often wonders if he is capable of taking on such a big responsibility. Raising his son alone is really hard, he asks common questions such as: Should you eat green spaghetti for breakfast? Is his son really the most beautiful son in the world or is that just a trend that goes around? Is he fit to be a parent? Gina regrets that she left her child with Harry, so she wants him back in her life, although she is in Tokyo trying to have a fresh start. It does not get any better that Harry's father health is dying and he is falling in love at the wrong time.

12,3639366936,11/11/2020,1.0,"I think something that deeply pesters me as a person is parents (generally fathers, which I’m sorry, just seems to be the way of things when you’re not the one popping a kid out of a birth canal) who simply do not want to be a parent nor understand how to be one. It is rudimentary to do the absolute bare minimum for your children- this man seems to avoid that enough that washing his son’s hair is a novel concept. This book is from the perspective of a man who is egotistical and juvenile, and the worst of it is that this is nonfiction. Nonfiction! To a point where the author could not recall his actual real life son’s real life fall from a bed because of his mildly fictionalised recollections. This kind of book is just a self indulgent sideshow of egoism- and it has such little value. The lawyer at the end also felt like a vitriolic demonstration of what the author *really* felt, and it was a very weird thing to be reading. I can only hope in the future that this specific brand of ‘man only grows up a little bit because he has to do bare minimum for child’ dies out entirely.",3,-0.5994,0.077,0.87,0.054,0.5112857142857142,NEGATIVE,1.0

The emotions are spot on, the dialogue is believable, the plot is engaging and intriguing. My only grip is the ending which felt a bit forced but honestly it's a small thing in terms of the rest of the book. The most powerful part is the relationship between Harry and his father. Tony Parsons authentically captures all the nuances of man's relationship with his aging father.

On the cover it says that James brown has said in the Observer that he cried five times and laughed out loud four. I didn't really really cry, even thou the grandfaither died. He was after all 70 something. And such happens everyday. I'm not saying that it isn't a big dela, cos it is, but I can never get that engaged. Whatever, I don't know why I'm writing this. As for the laughing. I alughed a lot more that four times. Pat, the boy, was just so cute. Anyway. Man and Boy was Nick Hornby indeed, but even better actually. The book and the characters were just so symphatetic. Funny and hilarious and everything. Man and Boy is really about men in three generations.

It tugged my heart and lifted up some of the pessimistic views I have about love and men, life in general. This novel is about a producer, a husband and a father who made a mistake that caused him his wife. At first, I can't feel sorry for him. I just cannot find the nerve to forgive men who break their women's heart easily. They deserve to rot or work in a public high school canteen..in jersey. He goes by the name Harry by the way. So his wife left him and brought their 4 year-old son with her. But when she went away to go to Japan to, get this, 'follow her dreams..' Harry took his child to his care. Well, it was hard for him. He basically has ZERO knowledge how to raise a kid. But he persevered, with the help of his dad and his mom. By and by, he changed, he even turned down a big job just to be a father. He thought, he has been a failure. As a husband, as a son and he wants to try not fail to be a father. This is a story of how a man learns to know the meaning of true love and its realities or lack thereof of happy endings. This is a journey of a boy and a man. If there's something I have learned about this book is that nobody is perfect. We all make mistakes one way or another, its just that men are far better in picking and worse mistakes. Men are men and they will always act like how they are programmed (y'know what I mean, right? I need not spell this out?). Another thing, it is understandable for ladies to feel hurt, betrayed and all that, but there should always be room for forgiveness. Even the biggest act of betrayal is forgivable. They make mistakes, so are the ladies. Let's face it, men will hurt women, they will say sorry and beg for forgiveness, that's no assurance that they will not hurt them again. Forgive and keep on fighting for true happiness, for happy endings doesn't just land in your lap, you have to work for it. ",2,0.9221,0.103,0.756,0.141,0.5402536848072562,POSITIVE,0.6565

47,1636759229,05/13/2016,4.0,"A love story of a completely different type, maybe unexpected, and it has not aged more than one single iota in the nearly twenty years that have elapsed since publication. It was adapted to television by and for the BBC. This iota has to do with the father’s attitude toward not getting primary residence for his son. Today courts are a lot more open on the question and some real sharing can be envisaged.But what makes this book special to the point of being translated into thirty languages? A lot of elements could be listed. I will just give a few.First the center piece of the novel is a young couple with a four year old child. The wife has sacrificed a career that she had never started to her family, a family that is so nuclear that she becomes a zombie from such nuclear fallout. Note even after six months of trying having such a career she will come back to the mould, request primary residence for her son and that will be it with maybe a second child later on with the new husband. As for the mother the book has tremendously aged. But back to the story line. She picks the first pretext she can find to run away. An easy task since boys will be boys and men will be men: they cannot escape the curse of the knob, as the husband Harry calls it, that makes them masculine. They have to rub it and to dip it into the first sheath available.Then the story centers on this man and his son. Harry learns how to take care of his son Pat. He becomes a single parent father. And he is successful at it. And yet the boy misses something. Guess what. The mother is in Japan having her own life with some Richard American expat, or something like that since it is not important who he is, his name, his position. He is just the man this frustrated woman picks to step back down into nuclear frustration. Poor Pat, and he is not the postman.Third, the author doubles this picture with a second mirror image, hence inverted which makes thing “normal” meaning straight. A woman, Cyd, an expat from Texas who has kicked her British BMW motorbike monster of a husband out of her immediate life and lives with her/their four year old daughter Peggy. Poor Peggy who is also missing something, a father probably. This makes the film utterly moralistic as for the definition of the parents of a child. There is no same sex marriage and no children with two fathers or two mothers, and children with single parents are seen as victims. A child has to have two parents and these have to be a man and a woman. Full stop! No question asked, hence no question answered. At the very end, in a club, there is a vague mention of gay men, but it sounds like some frustration on the part of the main character. Fourth. With that stuff the author makes a novel that is definitely new with some novel (new and not resembling something formerly known or used) ideas. It is true a lot less novel today. He now centers the novel on the father first and his efforts at becoming a true loving father and at providing his son with a new mother and a sister, Cyd and Peggy. But Cyd and Peggy are running away from such a choice, at least Cyd is, and Peggy follows. Pat just makes a new friend, but this time a boy whose identity is meaningless, except that we go back into a cliché: a boy with a boy, girls are for later.Yet the author avoids the soap opera with tears and whining mice and rats inter-devouring one another. Just one episode is important for the story: the relation of Pat with the parents of his father. The grandfather plays a role and particularly when he dies of cancer. The boy Pat at the age of five discovers death in a man he likes. Yet that loss is not exploited beyond the plain anecdote. For a child this age such an event is a trauma, and cannot be anything but a trauma. She child may be deeply disturbed, especially if he does not seem to be really shocked because he should. But of course it would have been another novel. So why introduce this death if it is not exploited? There is absolutely no reason why this grandfather has to die in this novel. It does not change the course of events at all, at least for the child. The novel at least avoids that possibility. So why mention the anecdote.Sixth. This death provides the “end” of the novel, but not in the child Pat, rather in the child Harry, because at this moment the father regresses to what he used to be as a child and he is deeply hurt, shocked and transformed by this death. Not on his own but thanks to the mother who has a tremendous power of adaptation. Harry’s mother goes through the funeral, survives her solitude and confides her secret to her surprised son. “Love means knowing when to let go.” Love then becomes a deep emotion that never leaves the one who lets go and it becomes the deepest inspiration for the one who goes, who is let to go, in this case Pat who is let to go by his father Harry. The book though does not seem to see the difference between letting go a dead man into death and letting go a child into a recomposed family. But I guess such contradictions are part of the genre. And the father drops all desire to get primary residence for his son and he lets the son’s mother and her recomposed family have it. Note the child becomes then a pure possession.This is heavily emphasized by the reference to the film “Cinema Paradiso” (Nuovo Cinema Paradiso, 1988) by Giuseppe Tornatore. Harry sees the film in a cinema with Cyd and the author summarizes it slightly skimpily: “. . . an Italian film . . . about a young boy’s friendship with the old projectionist at the local movie house. . . at the end when the gruff old projectionist, now blinded by a fire in the cinema, tells the Bambi-eyed young boy, now a teenager, to leave their village and never come back. The boy, Toto, goes away and becomes a famous film director and doesn’t come back to his little village for thirty years, on the day that they are burying Alfredo, the old projectionist who taught him to love the cinema and then sent him away. . . Because Alfredo knew that Toto would never find the things he needed in that little town. . . He had to break free so that he could learn what Alfredo already knew Life is not what you see in films – life is much harder. [dixit Cyd]” (p. 257-258)I regret the skimpiness of this summary because it misses absolutely everything important about the son Pat, because it cuts out Toto’s dead father, Toto’s sister nearly killed by a fire in the cinema, Toto’s mother, the two fire incidents in the cinema, the rebuilding of this cinema, Toto’s love affair with Elena, a rich man’s daughter, etc. In fact the film should have led the novel into another direction, but life is not what it looks like in films. Surely it is not, but the cinema teaches us great ideas and truths that life at times forgets to teach us and here the main idea is that Salvatore (Toto) has no father, needs a father substitute and finds one in Alfredo the projectionist. Toto is fascinated by the cinema (as an art and communicational medium) but his sister nearly dies in a fire in that local cinema (as a plain building that is inflammable). And Toto needs this father substitute to tell him: “OK, boy, it is time for you to go and realize your dream, live your life!” But Alfredo cheated in a way, and yet Salvatore would never have realized his dream of becoming a film director if Alfredo had not cheated and had not decided to lose a friend in order for that friend to become what his potential made him capable of becoming, and that future man will be able to hyg Alfredo on his deathbed if not in his coffin. To expand this theme let me quote the full synopsis of the film as given by the users of IMDb.“Beginning at the end, the movie opens with Salvatore's mother trying to inform him of the death of Alfredo. Salvatore, a filmmaker who has not been home since his youth, leaves Rome immediately to attend the funeral. Through flashbacks we watch Salvatore in his youth, in a post WWII town in Southern Italy. As a young boy he is called Toto and he has a strong affinity for the cinema. Toto often sneaks into the movie theater when he shouldn't and harasses the projectionist, Alfredo, in attempts to get splices of film that are cut out by the church because they contain scenes of kissing. Toto has a younger sister and war widowed mother who often struggle due to the loss of Toto's father. Toto is banned from the movie theater by his mother when his film bits accidentally catch fire and nearly kill his sister along with burning up the only picture Toto has of his father along with other family photographs. Eventually he sneaks his way back and forms a father-son bond with Alfredo, despite Alfredo's reluctancy, Toto even learns how to run the projector. Meanwhile one of the townspeople wins the lotto and becomes a rich man. One day in the cinema, after Toto leaves to watch the movie with his friends below, the film catches fire in the projector and knocks Alfredo out. Young Toto rescues Alfredo from death in the fire, unfortunately the cinema burns down and Alfredo loses his sight. Lucky the lotto-lucky-townsman pays to have a new cinema put up. Since Toto already knows how to run the projector he works with Alfredo in the projection room. Some years pass and Salvatore is now a young man. A rich girl, Elena, comes to town and Salvatore and his friends vie for her attention. Salvatore films her and begins to fall in love. Alfredo advises him to steer clear of love because it only causes pain. Despite his warning, Salvatore confesses his love to Elena, whose reply is that she does not, but she could. So he waits, every night outside her house for her reply. One day he gives up and trudges home depressed and upset only to soon discover that Elena does love him in return. They begin a passionate romance, like that of two newlyweds. Unfortunately, Elena's father doesn't approve and so he takes Elena away. All summer they try to meet, sometimes successfully, sometimes not. On one particular day he tries to reach her and she him but their paths don't cross. As we discover later, Alfredo catches Elena and convinces her to leave Salvatore alone out of love. Salvatore then wanders without purpose and eventually joins the military due to the requirement by Italian law that all male youths serve for a period of time in the army. When he returns to his home town, all has changed and he cannot adjust. Alfredo urges him to leave and tells him that if he were to ever return, he would not see him. Obviously Salvatore goes on to become a successful filmmaker. As he wanders the remains of his town after the funeral he sees a vision of Elena just as she was when they were young; he realizes it is Elena's daughter and follows her to Elena's home where he sees that she married one of Salvatore's childhood friends, a dunce when Salvatore knew him. He confronts Elena and they meet. They talk and she reveals to him that she didn't miss out on their fateful reunion but rather that Alfredo convinced her to leave. Salvatore realizes what a role Alfredo had in shaping his life and that Alfredo knew that if he stayed with Elena he would have no chance to pursue his love of film and so by going to Rome to become a filmmaker he sacrificed his love for Elena. Salvatore and Elena say farewell and go their separate ways. Salvatore returns to Rome with a can of film left to him by Alfredo. It contains all the splices of the kissing scenes from Salvatore's youth.” (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095765/s..., accessed May 13, 2016 )You can now realize how much the author missed, how many opportunities he missed on the side of Harry as well as on Toto’s side. The fact that Harry had been invited by Cyd to see that film with her in Soho is also extremely meaningful and the summary Cyd gives is so far from what is relevant: desire is one thing but it has no future in itself whereas love is not desire and it is able to see beyond the emotion the interest of the loved one who has to move away on his or her own road to eventually fulfill his or her promise, potential, future. We have our future in our own mind and brain but our body’s desires may tie us up so strongly at crucial moments in our lives that we miss the train and we reach the station too late. If we are lucky we can see the red lights of the train moving away and maybe learn a lesson for next time we try to catch a train: don’t linger satisfying your bodily functions and rush after your spiritual potential. Life is cruel if you do not do the latter. Life is beautiful if you do. I thus dedicate this review to a young man who has been my assistant for seven years and has to go on his own road. Don’t miss your train in the name of what is good now. Your train will not wait for you. Finally this novel has a happy ending for “everyone” though we could doubt the happiness of this ending but I won’t reveal it. It is good at times to run amok in a love story in modern garb, but please do not throw cobblestones on the pianist.

48,1030865399,08/19/2014,5.0,"*****************************************************************Harry should get custody of Pat. Harry has demonstrated excellent parenting skills by putting Pat first after Gina’s abandonment. Harry made sure that Pat felt comfortable at home and in school. He made sure Pat had friends to interact and have fun with. Harry was also willing to work out the marital problems he and Gina were experiencing. Harry never left Pat. Therefore, Harry should have equal rights and opportunities as a parent. Pat has two parents and considering Harry’s love and concern for Pat, Harry should be awarded custody of his child.	Harry has demonstrated good parenting skills by being present for Pat and taking care of his needs. When Harry loses his job as producer of the Marty Mann show he does not initially take another job so he can take care of Pat. Pat is having problems at the nursery school as a result of his mother leaving him and going to live in Japan. Harry receives a job offer as executive producer of a new television show with the comic, Eamon Fish. He goes to the interview with Pat and realizes he cannot work a full time job and take care of Pat. Once again Harry puts Pat first in his life. Only when Eamon arrives at his flat to ask him to work part time as a producer does Harry accept the position. Harry takes Pat out of nursery school when it is obvious Pat is having trouble. Harry let Pat do what was best for him at the time, clearly showing his understanding of his child’s needs. When Pat is almost five years old, Harry enrolls him in kindergarten. Pat makes his first friend, Peggy. Now he really enjoys it and is well adjusted because of how his father treated him. Harry also makes sure Pat is only with safe family members. Gina had wanted Pat to stay with her father who left Pat with his daughter Sally (from an abandoned marriage) and her boyfriend. Harry walks in and sees the boyfriend and Sally making out and smoking and removes Pat from the house. Instead of using Sally as a babysitter Harry lets Pat spend time with his own parents. Pat’s grandparents are wise and knowledgeable and love Pat, showing him a good time in a safe setting. Even when he needs more help Harry calls upon a family friend, Auntie Ethel, to help him. As a parent, Harry is a very good father.	Harry has a willingness to work on his marriage with Gina. Gina expresses no interest in any attempt to reconcile the differences in their marriage. Gina’s father’s “hippie womanizing” life style of abandoning children as he went along profoundly affects Gina and her attitude toward marriage. She felt that Harry’s one sexual encounter out of their marriage equated his behavior to her own father’s. Harry had become a womanizing beast in her mind. Even when Harry had shown he had just made a mistake and could hold up a nuclear family. It was Gina’s own fears as a child that made her marriage collapse and abandon her son. Gina then went to Japan to focus her career as an interpreter. Although Gina’s lawyers present her traveling to Japan to be the only opportunity for her to make a life and career for her and Pat; her abandonment of Pat shows a selfish, self centered, ego driven woman. While she is trying to get her career going and intending to send for Pat, Pat is suffering from the abandonment of his mother. Gina also is having an affair with a married businessman in Japan. Gina was a wonderful mother to Pat before her Japan adventure but she has now gone to the “dark side of the Force.” In question is her character, will she have another breakdown and ruin her life and Pat’s life? The issue of Pat being exposed to inappropriate music is an ironic one because Gina’s own stepsister, Sally gave it to Pat as a gift. Gina states that Pat is allowed to watch violent films unsupervised. Pat has been watching the Star Wars triology since he was quite young with permission from Gina. This is not an arguable issue since the Star Wars films are extremely violent for a young child to be exposed to. In reference to the Harry’s failure to provide a safe environment, this is also not relevant. The terrible biking accident that Pat experienced makes Gina feel that Harry is a bad parent. Any parent knows that anyone can look away for a split second and have their child suffer a serious injury. In no way does that event make Harry a negligent, irresponsible parent.	Fathers should have equal rights to the custody of a child. Typically, children are not given a voice in custody battles. Harry tries to give Pat such a voice. Pat feels safe and secure with Harry and had adjusted to Gina’s absence from his life. His success at kindergarten is evidence of this. “If very small children could speak, they would not choose to divide their lives in half. It is just not developmentally appropriate.” (McBroom, 1999). Pat wants to remain living with Harry. “We would look, first of all, to who is performing the actual parenting.” (University of California at Berkeley) In this case, Harry is performing the parenting as Gina has abandoned her son and is now off having an affair with a married man.	“The absence of a father from a child’s life can lead to a wide variety of negative behavioral and educational consequences.” (Larson, 2003).“Attachment refers to the strong emotional bond that develops between children and their primary caregivers… Establishing a stable, trusting relationship with a caregiver is an important component of early social development… Early attachment has a long term influence on children’s adjustment to school and social skills…” (Passer and Smith 473-475) Although the mother/son bond is important the father/son bond is equally important.In England, a parent no longer is granted “custody” according to the Children Act of 1989 but a residence order is issued. “Residency replaces custody as a way of removing the confrontational nature of deciding where a child lives. A residence order does not deprive any other person of parental responsibility. The law was changed to make it clear that a child is not a possession that can be won or lost. Under the terms of a residence order, a child lives with you. But a child does not belong to you.” (Parsons 298-299).Harry should be granted custody of Pat because he is a good father. Harry did not abandon Pat like Gina did, causing Pat emotional turmoil and the need to be taken out of nursery school. Harry is a loving, supportive and caring parent who puts Pat before everything else in his life (such as his career). Gina abandons not only Pat, but also the marriage, with absolutely no desire to keep the nuclear family intact. Harry is a man with much integrity. He shows it through his love for Pat and his willingness to do anything for him. Harry should be granted residency. Good fathers should have an equal chance.

49,1891661494,01/25/2017,5.0,"One of the major themes represented within this book has to be the theme of love. It doesn’t have to be necessarily the love between man and women; in this case it’s father and son. I really enjoyed how the novel Man and Boy portrays this theme in a very detailed manner when Harry is left alone to take care of his Pat. The father son relationship grows as Harry does everything he can to raise his child. The author was very powerful while describing the setting and characters in the first few chapters. The amount of detail put in the novel made the readers experience the story firsthand. In my opinion a story that has a great description of the settings and characters establishes its greatness from the first few chapters. Man and Boy had curiosity in almost every chapter, as the reader I was excited, curious and stayed glued to my seat wanting to know what happened in the next page.Although there are a lot of positive influences in this novel, there are also negatives which shouldn’t be ignored such as the ending being very fairy tale like and fake; also events in this novel happened suddenly. Normally to average humans it would take them time to get into another relationship after divorce, however Harry met a new lady and got married within a few months of his break up. This book makes it out to seem that in reality there is always a happy ending. However sometimes things don’t end up in a fairy tale style ending. Man and Boy is a novel with a roller-coaster of emotions, describing feelings and mental thought process in an extraordinary way. The novel showcases the importance of strength within a relationship and the importance of a relationship. This novel appealed to me because of all the drama, romance and plot twists it had stored within it. The novel started of very boring and randomly took a twist making it very interesting. Personally I was satisfied with this book. If you are interested in a novel with romance, corruption, plot twists and drama, this novel will be a good read for you.",0,0.9971,0.025,0.761,0.214,0.5600490196078431,POSITIVE,0.9879
50,3102735055,12/29/2019,3.0,"This novel is an emotional roller -coaster. To book lovers who wants to break free from the reality and relax in a fantasy, this novel is too real and that eventually infuriates the audience and that reflects in many reviews. The novel captures the essence of father son bond which acts as a page turner. The novel also takes a stand in love, propagating true love is the willingness to let it go. the protagonist Harry Silver is selfish in his own ways and his ways of categorizing people as beautiful and ugly makes him shallow and also he is a textbook romantic kinda man and not to forget that he cheats his wife and never feels guilty about it and he hides it from possibly everyone starting from his parents,his lover and eventually his lawyer, yet, for some reason he tries to justify his actions and plays victim and every time the author tries to glorify the protagonist, he terribly fails. he is not perfect but custom made for his life with his son Pat, his father Patrick and his love Cyd and with them he seems fine and even perfect in certain circumstances.Thus making him a perfect blend of positives and negatives and perhaps,all of it is too real, thus it bothers many. The novel also plays around many real emotions like divorce, death, parenthood. The writing of Tony Parsons is impeccable, even when one dislike a certain character, one has to remember that the outburst of emotions is because of the amazing reality that is created by the author and his writing. In the end one would close the book loving the author for creating the reality within fiction and absolutely hating the reality of the novel and the characters. IF YOU ARE STILL CONFUSED WHETHER TO READ THIS NOVEL OR NOT, Let me put it bluntly, if you are willing to go against reality once again in your magical reading room, go for it.

If we had loved each other so much, then why hadn’t it lasted? Was it really impossible for two people to stay together forever in the lousy modern world?’ (following his logic, it would be possible if he didn't cheat or she would be fine with him sleeping around)‘But I wasn’t ready to grow old and cold, hating women and the world because of what had happened to me.’ (what happened was that his wife didn't forgive him cheating)‘And I don’t want her to meet a boyfriend until I’ve been seeing him for a while.

But, once I got past the halfway mark, and felt a few jolts from my own life coincide with his, Harry Silver's, I realized this isn't all that bad. In fact, this could be pretty great, if you're massaging a few wounds. Harry Silver cheats on his wife of twelve years. And she leaves the very next day, of course she does, to get back the life she gave up to be with him. When you're trying to undo some past decisions, you can't honor a few others, too. So, their son gets left behind with Harry, no questions answered. And the book's about Harry trying to cope with this new change. He gets fired soon after. A few deaths added into the mix.

The book started with (SPOILER AHEAD OBVIOUSLY)Harry Silver facing a mid-life crisis with the sinking feeling that he was becoming old and no one likes losing the freedom and wildness of youth as it is. But life happens; you marry the girl who you think was out of your league, you manage to stay with her for a long time, your parents love her and you even have a son. Your wife has given up her career to take care of your son and life is smooth. But when peeking closer, you see that the spark of romance & intimacy is veiled (not to say lost)by a series of responsibilities & other things. You love your wife, you love your son. You have a perfect life. But it is obviously no more the same. You don't get it. What happened? So yeah, after one really rough & fucked up day at work, you dropped that one pretty coworker who asked for a lift and thats it; you go upstairs for a drink and fuck around. One-night stand; thats the word.Everything changes from there. The wife (Gina) leaves and then comes Pat, their beloved son. The drama happening in between didnt really caught my attention at times as I was quickly bored.. But thats real life drama. Such things happen. Harry fucking around while still loving his wife and then later on regretting & realising that he did such a fucking stupid mistake is typical of many married men in their 30s. This book is actually a mature story with real life drama. When Harry & Gina were splitting up; Gina told Harry 'I love you but I'm not in love with you.'Harry goes like: ""You love me but you're not in love with me? Whats that supposed to mean?""Gina replies: ""Love is what's left when being in love has gone, okay? It's when you care about someone and you hope they're happy but you're not under any illusions about them. Maybe that kind of love is not exciting and passionate and all those things fade with time. All those things that you're so keen on. But in the end, it's the only kind of love that really matters.""So, the book goes on with Harry, broken and trying hard to fix things in his life. He already lost his job and eventually got another job later but along the way, he was having a hard time esp. in regards to Pat. It was beautiful to see Harry become wise. I really felt for him. During your 30s, you dont mature, you become wiser instead. And Harry did a good job in gradually learning how to take care of Pat. Life gets sweeter and complicated after meeting Cyd, an American woman with her daughter Peggy. The intense drama illustrates how grown ups can complicate things in a relationship when they act like a 20/25 year old man. At a certain age, love obviously does not remain the same; it evolves but it's still there. Getting used to routine is what possibly makes things dull, boring and no more exciting in the relationship. Honestly, at first I hated Harry for being a typical man but later, I discovered he was only human and was hurting so much. This made me realise that loneliness is so underrated. Everyone(including men) needs some loving; it's not always about shagging. :)Finally why I gave the book 4 stars is because the few last chapters really tore me. I felt my heart pinch, seriously. Harrys dad death and Harry handing Pat over to Gina. These 2 events changed my perspective on many things. Family; the one bond of love that will last in forever terms. Everything was beautifully told. During the funeral, Harrys mom chose this song (lyrics ahead):Someday,when im awfully low,when the world is cold,I will feel a glowJust thinking of you,And the way you looked tonight.And the most beautiful lesson to end: Harrys mom - But you have to learn to let go. That's part of it, isnt it?Harry - Part of what?Harrys mom - Part of what it means to love someone. To really love someone. If you love someone then you dont just see them as an extension of yourself. You don't just love them for what's in it for you.And Harrys good old mom then had tears shining in her blue eyes.""Love means knowing when to let go""This was my moment of contemplation. I cherished this part most of all.And, I was happy how the story ended. It kinda tells me that there's still hope and faith in humanity.

169,1172736156,01/18/2015,5.0,"Man and BoyThe book takes place in the late 90’s in London, England. A few months before his 30th birthday, Harry was living the American dream. He had a beautiful wife named Gina, a luxurious red MGF sports car that average men dreamt of having, he was a successful TV producer and had his own Live TV show and to top it all off he had an adorable 4 year old boy named Pat. Till now everything was perfect for Harry; he had everything a man wanted. Everything changed one night when Harry unknowingly abolished everything. One night on his TV show, they brought in a new guest and things didn’t go the way Harry and his staff wanted it to. This incident gave Harry a lot of work stress which eventually led to a one night stand between Harry and his co-worker Siobhan. This changed everything for Harry, Gina found out and decided to walk out on Harry leaving him with the 4 year old Pat. Gina shifted back to Japan in hopes to become a Bank Translator. It gets worse for Harry as he loses his job and becomes an unemployed single parent. Doing everything he can to raise Pat Harry has to deal with his wife’s divorce request and fight for the custody of Pat. When Gina returns from Japan, Harry and Gina agree that after Gina settles in Japan, Pat will be sent to live with his mother. Slowly everything comes together for Harry; he meets a new lady named Cyd and decided to marry her. He got a new job as TV producer for another company and managed his time between working and spending time with Pat. 	One of the major themes represented within this book has to be the theme of love. It doesn’t have to be necessarily the love between man and women; in this case it’s father and son. I really enjoyed how the novel Man and Boy portrays this theme in a very detailed manner when Harry is left alone to take care of his Pat. The father son relationship grows as Harry does everything he can to raise his child. The author was very powerful while describing the setting and characters in the first few chapters. The amount of detail put in the novel made the readers experience the story firsthand. In my opinion a story that has a great description of the settings and characters establishes its greatness from the first few chapters. Man and Boy had curiosity in almost every chapter, as the reader I was excited, curious and stayed glued to my seat wanting to know what happened in the next page. 	Although there are a lot of positive influences in this novel, there are also negatives which shouldn’t be ignored such as the ending being very fairy tale like and fake; also events in this novel happened suddenly. Normally to average humans it would take them time to get into another relationship after divorce, however Harry met a new lady and got married within a few months of his break up. This book makes it out to seem that in reality there is always a happy ending. However sometimes things don’t end up in a fairy tale style ending. 	Man and Boy is a novel with a roller-coaster of emotions, describing feelings and mental thought process in an extraordinary way. The novel showcases the importance of strength within a relationship and the importance of a relationship. This novel appealed to me because of all the drama, romance and plot twists it had stored within it. The novel started of very boring and randomly took a twist making it very interesting. Personally I was satisfied with this book. If you are interested in a novel with romance, corruption, plot twists and drama, this novel will be a good read for you.",0,0.9979,0.03,0.812,0.158,0.5205191007822587,POSITIVE,0.9775

175,252357219,12/28/2011,3.0,"[Some spoilers, but very early in the book and also discussed in the book's own blurb.]Man and Boy is a book about relationships, love, and the difficulties when your life doesn't quite go to plan. I think I would place this book in a genre of 'emotional' writing that deals with life events that happen to a lot of people (marriage, break ups, children, death, family). Despite the main character, Harry, being male, I do think this book is predominantly aimed at a female audience. That's not to say that all women will enjoy it, or that all men wouldn't, but I feel that this genre of writing is seen as more female-oriented. The main relationships in the story are those between Harry and his father, a fairly traditional man who is tough (his tattoos are constantly mentioned), and between Harry and his young son Pat. I found that these two relationships were very well-written, emotive, and touching stories. I found that my main problems with the book came when Harry's relationships with women were discussed. His marriage breaks down early on and his wife moves to Japan. I felt that the descriptions of this felt like exactly what they were: a precursor to the author's desire to describe the father-son relationship and have a little tug on our heartstrings. I think this is why Harry's brief encounter with a colleague and his wife's discovery of it seem to cover so few pages; this seems strange in a book that deals with emotional/traumatic life events. I did not particularly enjoy this part of the book, although perhaps both Gina and Harry's actions would be more familiar and empathetic to readers who had their own children, especially if arguments surrounding custody were involved.Overall I found that the bits that really did make me cry & laugh (as the blurb/reviews promised) were the parts nearer the end between Harry and his father, perhaps because I can see parts of my own relationships with my dad/grandad in the text. A quick read (I steamed through it in about 4 hours cover to cover), but still enjoyable and emotive. I think the book achieved what it set out to do.",0,0.9206,0.062,0.85,0.088,0.4660457516339869,NEGATIVE,0.8735

He has that same earthy, 'call a spade a bloody spade' quality that is missing from too much of our modern air kissing Z list celebrity world. So when I saw his book, 'Man And Boy' in my local Acorns charity shop for £1 it was a no brainer. It is the best £1 I've spent in a long time - apart from seeing that the book is fifteen years old ! Surely not ?But it has aged well and didn't let me down. His descriptions of family life and growing up in the 60s in working class England is my world.

Losing site of the real world and chasing the greener grass that doesn't existThis book is funny, sad, touching, melancholy, bitter. All human life on the page.Tony Parsons has an all seeing eye that recognises the human condition and writes it into a page turner of a book.

Many years ago I had cause to write to Tony Parsons after something he'd written in his newspaper column. (I can't even remember what.) Several weeks later I got a charming hand written reply on a holiday postcard. It looked as though he'd interrupted his holiday to respond to a stranger. How many 'celebs' would do that ?

177,2800504987,04/27/2019,4.0,"For me this book was a thoroughly great read and I just didn't want to put it down until it was finished. Well written and engaging, there were so many poignant moments but in addition, there was a scattering of laugh-out-loud parts too. The story around his father's funeral and the realisations it brought out in Harry were superb and highly in touch with reality - so many readers will be able to identify with such an unfortunate and inevitable part of life. The journey he goes through with his young son which ultimately leads his unselfish decision to allow his ex-wife full residency was highly touching and this will resonate strongly with any fathers out there, especially ones with broken families.There is a kind a sadness associated with the book around the fact that modern life seems to be so tolerant of married couples giving up on each other, with children often being the main victims as a result. It may seem obvious but if couples were able to see the negative impact brought upon children from separation, surely they would think twice about having them in the first place - at least until they are reasonably sure they are able to make a life together first.Harry does succumb to adultery in the form of a one night stand at the start of the book - an action which might automatically cause the reader to believe that he deserves everything he gets. However it is pretty much impossible to maintain such a feeling as we unravel his character through the story. His moral and often unselfish behaviour on multiple occasions is highly admirable. This is also supported by the fact that his wife Gina really did seem to be looking for any excuse to get away from things and live her own life.In summary, a highly enjoyable but also important read for anyone who might be considering giving up on their family. Furthermore, well worth reading for couples who have not yet brought children into the world.",0,0.9894,0.064,0.768,0.168,0.5684057971014493,POSITIVE,0.9998

His life is perfect as it is but he manages to mess it up in one night when he has a one night stand and his lovely wife finds out and leaves him. This is the beginning of the book and it certainly did not make me warm to the main character. I cannot stand men who have a midlife crisis and need to fill their lives with something else, plus 30 is way too young for this self pitying nonsense! Also, Harry never considered that his wife might be unhappy looking after their son everyday and giving up her career.

179,1654331077,05/31/2016,2.0,"I really didn’t enjoy this book very much. It’s now over a month since I finished it and I can’t remember many details. Cynically, about the only thing I remember thinking is that this just seemed to me like a man jumping on the chick lit bandwagon. I couldn’t get away from the feeling that this book was the equivalent of a man borrowing his friend’s puppy to pick up women in the park – as if the author felt that there’s a lot of money to be made in that genre and it surely can’t be that hard. Or even that he made a bet with a friend that he could write a proper chick lit book from the perspective of a single dad and have all the women swooning and empathizing with him – as though to prove that women as a demographic are that simple to manipulate.That aside, assuming this author’s intentions were innocent, this book did not make much of an impression. It had a very simple rom com plot and set of characters and very few saving graces. To summarize for myself… the main character is nearing 30 and has been married for quite a while to a woman who had wanted to be a Japanese translator. They have a very cute son together. The man works for a shock-jock type TV talk show. He inexplicably sleeps with a co-worker and causes his marriage to fall apart. His wife, who had (resentfully) carried the brunt of the child-rearing responsibilities, goes off to Japan to see whether she can revive her career. The father becomes the primary parent in his son’s life and it, of course, changes him. Meanwhile he meets an American manic pixie dream girl who is waiting tables and has some very sassy one-liners.

Everything is looking up to Harry Silver – he has a beautiful wife, a young son and a great career, so why did he let it all go? or more appropriately HOW can he let it all go?

At that moment, I just felt like putting the book down and stop there. If it is about infidelity, regrets and wallowing in self-pity then I just don’t want to know.But as I continue reading the book, it became clear that Harry ‘grew up’ (though in my opinion in a passive way) and learn more about parenting, about being a son to his loving and supporting parents, and about love. . . if you really love that someone, you need to know when to let it go and when not to let it slip away.It has a happy ending, but as I try to put myself in Harry’s shoe, I can’t help but to wonder if he would make another silly mistake once his new life gets too monotonous or too complicated? Will he still question about life not being perfect all the time? After all, he is too much a romantic at heart to sometimes be realistic.The book is easy to read. And it felt real.

You just feel that you know him, if only you could place where you know him from.
