0,23587244,06/03/2008,4.0,"Angels & Demons (Robert Langdon #1), Dan BrownAngels & Demons is a 2000 bestselling mystery-thriller novel written by American author Dan Brown. The novel introduces the character Robert Langdon, who recurs as the protagonist of Brown's subsequent novels. Angels & Demons shares many stylistic literary elements with its sequels, such as conspiracies of secret societies, a single-day time frame, and the Catholic Church. CERN director Maximilian Kohler discovers one of the facility's top physicists, Leonardo Vetra, murdered, his chest branded with an ambigram of the word ""Illuminati."" Kohler contacts Robert Langdon, an expert on the Illuminati, who determines that the ambigram is authentic. Kohler calls Vetra's adopted daughter Vittoria home and it is ascertained that the Illuminati, an ancient anti-religious organization thought extinct, have stolen a canister containing antimatter, a substance with destructive potential comparable to a nuclear weapon. When at CERN, the canister is stored in a unique electrical charger which ensures the antimatter's stability, but when removed, its backup battery provides power for 24 hours, after which the antimatter would fall out of suspension and, on coming into contact with the physical matter of the container, explode. The canister is located somewhere in Vatican City, with a security camera in front of it, as its digital clock counts down to an explosion due to occur at midnight, which will wipe out the Vatican.Langdon and Vittoria make their way to Vatican City, where the Pope has recently died. They are told that the four Preferiti, the cardinals who are most likely to be elected pope, are missing. Langdon and Vittoria search for the preferiti in hopes that they will also find the antimatter canister. Their search is assisted by Camerlengo Carlo Ventresca (the late pope's closest aide), the Vatican's Swiss Guard and Commander Olivetti. ...عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «شیاطین و فرشتگان»؛ «فرشتگان و شیاطین»؛ نویسنده: دن براون؛ تاریخ نخستین خوان: یکی از روزهای سال2007میلادیعنوان: شیاطین و فرشتگان؛ نویسنده: دن براون؛ مترجم: نوشین ریشهری؛ تهران، نگارینه، 1385؛ در 488ص؛ چاپ دوم: تهران، نگارینه، 1395؛ در572ص، شابک 9789647533287؛ موضوع: داستانهای نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده 21معنوان: فرشتگان و شیاطین؛ نویسنده: دن براون؛ مترجم: علیرضا صدیقی؛ تهران، نشر گستر، 1389 در در 554ص، شابک 9786005883183؛ شخصیت «رابرت لانگدون»، و احساسات افراطی او، در باره ی هنر، سمبل شناسی، رمزها، جوامع پنهان، و مناطق خاکستری بین خوبی و بدی، رمان حاضر را شکل داده است، «دن براون» نویسنده ای بسیار باهوش هستند؛هشدار و اخطار: اگر کتاب را نخوانده اید و میخواهید بخوانید بهتر است ادامه ی نگاره را نخوانید؛چکیده: استاد نمادشناسی دانشگاه «هاروارد»، با همراهی دانشمندی زیبا و مرموز به نام: «ویتوریا وترا»، در مورد ارتباط کشتن یک فیزیکدان در «سرن»، با یک گروه باستانی به نام «اشراقیون»، و رابطه ی آنها با «واتیکان» پژوهش می‌کنند؛ که منجر به دفع یک توطئه توسط اشراقیون می‌شود؛ آنها در نظر دارند، تا «واتیکان» را به هنگام جلسه ی گزینش «پاپ»، منفجر کنند؛ آن دو به کشفی نامعقول، کشفی در درون دخمه‌ های مهر و موم شده ی ترسناک، مقبره‌ های خطرناک، کلیساهای متروک، و اسرارآمیزترین سرداب روی زمین، پناهگاه فراموش شده ی اشراقیون، دست مییابندتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 28/06/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 01/06/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی",233,-0.6542,0.033,0.939,0.028,0.4366702741702742,POSITIVE,0.9152

This is a MASTERPIECE indeed. I read this in like two sittings. All 710 pages of oversized print.I was soooo hooked I recalled many other lesser books that have riveted me. This one is so incredibly put together, it is no wonder Brown has been heralded by the general readership, ingrained in the zeitgeist.The awesomeness of this work lies in the battle between science and religion, perhaps one of the most seminal works about that topic. It explores this duality literally, symbolically... every which way. That they are married, both science and religion, is the thesis.

3,4561216,08/14/2007,1.0,"I read this after the drivel that is called ""Da Vinci Code."" I decided to give the author another chance, and take on something that maybe wasn't so formulaic. No dice. I am convinced that Dan Brown does absolutely no research into the subjects he writes about. Or if he does, he decides it is not ""titilating enough for him"" so he makes it up. I mean why even include actual real things in his books if he chooses to ignore any facts about them. Opus Dei? I doubt he could spell it. Catholic Church? Has he even read any history about the Catholic Church at all? His descriptions of the Church seem to be based on whatever anti-Catholic propoganda he could find, Chick Tracts, and superstition. So it comes to no surprise that he has 2 massive bestsellers that are more or less, anti-Catholic. Cuz you know, Catholic baiting and prejudice to the Catholic Church is the only real acceptable prejudice left. The underlying superstition and hostility towards Catholicism, priests, the Pope, Vatican, etc is very close to the same sentiments that lingered in the decades and centuries before WWII in Europe. Think I am overreacting? If someone wrote these books but instead baited the Jews or Muslims there would be a huge outcry. Bashing Catholics and depicting them and their history in the way Dan Brown does in these books is outrageous and should be criticized and shunned. And I didn't even delve into how awful of a writer he is, did I? The only thing more embarassing than his writing that will never be remembered 20 years from now, is the fact that so many people bought into his piece of shit and wasted their time with it. Including respectable people like Tom Hanks and Ron Howard. There's time you will never get back again. Congrats! ",208,-0.9581,0.117,0.816,0.067,0.4421130952380952,NEGATIVE,1.0

""Listen carefully. I'm about to change your life.""
Not really 😅I've been receiving a ton of recommendations to read Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code for a few years now, and after finding out it was actually the second book in a series, I've thought of starting things properly with the first book, bringing me to Angels and Demons. I'm a little new to thriller books in general, making Angels and Demons a refreshing experience to begin that journey, especially compared to intricate world building I'm used to with fantasy books.
""Information is only as valuable as its source.""
I think it's safe to say that there is no lack of drama, suspense, and twists throughout the book, making the reading experience somewhat addictive. The narrative is super fast paced, most content spread over a matter of hours, resulting in an further enhancement of aforementioned qualities. Brown clearly and easily exceeded most reader's expectations when it comes to the protaganist in my opinion, Robert Langdon, a realistic character which is ideal for a story like this in my opinion. I'm glad he didn't go for an overpowered lead character, instead opting for maintaining a good balance with Langdon's abilities and shortcomings. Rest of the cast isn't that far behind either, with numerous twisters around every corner making them re-appear in different light throughout the story. As for the plot itself, bringing different threads together was well executed, but it wasn't the best I've seen, since there were some loopholes here and there if one was to look closely. But overall, I'm quite happy with the plot and the set of characters here.
""Our minds sometimes see what our hearts wish were true.""
Another (hopefully good) thing that most readers are going to notice is how the author had gone to extreme lengths in describing intricate architecture in and around Vatican City. It felt like a detaild virtual tour, and was a nice surprise for me. What did NOT come as pleasant is the frequent use of Italian phrasing, but I think I might be in the minority here. 
""Thge most dangerous enemy is that which no one fears.""
However with all that, I didn't feel like the book is beyond 3.5-stars, and the rounding up to 4 is mostly due to this being one of my first books from the genre. I'm quite certain a second read through could actually bring it down to 3-stars. Had I being an atheist, things would've been somewhat different (still not 5-stars though), as I could see most of the stuff here being appealing to atheism. But it doesn't mean that others could easily enjoy the book, for, I believe Brown's walking a fine line even with everything going here, especially using the underlying system of belief of the protagonist himself to keep the atheism in check.

5,2656678940,03/31/2020,4.0,"How did secret societies, associations, cults, and shadow cabinets influence human history and how evolved the first few stone age groups of chief, medicine man, dealer, and strongest soldier until today and will develop in the future?  It´s not just the realm of religion that has had its fake news problem since the first primitive cults and sects tens of thousands of years or even longer ago, it´s each field of human activity that was, can, and will be influenced by the dark forces in the background, the puppetmasters influencing the fate of both tribes of thousands or states of billions.  I can´t say much about the epic, endless science vs faith battle, because I am biased as heck and it would go against the obligation of a responsible reviewer to add too much subjective.. Go science, show who is the boss, yes, keep using that chokehold,… A subjective interpretation: I am reading nonfiction for soon over 20 years and must say that much that has been deemed impossible, wrong, or lies, became true and influenced the lives of everyone in massive ways. In light of the fact that there is said that the lucky ones of us are living in so called enlightened democracies, one could reverse engineer history and guess how much of, well, everything could be wrong, lies, and pure fiction. That it´s the opposite, that many of the weirdo theories about the present and future are the truth and much of what is written in history books are lies.  I don´t understand the Brown bashing of some people, many authors don´t really care much about the rules of writing or create average quality of consistency, logic, dialogues, and stuff and don´t get criticized for it. It might be possible that it´s more the inconvenient topics Browns is using that are activating the bite reflexes and reactionary mental programs. The fast paced writing style with many different settings, fine infodumps, cliffhangers, and everything similar to a well written Hollywood blockbuster is nothing people are ranting about as long as it´s not controversial. It´s possible that the new editions of the book have been edited and corrected ( I don´t know), as there are some errors regarding the possibility of the involved physics and technology and wrong descriptions. But as I know publishing houses, they probably still haven´t invested the money to fix the bugs, even in a multi million selling world bestseller.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real life outside books: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspir...",160,0.1494,0.08,0.835,0.085,0.5010489510489509,NEGATIVE,0.9763
6,826614975,01/17/2014,2.0,"Dan Brown writes trash, but sometimes trash can have a certain allure. Sometimes trash sucks you in as you feel forced to reach the bottom of the rubbish pile and see what secrets it may be hiding. And that’s the strongest aspect of his writing, the pull. Say what you want about the crazily outlandish plot that’s built upon a nest of poor research and flat characters. Say what you want about the anti-Catholic undertones and the semi-racist portrayal of the antagonist, there’s no denying the intensity of the writing. This is a real page turner, the kind that keeps you reading until three in the morning and makes you want to skip to the end of the book just to see what’s happening. And it’s so entertaining like all good trash should be. Critically speaking, there is so much wrong with this book but I can’t deny how successful it is at keeping the reader involved. It creates so many ridiculous questions that just need to be answered. I stormed through this book at lightning speed.Looking back though, it is very easy to see the faults. Dan Brown hooks his reader, using mystery and suspense as bait, and it is so very easy to bite on the line. Though as every fish knows, once you’ve been netted life only gets worse. This is a book of very cheap thrills, which can be addictive but will only ever be cheap.",156,0.1257,0.155,0.682,0.163,0.6856845238095238,POSITIVE,0.9982

8,8072481,10/22/2007,2.0,"This was Brown's book before the infamous ""The Da Vinci Code."" In many ways, this book was like a rough draft for ""The Da Vinci Code"", same character Langdon, same other characters, same basic start, same concepts, same bad research passed off as fact, same trick of having nearly every chapter end in cliffhanger, the same in so many ways.Sadly, I think he did a better job the first time around. I recommend you have a computer handy so you look up what Brown is talking about, and that way you can have a better idea of what it really looks like. Added bonus too, you can have a laugh over how Brown had to forced it into his world to make the plot somewhat cohesive. Look, if you want to write fiction, do so but please own up to it being fiction! Trying to pass off the Ecstasy of St. Theresa as being so pornographic in nature that the Vatican had it exiled to a small church, is, well, wrong as wrong as gets.Brown throws out a number of stunningly stupid statements, like asserting that since Christianity is syncretic, God-eating (the Holy Communion) was taken from the Aztecs. How, Brown never explains, since the practice was established by Christ himself during the Last Supper around 33 A.D. and the Aztecs didn't show up until 1248 A.D. I figure Brown left it open so he could write some sort of time travel book, involving a long lost secret that the Aztecs built their pyramids as sort of a dry run, traveled back in time and were actually behind the pyramids in Egypt. And, of course, were the sect that created the Christ-myth due to a poorly thought out plot.Thanks to the internet, you too can have fun poking holes in the book. See, for example, CERN's site on the book. And if that doesn't do it for you, here's a good site looking into all the errors.A sample from the last site:""While walking around the CERN campus, Langdon notices a marble column incorrectly labeled Ionic. Langdon points the mistake out to Kohler: ""That column isn't Ionic. Ionic columns are uniform in width. That one's tapered. It's a Doric -- the Greek counterpart."" (26) The problem is that Ionic columns are themselves Greek. The three orders of classical columns, Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian, are all Greek in origin, so it's impossible for the Doric order to the be the Greek counterpart of the Ionic. It's also much easier to distinguish the Doric from the Ionic based on their capitals; Doric columns have plain capitals, while Ionic columns are topped by volutes or scrolls.""That irked me when I read that passage, because not only is a poor joke, it doesn't make sense! Let's ignore the bad, the erroneous, and the ugly, and you have decent little thriller zipping around Rome looking at art. Of course, it has to zip along, slow down long enough to think about it, and a host of questions start to swarm up. Like how Langdon has a whole theory on who the bad guy is and how Langdon was involved in these rather preposterous circumstances. Of course, the premise is wrong, so that that whole house of cards fall down. Not bad in of itself, but then Brown doesn't ever provide any reason Langdon was involved after that.Of course, you aren't supposed to notice while reading it, and preferably not afterwards, either. Doing so reveals how badly Brown writes. He can't provide a single decent reason why his hero is there, aside from a vague ""Because"" and a shrug.I'm envious of Brown, he can't write well, has plot holes big enough to drive the Popemobile through, bad research and ""facts"" that aren't, and yet still is entertaining, popular and, most galling perhaps, published.Caveat lector.",110,-0.8281,0.101,0.799,0.1,0.4466560846560847,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Review

4+ out of 5 stars to Dan Brown's Angels & Demons, the first book in his ""Robert Langdon"" thriller series. When I saw the movie trailer for The Da Vinci Code, I was hooked and immediately bought the book so I could read it first. When I got home, I realized it was not the first in the series...I refused to read it... and then I went to the store and got the first one, Angels & Demons, so I could read them in order. And while it's not really necessary, I always follow the order (unless I have an ARC with a due date on a newer book and no time to get to the whole series). So I started Angels & Demons, and I was was simply blown away.Not everyone loves Dan Brown, and people aren't always kind, but man... I LOVE HIS BOOKS! And I'm not afraid to say it... so if you don't like them... don't be hating on this review because I willOn a more serious note, the climax with each of the murders, the deep connections to so many Catholic rituals and ceremonies, the brilliance of the chase... it just left me unable to stop reading it. It's exactly the kind of book I like to read:1. Has some connection to me -- I'm Catholic and knew most of the stuff they were talking about2. I love reading about murder -- since I won't do it in real life, I have to get my thrills somehow3. Secrets are the best thing in the world -- I have so many about others, but I never let anyone have one about me4. Classic battle of good versus evil -- This is my life. Should I be good or bad today? Ugh... Sophie's catch #22...5. It's non-stop thought-provoking messages and themes -- How much control and time do we really have right now?Oh, that's the spot baby![image error]And with that said... if you want a real review with details about the story, go find someone else's! Today was all about just being excited to think about the book again. Now that said, I thought Da Vinci Code was a slight bit better, hence the 4 here.Ciao! I've got some branding to do...

10,693287876,08/12/2013,3.0,"When a physicist/priest is murdered, the word Illuminati branded into his chest, and a quarter-gram of antimatter stolen, it's up to renowned symbologist Robert Langdon to find the goods and the murderer. But can he stop someone from using the antimatter as a weapon, even with hot physicist Vittoria Vetra in tow?After all the hype, I managed to dodge this bullet for over a decade but when my girlfriend caught me in a vulnerable moment between books, I knew the time had come. Overall, it was a fun read. It reminded me of a high tech Indiana Jones a lot of the time. However, at the end of the day, it was pretty much a by the numbers thriller, complete with forced sexual tension.Like I said, it's pretty Indiana Jones-ish, except instead of an archaeologist who has crazy globe-trotting adventures, Langdon is a symbologist who has crazy globe-trotting adventures.As much as I want to hate on this book, it's a page turner; Short chapters, nearly all of them ending on a cliffhanger. However, even for a thriller of this type, the plot seems a little overly complicated. A centuries old secret society is going to use some stolen antimatter to blow up the Vatican? Wouldn't it be easier to get a surplus nuke from the former Soviet Union?The writing is so cheesy and over-dramatic I can't help but be amused. It's really pulpy but not in the good Raymond Chandler way. More like an early Doc Savage. Seriously, Langdon could have said ""I'll be super-amalgamated"" and it wouldn't have felt that out of place. It almost feels like Brown was trying to do a Black Dynamite-style commentary/spoof on conspiracy thrillers.One thing I didn't enjoy is that the book suffers from ""I did a bit of research so I'm going to cram it all in the dialogue"" syndrome. There are infodumps galore and lots of redundant information, mostly about symbology. I'm not going to touch on the things that weren't researched and are erroneous since most movies have equally shitty fact checking.I guess I'll rate it 3 stars. It's not well written or to any degree believable but it's a fun and exciting read, like a pack of Skittles for your brain. Not good but definitely entertaining. Not only that, Dan Brown's milkshake brings all the boys to the yard.

11,19013712,03/30/2008,5.0,"Angels and Demons by Dan Brown was one of the best page-turners I have ever read. From the very beginning I couldn’t put it down. I did not know where Dan Brown would take the story next. Following the main character Robert Langdon, a Harvard symbologist on his first great adventure was breathtaking. I wanted to learn more, to know the secrets of the Illuminati and the only way to do it was to let the story naturally unfold as I read. I can usually guess what is going to happen in thrillers, but Dan Brown did a wonderful job keeping everything a mystery until absolutely necessary to reveal the secrets. I first read the book on a flight from Seattle to Rome, with a few places in between. Never having read the Da Vinci Code before hand I didn’t have as high of expectations as most people do when going to read Angels and Demons. I have often heard that the Da Vinci Code is much better than Angels and Demons but I disagree. Angels and Demons is Dan Brown at his best. I love how he took historical events, places, art and turned them upside down into a thriller that left me wanting more. Dan Brown not only wrote a good novel but he also brought up the old argument of Science vs. Religion. Both sides of the argument are thoughtfully brought up in Angels and Demons and in the end it is up to the reader to decide which side they believe is the right path for them. I love that he didn’t try and persuade the reader of his view on the subject but instead put the evidence and arguments out there for us to make up our own minds. Having traveled to Rome and seeing the places talked about in the novel Dan Brown did a wonderful job putting the readers in the places talked about. As I walked the path of Robert Langdon it seemed even more real to me that events as radical as the illuminati pulled off in the book could have actually happened, giving more power to the fast paced adventure.

12,26262643,07/03/2008,2.0,"So I honestly want to give the book three stars. What I enjoy about Brown is how he can write almost 600 pages of a book and I get almost to the end and realize that it has taken place all in the space of one day. As a writer, I would love to be able to do that. The weaving of religious and scientific themes into an adventure set in European locales is also right up my alley. What I don't like... and why I am forced to drop down to two stars (just a few examples): That same time stretching often results in a parceling of time that is terribly irritating - most of the book actually isn't just in less than one day but in about four to five hours. Unfortunately, in one part of the book, given twenty minutes, the protagonists can, say, drink tea and eat scones, talk at length about their theories about what's happening, run from one location to another, save someone, and research an important historical fact. But during another twenty minutes, they don't seem to have enough time to, say, run the length of a block and enter a building. It must be difficult as an author to keep track of this sort of incongruity but this is Brown's special trick and it's irritating that he can't follow his own rules. It needs to be either one way or the other but not both. Every few chapters, he seems to feel the need to reintroduce his main protagonist by first and last name, ""Robert Langdon stood in front of the church...""; like we haven't met this character yet for every single paragraph for the last 126 chapters (and no, I'm not exaggerating on the numbers of chapters). This really, really frustrating thing where the protagonist, Langdon, is this brainy professor that can supposedly figure out these relatively obscure, secret messages hidden by other brainy men hundreds of years ago in order to save the world... and yet he can't figure out the REALLY obvious things right in front of his face. I was listening to this on audiobook and I SWEAR, I kept expecting a three year old child to pipe up from somewhere in the back of the crowd, saying, ""Oh, come on, mister! You can't see that? Seriously? Aren't you supposed to be the hero? Even I can see that!!And, finally, lines like, ""The silence that followed might as well have been thunder."" Um, what... honestly, what? Is this Brown's version of ""A thunderous silence followed...""? It's really rather frustrating because I honestly think that in many ways Brown is rather talented; in some of his plotting, the details, the ideas he pulls together. I just wish that in other ways - the writing, some characterization, he could catch up with his other abilities. After reading The Da Vinci Code, I was going to read both this and Digital Fortress but I do believe I will stop here... wishing I could tip it over to the three stars.",76,0.9734,0.074,0.811,0.116,0.4642539682539681,NEGATIVE,0.9996

And my heart tells me I am not meant to.The first time I read Angels and Demons was 4 years ago, and it completely blew me away. This was my fourth time reading it, and it still is one of my favorite books of all time, and I'm sure it will always remain on that position. In this review, I won't go into the plot, since I think that everyone has either read it, seen the movie, or just heard of what it's about. I will stick to my feelings about this book, and why it has impacted my life this much. Firstly, the character of Robert Langdon will always be (at least in my opinion) one of the best characters ever created. And Brown's writing style goes perfectly with his character. He is a kind of a professor I would give anything to at least attend one of his lectures. I like his way of thinking, and he knows how to perfectly describe a place or a building, so that you would love to visit and explore every single one of them.And when it comes to the book as a whole, it impacted my beliefs quite a bit. I remember when I first read it, and how it changed my viewpoints on religion, science, Church, and even God as well. Not necessarily in a good or a bad way, it just opened my mind, and ever since then I have tried to not have a closed mind when it comes to both religion and science. They are not the opposite things, and just like Brown said in this book:'Science and religion are not at odds. Science is simply too young to understand.'And to conclude, I get who so many people dislike or even hate Dan Brown's books, but he was one of those writers who got me into reading. Until now, not a single one of his books disappointed me (and I've read every single one of them) and I'm pretty sure none of them, yet to be written, will.",64,0.9339,0.035,0.875,0.091,0.5204980842911877,POSITIVE,0.9997
15,15872952,02/19/2008,1.0,"Angels and Demons is one of the most insidiously-constructed page turners I’ve ever read and unlike other such efforts (Richard Laymon’s IN THE DARK) I actually raced to the end of it rather than throwing the thing half-finished against the wardrobe in rage. Think of Hercules Poirrot. Think of Inspector Morse. Think of Agatha Christie. Once you strip all the character and soul from these genre writers you have Dan Brown. They all have in common the one writer trick, etirwer (the backwards rewrite). I don’t mean check a book for spelling and grammar. I mean write a basic plot line. Then go back. Adding in detail that will drive the narrative relentlessly towards what you sketched. Stuffing the book with glimpses of false trails and dead ends to keep the reader in the dark, so to speak. Confounding the reader in a way that will make him feel insignificant and meaningless.This, for me, is the worst of all genre writing tricks.Professor of Symbology Robert Langdon in his tweed and nuclear physicist Vittaria Vetra in her Lara Croft gear go in search of the thieves who killed Vittaria’s dad and stole the anti-matter from CERN and find themselves in what appears to be a travelogue of the more obscure bits of Vatican City. It reads just like that, a Treasure Hunt type of book. The reader is dragged along with teasing glimpses of THE TRUTH behind the religion and the war with science that has waged through the ages. But it could have all taken place in a virtual world like the internet or a library with mischievous librarians swapping cards around so old ladies can no longer find their Mills and Boons.Any good book should involve, include, confront or enrage the reader – this book cored out the reader’s personality so that by the end you didn’t care if there were 30 more pages yet to go as the final threads of the convoluted narrative finally unravelled.This book (maybe all Dan Brown books) should come with a mental health warning: At no point in the reading of this book was the reader in danger of thinking.An ultimately vacuous exercise in Franchise Management D.B. even sneaked in an early reference to the following Professor Langdon mystery The DaVinci Code.

21,388366960,08/10/2012,5.0,"When The Da Vinci Code phenomenon happened, I read most of Brown's novels and I enjoyed all of them. But for some reason I didn't read this one, his first one with his famous hero Robert Langdon. And now I really wonder why... because I loved it!Dan Brown combines action with mystery, historical and science elements in an outstanding way and he creates an action thriller that you just cannot put down. One of the greatest aspects of his books are the historical elements. There are times that it feels like you're watching a documentary, but an exciting one at that! Sometimes it feels like all those information are too much, it even feels like Dan Brown wants to impress the reader with his knowledge, but after you are done with the book you will still find yourself wanting to learn more about them.Another great element that really is one of the reasons that I like his books so much is the setting. Brown always uses a gorgeous place as the background of his story. Τhis time the setting is Rome, one of my favorite cities in the world. The descriptions of the city and the places are breathtaking. Mesmerizing. You feel like you are there. And what I also like is that he uses places in Rome that most tourists don't know about. He presents a hidden side of the city. Places that when you read the book you will want to visit.  The whole story takes place in 12 hours and this really is a great idea that Brown fully takes advantage of. You can feel the pressure of the time. I found myself many times throughout the book wanting to scream at the characters to hurry up! This energy that radiates from the pages is what made me read this book in two days. You feel like you are there with the characters, you want to solve the mystery.What I don't like sometimes about Brown's books is that he rushes the ending too much without giving a full explanation to all of my questions (Dear ""The Lost Symbol"", I am talking about you). But this is not the case with this book. The ending is as amazing as the rest of the story. There are three huge twists at the last fifty pages that really took me by surprise! After that three twists everything is positioned into place perfectly. You rarely find such enjoyable, action-packed thrillers and this is why his books are so popular! They are nothing more than what a popcorn-blockbuster is for the cinema but we all need a book like that sometimes! ",56,0.9982,0.03,0.757,0.213,0.5225529100529099,POSITIVE,1.0
22,1188584496,02/02/2015,3.0,"I remember the first time I watched ""The Da Vinci Code"" and how much it scared me. I seriously hated it but after 2006 things changed for me. What I found interesting before changed. I become kind of obsessed with cults, religions, believes, signs and many other things. So I watched the movie on TV and I loved it, and now I'm a fan and can't wait for the other movies to come.I bought ""Angels and Demons"" and I'm moving quickly in it. The information are interesting but not all are correct regarding Islam. But it's fiction so I'm eating it up. But I find that I don't like Robert Langdon in the book, I prefer Tom Hanks portrayal in the movies, and I liked the changes made in the movies. I prefer the thriller without the romance, and I prefer them without mentioning us or linking us to Illuminati and I like the changes made to the other characters and events.I read this book about several times because I keep researching the terms, locations, and everything I don't know, that sometimes I lose touch with the actual story. I really HATE how much the author keep insulting and demeaning Arabs, Arabic language and Muslims, but I think the author is anti religion in general now. He seems to despise Christianity and thinks Islam is Inferior. The main character is supposed to be a scholar but the information about us is wrong most of the time even the way Arabic is described and written is rubbish.What's so interesting to me right now, is the science mentioned in the book, it's what interested me most. I'm enchanted by the jet that took an hour from USA to Switzerland, I'm intrigued by the center in Switzerland, it made me wish that I was into science, or that I was a scientist... I love the idea of that place, I'm currently following them on Twitter. CERN is the one that invented the internet we are all obsessed with, the idea that they think it's not their ""best"" work makes me so curious about what else they invent and do. I would like to read a book about their work and what they are working on.I think Vittoria Vetra's father was such an amazing guy. Also, is there a full list of the books in the Vatican library? It seems they are wasting away in there.The differences between the movie and book are varied, many things in the book is omitted from the movie like the Shia assassin, he called Hassassin (Order of Assassins), and he made him speak Arabic when in fact he must be Persian and they were against Muslims (read your history). Mr. Kohler was also a character in the book that didn't make it to the screen, his story is sad, he was raised by religious parents who didn't give him medicine as a child so he became crippled. He hates religion and values science, and is the head boss of CERN. The camerlengo didn't say my favorite line in the movie but Vittoria did in the book (do you believe in God? I did not ask you if you believe what man says about God. I asked you if you believe in God. There is a difference.) Vittoria wasn't in CERN when the murder of her father happened, that was also changed. They made her just another co-worker who was working on this antimatter project (no Big Bang Theory was mentioned in the movie) she was in shorts all through the book, while Robert was in a bloodied wet cardigan, no one gave him a change of clothes (which I'm glad they changed in the movie, he changed in the end from clothes from the hospital), the church and the residence were very harsh in the book but not in the movie. The four guys who were kidnapped all died, there are reporters as secondary characters in the book as well. The camerlengo's was raised by the pope he poisoned who took him in as an orphan to a religious mother who insisted that her boy was a messenger of God. He also was in the army was a pilot and he was good at skydiving (it was all planned). In the book Robert is so into himself, not in the book. The saddest part that Vittoria's father was was also a priest wasn't in the movie. He is my favorite. And Robert keeps saying ""Godspeed"" what does it mean? Oh and Robert was with the camerlengo on the helicopter and antimatter. I don't know if anyone who can jump from a chopper into a running river and survive... that was a James Bond moment. Of course, the ending is different, Robert didn't score Vittoria.One last thing, as much as I love libraries I would never want to visit the Vatican library because of the oxygen thing... omg! What are they thinking? Reprint people, don't kill yourselves. Do you remember Emma Watson's speech? In page 580 the camerlengo says: ""If not me, then who? If not now, then when?""I'm speechless.""Galileo was an Illuminatus. And he was also a devout Catholic. He tried to soften the church's position on science by proclaiming that science did not undermine the existence of God, but rather reinforced it. He wrote once that when he looked through his telescope at the spinning plants, he could hear God's voice in the music of the spheres. He held that science and religion were not enemies, but rather allies - two different languages telling the same story, a story of symmetry and balance, heaven and hell, night and day, hot and cold, God and satan. Both science and religion rejoiced in God's symmetry, the endless contest of light and dark.""When I read this, my eyes filled with tears, because this is Islam.

A mainstream Bollywood film is termed paisa vasool and is commercially successful only when it constitutes the following factors:1)	A hero who can do anything and everything under the sun. He can achieve impossible feats and always survives bizarre accidents.2)	A heroine comes across as smart independent women in beginning but turns into a cardboard cutout by the end. Just another pretty face, another damsel in distress.3)	A plot which is always over the top. Includes dramatic twists, graphic deaths, a little romance thrown here and there, and a demented villain.

You see, I've been telling anyone who would listen (my poor husband, mainly), about Dan Brown's atrocious writing style. Nearly every page was riddled with exaggerated descriptions, cartoon-like characterizations, implausibilities (even for a thriller), and just plain clumsiness. But I am forced to admit that I turned those pages pretty rapidly--maybe a hundred a day near the end. After all, I had to find out if Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon and CERN physicist Vittoria Vetra would find the stolen antimatter hidden deep within the Vatican walls by the defunct-but-seemingly-resurrected religion-hating, science-loving, Freemason-infiltrating Illuminati cult. Was I going to let Mr. Brown's frequent references to his characters ""looking"" mad, angry, confused, impressed, stupified, insulted, etc. keep me from learning more about an organization to which George H.W. Bush, Galileo, and Cecil Rhodes were supposedly linked? Not on your life. And this does much to explain why Mr. Brown has earned so much money from his novels that he can afford to bail out a hapless financial institution or two. He can tell a story. Angels & Demons is stitched together with just enough historical and scientific facts to get me to buy its shaky premise and continue reading. (Of course, maybe--probably--I'm just gullible). I am not a theologian, a physicist, an art historian, nor a Harvard ""symbologist""--but I kinda like learning about that stuff without having to do any heavy lifting by cracking open a Bible or a physics book. Mr. Brown's strange brew of all these disciplines, plus his masterful juggling of characters, plot threads, and time constraints managed to pique my interest. I admit that I was dying to know if Langdon's extensive knowledge of Italian baroque sculpture would save the day and prevent further bloodshed in Rome.

Especially since I reread it recently.*This is Dan Brown's first novel having Robert Langdon as it's protagonists and it is also, for me at least, the best book in the series. With Origins on the way, I am curious if A&D will be able to maintain it's spot.*A lot can be said about Brown's writing, but it is never dull. The book takes place over a short period of time. About as short as it took me to read it, which is about a day. It starts strong and never lets go until the last page. And that says a lot about Brown's ability to write witty and entertaining prose.*Usually I have a problem with books throwing me right in the middle of the action because I feel like I need some background, some base to make me care about what's happening. But A&D does it naturally, and that background info that I need is added bit by bit at exactly the right time.*After reading all of Brown's Robert Langon novels I can say they are formulaic to a point. But this is not necessary a bad thing because Brown adds something very few books add to the mix. The very real, very fascinating, full of history and interesting as hell locations. A&D, like all the other Langdon adventures, feels like a mix of documentary and action movie and if you are a fan of conspiracies, then DB is the writer for you.*Now, I've seen a lot of complains about inaccuracies, but, in the end, this is a work of fiction. I for one knew a lot of the things presented here because the subject is a passion of mine, but for someone new to it all, A&D is a nice introduction to the world of symbolism and secret societies. *Now, the ""big three"" (plot, character development, world building) all work wonderfully here. You have the standard-but-never-see-it-coming twist, the smart and sexy companion (Langdon almost feels like Doctor Who :)), and the riddles that will keep you glued to the page.*I could go on and on, but the truth is this will still be a 5/5 stars review and one of my top reads ever and I think I got that message across.

It's an odd thought, because now, I would absolutely never DNF this, but I guess that just speaks to how tastes change over the years.As of today, Angels and Demons is easily one of my favorite books. The constant action and simplistic writing style blend together perfectly into a fascinating story of non-stop questions and clues.The characters felt real, and I connected with many of them, whether that be through their personality, their work, or some other trait. The story was written in such a way that I never wanted to stop reading. (I think I read it faster than I've read a book in a long time.)The writing style is straightforward. Extra fluff is never used to add to the word count. One of my greatest bookish pet peeves is when fifty words are used where ten would do the job. But there is literally none of that here. Only the necessities.Every word is necessary, and every POV utilized is important. The story is told from multiple characters' perspectives, but it doesn't feel like an overload. The reader is not all-knowing until the very end, but rather, throughout the story, we get a look into the minds and actions of more than one pertinent, essential character. And each of these people are woven together at the conclusion of the story in a way that I can only describe as this: brilliant.For fans of thrillers and generally exciting stories with complex solutions, this is absolutely the book for you.

Throughout it, I had a diversity of emotions: At the beginning I loved it; at about 30% , I was still enjoying it, though it sometimes seemed a little convenient; by around 85-90% of it, I was sure I was going to rate it 2 stars, because of probably the biggest Deus Ex Machina I had experienced so far in books... but Brown saved the book in the cleverest way possible, and here I am, giving it a well-deserved 4-stars rating.That is not to say the book was perfect, because it wasn't. Here is what I kept thinking while reading it (at it quickly became my main complaint): It read like a book made out of a movie, not otherwise, which was actually the case. I have in fact read books made out of movies, that is, the movie came first, then the book. What do they all have in common? The writing is deficient and tells me barely anything about how things look like... in other words, the descriptions are weak. Like, I didn't know how to picture things in my mind. I had to google some things because their descriptions were not enough to give me a clear image.Truth be told, descriptions are very important. You cannot exaggerate with them because what you'll create is a tedious book no one will want to read. However, if barely no detail is given about the imagery of the book, you can't simply see the things how the author wants you to. That is why this book gave me problems. The deaths of some of the cardinals were impossible for me to picture. I even had to watch the movie to get an idea, if that tells you something.Nonetheless, I still deeply ejoyed the book. It was one of the fastest-paced books I've ever read. Really, I can't remember a book that got in the action as quickly as this one did. Riddles, Illuminati, deaths, ancient books... I loved every piece of it and I do not regret reading it. I wonder why in hell it took me so long to start it. My father had gotten himself a copy of it more than 4 years ago, and till now I am reading it. Why, though, I know not. I totally recommend it.

44,81484588,12/19/2009,3.0,"There's this argument you sometimes see, that Richard Dawkins spends a bit of time discussing in The God Delusion. Perhaps religion is all nonsense, it goes; but, when you consider how much great art it has inspired, surely that, on its own, is justification enough. Dawkins, you won't be surprised to hear, doesn't buy this, and thinks that people like Dante, Michelangelo and Hesse would have done great stuff even if they hadn't been inspired by the Church. He goes so far as to say that maybe they did in spite of the Church. I can see both sides of this, and I don't feel completely convinced either way. But let's get to the actual point.So, a couple of days ago, I was watching the movie of Angels and Demons. (The waterboarding hadn't worked out, and my interrogators were becoming a little desperate). Now, most likely it was aftereffects from the electric shocks and the attack dogs, but I couldn't help thinking that some parts of this film were rather good. The art direction and cinematography seemed well done; there were some excellent shots, which I'm still seeing clearly in front of me. I was particularly impressed by the beautifully composed scene in which Tom Hanks runs up a huge spiral staircase, overtaking a stately procession of red-robed cardinals; the anti-matter explosion at the end, with its Blake-like echoes of God speaking from the heavens, was also impressive. And Hanks, who just seemed to be thinking about his paycheck in The Da Vinci Code, had perhaps been stung by the negative reviews. This time, I thought he did a fine job. To my surprise, I actually started finding his interpretation of Professor Langdon interesting.Then it hit me. What a clever trick, and what an insidious post in that ongoing debate about Art and Religion! Here you had some people who, in fact, were quite gifted artists, and who could have done all kinds of things. What they were doing, though, was working on a film based on a mediocre religious book with a creaky treasure-hunt plot and wooden dialogue. Despite the problems they were faced with, they'd found some interesting and worthwhile angles. Maybe Dan Brown wasn't all bad. And, similarly... well, he'd really got me. Compared to this vicious, under-the-belt attach, Dawkins's comments seemed extremely moderate.No wonder Catholics don't much like Mr. Brown.

Once removed from the electric charger on which the canister is kept, the antimatter can hold in suspension only for 24 hours without further charge. And once the antimatter falls from suspension and contact physical matter, it will explode and the damage it can done is equal to a nuclear bomb explosion. Professor Langdon teams up with the dead scientist's daughter, Vittoria, who is also a scientist in the quest to stop the destruction and the threat to Vatican as well as to find out the murderer of the scientist. However, further troubles await for them in Vatican. The four Cardinals, out of which a new pope is chosen, hasve suddenly disappeared without trace. Vatican is in chaos and only Robert Langdon and Vittoria can save the day.  (hide spoiler)]It was fascinating read and an intense page turner.

“But who is more ignorant? The man who cannot define lightning, or the man who does not respect its awesome power?”
Dan Brown did a brilliant job of creating an incredible story and building it up till 500ish pages and then in next two pages he completely destroyed it! I loved the about three-fourth of the book but the ending did not appease me. But still I think it's worth reading at least once. The one thing that amazed me the most was that how one person can write from two utterly opposite point of views, Science and Religion. You had to take a second or two to stare at the page and appreciate the witty dialogues.Overall, I think I liked the book.I don't know if I'll ever reread the book again but there are some pages that I'd surely like to revisit.

That is my first time reading a book by Dan Brown, but I watched many of his interviews. In almost all of these interviews, Dan Brown mentions that he, as a child, lived in the two worlds of science and religion, as his mother was a church organist and his father was mathematics teacher.Angels and Demons introduces Harvard symbology professor Robert Langdon in a breathtaking adventure to save the Vatican City, Rome from a perilous threat from an ancient brotherhood died four hundred years ago. And on this very day, they attempt to continue their grand vendetta against the Church. Sorry if that is considered a spoiler, but this book has a lot to do with four, four altars of science, four cardinals, four churches, four... hell, that's my fourth read in July!The events started when Robert Langdon received a phone call asking him to come to Switzerland immediately. When he refused, he was sent a photograph of a dead physicist, on his chest branded an ambigram which read one word, Illuminati. Illuminati are a satanic cult who fought religion and Church for decades, theirs was the weapon of science. Literally, Illumination means lighting, as to enlighten humans from their ignorance caused by the Church, and orienting them to the path of light, of science. As the events roll in a thrilling, unexpected way, Robert Langdon learns the cause of the man's death, and finds himself in a race against time to save Vatican from a totally new technology pioneered by the late scientist.One of the main things that I truly admired was the locations, the author takes us on a journey in Rome, describing every place they go to through the events, which is very good but ponderous in a way. Dan Brown knows how to write, knows how to make the reader worry about the good side and fear the evil, he knows how to play with time. But the most thing I liked is how he combined all these facts in a work of fiction in a very deft way, with well-developed characters, who are also dumb to some extent. I was really attached by the camerlengo's EPIC speeches about science and religion, until page 5oo, perhaps. After that the story turned to an utter madness. The ending was truly disappointing. It was as if Dan Brown is showing his skills in creating meaningless plot-twists!Although his protagonist is atheist, Dan Brown didn't tell his story from one-side point of view, he was unprejudiced towards science or religion, he was neutral, at least that's what I thought. The author also was often calling his interesting main character Langdon, not Robert, I wonder did he intend to make a Robert Langdon series or this book was meant to be a stand-alone book!

60,43045378,01/14/2009,5.0,"	If you enjoy suspense and mystery novels like myself, Angels and Demons is a great novel. Dan Brown combines religion and science to create a rather controversial read. The story starts out by introducing us to Robert Langdon by awakening him with a phone call. Maximillian Kohler summons him to the science base, CERN, for his expertise of symbolism following the murder of their top researcher. He was branded with the mark of the Illuminati, an anti-religious cult that was believed to have died out years ago. So why kill a man of science? His research had proved the existence of God’s force, in creating dark matter. His murderer gruesomely accessed his work and stole away to Vatican City. Soon after a terrorist threat was made, with no demands, and four of the preferiti were kidnapped. The preferiti were the preferred elects for the pope election. Meanwhile, the chamberlain has to take care of the election and make orders to find the dark matter. Robert is also kept very busy attempting to decipher the ancient Illuminati clues to locate the four preferiti, who are under the threat of murder. With the help of the murdered scientists daughter, Vittoria Vetra, they race across Rome to arrive a few seconds late. The first of the preferiti was suffocated with dirt and branded with the ambigram of earth on his chest. At this point it’s impossible to put the book down. Brown’s use of mystery and riddles keeps you on the edge of your seat as you struggle along with Langdon to solve the puzzles. Personally, my favorite part is at the very end when the conflict of the dark matter is resolved, but the question of who is responsible for everything is still in question. Robert ends up jumping out of a helicopter to save his life, and that’s how he solves the final problem. The most unsuspected person turns out to be the bad guy and the return of the Illuminati was used as a scare tactic. Because Vittoria and Robert were dependent on each other for that 24-hour action packed day, they began to feel attached to one another. At the very end they spend a romantic night together in celebration of saving Vatican City. Unless you are sensitive about religious views, this book is a fun read and will make your brain work! Don’t expect to do anything else while your reading this book, since you simply can’t picture wanting to do anything else other than solve the mystery.",18,-0.6685,0.093,0.812,0.095,0.5189042498719919,POSITIVE,0.9997

There's nothing inherently wrong with this approach. It's just a little too simple and grates a bit on the ears of college grads. Too many bland adjectives, but that ain't a hanging crime. It's simple genre fiction written in a simple style.Second, you have to suspend your disbelief pretty frequently, but then, don't you have to do the same with James Bond? Indiana Jones? Batman? McGyver? Jesus? That's what thrillers and suspense stories are all about. Page turning, tense situations with the hero surely about to die, but saved at the last moment by seemingly miraculous interventions, whether man-made or divine? Isn't that what we want for our entertainment dollar?And in the end, Angels and Demons is entertainment. It isn't a scholarly essay attacking the church.

In fact, re-reading this book was a bad idea, but I chose to do it for reasons that will soon become clear (that, and I wanted to give it a more accurate rating on Goodreads).I love to tear into bad books—and make no mistake, Angels & Demons is a very bad book, and not in the naughty sense. But the problem with bad, popular books published ten years ago is that most of the witty deconstructions have been done. Bashing Dan Brown is like bashing that vampire series: yes, I could do it, and I could do it well. But what would be the point? It's passé.I could take my time to detail the many factual errors present in this book, but TV Tropes has already taken care of that for me. Also worthy of note is this blog post, which mentions the absurdity of the claim that Vittoria ""disproved one of Einstein's fundamental theories"" by observing fish.Say what you will of Angels & Demons; dismiss it as ""light entertainment"" that should be celebrated because it's a well-paced thriller with a pseudohistorical, pseudoscientific plot and a hot yoga-practising Italian physicist. All those inaccuracies, they're just artistic license, right? It doesn't matter that the facade on St. Peter's Basilica is travertine instead of marble. Who cares about minor details? I'm just being a downer nitpicker!Were it not for the depressing overabundance of nits to pick, I might agree with my straw man opponent. The sheer number of errors and oversights on Dan Brown's part, however, means he is either too lazy to do research or wilfully neglecting the fact-checking. In either case, it sends the message that he doesn't think his readers are worth the time to produce a book that's more accurate. That's condescending, and I don't like condescending.Responsible authors, particularly authors of historical fiction, write historical notes that mention where they've deviated from, you know, actual history. Dan Brown claims it's 99 per cent true. Angels & Demons has a nice little ""fact"" preface that warns us all about antimatter. I don't know if you've spotted the trend yet, but it turns out the ""fact"" is not much of a fact. So Dan Brown is portraying his (poorly researched) fiction as non-fiction. And that's not what writers do; that's what politicians do.The whole ""science versus religion"" debate is a worthy motif for any story. Far better books have done it more justice than Angels & Demons does, mostly because Dan Brown doesn't even try to do the subject any justice. I'm sure there are many people who feel that science is destroying religion much the same way the camerlengo does in this book. Television and the Internet (which may be biased, I guess) inform me that none of them has faked the attempted destruction of a religious site using a new and highly-destructive weapon created by science in order to restore people's faith. I guess they're all waiting on that antimatter.My point is: subtle and nuanced Dan Brown is not. His villains are caricatures of caricatures. His hero . . . well, I feel only pity for Robert Langdon, to be trapped in such a poorly-researched world. And he's played by Tom Hanks in the movies, so he's not all bad.But Angels & Demons is bad. Even if we label the bad writing and incoherent plot as subjective elements, the fact remains that Dan Brown is feeding us a shit sandwich like it's made of edible gold—and charging us for the gold too.It's still better than

TW: Rape threatsThe reason I first read Dan Brown was because I trusted some of my friends who said his books are great. The reason I kept turning the pages, biting my nails, feeling like my every move was watched, feeling like time was ticking towards distraction was the indescribable action, the constant mystery, the fights, the riddles, the worry one feels when reading these books. The reason I loved it was the research, the plot, the characters, the execution of everything in this spectacular, heart-stopping book.This is why I present to you a few reasons to pick up a Dan Brown book:♦ Tons of research on science, religion, art, geography, philosophy and so many other branches. The amount of information in this book is maddening, and yet it is never tiring and it never feels like it drags on. The exact opposite, each small fact or huge revalation stays with the reader throughout the story, like the riddles towards an even greater mystey.♦ A skull-cracking mystery, serial killings, the fate of the Catholic church crumbling, the world watching in shock. This book has so much page-turning action that even thinking about it now, it still steals my breath away. I kept guessing and guessing and it got me nowhere, until when I found out the truth, everything suddenly made sense.♦ Complex, well-thought characters, and an absolutely charming dymanic between Robert Langdon and Vittoria Vetra. Their relationship, the way they completed each other and the way their thoughts crossed and their knowledge tangled was an absolute delight to read about.♦ A villain that had me press a hand on my mouth and widen my eyes in shock, as the motives, the feelings and the entire psychological complexity were absolutely unbelievable.♦ A trip in Rome that made me feel like I knew the place, even if I've never been there.

Because of that, I am trying my best to not (a) throw this book across the room(b) burn it(c) rip out pagesBecause at the moment, I feel like this: And this:A bit like this:  And actually, quite a lot of:  This book was lousy. While I acknowledge it had a good twist and is packed full of details, anything redeemable is quickly lost in bad writing, atrocious characters, and random plot elements. Thrillers should not try and be religious discourses. They also shouldn't give the reader WAY MORE INFORMATION than ANYONE COULD EVER WANT.  I don't really read this genre, and I remember why now. My emotions throughout the book were....varied and mostly negative. The main character is an American-Cambridge professor-genius who we are frequently reminded is hawt, attractive to women, and emotionally traumatized. He also has weird dreams that probably reveal a fear of growing old or something. He meets a hawt, attractive, intelligent woman who basically runs around with little clothing on, admires his brilliance, and occasionally helps explain things for the reader. #great. So much for strong female characters. There is an Evil Baddy Bad Guy who is sexually twisted and so entirely villainous that it is morally proper to cheer for his downfall. And a couple other characters who POV shift randomly and who are confusing and stupid and traumatized. In retrospect, I can't blame them. I'm traumatized reading such a lousy book. Just imagine being part of it! The plot never ends. This book goes on and on and on. I can't believe this is a series. Also, this book is starting to get dated and that is just awkward.

Having first read Angels and Demons after the Langdon fame of The DaVinci Code, returning to reacquaint one’s self with Brown’s earlier work and the development of Robert Langdon as a character seemed an obvious decision. This reintroduction proved refreshing and a great start to the series as Inferno sits waiting to unleash the latest Langdon adventure.When the prized possession of Europe’s premiere scientific institute ends up in the hands of a presumed defunct anti-Catholic organisation, Robert Langdon agrees to lend a hand, more curious about the organisation than the mild-blowing discovery. After the Illuminati begin wreaking havoc in the middle of papal conclave, Langdon must save face for the Catholic Church as well as locate that which he was tasked to find. When the bodies begin mounting, it is a race not only against time, but also a chance to bridge the chasm between science and faith, long seen as irreconciliable. Full of great character development, thorough research and numerous teachable moments, Brown begins his series with an explosive bang sure to reverberate for years to come.Brown’s approach differs from some of his pre-Langdon work, with a strong focus on the clash between the scientific and Catholic spheres, bridged by the unlikely world of 16th century artists. Brown presents strong narratives about the role that the Church and Science play in the world, showing how they need not contradict one another. With a focus on Rome, Brown shows many of the nuances of the city and its deep artistic history. He posits that all he writes is true, so the reader is left but to absorb all that is on offer. A jaw-dropping read with a light critique of the Church (perhaps foreboding for the kick in the teeth he delivers in the next book), Brown opens the series in such a way that the reader cannot help but want more of the same calibre. Kudos Mr. Brown on this opening book in the sure-to-be exciting Langdon series. Your attention to detail, postulations, and attention to detail will surely rock some to the core, but entertain a slew of others.",10,0.9973,0.022,0.787,0.191,0.5515923120089786,POSITIVE,0.9999

This time he saves the Vatican City—and practically the foundations of Christianity—from an avant-garde technology that threatens to become the doom of The Catholic Church.A new female lead character is introduced—Vittoria Vetra—who was an independent woman. She is a staunch supporter of science and religion alike, but is often caught in a limbo in the conflicts of the two. Langdon is depicted as someone who prefers to be at the neutrality of things and simply observes everything and does not seem to be on either of the sides. This book in my opinion, should be read by everyone as it beautifully depicts how circumstances can bring even those people who are devout scientists or theists, in a state of dubiety.Brown's books do not have a humongous, final twist, that has the potential to shatter you.

Although the main character, Robert Langdon, appears in both novels, the plot is basically completely different. In Angels and Demons Robert is awakened in the middle of the night by a mysterious caller who tells him that a CERN scientist has passed away. Not just passed away, but murdered and branded on the chest as well. The man branded was named Leonardo Vetra, and he had just invented the substance ""antimatter"", which is basically an antimatter particle thing that is super powerful. Anyway, around the same time the antimatter goes missing, four cardinals from the Vatican church are abducted, and a bizarre murderer is on the loose. As you can see, there is a lot going on in this book.It is difficult to read two books that like ""Angels and Demons"" and the ""Da Vinci Code"", and not compare them, simply because they are so similar. It almost seems that Dan Brown was using Angels and Demons as a roughdraft for the Da Vinci Code, because the characters are oddly reminicsent, the plot follows the same formula, and the twist I predicted since the beggining. However, this book held my attention better than the Da Vinci Code, probably because there was less religious rambling and more action. My only real complaint is that the author seemed to twist time. The entire book took place in a timeset of four to five hours, and some places it uses 100 pages to describe 20 minutes worth of action, and then it took 10 pages to describe 45 minutes. What I'm trying to say is that it didn't flow as smoothly as I wanted it too. Probably worth a 3.5 rating... but not a 4.",9,-0.8807,0.098,0.83,0.072,0.404371862705196,NEGATIVE,0.9998

Sure, our hero falls two miles from a helicopter with nothing but a tarp as a parachute, landing in a river thanks to his ""diver's body,"" and yes, he uses his Mickey Mouse watch to light the way in the subteranneous vaults underneath the Vatican, but I was laughing from page to page and really did enjoy mocking Brown's attempts at dramatic pause.

Did that stop me from reading this book in a frenzy? Absolutely not!I will fully admit, I loved The Da Vinci Code. I didn’t care how unbelievable or bad the writing, the story itself was so good that I was reading well into the night, every night. I simply had to know what happened next.That was at least 10 years ago that I read that book, so I felt like I was long overdue for a Robert Langdon mystery. For some reason, the mood just struck me and I decided it was time to check out the first book in the Robert Langdon series, Angels and Demons.I’ve seen the movie version of this book many times so I already kind of knew what was going to happen, what I was hoping to glean from reading the book was more detail about some of the major plot points. What I basically got was the movie still. The only thing that I felt was different was the lengthy explanation about the anti-matter. In some ways that was disappointing, but at the same time I still kept reading and as interested in the story.The long explanation about anti-matter was tedious and annoying in my opinion though. If it had to take up that much of the story, then it was too complicated. And it was complicated and I found myself skipping over some of the science-y stuff because I was lost and I basically felt like—ok we get it, it’s an undetectable bomb, let’s move on. Some of the early parts in the story were too far fetched to be believable. A rocket ship that takes you from Boston to Switzerland in an hour? And don’t even get me started on the plausibility of anti-matter and the CERN bunker etc. It was all so over the top, even for Brown, that I had a hard time buying in. Yet I read on.I heard about Mickey Mouse a few too many times in this story, and there were a bunch of cheesy lines, a flimsy ‘romance’, and I had a hard time accepting that all the Vatican rules were being tossed out the window but yet I read on. Something about religious history, especially Catholic history, really gets me. I was basically in it for the religious history. There wasn’t a ton of research of historical data in this book as there was for The Da Vinci Code, but it was still interesting to read all the same.I am a Catholic myself, but I am not a ‘Dan Brown is the devil’ Catholic. I take his stories for what they are….entertainment. I don’t care if his ‘facts’ on Catholicism and it’s beliefs are unfounded or inaccurate, it’s a historical fiction thriller…..not a history book.Reading this book was both annoying and interesting at the same time. I didn’t care for some of the elements or writing in this book, and some times the plot stalled because too much was happening, but at the same time when I wasn’t reading it, I was constantly thinking about what was going to happen next. The movie basically follows the book so if you saw the movie you basically read the book, and yet I felt like the book was better.Yes this book had a lot of mechanical issues and it was almost a little too extravagant to even be believable but yet it was still a worthwhile read.

I never got bored even for a moment and it kept me turning the pages. The blend of science and religion that Dan Brown has created is breathtaking, awe-inspiring, and spectacular. This book serves equally the cravings of people who love science and those who love religion. CERN, Illuminati, Ancient Roman and Vatican histories, Christianity, Galileo, and antimatter....my Goddd!!!...this is just fascinating.The best aspect of this book is that you can never predict what's gonna be the next. The moment you think.......'well, this book has now unfolded everything, I know what's going to happen in the upcoming chapters'.......well well well...stop you're utterly wrong and there comes the twist and you again get absorbed by the words unraveling further mysteries. Since I don't wanna give any spoilers so...I'll not be explaining anything about the story line, albeit I think I have given you enough hints by providing the key terms used in the book. Do read this book, you will be amazed.Despite all the intriguing and tantalizing things this book has to offer, there is one thing that bothered me and didn't make sense to me. 'The God Particle' ..When I came across this term, I wondered how could Dan Brown possibly know about 'God Particle' 17 years ago, since this book was Originally published in 2000 and that the God Particle was discovered in 2012. Of course, the presence of Higgs Field was theorized by physicist Peter Higgs in 1964, if I remember correctly but its presence was proved in 2012 at CERN. That's it....I just didn't understand it. I'd love to read the comments on this.There is nothing else to complain about this book. This is the ultimate mystery thriller. While reading, my mind pictured Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon because I have watched The Da Vinci Code and Inferno already. I think the actual movie is when you fathom the things in your head while reading the every minute detail of the scene.Oh...wait..I wanna say something about the movie based on this novel. Let me tell you something...when I started reading this book, I knew there was a movie based upon this and I wanted to watch it first but I resisted my impulse. The moment I finished the book....I watched the movie. It really pains me to say this....that the movie is an utter disappointment. You might like the movie unless you have read the book. Watching the movie After having finished the book is pathetic. You'll see the details missing on a great deal and poor acting. They have also tampered with the story line and characters. There is nothing worth appreciating but Tom hanks (Robert Langdon), Ewan McGregor(the Camerlengo) and Stellan Skarsgård(Captain Rocher).",7,0.8836,0.061,0.846,0.093,0.566991341991342,POSITIVE,0.9986

120,1974316598,05/23/2018,4.0,"Reviews and morehttps://edwardsghostengine.wordpress....My second Dan Brown book, and still it won’t be my last! Firstly let me say that Dan Brown’s books seem to certain patterns that with a murder in the beginning and bright minded people working together to solve it. I know this bothers some people and comes across as boring to others but I myself don’t mind. I find that I like how this author structures his plots and how he develops his characters, I mean sure, they’re not the best developed characters I’ve ever come across but Dan Brown still manages to make them feel realistic.I read that others have said in many Dan Brown books that the information or facts is incorrect and as usual I can’t really comment on that as I don’t know much about religious symbology (but am interested). Personally I don’t mind whether the author uses pin point accuracy or adds his own twists to the factual information, I’m mostly here for the plot AND it is fiction after all so in my opinion authors should be able to mix things up a bit, I’m just saying 😛 But what I loved the most about this book were the twists at the end and all those revelations… Now most of the time I can spot twists and betrayals in books but in this book they seemed to just come out of the blue!Another theme I was quite interested in with this book was the clash of science and religion and the effects of religious extremism. There were some really interesting arguments brought up here like the nature of God and the how both science and religion impact people’s lives. It was interesting to see how some thought the rise of science was disconnecting people from the divine and how some thought progress was an act against God.. It’s all very interesting debate and I will definitely look for more books of this nature!The plot also moves at a fast breakneck pace for the second half of the book (the first half was a little slow but I could totally understand why those explanations and descriptions were needed) and despite there being many pages in this book, I felt it was a rather short story and I would have liked to have known a bit more about the MC’s… But it was probably short in this sense because of all the historical descriptions which in fairness were quite fascinating (whether they were completely accurate or not 😛 ) and still despite all this Langdon still felt real and he was still a character I could enjoy reading.So this is the first in Dan Brown’s symbology series and I will certainly read on but in the series order because some say you can read these books as standalones, but many do agree the best thing to do with any series is read them in order 😉Who I’d recommend this forI say if you’re interested in secret societies but also like multi layered plots with twists and action, then this will suit you. Seriously I don’t quite understand why so many dislike these stories…",16,0.9957,0.044,0.813,0.143,0.4604253689780005,NEGATIVE,0.9928
121,106327996,06/09/2010,2.0,"OK, the story, if not even a little bit believable, was reasonably entertaining. I don't demand believability!However, the way this book is written is just unbelievably condescending. Brown feels the need to explain what the BBC is, what a particle accelerator is, insists on translating VERY basic foreign phrases, and gets basic word definitions in repeatedly under the guise of not having his characters know what things are. This wouldn't be so bad if the characters weren't supposed to be a physicist/biologist and a professor/symbologist. (A college professor has never HEARD of CERN?) The 'obscure' tidbits of knowledge that supposedly prove Langdon is brilliant in his field are most often common, pop-culture kinda stuff. He also divides ""Christian vs. Pagan"" symbology up in a way that people of centuries past did not. (It really would not have been considered shocking for a religious sculptor to also carve pyramids and obelisks, for example. And as of when is a dove a solely 'pagan' symbol?)Luckily, most of the really irritating bits are in the beginning of the book - once people start dying, things get moving and the definitions fall by the wayside.Still, I was hoping for a bit more... I didn't find the descriptions of life either at CERN or in the Vatican to be realistic AT ALL. (Oh, and as a library person, the bits dealing with when Langdon is allowed into the archives alone, without the help/supervision of a professional - sorry, but no way. They couldn't go wake up an archivist/librarian? And I don't believe that there is ANY evidence that the Vatican denies access to the materials in its catalog to non-Catholic researchers on the basis of their religion. From what I've read, it operates much like any other restricted archive - you have to have credentials as a qualified researcher, you need to request an appointment and the specific articles you want to see in advance, etc. Standard practice. And I really don't know about suffocating to death in an archival vault in 20 minutes. Unlikely. At least it's not something they ever warned us about in library school.)I've been to Rome, and the book didn't succeed in bringing me back to the aura or feel of that beautiful and ancient yet modern city.The religion vs. science debates brought up in the book are certainly timely, but fairly basic - they never really delve that deeply into the issues. Still, there are some really amusing bits, and some unexpected twists and turns in the plot.Still, I should probably mention that it follows a very similar formula as the Da Vinci Code - if you've read one recently, the other may seem sneakingly familiar....",7,-0.8213,0.069,0.877,0.054,0.448952922077922,NEGATIVE,1.0

134,1842696254,12/18/2016,4.0,"Once again Dan Brown has fooled me and gotten away with it. What a ride!This was my last Dan Brown novel and did it hit the mark? Bull's eye. As fiction, I really enjoyed it.I was taken with Dan Brown from the start, when 7 years ago I happened to come upon The Da Vinci Code but I read Digital Fortress first to ease myself into it and was it sublime! I was instantly infatuated and obsessed which I am to this day. It was the newest thing for me then. Now I've read all his novels but since Origin comes out this fall I'm not worried, I couldn't have timed it better. Dan Brown inspired in me a love for architecture (and obviously art), it began with The Da Vinci Code. Cryptography, secret societies, symbology, and history were an added bonus. Brown made me love art with his too many and lengthy descriptions. And, mystery thrillers, of course, mystery thrillers.
Angels and Demons
 is centred in the Vatican City (yay!! religion! history! architecture! Rome!). The Pope has been dead 15 days, the ancient rite of the Papal conclave is about to begin when the papabile are abducted from right within the walls of the Vatican City. When one of CERN's finest physicists Leonardo Vettra is found murdered and branded with the Illuminati ambigram Harvard symbologist and Illuminati scholar Robert Langdon's expertise is called into assistance. Illuminati have been defunct for centuries but the turn of events lead to believe that they, in fact, are active and are threatening the lives of the Cardinals and the destruction of the Vatican with an antimatter bomb stolen from CERN. Langdon and Leonardo Vettra's adopted daughter Vittoria Vetra, a bio-entanglement physicist from CERN, have to solve the mystery of Illuminati by following the Path of Illumination to save the Cardinals being murdered every hour and to stop the bomb from detonating in 5 hours.I've always been in awe of Brown's writing but this time it was different. I noticed little things I hadn't ever before, listened to the music of his poetic words, his vivid imagery. The best thing about Brown is that you don't fall in love with art, you fall in love with his art, his description strike such vivid images in your mind it feels like you're really there. And, the fun part is while being secular it's really religious, religious symbology from a sceptic (cool!).This was a huge page turner, kept me on my toes, unable to predict, on the look out and hungry for more information, intense and just the right combination of thrilling suspense, the plot was quite sound, I was glued to the progression of events, and just gobbled it down. After The Lost Symbol, I thought I'd probably figure out the main ""villain"" before Brown gave the cue. I suspected everyone, hahaha. But. I. Could. Not. That's the best thing about this book, even when you think it isn't the book is unpredictable, and it makes you suspect until the end. I had my doubts about everyone and I wasn't sure about anyone until Brown gave the signal. It was a bit frustrating but ultimately it made everything more interesting. I was not a little frustrated that I hadn't read Robert Langdon # 1 first, shit, I didn't know. I read the books in the order I came upon them (thanks to my wonderful aunt and uncle) and it was all from another time, the time when I believed in myself more than the internet. Turns out, I had, in fact, left the best for the last, and now I'm happy that I did.I got to know a little more about Langdon and his history (daddy issues, I mean). I'm afraid, he might be too gullible. So, Robert Langdon (despite his age) is the ultimate boy next door, Brown was obviously thinking about himself when he wrote Langdon, Harris tweed, khakis, loafers, Exeter, symbologist, professor, revers art, turtleneck, really?. It was the uncanny similarity in appearance which tipped me off. Always wins the day, always gets the girl, a little cliché, don't you think, but it works. Because that's the style of the narrative, that's how it's supposed to be (Nancy Drew?), the ultimate idealism. A good-looking well-aged university professor who albeit a few obstacles, solves mysteries in a day with his university education, vanquishes the deadly enemy with his accumulation of bookish knowledge and sheer luck, don't we all want that, AND, and, to give us a happy ending, gets the girl. (Brown is prettty obsessed with the Freemasons.)The little bits of description here and there really made for an aesthetic read for me. For the first time I noted that Brown includes such dazzling descriptions:“Langdon's concerned gaze passed through her like a ghost.”“The words hung like a blade.”One major flaw, when did Muslims start joining Illuminati, that's where logic ends. Brown got a lot of things wrong: science, history, art, locations and the main premise of the novel is mythical, not factual (which I'm not going to elaborate on because there's the internet for that).But, one thing, is like seriously wrong, Muslims don't join Illuminati, period. A satanic cult joined by Muslims, come on. We are NOT against Christianity, we believe in all the Abrahamic religions and all the Holy Books, and we are not allowed to harm any of the houses of worship. It happens but it's ignorance. Taking individual incidents and stereotyping and generalising it on 23% of the world's population is hardly fair. This is not a part of Islam, the ignorance, sigh.I'm going to take a star off, half for the mistakes and a half for the stereotyping (Indonesia is the biggest Muslim country, okay, all Muslims are not in the Middle-East, haha) and the racism.(view spoiler)[The most impressive thing was that Brown had the balls to kill off all the Cardinals. We were fed hope, we kept hoping until the end, until the trigger went off, the plank was pulled away. He kept the best for the last and then just like that it too was taken away from us. (hide spoiler)]The Italian language is easy, I liked it, I could understand it, should learn it, definitely. Well, whenever the impulse to read The Divine Comedy strikes.The CERN part was fun too, the science is fun (despite the gaping flaws), the thing is that it impels interest, drives people to look into it.Definitely recommended (read it as fiction though) and if anyone has something to share/correct, enlighten me.",6,0.9988,0.094,0.732,0.174,0.5167003968253967,POSITIVE,0.9984

139,1652976772,05/30/2016,3.0,"Okay, I have a lot of thoughts about this book, so this might be a long ride. First of all, Angels and Demons is a book by Dan Brown, and the first book of a trilogy of history-filled fiction, mostly set in Italy. The story starts with our main character, Robert Langdon, a historian, being called to a secret organization called CERN where the director claimed that a professor was killed by Illuminati. The story revolves around Langdon and the dead scientist's daughter, Vittoria Vetra, on a race against time to save the Vatican.This book is packed with science, religion, and history, and it gives a unique point of view of them. It involves two main characters, each very smart in history, art, and science, and it's remarkable how much Dan Brown can fit in so much information and not make the readers explode. It's one of the main things I really liked about the book.The plot of the story was also very exciting. It's very thrilling, and it has a lot of action so nothing gets too boring as well. But other than that, you can also still learn more about the characters and where the story is set, while also focusing a lot of the history of the setting and the different plot twists.But one of the problems I had with it was its plot twists. At first I really enjoyed them, because who doesn't like plot twists? But then as the story progressed and it got longer and longer, I sort of felt like the book would never end, that there was always another conflict that suddenly appears, and more and more plot twists. I think in that sense Dan Brown sort of overused the whole plotting for me.Nonetheless, while focusing on the location and Italy, I really enjoyed the perspective of Rome and Vatican City in this book. I think this is a very Italy-vibed book, cause you can really see the characters exploring the city, mentioning the historical locations, and the people in there because the main thread of the story focuses a lot on that aspect of the city. Especially in the last parts of the book, during the night where a lot of people were crowded around the Vatican, you can really feel the Italian feel. It makes me want to visit all the places mentioned in the book.Another thing I'd like to mention about this book that I liked was how Brown weaved in morality and the rocky relationship between religion and science. As a Catholic myself, and a future scientist/engineer, I can really relate to this book. I felt a lot of things regarding my faith and how it affects what I think about science, and I can really relate to the camerlengo or Vittoria in that way. It was a unique perspective and something that was explored really well in this book.So overall, I didn't really like Angels and Demons, story-wise. It was fast-paced and exciting, and it kept surprising us as readers, but the plot twists kind of got repetitive and predictable after a while. And even so, the setting was excellent, with great characters as well, although I didn't really gel with any of them or love any of them in particular. In the end, it's a fun book to read, and I'm sure I'll like the movie more than the book, especially as it presents Italy in a visual way as well.",10,0.9888,0.035,0.861,0.104,0.4673115079365079,POSITIVE,0.9972
140,1403543171,09/28/2015,2.0,"I read The Da Vinci Code earlier this year, and if you saw my review, you know that I quite plainly hated it. I already had Angels & Demons in my possession, so I decided to give it a go anyways.I think that Angels & Demons was a big step up from The Da Vinci Code, but I still didn’t really enjoy it, so I’m going with 2 ½ stars. At this point I won’t be picking up any more Dan Brown books, as I’ve got a feeling his writing just isn’t for me.The beginning of this book was quite strong. The mystery had quite an intriguing sense around it, and Dan Brown’s writing didn’t feel as insufferably textbook as I remembered. While I had previously criticized Langdon for being bland, stereotypical, and kind of stupid for a supposed Harvard professor I found him more tolerable this time around, though I still agree with the statements above.While The Da Vinci Code followed Langdon on his quest to uncover the secrets of Leondardo Da Vinci, this case has ties to the Illuminati. Dan Brown again infuses mystery, history, conspiracy, and religion into the story. He also focuses on how science affects religion, this time having Langdon team up with physicist Vittoria Vetra to try and find stolen anti-matter before it blows up a city.It all makes for a very interesting start to a story, and it should have been a fantastic book. I think it would have been if not for the length.I was interested and enjoying this until about the 250 page mark. This book is 709 pages. 709 PAGES. And it’s a thriller, which should be fast paced, not long and drawn out. The only authors who can write a 700+ page book and actually keep me interested is Cassandra Clare or JK Rowling. Other than them, 700 page books will drag, and oh boy was this one a drag.The mid section was a repetitive mess of religious nonsense and a semi-interesting treasure hunt. Those constant switching POV’s were pretty awful as well. Dan Brown’s unengaging writing style certainly did it no favors either.

142,2916450510,08/02/2019,4.0,"Angels & Demons is the first book in the Robert Langdon series written by Dan Brown and centered on Robert Langdon, a professor of art history and symbology at Harvard.Robert Langdon, a Harvard specialist on religious symbolism, is called in by a Swiss research lab when Dr. Leonardo Vetra, the scientist who discovered antimatter, is found murdered with the cryptic word Illuminati branded on his chest.These Iluminati were a group of Renaissance scientists, including Galileo, who met secretly in Rome to discuss new ideas in safety from papal threat; what the long-defunct association has to do with Dr. Vetra's death is far from clear.Vetra's daughter, Vittoria, makes a frightening discovery: a lethal amount of antimatter, sealed in a vacuum flask that will explode in six hours unless its batteries are recharged, is missing. Almost immediately, the Swiss Guard discover that the flask is hidden beneath Vatican City, where the conclave to elect a new pope has just begun.Vittoria and Langdon rush to recover the canister, but they aren't allowed into the Vatican until it is discovered that the four principal papal candidates are missing. The terrorists who are holding the cardinals call in regarding their pending murders, offering clues tied to ancient Illuminati meeting sites and runes. Meanwhile, it becomes clear that a sinister Vatican entity with messianic delusions is in league with the terrorists.Angels & Demons is written rather well. Brown sets an explosive pace as Langdon and Vittoria race through Rome to try to save the cardinals and find the antimatter before it explodes. Though its premises strain credulity, Brown's tale is laced with twists and shocks that keep the reader wired right up to the last revelation.All in all, Angels & Demons is written rather well and is a wonderful start to what would hopefully be a wonderful series, which I plan to continue in the very near future.",6,-0.5106,0.099,0.817,0.084,0.507823593073593,POSITIVE,0.9433
143,243847833,12/06/2011,1.0,"Although this one is slightly better than The DaVinci Code (but really.....EVERYTHING is slightly better than that garbage), it is still pretty bad. And here's why.It was authored by Dan Brown, who uses his novels as ways to fluff his own ego, show off his intellect, and brag about all the things he thinks he knows about secret societies, art history, symbology, and the history of the classical world. Those with only the most superficial knowledge about any of those subjects could see right through his bullshit.The main character, Robert Langdon, is basically just a literary version of Dan Brown, or at least what Dan Brown believes himself to be.The writing is absolutely abysmal. A high school student could have done better with a first draft.Interesting action sequences which could have made this book infinitely better were constantly interrupted by Dan Brown's Robert Langdon's constant need to discuss in detail how much he knows about the ancient artifacts he is hunting. So, for example, the reader has to drudge through a history lesson ego fluffing for about 5-6 pages when the main character is racing against time to discover a needle in a haystack before he and his lady friend suffocate to death.The main character is a scholar. He is not Indiana Jones or James Bond. But, he escapes death more times than those characters have. Combined.The ending involves ridiculous, science-defying stunts that even Michael Bay would think were over-the-top.I thought maybe I was too close to the subject matter of 
The DaVinci Code

144,59004487,06/09/2009,2.0,"I picked up this book because I wanted some mindless action with a fast-moving plot. This book was exactly the opposite: political, too much dialogue, and slow moving. At first the politics of the book intrigued me because Brown attempts to take on the clash between science and religion, however he seems to be completely ignorant about science and religion in the very ways that feed the clash between them. For example, he talks about cutting edge scientists studying the big bang. (Cutting edge scientists dismissed the big bang as unlikely several years ago.) He presents religious scientists as being motivated only by a desire to prove scientifically that God exists by showing that the big bang and Genesis are consistent. (Not all religious scientists feel the need to prove God exists. Why would any scientist, religious or not, think of the Bible as a scientific text book?) He shows religious people as fairly fanatical. (Which is sometimes the case, but usually not.) At first I thought that this book was going to try to bridge the cultural perceptions that science and religion aren't compatible, but by the end, I think the book only deepened the problem.Aside from that, the perspective in the book changes between at least 10 different characters who rehash material that has already been covered. It slows the book down whenever it seems to pick up even a little momentum. 150 pages could be cut easily without altering the plot even a little.Also, the horrific violence in this book, which should be shocking, never really is. I haven't thought about it enough to figure out why that is. Hmmm... poorly described...too many coincidences....overdone...hmm. Something along those lines.

Aside from a similar plot structure, I liked the history behind the events.It certainly was interesting reading about the Illuminati, and I am glad that it was a fast-paced book. ""Full"" review :P Having loved The Da Vinci Code, needless to say, I did have quite an expectation for this book. It did not disappoint to the extreme point, yet it wasn't good enough in comparison. I feel like that the basic plot progression can be quite similar to the others in the series, but I guess I'll make a final decision on that after I read Origin. As usual, I was so baffled by the amazing mystery/puzzle solving skills of Robert Langdon. It was so satisfying to see problems coming to a solution. In addition, I was able to grab some quick facts along the way, which was a big bonus for me. All this in a book? Oh boy, I was intrigued. (Psst, if there's any more of these books that you know of, do recommend them to me! I am definitely in to read them)Another part that I did enjoy about this book is that how it talked about the mixture of science and religion. Being able to read about history was a big reason why I liked The Da Vinci Code, so the reason also applied to this book.Like I stated before, the reason for a 3.75 rating rather than a 4 or above is that the plot was somehow too expectable.

I have to say I like the ending of the movie better as it’s a bit more upbeat than the book is, but that’s a personal preference.Overall I think Angels & Demons is a solid introduction to the series and character of Robert Langdon.

Really, you can hardly get better than this when you want a thriller. I had never thought I could be this invested in Catholic architecture.From the point of view of characterization, though, I felt like there remained something to be desired. A few of the characters were very well drawn, but they were the exception rather than the rule. The hassassin was caricaturish in his villainy; and to the end of the book we are never told why he was so into the whole Illuminati thing. He didn’t seem the type to be super into secret scientific societies. Why was he so honoured to be working for the Illuminati? Robert Langdon and Vittoria Vetra seemed almost like cardboard cut-outs of a thriller hero and heroine. I liked Kohler though, as well as Mortati and the camerlengo. Gunther Glick was a personal favorite, though he wasn’t exactly what you would call nuanced, either.All in all, I really liked the book. It was dense, but a fun read all the same.

My conflicts with this book are simple. The implausible was constantly coming to pass during multiple moments of the main plot. A certain weapon was left behind during a pivital scene. The elements of earth, air, fire, and water were not part of Vittoria's common knowledge. The specialties of the main characters were discussed in detail and given in a lengthy lecture-style between characters while antimatter was threatening to blow up the Vatican and cardinals were kidnapped and tortured on the hour. The greatest blunder was the time frame as Robert Langdon only had hours to solve centuries of undisclosed secrets while he was sleep-deprived, escaping life-threatening situations, and traveling across Rome during conclave! I found this book slightly predictable. I was not motivated to turn the page until I was over 250 pages into this novel. The foreshadowing is lazily written and exhausting at times. I found the violence disturbing and the portrayal of women as sexual objects appalling.  Angels and Demons was a true disappointment, especially for a best-seller.

I'm going to say it's worth the read. It's a fast-paced thriller providing an exhilarating escape that I enjoyed. It made me want to visit Vatican especially the library. But, to enter the Vatican Library, one need to have academic credentials. Maybe once I earn my PhD, I'll be able to step foot in the library.SPOILER ALERT(view spoiler)[CERN director Maximilian Kohler discovers one of the facility's physicists, Leonardo Vetra, murdered, his chest branded with an ambigram of the word ""Illuminati."" Kohler contacts Robert Langdon, an expert on the Illuminati, who determines that the ambigram is authentic. Kohler calls Vetra's adopted daughter Vittoria home and it is ascertained that the Illuminati- an ancient anti-religious organization thought extinct- have stolen a canister containing antimatter—a substance with destructive potential comparable to a nuclear weapon. When at CERN, the canister is stored in a unique electrical charger which ensures the antimatter's stability but when removed its back-up battery provides power for 24 hours after which the antimatter would fall out of suspension and, on coming into contact with the physical matter of the container, explode. The canister is located somewhere in Vatican City, with a security camera in front of it, as its digital clock counts down to an explosion due to occur at midnight, which will wipe out the Vatican.Langdon and Vittoria make their way to Vatican City, where the Pope has recently died. They are told that the four Preferiti, the cardinals who are most likely to be elected pope, are missing. Langdon and Vittoria search for the preferiti in hopes that they will also find the antimatter canister. Their search is assisted by Camerlengo Carlo Ventresca (the late pope's closest aide) and the Vatican's Swiss Guard.Langdon tells Vittoria how the Illuminati created a citywide map known as the Path of Illumination, a trail once used by the Illuminati as a means of inducting new members; aspirants who wanted to join the Illuminati were required to follow a series of subtle clues left in various churches in and around Rome. The clues indicate the secret meeting place of the Illuminati. Langdon is granted access to the Vatican Archives where he believes a document containing the clues to the Path of Illumination is located. The clues to the Illuminati markers are placed inside Galileo's famous book called 'Diagramma.' Langdon then sets off on the Path of Illumination in hopes of saving the preferiti and recovering the antimatter canister.The Path leads Langdon and Vittoria to four churches in Rome, each one representing works of art by Baroque artist Gian Lorenzo Bernini which are associated with one of the primordial elements: Earth, Air, Fire and Water. Langdon realizes the four preferiti will be murdered in a way thematically related to each location's related element. The first cardinal is branded with an Earth ambigram and has soil forced down his throat, suffocating him; the second is branded with an Air ambigram and has his lungs punctured; the third is branded with a Fire ambigram and is burned alive; and the fourth is branded with a Water ambigram and is wrapped in chains and left to drown at the bottom of a fountain.During their search for the Illuminati lair, Langdon and Vittoria are seen getting closer.After finding the bodies of the first two preferiti, Langdon hurries to the Santa Maria della Vittoria Basilica and finds the preferiti's abductor in the act of setting the third cardinal on fire. The kidnapper is an unnamed assassin who is working under the orders of the Illuminati master ""Janus,"" whose true identity is unknown. Commander Olivetti is killed and the assassin kidnaps Vittoria. Langdon escapes and accosts the assassin at the final element's marker (Water) but he is unable to save the cardinal.Langdon must complete the Path of Illumination in order to find the assassin and rescue Vittoria. His search leads him to Castel Sant'Angelo which he realizes is the Illuminati lair, under which a tunnel leads directly into the pope's private library in the Vatican. Langdon frees Vittoria and together they send the assassin falling several hundred feet to his death. The two hurry back to St. Peter's Basilica where they find that Kohler has arrived to confront the camerlengo in private. Langdon and Vittoria fear that Kohler is Janus and that he has come to murder the camerlengo. Hearing the camerlengo scream in agony from being branded with the Illuminati Diamond, the Swiss Guards burst into the room and open fire on Kohler. Just before he dies, Kohler gives Langdon a mini video camera containing a video Kohler made while confronting the camerlengo and tells him to give it to the media.With time running out, the Swiss Guard evacuates the Basilica. The camerlengo rushes back in, claiming that he has received a vision from God who has revealed the location of the antimatter canister to him. With Langdon in pursuit, the camerlengo ventures into the catacombs and finds the canister sitting atop the tomb of Saint Peter. Langdon and the camerlengo retrieve the antimatter and get in a helicopter with only minutes to spare. The camerlengo manages to parachute safely onto the roof of St. Peter's just as the canister explodes harmlessly in the sky. The crowd in St. Peter's Square look in awe as the camerlengo stands triumphantly before them. Because of this ""miracle,"" the cardinals debate whether to elect the camerlengo as the new Pope. Langdon manages to survive the explosion using a window cover from the helicopter as a parachute, a trick he learned while touring CERN with Maximillian Kohler and lands in the Tiber River.As Langdon regains consciousness, he finds himself in a hospital located on an island. He is given the video camera which he placed in the pocket of his tweed jacket. He is shocked when he hears the footage and becomes desperate to head back to the Vatican. The video shows the camerlengo branding himself with the Illuminati diamond and confessing that he himself is Janus, and who set in motion the night's chain of events in order to sabotage the Vatican. He also confesses that he killed the Pope with an overdose of heparin, a powerful anticoagulant because the Pope revealed he had fathered a child.After viewing Kohler's tape, Langdon, Vittoria and the cardinals confront the camerlengo. Shortly before the novel begins, the Pope met with Leonardo Vetra who believed that antimatter was capable of establishing a link between science and God. Vetra's beliefs caused great discomfort to the camerlengo. While discussing Vetra, the pope reveals that his support is due to science having given him a son. Without waiting to hear the explanation (that the child was the result of artificial insemination) and horrified that the Pope appeared to have broken his vow of chastity, the camerlengo plots to rectify the situation. He poisoned the pope and, under the guise of an Illuminati master (Janus), he recruited the assassin to kill Vetra, steal the antimatter and kidnap and murder the preferiti. The camerlengo planted the antimatter in St. Peter's basilica, feigned his last minute vision from God and retrieved the canister just in time to save the Vatican from the ensuing explosion. This was in hope to unite the struggling Catholic Church. The Illuminati involvement was merely a plot engineered by the camerlengo to cover his own involvement. Upon the discovery and the camerlengo's attempts to justify his murder of the Pope, Cardinal Saverio Mortati, Dean of the College of Cardinals, reveals that the camerlengo is in fact the late pope's biological son, conceived with a nun through artificial insemination. Overcome with guilt, Ventresca soaks himself in oil and sets himself on fire before a crowd of onlookers in St. Peter's Square. His ashes are recovered by Mortati, who places them in an urn which is placed inside his father's sarcophagus. It is revealed that the cardinals' endorsing of him would have made him Pope by acclamation. Mortati is unanimously elected pope by the cardinals and Langdon and Vittoria reunite at Hotel Bernini where they share an extensive meal before making love.

It was about science vs religion, terrorism, hope and faith, good vs evil, catholic rituals and ceremony, history and art.I watched movie ages ago. I vaguely remembered who was the real mastermind behind whole scheme of murders and destroying Vatican City and still I enjoyed reading the book. It made me curious to solve the mystery of finding Illuminati lair and catch the killer. (which I didn’t remember much)Writing was amazing. It was gripping, fast paced, and descriptive with loads of information from the very first page. I always love fictions that provides factual information that I wouldn’t have read or known before. Characters were interesting, realistic, and well developed. Best part of the book was theme, description of setting and art and history. The end was brilliant but I don’t agree with what they decided.

I read the Da Vinci Code more than ten years ago and had of course seen all the movies but never took time to read the series in its entirety. I’m looking forward to it now, the vibe of historical treasure hunting and mysterious intrigue captivates me and while some of the plot is extremely far-fetched, I found I could care less about the intricate details that I’m sure many people would pick apart. The death of a pope and the murder of a physicist priest collide in ways science and the church normally do not.

You only read this ก็เพราะว่า #พ่อคือพ่อ เท่านั้นแหละ!Red-handedly caught guilty...I have seen the film and have read the book before, in Thai edition. And it's been ages so I couldn't remember what happens after the protagonists take off to Rome. After that my recollection of the story is that of the film. The novel is more detailed and filled with occasional humour, which is fairly entertaining. The film is well done and action focused. The cinematography is impressive as well. However the novel detailed story is fascinating thus worth reading even though you have already seen the film. I remembered when I first read the Thai edition, when I very young, all I reckoned was how bloody gory the crime scene at CERN was. With that bloody damn eyeball.There's one scene that would have been beautiful, cinematographically speaking, is the scene towards the end where Mortati places the urn in the sarcophagus. What a pity they didn't include that. However it's understandable since they ridded most of the materials on the certain shenanigans and even went as far as modifying the original Carlos Ventresca into Patrick McKenna instead. Not to mention to give more screen time to the two main leads, and to make the story revolve around crime and detective trope and not drama as well as to get the story away from the bones in Pope's closet. I personally liked the drama and thought that it's well done, that it has more weight than the one presented in the adaptation.Nonetheless there are some changes in the adaptation that are great. One of them is the explosion of antimatter scene. It's more epic to have Camerlango go alone. Moreover it wouldn't affect the plot in anyway. You can still have Langdon down there and Carlos still survives, then the secret can be revealed in the same exact manner. And it would have been more convincing (it already is, but there's no harm in enhancing it) and surprising (or shocking rather). The scene of Robert Langdon's realisation in the book isn't a bad idea for the plot but it appeared that the screenwriters had come up with an idea that was even better.Now to the bad. There's an uproar on racism and Islamphobia (assuming that the Hassassin was a Muslim and/or Middle-eastern), it is however evident that this is the issue of hegemonic masculinity and competition between the powerful within male supremacy itself. I couldn't give a ratass unless women are affected. What Brown conveys in the book should be read through critical and contextual analysis as 'this man' in 'this realm of male supremacy' subjects women and beats women. WHICH means that 'other men' in 'other realms of male supremacy' no matter higher or lower, also beat women. Critical readers should be able to do that. Nonetheless I do not believe the author consciously realises that the situation is also a normative in his society (aka the other realm of male supremacy). In short, men in western nations are oppressors too. Surprise surprise. Vittoria's original costume and the guards' complain should have been included in the film because it addresses misogyny. What a waste. They gave Langdon and Vittoria business suits. And that formal black heels. Ugh. I cringe. Good luck running around tourist spots in those.The end (the very end, in the book) kills. It's tacky. Mortati's last visit should have been the last thing in the narrative before the scene fades into candle lights. Although the film makers didn't include that beautiful beautiful scene in movie but, THANK GOD, they didn't include this tacky one either.*after I'm done with this I'll have to submerge conscience in the most morbid and inappropriate idea of a crossover, ever.

 Movie update 
 :It's practically impossible to cram 620 pages of information tome into 2 hours movie and as always, movie skipped many important parts and characters of the book which made it less appealing than the book but to be honest, if one sees the movie in its own right, it's a good movie. Some movies you will understand only if you have read the book because of the elimination of details but this one, even if some details are eliminated as usual, overall structure of the story is rebuilt for 2+ hour movie. I certainly enjoyed the movie but ofc not as much as the book.. End_______________________________________________
“Nothing captures human interest more than human tragedy.”
I am honestly the worst person to take the opinion on this book because being an atheist, I am probably baised on team-science of the story and since I don't want to harm other's view on what they believe, I'll try to be as subtle as possible.. I know I am twenty freaking huge years late to this book and it's concept and believe me that this fact stays as one of my biggest regrets of my life and I am sure it haunts me when I am in my deathbed. Dan Brown... A gigantic fame of ardent research was a person who enlightened many people with his stories with his marvellous caliber to blend factual data into fictional world... 
“Faith is universal. Our specific methods for understanding it are arbitrary. Some of us pray to Jesus, some of us go to Mecca, some of us study subatomic particles. In the end we are all just searching for truth, that which is greater than ourselves.”
Science vs Religion is a never ending battle with truths and deceits in both sides.. It's really hard to lean into one single side.. Having no explanation to certain things doesn't mean Science is clueless.. Having no proof for their own explanations doesn't mean Religion is ignorant.. Both is needed by our world... Both signifies a wheel of a motorcycle each. Equally important.. Everything reduce into today's world, which is keen on evidence about the truth rather than the knowledge of truth... For me personally, some claims made in the book about the existence, creation and faith are really really on point.. I believe in a higher energy state rather than some 'being' watching down on us, punishing us for our sins.. At the same time, I agree on some claims about religion too when he writes why does God decide not to help us when in trouble despite we being his beloved children.. So I think it's all about perception.. All about how YOU see things and interpret it.. We call 'Sun' as God whereas we proved its a huge burning mass...We consider 'Moon' as a God too and yet in some years people may start real estate in moon.. 
science and religion are two totally compatible fields—two different approaches to finding the same truth.”
This book is huge.. This is the first physical book which has over 500 pages that I am reading and I am glad it's not a failure... Angels and Demons being a start of Robert Langdon series follows Mr. Langdon on his adventure and struggles between the proclaimed eternal enemies Science and Religion.. I loved this book and I will most certainly continue the series soon... I warn you not to be late like I am into this wild ride.. Take a hint and hop on...

The continuous adventure and unfolding mystery packed in a limited time-frame was enough to put me under the spell and at the edge of my seat. I'd call it an adrenaline booster. Angels & Demons is the 1st book in the Robert Langdon Series.The story starts when a Harvard Symbology Professor (Robert Langdon) is summoned by the director of a European scientific organization (Maximilian Kohler) to assist in solving the murder case of one of its scientists (Leonardo Vetra). The scientist's daughter (Vittoria Vetra) who is a scientist herself joins forces and vows to avenge her father's death. I won't speak of the inaccuracy of facts or historical details used in this book as I am no expert in that area. I treated the book purely as a work of fiction despite the realness of the locations and whatnot, and I really enjoyed it in the process. A few predictable moments passed near the end but that didn't demean my admiration for the book as a whole.However, there is a minor issue that non-Arabs might probably never notice. I wish if Dan Brown did a proper research when he decided to include Arabic phrases. Most of the Arabic in this book wasn't neatly written, and it doesn't make sense to the Arabic reader although it's technically correct (if each word were used separately per se). For example, ask any Arab if they would use the curse word ""Tabban"" in their everyday language. The answer is: Never. FYI, the Middle East includes 20 countries, most of them speak Arabic, but each of them speaks with a different accent/dialect. ""Tabban"" is formal Arabic and Arabs don't normally speak like that everyday. Yeah it's used in movie subtitles, but again Arabic subtitles are always in formal Arabic. Another example is when the Hassassin counted from 1 to 4: ""Wahad ... tintain ... thalatha ... arbaa"" you won't be able to guess his nationality because 3/4 of those words are written in a different accent. I recommend this book for action and mystery seekers who would enjoy conspiracy theories. It has a bunch of interesting info on art, science, religion, in addition to an appetizing dose of Renaissance history.

""Science tells me God must exist. My mind tells me I will never understand God. And my heart tells me I am not meant to.""
Can bad writing be saved by a good story? It's a question I kept asking myself while devouring the pages of Angels and Demons. It's a book I've read before and it's a book I liked a lot when I did, but somehow it rubbed me the wrong way this time around. It's the story of Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon who gets summoned to a Swiss research facility to analyse a mysterious symbol seared into the chest of a murdered physicist. Turns out what he sees in front of himself is evidence of the resurgence of an ancient secret brotherhood known as the Illuminati, who have now surfaced to carry out the final phase of its legendary vendetta against its most hated enemy—the Catholic Church. So the thing is, this book is really hard to put down. It's faced paced, it's easy to read, it's fun. It puts you into a situation where you constantly want to know what happens next. However, all these mechanisms Dan Brown uses to keep you on edge are so deliberate and apparent (like ending every second chapter with a cliff hanger à la ""He couldn't believe what he then saw""), that it took a lot of the fun out for me. It ultimately made me aware of being told a story, never allowing me to fully immerse, but leaving me with a feeling that I am just watching a story happen. The writing style added to that: it's cinematic somehow, clear and fast, yet occasionally wooden or not quite on point. If you're looking for touching quotes to get tattooed on your forehead, you certainly don't find them here.But I am probably being too harsh, because I doubt that's the claim the book makes. Despite all, it's a clever plot, everything is neatly tied together and I enjoyed the dabbling in history of the Vatican and the Catholic Church. Speaking of which, the main motive this book explores is the conflict of the Church and Science, which is a tough topic to form an opinion on and an even harder topic to write about.
""Science and religion are not at odds. Science is simply too young to understand.""
All in all, I don't consider re-reading this book a waste of time at all and for fans of this genre it's definitely worth having a go at. I'll probably join good old Robert Langdon for the rest of his journey.",5,0.7185,0.085,0.805,0.109,0.4725803329461865,NEGATIVE,0.7136

I'm utterly lost amongst the science, literature, art, language etc so I can't predict or collaborate on the chase lol but enjoy it all the same. I have to say I'm disappointed that the lady took a document from the archives. A moment to get a pen and paper could save the document for future reference and damage. You lose that, you lose the cardinals. Speaking of vaults. If the Vatican truly does have one in real life, I hope to god they allow copies of their collection.And the news reporter! Grr. Whether the killer was a fake nor not, he should've alerted the authorities. But no, let's just show up, begin rolling and capture a murder shall we?

202,1759153796,04/22/2017,5.0,"I am going to try and write a coherent review for this super incredibly amazing book. But to be honest, most of it will probably just be me fangirl screaming. I'm already smiling like a loon over and giggling like a fool. That is what a good book will do to you. This book! This book, man! This is the series that really started my love affair for history. Fun fact that you may not know about me: I wanted to a historian. Before I found my calling, psychology, I fell in love with history. This incredible series started my love affair for all things old and dusty. I will forever hold this series close to my heart, right next door to  Harry Potter and  The Perks of Being a Wallflower.Onto the review though because I'm pretty sure that is what you all are waiting for. This is the first adventure of Robert Langdon, a symbologist that teaches at Harvard University. He is an incredibly smart man that has study symbols and art history pretty extensively. He gets a call from Maximilian Kohler, director of CERN, to help solve a case of missing antimatter and the murder of a beloved scientist. What entails is sooo much more than what Langdon bargained for. This book also brings up the topic of science and God. Does science have a place in religion? It's a question that continues to bring problems everyday. I am a woman of science. There is just too much evidence for me to ignore what all science has proved. But I respect those that believe the Creation Story. I think that Dan Brown brings both sides to the argument very respectfully. (view spoiler)[ Antimatter is the opposite of matter. What the scientist and his daughter did was prove the story of Genesis. This is where God created the world and everything in. The antimatter made something out of nothing. Quite fascinating, really, but hard to wrap your brain around.  (hide spoiler)]Did my review seem coherent? Probably not because I have a hard time expressing my love of a book into words. Usually I just shriek and point excitedly. Overall, I think that this a fantastic book. You can sure bet that I will be continuing on with the rest of the series considering I have them all with the exception of the latest one that hasn't come out yet.

203,684086901,05/02/2020,2.0,"I don't even know where to fucking start with this holy shit. I knew this was going to be bad, it was written in 2000 by a man after all, but I held some hope that it wouldn't be a flaming pile of SHIT. Alas, I was wrong.CharactersRobert Langdon: Robert Langdon is a self insert of Dan Brown. He's tall, handsome, broad-shouldered, and he swims like 5 million times a week to keep in shape, he's smart and well-read and cultured, and all of his friends are like you should be married how come you don't have a wife. And also, he's middle aged, and this is an important fact to keep in mind because he's also a FUCKING CREEP.The minute he sees Vittoria he begins to fucking sexualize her and pays intense detail to how ""lithe"" her figure is and how toned, and how her body doesn't bulge in places it shouldn't (and yes, this is actually from the book). This woman is literally mourning the death of her father and he's standing there in heat. What a fucking asshole. And the thing is, he's constantly thinking about her like this throughout the whole book. He's hyperaware of her presence to the point of distraction for almost no reason because he doesn't know this woman like at all. Vittoria is also like half his age. Is this the thought process that crosses the mind of all middle-aged men when they encounter a woman in her twenties? Do they just spend the whole time sexualizing her in their heads? I genuinely want to know because if that's the case I never want to speak to a man ever again, thank you. Which also leads me to pondering why it is that every single male writer somehows dreams and fantasies about women half their age finding them attractive? It seems to be the one thing I come across consistently, and I just don't get it. I will save y'all the time and tell you right now: we don't and we never will. Get over it.He also manages to be such a know-it-all while actually knowing fucking nothing. I'm just wondering how one goes from attending a school for architecture to being a world renowned symbologist who's an art history professor. I can see how one might have an in-depth knowledge of art from studying symbology I guess, but architecture to religion? I was under the impression that you could only do your masters and PhD in stuff that you had gotten a bachelor's degree in? It would be like a chemistry major doing their masters in neuroscience. And he's constantly talking down to Vittoria like she's a fucking idiot even though it's well established that this woman has been doing work advanced enough to get herself a Nobel Prize. And he's constantly surprised that she knows history about her own country ?????? Like she may not be a symbologist but I'm sure she knows some of the history of her people. And he's always surprised when she knows the meaning of Italian words,,,,,EVEN THOUGH SHE IS ITALIAN ???????My favourite is when he tries to flex on the reader, for example when they first arrive in Rome Robert says he can recognize certain signs jump out at him but it's shit like uffici postale and ospedale, which you don't have to know any italian to figure out. Like you've been spent all these years studying Catholicism and stuff and that's the only Italian that you've picked up on?Or when things are just wrong. For example, why is Vittoria saying buona sera,,,,,,when it's night time in Rome? Or when they enter Vatican City and the Swiss Guard are like you can't be wearing shorts in Vatican City. Maybe the rules for Vatican City were different in 2000 but from what I remember from two years ago, you can be in shorts and tank tops in Vatican City, they just won't let you into the churches.Hashashin?????: This just churns my butter because of course the killer had to be an Arab brown man, who's also a fucking rapist by the way, and is just all around fucking creepy. In terms of being an incel (which is what this character is let's face it), I honestly can't say if the character was caricaturized to be entertaining or interesting. But it just,,,,,why does it have to be a brown man committing these acts. Was Dan Brown using growing anti-brown sentiment at the time to his advantage to his story and did it ever occur to him not to do that because it's, oh, I don't know, racist. And the fact that someone who's clearly very important to the progression of the plot to the story doesn't even have a fucking name. Doesn't sit right with me.The part that was especially really funny for me, was when he's going on about how he doesn't like to pollute his body with drugs and he's talking about hashish. It's weed. And I just went wild for it, because it's not Dan Brown's fault, like at the time we didn't know a lot about weed or how it worked. But reading this in 2020, is hilarious because it's just weed. Maybe the Hashashin would've just calmed down and stopped being such a predator for 5 seconds.WritingThe writing is atrocious. This book reads like it wasn't edited at all. There's so much waffling and repetition at the beginning for no reason. I would've cut out at least 75% of it, personally. Everything is exposition, it's just Robert Langdon telling us everything all of the time instead of it being shown, and I guess that's what the point of having Vittoria there is for. Without her there, I really don't think the author would've found a way to impart all of the knowledge we needed to know for the story.There's also a lot of preaching about science vs. religion which, again, has nothing to do with the plot of the story. I didn't come here to read philosophy on the debate and the merits of each side. I don't care. It was just unnecessary and added length that didn't need to be there, especially when it's coming from characters who have literally no relevance to the plot whatsoever, like the secretary of Maximilian or Michael Colner or whatever the fuck his name is.The camerlango goes on live news broadcast and gives this whole speech on religion and it's literally so fucking uncalled for, especially because he's a figure of authority so he should just be giving the facts as they know them and that's it. I don't understand why he's preaching on international television the way that he is. It's like reading a Russian novel and having to wade through 15 pages of political ideology before the plot can progress.And I don't understand why the Swiss guard didn't go to the police once the Cardinals started dying, unless they're the only legal authority in Vatican City? And I don't understand why Robert Langdon was allowed out into the field. I don't doubt that the police would've consulted an expert on this matter, but I also don't think, for legal reasons, they would've let Robert out into the field where he would've been put in danger or slowed everyone down or even obstructed their work.I had a bet with my friend that Robert and Vittoria were gonna sleep together at some point, and I got until I had about 3 hours left of the audiobook before I just gave up so I'll never know for sure if it does happen. But we did get almost-rape instead because of course it had to be there. It's always one or the other.Honestly, the movie was way better because it cut the majority of the bullshit out. Tom Hanks made Robert less fucking creepy and Vittoria looked to be in her 30s at least. I love reading about Catholic conspiracies and the politics and the intrigue, but honestly, this was just not it.",4,0.9986,0.06,0.803,0.137,0.5501182033096927,NEGATIVE,0.9997

Many such questions have been brought into light by this novel.Novel unravels how a long gone evil is made to rise again to kill one’s apathy. It began with a heinous death of a scientist named ‘Leonardo Vetra’, a person who was going to put an end to the age long fight between science and religion. His death marked the beginning of a labyrinthine tale of ancient symbols that must be deciphered by the Harvard professor ‘Robert Langdon’ before it’s too late. Robert Langdon along with Vetra’s daughter ‘Vittoria’ lands up in a breath-taking race against time to save Vatical City and put an end to the secret brotherhood- ‘The Illuminati’. What I loved the most was those references to all the works of art, tombs, tunnels architecture in Rome were factual. It made the book far more interesting than any other thriller novel I have read before. All the action scenes especially the one during Langdon’s fight with Hassassin was amazing.

Langdon teams up with the scientists daughter, Vittoria, who helps him on his quest.I love conspiracy theories, even when they're not true, and I love the theory behind this book.

It almost all happens in real time, which isn't something you can say about any other book. It is so well written, that you actually feel like you're there. I felt like I was running between churches and countries like Langdon, and I couldn't wait to catch the man responsible.The book also brings up a lot of themes between science and religion. Are they actually opposites? Can they work together or is it impossible like some suggest in this book? I was raised Catholic. I attended church on a daily basis until I reached what I call the age of reason. Physics and chemistry explained so much, and science was creating miracles of its own. But then you had countries that had no advancements, still suffering from things we were curing and building immunity towards. So was it a god who was miraculous or was it science? We still have countries going to war over what god is the right god, but no one is arguing over math and science. We all seem to agree on Newton's laws of physics and Einstein's E=mc^2. And I think the real miracle is getting people to agree on something, anything really, even if it is something as simple as gravity.All that being said, I would love to see if there will ever be a time when we can prove the existence of a god through physics, like the scientist in this book. It did remind me of Aristotle's theory of the first mover, which is something I always believed. Something has to act for the rest to fall into place, which can lead to creating something out of nothing.Despite heavy scientific and religious themes, I think this is a book anyone can enjoy. Everyone who has studied religion and found themselves frustrated with science should read this, and vice versa. Or if you're in the camp where the two can work together, this is the book for you. In short, everyone should read this book. It is so exciting, and yet so horrifying.Dan Brown writes in a way where you don't want to put this book down.

If that is true, then ""Da Vinci Code"" must really be some awful dreck. ""Angels and Demons"" is, honestly, almost unreadable, in my opinion.I could fill pages describing the many transgressions against both literature and taste that Dan Brown commits, but I won't try your patience in such an exercise - I'll try to be much more brief.The characters are lifeless, dull, and boring. Each one is a stereotyped cardboard cutout of cliches and inanities. The captain of the pope's guard was particularly poorly-treated: his sole job is to investigate threats to the pope's life, and his manner of performing his job is to insist that threats don't exist? His very existence was superfluous, and his presence seems necessary only for the purpose of creating poorly-contrived drama.The conversations between the characters are no better served than the general behavior of those same entities. The obvious is overstated, the content occasionally borders on nonsensical, and 4 conversations out of 5 sound ridiculous when spoken aloud. The combination of the caricaturized personalities and the lackluster dialogue gave me the impression that Dan Brown's aim in writing this story was to make it as easy as possible for it to be adapted into a screenplay, and condense the relevant parts of the story into a neat, trite, 2-hour package (something he was successful at). Any nuance or subtlety is completely absent.As for the plot - sigh. I was 2 days and about 2/3rds of the way into the book when my mom asked me if I had any ideas on whodunnit. I named my top suspect, and said that this person was the most likely culprit because of being the only character who hadn't had an obvious red herring dangled annoyingly in front of the reader's nose. Imagine my lack of surprise when I discovered my guess was correct... The only thing I hadn't worked out was the motive - and when I read the why, I nearly threw the book across the room. Without indulging in spoilers, I will say it is one of the worst ""big reveals"" I have ever encountered; far more stupid than I could have ever guessed even after enduring the 600 pages of idiocy that had come before - and I've read enough books and watched enough movies to guess at quite a lot of stupidity.So much for my thoughts on this book. I will pass on ""The Da Vinci Code"" and the other entries in the Robert Langdon series - enduring one book replete with so many egregious literary sins is enough for me.",4,-0.957,0.101,0.828,0.071,0.5724842767295597,NEGATIVE,1.0

But I don't have that kind of time right now, so let's narrow it down to the most basic and overarching, which is that Dan Brown is a fucking hack whose subpar writing skills are eclipsed only by his complete inability to grasp the art of exposition.So, basically, what Brown has created here is a sprawling 700+ page tale about two barely functional retards, and their supporting cast of highly-trained yet criminally inept fellow retards, running half-cocked around Rome on a harrowing adventure or some shit, whatever, and accosting random tertiary characters with whom to engage in long, drawn-out, largely unnecessary expository conversations. Which is to say, it's pretty much exactly like The Da Vinci Code, except the geography is different and Prepackaged Female Sidekick has a different name. Oh, and The Da Vinci Code obviously had a slightly better editor looking after it, or else the editor for Angels & Demons was asleep on the job or something, Jesus Christ.

After reading about Vatican with its enormous historical and religious significance I have made visiting Vatican one of my goals in life. The Illuminate, the path of illumination, St Peter's Basilica etc are things that stay with you for a long time. Bringing great personalities in to a conspiracy theory is one of the facts that make Dan Brown's book alluring and he has not failed to replicate this winning theory in this books. There are some very big names in this book which would make you want to do research on this whole story just to see how much of it is true. But conspiracy theories and interesting history lessons are not the only things that you encounter in this book added to this there is a heart stopping adventure in this book as a result of quest to find the truth which will have your adrenaline pumping as though you have just started running for a marathon race. Even though I liked this book very much there were still parts of this book which I thought was a bit far fetched. For one thing Langdon's jump from the helicopter without a parachute and managing to survive by landing in a river was a bit overdone and highly unlikely.

This novel demands to be looked at seriously because, the setting of the novel accentuates the accomplishments and failures, the strong points and flaws of both, the science and the religion. As far as India and Hinduism is concerned, each individual needs to strictly follow some of the proud creeds mentioned in this notable work by Dan Brown.The novel is gripping and well acclaimed by the readers around the world and the content and the virtuoso of the author speak for it. Apart from the mystery which is the major feature of this novel, I did find the few moments between Robert and Vittoria quite intriguing. Dan has quite adroitly explored the personality of Robert Langdon, which adds up to make the novel more captivating.The Last Word:Dan has surely written a robust mystery-thriller, but we also need to ruminate on the essence of the religion before we overlook its importance.

As we live in the 21st century, we are aware of how much science can creates a logical miracle through our lives which makes us feel a contradiction in religions. Science allows us to doubt about God’s existence. Angels and Demons, written by Dan Brown creates a moving story of a battle between science and religion. This book is well-known as one of the most exciting books that keep readers wired right up. It is about Robert Langdon, a Harvard specialist on religious symbolism, who fights against a scientific terrorist with Catholic Church. The story is so tensed that readers would not want to put the book down. It starts with mysterious murder followed by the anecdote of hidden bomb by the Illuminati, a group of Renaissance scientists which existed in the past, and is expected to be explored in no longer than one day. This non-stop tense stays till the last hundred or so pages -- Brown blows it open and leads us to a surprise ending. Brown creates a realistic story by basing the setting in Vatican City and uses the actual churches that exist in the city accordingly. This makes readers who went to Vatican City understand better on the image of the story. His clear descriptions of the place have provided the illustration of the city to readers who have not been there before. He also manipulates non-fiction facts in the story by a deep research on Illuminati. Brown uses of language and the setting of the climax reveals that he purposely makes the story to be shocking by revealing all the truths in the end. Although Brown uses true facts to create a real story, the ending of the story was unnatural and unrealistic.

The momentum is sluggish initially, understandably, to lay the foundation for the main story. Towards the middle, it picks up pace, which it maintains throughout, finally culminating in a real gritty climax.Brown has very cleverly maintained a balance between science and religion. Like a clever lawyer, he has very ably argued on the side of one and than the other. Kudos to him!The downside is the characterisation of Robert Langdon. He is slow. Very slow. Okay, he is 'old', but age has nothing to do with mental agility. Considering he single handedly decifers the entire puzzle, Brown could have made him wittier or sharper. There is no proper base build for the romance between him and Vetra. Just a sentence here and there, with the absurd explanation of people getting close faster in traumatic situations (yes they do, but not with this level of communication - bare minimum), but no romance really. Agreed the entire novel is hardly covering an entire day... still... Lets talk about spoilers. What would you say if the author himself gave out the end at the start of the book itself? This book does that. Lets see how many of you can see it. I did and I was mighty put out by that.This book is all action, panic, thrill, intellect. There is very little scope for the softer emotions.

There is no denying that his Robert Landon series has made him a household name. I do have to wonder, though, if it hadn't continued the story with The Da Vinci Code, would Angels and Demons alone have made him such a well-known author.Angels and Demons may be the first book in the Robert Landon series, but I read it after having read the second book, The Da Vinci Code. I'd imagine this was the case for many saw The Da Vinci Code movie and wanted to see more of Brown's work. Angels and Demons is definitely heavier on the religion, being that it takes place in Vatican City and deals with the murder of current potential popes. The history here focus on the Illuminati, a secret society of free thinkers of a time long past. Instead of delving deeply into the secrets of the church long ago, the look is at Vatican City itself and the secrets hidden in it's architecture and design. We see a lot of present day, inner workings of the religious city, much more so than the beliefs that shaped it.Angels and Demons contains a thrilling, engaging mystery that would be surprising for the few that haven't already seen the movie version.

258,2911713744,07/26/2019,4.0,"This is the best Dan Brown book I've ever read. I like the way how he combined the Vatican history, the knowledge of symbology, the conflicts between science and religion together and weaved them into an exciting fast-paced adventure. The story happens just overnight, but it seems to be long enough. Some of the plots may have been exaggerated but after all, it's a fantastic story that's worth enjoying, an intrigue that may arouse your interest in history and mystical groups, an inspiration inducing you contemplating the universal essence of faith whether regarding religion or science. Are religion and science really historic rivals? If you only accept one, rejecting the other, it may seem so. But if you transcend all prejudice to search for the pure origin of faith, you will find out the ultimate truth. They themselves are not the truth. They are not the answer. They are just languages, two distinctly different languages. Two keys to one door. Two paths toward one destination. While religion works on the inner world, science studies the outside world. Finally, they will meet at a sweet point since we ourselves are the bridges between visible and invisible worlds. The ultimate destination is so bright, so immense, that no way can escape it and no one can end up without approaching it. We all are on the way.Get back to this book. Although most of the length has been spent on plotting and there's very limited space for portraying, I can tell that the characterization is quite successful. Professor Langdon who's suffering from claustrophobia, the charming Vittoria, the loyal commander Olivetti, the faithful camerlengo, the young lieutenant Chartrand who quite respects Carlo, all come to live in my brain. I even couldn't believe my eyes and put my hand on my mouth when I saw that Olivetti was shot to death by the Hassassin. Even the journalist and videographer from the BBC make the story more real.Also, I like the author's writing skill. Each chapter is short so it's easier to keep up. The plots have been well organized. The writing is vivid and engaging.The book is not perfect of course. One thing I feel unnatural is the twist that Rocher 180° reversed his attitude toward the camerlengo after receiving a phone call from CERN. What??? He didn't even know who Kohler was before! He guards the Vatican City! How could he believe a stranger's words so easily? It would be better if there was foreshadowing for that.Above all, this is worth four stars to my interest.",3,0.9972,0.067,0.727,0.206,0.5434371184371184,POSITIVE,0.9999
259,3160624108,02/02/2020,4.0,"I'd always felt left out because many adults I know, as well as my friends and significant other, have read Dan Brown books. Some of them even started back when they were in high school. For some reason, I had always had this impression that Dan Brown is THE author to look for. His books are somewhat a rite of passage into being a so-called bibliophile, at least in my community. His genre is not really my cup of tea, but I had always wanted to read at least one book of his, just to see what I had been missing out on all these years.Fast forward to today, I'm in my mid-20s, and I gotta say I'm glad I started reading this book at this age and level of maturity. I'm also grateful I read deGrasse Tyson's book, watched TBBT, and learned about conspiracy theories before reading ""Angels & Demons."" Otherwise, I don't think I would've understood and appreciated the story as much as I did. Controversies and factual inaccuracies aside (I just read from the reviews that there are lots of wrong info here, I just don't know exactly what), I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I consider all of it as fiction anyway, so the wrong info does not bother me. I really loved the concept of the story, and I found myself excited and engaged all throughout. I couldn't put it down! With that said, the writing style of Dan Brown is not the best for me. Again, I like the story and all those freakin' plot twists, but the seriousness of it all is somehow dirsupted by the inconsistent tone of the writing. There were times when I was really tensed because of the dramatic scene, then BAM! An awkward description would catch me off guard and ruin the mood for me. One example I can't forget is when Langdon was afraid of how the camerlengo would approach him, imagining that he would see the priest on the other side of the door holding a bazooka. uhm EXCUSE ME? A priest and a bazooka don't match. What kind of imagery is that? It's so incoherent and irrelevant that I just kind of get pissed whenever it happens. There are lots more, but I'll let you guys find them yourselves lol. Also, can I just say that for a 24-hour setting, this book is long AF lmaoOverall, I really liked this book mainly because I had not experienced a truly gripping story in a long time. I missed that feeling of wanting to know what happens next so bad that I even put off my actual work just to squeeze in a few more chapters lmao. I now get the hype.

260,3381359537,06/08/2020,3.0," 2.5 stars, 3 on a slow day Well, this was definitely a page-turner — exhilaration  is  what Dan Brown gets paid for, after all. However, like most things that were downright impressive to me at the age of twelve,  Angels and Demons  turned out, on a second reading, to be riddled with those stereotypical markers of bad writing that get overlooked amidst all the exhilaration and furious page-turning: racist antagonism,  the male gaze,  poor research (although I do think the last bit can be excused, of course it's not all true — it's fiction!), wooden dialogues, flat characters and outlandish quirks — including a Hitachi TV in the Pope's office and a Mickey Mouse watch on a Harvard Professor's wrist— and so on. If you think about it, Robert Langdon is pretty much James Bond repackaged as an American academic — the action sequences and the pointless sexual reward at the end being a case in point. But Dan Brown does with his protagonist what Fleming never could, which is make his heroics center around mythology (or religion, as some would call it), conspiracy,  as well as  the futuristic reaches of science.How that goes in  Angels and Demons  is that the book paints the Church in a light too bad for Catholics and too rosy for sceptics...until the twist. The Plot twist, like the cliffhangers at the end of every single chapter, is just one of those things which make a Dan Brown novel what it is: interesting at first, but quite a bit  too  preposterous towards the end. Angels and Demons  is just the first time he's done it, but despite the structural repetitiveness and overall absurdity, we've let the man write at least 9 books — and that stuff really sells. As they say, all's well that ends well, and these books always end a little  too  well. If there's one thing I've learnt from Dan Brown, it's this: never be afraid of taking a chance with an unconventional ending — because that's something  he  never does. Oh, and any woman will be falling over herself to sleep with a man she just met and spent 24 traumatising hours with.  tl;dr - not outstanding (more of the so-bad-it's-good variety), but the kind of bestselling bait that most of us occasionally give in to.

261,3166564380,01/29/2020,3.0,"I love series and this one I’ve read a long time ago, when they first came out. And as I haven’t read them since, I figured to give it another try as I didn’t remember a lot about the books.Of course I am a fan of the Tom Hanks helmed series, but movies do skip a lot of stuff that are detailed in books for obvious reasons. I’d say that Angles and Demons were immaculately researched, when it comes to settings, history, science and religion.The book involves all of those heavily, so if you don’t like one or more of these topics, I’d say it’s not for you.The book is hefty and at times a bit too drawn out that makes it a bit tedious to read on occasion, but since I was already invested in the story, I plowed on.Dan Brown also relies heavily on a suspense of a reader, which I am not a fan of. I like when a writer ‘incorporates’ or let’s the reader in on the secret that is being hidden from a particular character. Sometimes the character even finds out or learns about an important piece of information that we don’t get to learn together with the character, which makes me feel rather annoyed, not intrigued. The well researched history and the action filled plot line is fun to read (I combined listening the audio book with reading, which made it a bit more fun). I don’t know much about Illuminati but secret societies have always excited and probably always will for one reason or another. Secret societies definitely have mystical allure of the unknown, exclusive and sometimes the forbidden or even elitist. Whatever the reason or how much of the Illuminati lore was true or fiction didn’t make that much difference to me. They served a good purpose as the ‘ultimate’ opponent to the Catholic Church.Some of the parts were little too fantastic but since this is a fictional book with elements in reality and not vise versa, I didn’t find it too offensive.Overall a good read, some parts too drawn out and annoyingly ‘mysterious’ at times, but I will continue with the next one for sure.

And how an American symbologist is caught up in the middle of this mess, trying to make sense of the clues and hints involved.

Why I Recommend Bumping This DOWN On Your TBR: I can understand how some readers enjoy the little factual tidbits, but I would have preferred reading those in a nonfiction book, rather than having them scattered throughout this boring plot. I also don't appreciate how Vittoria is written. We start off with her making a demand and being told she is not allowed to see the body of her recently deceased father, until she goes through some BS, and only then is she ""allowed"" to see her father. Then we have a chapter in which we go back in time and she is ""saved"" by her father who adopts her. There are some attempts by the author to balance the good with the bad, as she is written as a skilled and intelligent woman.

At first sight, I thought it was just some fantasy book about some prince killing a demon and saving the princess, something like that.

Angels and Demons is about a Harvard Professor, being asked to go to CERN to investigate a murder. This leads him to Vatican City, and then a whole lot of stuff starts happening. I think this book really stands out for me, because first off, I like memes. I just saw the word Illuminati, I loved this book. But secondly, it provides a rich understanding of Catholic culture, the war of science and god, and the dark cult-like organization known as the Illuminati. The twist at the end was fantastic, I got so shocked. I actually thought Mark Koher tried to murder the carlamengo, or how you are supposed to spell it.

286,1080771334,10/15/2014,2.0,"(possible spoilers ahead)I, like many people before me, read The Da Vinci Code before Angels and Demons. However, after having read both, I can now say that it did not matter. Both stories stood well on their own. So I just wanted to clear that up just in case anyone was wondering before really starting this review.On the whole, this book was OK. Unfortunately, my harsh rating is not because of the overall story arc and things like the pace of the story itself, but because of the little things throughout the book that really irked me. Not only that, but the structure of the story and the predictability of it all.First, I would like to address the fact that Brown purposely chose an Arab-Muslim character to portray the bad guy. I understand that perhaps the character had some beef with the Catholic church, but that doesn’t give an author the excuse to use him as a blood-thirsty, raping, animal. I myself am Arabic—not Muslim, but I have many friends and family that are. To paraphrase from the book, the character said that women in his culture were nothing more than slaves of men, sexually and domestically. I’m sure this is true in some cases (even today), but for the 21st century, I found this extremely off-putting. Brown only added onto the stereotype that Arabs/Muslims are a vulgar, violent, and terroristic people. Did it help get the point across that the other characters were in danger with this particular character? Yes. Was it necessary that his ethnicity and religion be the reason why? No.Another issue I had with the story was the way it was structured. There were no surprising turns or twists. It literally went from finding one dead cardinal to the next, and to be honest, I expected that. I didn’t expect Robert and Vittoria to find them any other way. I expected them to be too late each time, and I was right. The only twist I can commend Brown on is the end concerning the Camerlengo. It was a good twist, but I think Brown waited too long for it. It came at the very end, and at that point, I just wanted the book to be wrapped up already.The last couple pages of the novel were also very off-putting. After all that Vittoria had gone through with her father and with the gruesome events of that day, she just wanted to have sex? Really? The need for romance in this book was not there for me. The last line of the book was something along the lines of, “You’ve never slept with someone who does yoga, have you?” After EVERYTHING that happened, that is how you want to end the book? I just couldn’t take it. This part may have been small, but it had a huge impact on how I viewed the book. It reduced Vittoria’s character immensely within a matter of a few pages.I can say that I enjoy reading Brown’s books for is how he can effortlessly present information without it dragging on. The character of Robert Langdon is perfect for relaying information that is important to the story, and that is a feat that many author can not and will never over come. So for that, kudos Dan Brown.In the end, I deeply wish I could give Brown a better rating. The story really was interesting. I mean, who doesn’t love a story that concerns the Illuminati? They’re mysterious and interesting. Unfortunately, it was not enough. I do plan on reading The Lost Symbol and Inferno, so hopefully my ratings will rise with those two.

287,542787606,02/21/2013,5.0,"Dan Brown knows how to write a good thriller!There are many people who hate Dan Brown's writing for many reasons. Some consider it sacrilegious and offending to religion, and some other people, who don't care about this, simply say his writing skills are terrible. I find his writing to be more focused on the plot (and what a plot!) than the characters, thus the characters are one dimensional.Overall, the lack of in depth character development, and certain quirks in his writing don't bother me because the story is just sensational! This book, along with The Da Vinci Code are some of the best page turners, for entertainment value, I've ever read.I love how Brown introduces interesting information about history, culture, art and religion as part of the quest to solve the mysteries. It doesn't look like a huge dump of information. I love reading it. I think it is very smart.I liked this book better than The Da Vinci Code. Here, a particle of antimatter, which when coming in contact with matter produces a huge explosion, in a special canister gets stolen from a laboratory, and is placed somewhere in Vatican city during conclave, the ritual in which all the cardinals are reunited to choose a new pope. If the battery from the canister runs out, it will explode, and will destroy Vatican City along with all the cardinals inside. They have less than 24 hours to find it.That's not the only thing going on. There are other critical situations that they need to resolve, but it all adds up, and it creates an outstanding thriller, with many twists and turns, action, and all the incredible research by Mr. Brown.Even though the story was very good, I think there were some things that didn't make much sense. Sometimes Dan Brown, to enable the characters do something that would help with the story, would make it easier for them to have access to some areas. Not really a spoiler, but there was a point in which everyone was like ""What the hell, let's break all the rules of Vatican City!"" and nothing mattered anymore. I think in that sense it was not very realistic. It also applies to the general reaction of the audience, the people who were waiting outside the Vatican for the election of the new Pope. Even after they were told there was this antimatter, and was going to explode, they were still there. I think in real life, people would have left immediately to somewhere safer, they wouldn't stay there to see the events that were unfolding.The movie doesn't make justice to the book. They changed many of the good things that are jaw-dropping, and eliminate others. It is boring, and ridiculous compared to the book in my opinion.I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good, entertaining thriller to read.

288,925108805,04/30/2014,5.0," In the Name of the Brotherhood  A review on Dan Brown’s Angels and Demons Title: Angels and DemonsAuthor: Dan Brown Rank: 84th book in 2014Plot movement: 5starsEntertainment Factor: 5starsCharacters: 5starsWriting Style: 4starsDetails: 5starsProvoking:  5starsWorldly Relevance: 4starsSuspense: 5starsConclusion: 5starsEmotion: 4starsTherforeThis is my first Dan Brown experience so let me say that it exceeds my expectation. Since I read Gone Girl – Gillian Flynn (5stars) I craved for more suspense/thriller books. I’m not used to it at first because my common books in my bookshelves are more of dystopian or young adult. I give myself a try, why don’t I seek for more genres outside my haven. So here it is – Angels and Demons.My close friend warned me about this book. She doesn’t like Dan Brown much because of the impression on his The Da Vinci Code novel that turned into film last 2009 if im not mistaken. I’m the bad guy here so I didn’t follow her opinion. I read A&D (Angels and Demons). So here’s the catch, when I took my Art Appreciation subject when I was a first year student (2010), this subject was my most favorite. Maybe because of the sculptures and the history that lies on it. Plus, my Art Appreciation teacher was agnostic so he gave plenty of his understanding about this matter. That time, I was feeling a little bit agnostic (I even questioned the existence of God) but now, I renew my faith with God so there’s no problem with my religion stableness. :D HAHAAs a physics teacher, yes I agree with the opposite of everything such as up quarks and down quarks, protons and electrons, north pole and south pole of magnetism. Even with my classmates, we discussed a little bit of existence of what we called antimatter with is the topic on the novel. But on the book, there are some flaws regarding science and religion. We cannot make opposites join together such as science and religion. If the science proves the existence of particle God, then the faith on churches will decrease no matter how strong the churches are. I just ignore it because while reading, I remind myself that this is a novel – fiction- this is not a textbook so let me just digest the context of the book.Highly engaging, what more can I say. With the Illuminati brotherhood, fucking awesome ambigrams, the killings of cardinals on different elements are the strong points of the novel. Plus with this 500+ pages, the entire book happens within 24 hours period. This is awesome.When it comes to entertainment factor, this is very entertaining. When I’m reading this novel, sometimes I murmur foul words because of the intense scenes on the book. Fucking book! I even had a palpitation because of the information about the brotherhood. Another one, I am highly amazed on the angles pointing to each destination of the new element. I even looked for the pictures of the said church or sculpture mentioned on the book.",3,0.9948,0.054,0.787,0.16,0.5167131844763423,POSITIVE,0.9773
289,604412642,05/01/2013,1.0,"""It's better than The Da Vinci Code,"" they said. ""You'll like this one more,"" they said. ""The facts are closer to reality,"" they said.So I found this in the library and read it.There is absolutely a reason Dan Brown is used as a derisive name of non-scholarship among us medievalists. He has no idea what he's talking about, but he makes it horrendously popular; much of my teaching is undoing the concepts he's gotten people to swallow.The premise of this is itself absurd: the Illuminati are trying to take down the Catholic Church once and for all. The whole argument is built on the premise that religion and science hate each other and have always hated each other and can't be in the same room together, like ex-spouses at a shared child's wedding. WRONG. Brown's characters keep claiming this goes all the way back to the Middle Ages (oh no, not that far!) when ""true"" scientists got fed up with being suffocated by the Church and went underground with their resentment, when in fact most of the best medieval scientists were devout Christians. Roger Bacon, who ""invented"" eyeglasses and discovered the light spectrum as well as planning planes, cars, and steamships 600 years before the Wright Brothers and Henry Ford, was a Franciscan friar. (Yes, he did get in a scuffle with some of his superiors, but the Pope supported him the whole way.) Peter Abelard, Thomas Aquinas, Isidore of Seville, William of Occam--all part of the Church, seeking to uphold its doctrines by reason and logic, not in spite of it. Science and religion/faith were partners, not enemies.But noooo, far easier to see the Middle Ages through the lens of Petrarch and the humanists' disdain for all things not Roman, that speed bump of history. It's folks like Robert Langdon and company who keep calling the Middle Ages the Dark Ages, which just irks me.So the premise is bad. The writing is terribly elementary, also--there are no richly spooled out sentences here, because Brown writes like a journalist--flashy for the lowest common denominator.There is one section that deserves praise--the speech of the camerlengo that reveals all that's been going on. It was the best part of the book, really, in which the character decries science as the ""new God"". Really, skip the rest of the book and read pages 378-84. It was better than The Da Vinci Code, especially because I didn't predict the ending by chapter four. But the bar is low enough that pretty much anything could achieve that. Go read real history--much better. (Although, I must admit, it was pretty hilarious to read this, completely by accident, during the choosing of Pope Francis this spring.)",3,0.9316,0.109,0.75,0.141,0.5060659789383194,NEGATIVE,0.9995

291,1919165345,04/08/2017,3.0,"After (stupidly) reading The Da Vinci Code first, I was really excited for more of Robert Langdon's adventures and another fast-paced, highly suspenseful treasure hunt. Unfortunately, I wasn't as blown away by this one as I was by his second quest.First of all, I definitely prefer Sophie Neveu as Langdon's ""side-kick"" over Vittoria Vetra. I feel like Vittoria was there more to bring another perspective to the narrative than to actually develop the plot and push the storyline forward. We really know nothing about her, I found it hard to relate.Another issue - this one not as minor as disliking a supporting character - is that I don't like the main character either. While this is an interesting and intentional means in other books, I can't help but think that Dan Brown wants us to like Langdon. He is fully made out to be likable, even relatable, but I just find him annoying. His self-importance, his overly charming behaviour and the way things just simply seem to happen for him... urgh! Langdon just seems to be really impressed with himself - a very unattractive character trait.Furthermore, I found the plot absurd. So many eventualities, coincidences, unlikely and impossible events seem to all occur at the same time, this is far from realistic. Of course, creativity and imagination are allowed as a writer's tools but this far-fetched story stands in deep contrast to Dan Brown's wish for reason and reality. There is no room for negotiations, every detail is minutely planned out and explained, but the overall concept just lacks credibility.On the other hand though, the choice of topic was impeccable. Science and religion are omnipresent, all-important, influential and seemingly opposing entities. Not just for personal reasons but also in general have I wondered whether these two are mutually exclusive. Is there a scientific explanation for God, a higher power, and what does it take to make an individual believe? Under these ponderings, I found it particularly intriguing to follow the character development of both the Camerlengo and of Cardinal Mortati. Without wanting to spoil anything, I was left astonished by more than one revelation throughout the book. Expecting plot twists left, right and centre, I was still not fully prepared for some of the discoveries that are laid bare. All in all this is definitely an enjoyable read. Once more, I am left aghast by how this novel plays out in just 24 hours, and how the beautiful ancient cities of Rome and the Vatican are woven into the literary scenery. Expect 180 degree-turns, half-researched facts about Catholic history and a slightly conceited American intellectual and you won't be disappointed.",3,0.9947,0.049,0.792,0.159,0.463860544217687,NEGATIVE,0.9999

294,135841659,12/20/2010,4.0,"When I was hunting for a story that was based in Rome, Italy, this is the one that stood out like a sore thumb. It is one of those books that it seems like everyone has read, or at least seen the film adaptation of... everyone apart from me! I didn't really want to read this book - I was actually dreading it. I am not a big fan of mystery or crime books, so I didn't think that this book would be for me. I also thought that the book would be one huge info-dump. Nonetheless, I picked it up and gave it a go simply because it was set in Rome. I am so, so glad that I gave this book a chance as I was completely blown away.There was a lot of information provided the history of Rome and the Illuminati in this story, but rather than feeling overwhelming, it was simply fascinating - I couldn't get enough information and it has made me want to look into the Illuminati more. I really can't describe how interesting that this book is - on almost every page I was learning something new without feeling as though I was having a history lesson. Dan Brown is amazingly clever in the way that he links all of his facts together. Reading this on the plane home from Rome was a real treat - Brown led me around the city through this book and taught me lots about its history. Whilst I doubt that the events that occurred in this book are going to happen anytime soon, it was quite realistic and as I've mentioned, Brown fabricated this story very impressively. The characters didn't have particularly amazing personalities, but they were strong and they interacted well. I did like our main character, Langdon, my fondness for him growing as the story progressed. I loved Vittoria Vetra too - a bit kick-ass and very brave. We were of course introduced to lots of other characters, though they were all well defined and it was easy to keep track. There were a whole load of twists throughout the book, some a little predictable but thankfully, quite a few that weren't too. The book was generally fast paced though I did feel that there were brief sections where it lagged. It did take me a little while to get into the book as it's not my usual genre, but once I did adjust to it, I was hooked. This wasn't the best book I've ever read, but it was certainly one of the smartest which is what made it so good.

I started it about a week ago & it took me a really long time to finish because I got sick so badly & was trying to finish Yu-Gi-Oh!5D's with it & it became somehow boring before the middle until the late 500 pages that I really started to get sleepy while reading a few pages of it xD but the last events (after the explosion of the antimatter & survival of the camerlengo & Robert) were so shocking that I had to reconsider my opinion of it !So , the story was very good in the beginning but as I said became boring in the middle but in the end turned out brilliant (& I'm not found of crimes & detective things) & the language is so easy (I didn't need to use a dictionary at all) & fluent that it pulls you in even if the events are boring & I really liked Robert & Vittoria's characters & since the beginning I shipped them xD & Mickey's watch that Robert owns is a great point in the book :D & What I liked the best are the Illuminati amigrams because they were just so beautiful & that the writer knows some Arabic words & pronounce them perfectly (even thought I found it hard to read them in English)& of course the twist at the end (even thought I had a feeling while reading it that the camerlengo was the late pop's son or someone related to him at least) & the using of Italian a lot which resembles French somehow so I learned some new words :) & I got to know a lot about artists & stuff that I know only hints about or just its name & now I really wanna go to Vatican city in the future if god wills :DSo 3.5/5 because of the boring parts for me xD & I hope The Da vinci Code will be even better thought I guess I won't be reading it any time soon because of the damn school :'(",3,0.9963,0.068,0.754,0.178,0.5515962052132265,NEGATIVE,0.8401
