""Hang on. This Lord Voldything's back, you say.""
When a book gets too long, there's always the risk of giving up halfway, or start skimming through parts. I think, The Order of Phoenix qualifies as long (the version I read had around a 1000 pages), but I wish it to be even longer. Only Rowling can do that. I didn't find one boring bit, or anything out of place. We are reaching a near-perfect level of writing here at the fifth of the series, which, in my opinion, is an excellent concoction of suspense, hope, triumph, disappointment, humor, anger, happiness, sadness and so many others.
""I've always wanted to try firewhisky -""
Right from the beginning, you'll find everything to be intriguing as always, with an excellent set of new characters being introduced. The main characters around Harry are of course the main focus, and the narration inherits a lot from how the teenage Harry views the world. Average emotional rollercoaster of a teenager blends in nicely with the main plot, and makes things more interesting.
""Ask us no questions and we'll tell you no lies,""
We've finally moved in to the core of the story, and an-action-packed story is being unfolded - full of dark times - with no more holding back. If it wasn't for Rowling's writing, this might've felt like one complex story, not to mention how unbearable it would've been with Umbrige, and also with Lestrange and Fudge closely behind. But everything's put in place perfectly, and even the annoying characters do their part really well. And the ending chapters - though disappointing - are the best and most dramatic in the series so far. This has been one amazing ride, while proving the 'Last-is-Best' still to be true.
""Youth cannot know how age thinks and feels. But old men are guilty if they forget what it was to be young...""

8,26033375,07/01/2008,5.0,"I cried like a little baby. J.K. Rowling really starts taking the series down a darker road in this book. She is so talented at character development, and it really shines in this book. Here, Harry is 15 years old, and for most of the book, he's whiny and self-centered, just like a typical teenager. I also adore Dumbledore's role in this book--his conversation at the end with Harry put me to tears. Rowling did an amazing job with the character of Umbridge...never have I hated a fictional character more than I hated her. I do have to admit, I'm curious to see whether she makes any more appearances or not. For me, this book was stronger for character development than plot. Yes, this is a key book for the series, but I felt like most of the book was spent with characters' internal issues and development rather than the plot. I love how Harry and the crew are dealing with more adult issues now, such as relationships and death. As with all of her books, I have a really difficult time putting these books down, but especially within the last 100 pages, I physically could not separate the book from my hands. Overall, another outstanding addition from J.K. Rowling. ",408,0.9115,0.077,0.781,0.142,0.4904100529100529,POSITIVE,0.9996
9,923913499,04/29/2014,5.0,"Despite this being the longest book in the series, I read it quicker than all the others. Here’s three things I really loved about it: 1. Harry and Sirius- they never had much time together but the time they did have really influenced Harry’s development, a few wise words from a sincere friend (or godfather) can go a real long way. And this scene was perhaps the most powerfully written in the series for me, we all know what happens next: 2. Dumbledore’s Army- Harry, Ron and Hermione have always taken matters into their own hands; they’ve never waited for someone to come along and save them. And here they have got so many great characters involved in their heroics, which leads me onto my next point. 3. Luna Lovegood- because the weird people are always the best people. Luna’s by far my favourite character because she is so completely herself in all her colourfulness; she’s often ignored, avoided and even ridiculed as a result but secretly she is brilliant. The world needs more Luna Lovegoods. I always thought she had far more chemistry with Harry than Ginny ever did. ",354,0.9876,0.051,0.761,0.188,0.5847826086956522,POSITIVE,1.0

⭐️In Defense of Harry Potter: Order of the Pheonix
So this is my second favorite book of Harry Potter. And I plan to tell you exactly why the fuck why. Order of the Pheonix is the most emotional book of the entire series, in a lot of ways. You have the visit to Neville's parents, Harry's ending breakdown as a character, the backstory behind Snape and Sirius... It deals with the deep emotional stuff in a way that the first few books didn't, with the possible exception of Prisoner of Azkaban. This book will make you cry.
⭐️Interlude: In Defense of Harry's Angst Phase
Harry is an incredibly traumatized young adult who's just been isolated from every person who cares about him all summer. Literally every single person who cares about him. You try being dropped in that situation and not being upset, especially as a fifteen-year-old. But what really stands out here is Harry's character arc as he comes to be less angsty. This book took him to his bottom point and to his top and it's brilliant. 
Return To Actual Review
J.K. Rowling really nails down her tonal shifts in this book. The darker tone really takes this series to the next level in terms of plot AND character work. Order of the Pheonix is so dark and yet so hopeful. It's about resisting oppression in any way you can and it's just a perfect fucking book god I love this book so much The plotting is brilliant, incorporating one of the most terrifying villains I have ever read about in my entire life. She's so human and that's what makes her such a terrifying character. Also, the plot reveals at the end. The interesting twist on the chosen one trope in regards to Neville. The side characters and the entire concept of the DA and their bonding as a team really stand out here. There's something incredibly powerful in Harry Potter, who has worked alone the last few books, needing to ask for help. Harry realizes that he doesn't have to be alone. This book also deals with the fact that adults aren't perfect, even when they love you and want to help you. Also, Ginny Weasley is fucking perfect. Why do all of you sleep on her verbal DRAG of Harry? “I forgo–” “LUCKY YOU” This book is also undoubtedly the funniest of the series. Fred and George. The school resistance to Umbridge. I don't know, maybe Lord Voldemort? IT UNSCREWS THE OTHER WAY.This book is just fucking perfect. My mother is giving me annoyed looks while reading this review on her goodreads app but I don't care, this book is perfect.",240,0.9658,0.059,0.823,0.118,0.5384075543797766,POSITIVE,0.9998

Deprived of their usual car-washing and lawn-mowing pursuits, the inhabitants of Privet Drive had retreated into the shade of their cool houses, windows thrown wide in the hope of tempting in a nonexistent breeze.

""HolyMadonna, how big is this book?"" my daughter says, without fear for the number of pages, she looked more excited for the opening of this new adventure. And it starts with a bang, with two dementors attacking Harry and his cousin Dudley in a muggles area, out in the open. The rules of the usual Rowling's game have definitely changed. . The axiom ""before we'll be between the welcoming arms of Hogwarts, and after many things will happen"" no longer exists. The previous chapter of the series, also, started in the spirit of this new trend: you're not safe anywhere. Everything is more complicated for Harry Potter, it is difficult even to sleep by now.«There is a room in the Department of Mysteries that is kept locked at all times. It contains a force that is at once more wonderful and more terrible than death, than human intelligence, than the forces of nature. It is also, perhaps, the most mysterious of the many subjects for study that reside there»Let's talk frankly, the entire novel revolves around this room and what's on it, and there are numerous signs and things said that make me think that we will be back on the argument in the future. In fact, despite a series of revelations came about this room at the end of the novel, an air of mystery remains.And sadness remains too. So much sadness.Vote: 9«Il giorno più caldo dell'estate – almeno fino a quel momento – volgeva al termine e un silenzio sonnacchioso gravava sulle grandi case quadrate di Privet Drive. Le automobili di solito scintillanti sostavano impolverate nei vialetti e i prati un tempo verde smeraldo si stendevano incartapecoriti e giallognoli, perché l'irrigazione era stata proibita a causa della siccità. In mancanza delle loro consuete occupazioni – lavare l'auto e falciare il prato – gli abitanti di Privet Drive si erano rintanati nella penombra delle loro case fresche, con le finestre spalancate nella speranza di indurre una brezza inesistente a entrare. La sola persona rimasta all'aperto era un adolescente che giaceva lungo disteso sulla schiena in un'aiuola fuori dal numero quattro»Comincia il ""big 5"" di Harry Potter, il volume più lungo della serie. ""O Madonnamia quanto è gigante"", dice mia figlia quando lo vede, per nulla spaventata dalla mole, anzi eccitata da questa nuova avventura che sta per iniziare. E comincia col botto, con due dissennatori che aggrediscono Harry e il cugino Dudlley in piena terra babbana, alla luce del sole. Sono definitivamente cambiate le regole del gioco della Rowling al quale eravamo abituati in precedenza, ossia prima si arriva tra le accoglienti mura di Hogwarts e poi succedono tante cose. Non più. Già il capitolo precedente della saga era iniziato all'insegna del nuovo trend potteriano: non si è più al sicuro da nessuna parte. Per Harry è tutto sempre più complicato, gli riesce difficile perfino dormire in santa pace.«Nell'Ufficio Misteri c'è una stanza che viene tenuta sempre chiusa. Contiene una forza al tempo stesso più meravigliosa e più terribile della morte, dell'intelligenza umana e della natura. E forse il più misterioso fra i molti soggetti che vengono studiati laggiù»Parliamoci francamente, l'intero romanzo ruota attorno a questa stanza e a quello che contiene, e ci sono molteplici indizi e mezze frasi dette che mi fanno pensare che si ritornerà a parlare di essa, tentando di chiarirne l'essenza misteriosa, che però permane nonostante tutta una serie di rivelazioni a fine romanzo.E permane tristezza. Tanta tristezza.Voto: 9",219,0.0132,0.049,0.895,0.056,0.4261087551903879,NEGATIVE,0.9541

❝Things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end, if not always in the way we expect.❞

Rating: ★ ★ ★ ¾I feel like I'm going to get attacked for only rating a Harry Potter book 3.75 stars but Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is probably my LEAST favorite of the series thus far. It went by so slow and I felt like too much went on but at the same time nothing really happened. This book could've easily been made at least 200 pages shorter if J.K. Rowling got rid of all the pointless details and chapters that added nothing significant to the storyline. The movie was never really one of my favorites either and that was probably the primary reason it took me more than a month to get through Order of the Phoenix.On top of that, I wasn't a big fan of Harry in this book. I understand that he went through a whole lot after the events of Goblet of Fire but he was moody and a jerk to everyone around him 98% of the time and although I can empathize with him, it became too over the top for me and I got tired of it real fast. He just kept snapping and going off on all the wrong people and it got really annoying. All the constant CAPITALIZED yelling didn't help too much either.Even though Order of the Phoenix was my least favorite movie and book, I LOVED the concept of Dumbledore's Army. I just loved seeing all the students in action and actually putting everything they learned into good use. We finally get to meet Luna Lovegood, one of my favorite Harry Potter characters of all time, and I was so ecstatic every time her name was mentioned.As for Umbridge, she was also the ultimate villain in this book. She was the woman you LOVED to HATE and I felt the movie nailed this portrayal so perfectly. If J.K. Rowling's goal was to make you want to rip your own hair to shreds, she succeeded that and more.Overall, I felt the book was unnecessarily long but the movie itself was not much better. Where the book felt too slow, the film adaptation felt too rushed leaving out key details. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix will probably always be my least favorite book and movie in the series, but the worst Harry Potter book is still a whole league better than a lot of other books.",210,-0.8149,0.139,0.746,0.115,0.6008333333333333,NEGATIVE,1.0

The Written Review
Now we've entered the start of the not-so-happy arc. I don't even want to think about the ending. I would much prefer to reread the first four books again than suffer (vicariously) through that ending with Harry.The twins antics keeps the book from becoming too depressing and Professor Umbridge is simply divine as the Big Bad. On a side note, ever think J K Rowling just wants to give sage advice to her kids and wrote an entire book to cover that up?
Indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike.

Youth can not know how age thinks and feels. But old men are guilty if they forget what it was to be young.

We've all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to act on.

Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix follows Harry Potter's struggles through his fifth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, including the surreptitious return of the antagonist Lord Voldemort, O.W.L. exams, and an obstructive Ministry of Magic. During the summer, Harry Potter and his cousin Dudley are attacked by Dementors. Forced to use magic to fend them off, Harry is expelled from Hogwarts, but his expulsion is postponed pending a hearing at the Ministry of Magic. Harry is whisked off to Number 12, Grimmauld Place, the childhood home of Sirius Black, by a group of wizards belonging to the Order of the Phoenix.Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger explain that the Order is a secret organisation led by Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore, dedicated to fighting Lord Voldemort and the Death Eaters. Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny Weasley and Fred and George Weasley learn that Voldemort is seeking something he lacked prior to his defeat. The Ministry, led by Cornelius Fudge, refuses to accept Voldemort's return, and are running a smear campaign against Harry and Dumbledore. At the hearing, Dumbledore defends Harry, who is cleared of all charges.At Hogwarts, Dolores Umbridge, a senior Ministry employee, becomes the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. She refuses to believe in Voldemort's return, and clashes with Harry, punishing him by having him magically carve ""I must not tell lies"" into the back of his hand. She also refuses to teach her students how to perform defensive magic, prompting Harry, Ron, and Hermione to form their own Defence group with other students. Umbridge, empowered by the Ministry to interfere in Hogwarts as the new High Inquisitor, bans unapproved clubs, forcing the group, now called Dumbledore's Army, to meet in secret in the Room of Requirement to practice under Harry's instruction. ...عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «هری پاتر و فرمان ققنوس»؛ «هری پاتر و محفل ققنوس»؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش در ماه دسامبر سال2003میلادیکتاب پنجم «هری پاتر و فرمان ققنوس» از سری «هری پاتر»، که با ترجمه ی جناب آقای «فریدون قاضی زاده» و سرکار خانم «نفیسه ی سلطانی»، با ویرایش سرکار خانم «نسیم عزیزی» در872صفحه، و با چهار تابلوی رنگی از هنرپیشه های فیلم، توسط نشر روزگار، با جلد شمیز چاپ شده است، قیمت کتاب با جلد شمیز50000ریال، همین کتاب، با عنوان «هری پاتر و محفل ققنوس» در سه جلد با ترجمه ی سرکار خانم «ویدا اسلامیه»، با جلد گالینگور، توسط کتابسرای تندیس نیز، چاپ و منتشر شده است؛ قیمت سه جلد جمعا98000ریال است؛ دو ترجمه را مقایسه کردم، هر دو ترجمه خوب بودند، رقابتی بیهوده برای ...؛ اگر در یکی از برگردانها اشکالی بود، باز میشد، خود را به کوچه ی دیگری رساندپنجمین کتاب از مجموعه ی داستان‌های هفت گانه ی «هری پاتر»؛ نوشتهٔ سرکار بانو «جی.کی رولینگ» است؛ این کتاب طولانی‌ترین رمان این سری است، و نسخه ی «آمریکایی» آن در870صفحه، و ترجمه فارسی بانو «ویدا اسلامیه» نزدیک به1250صفحه است؛ ماجرای این رمان، پس از بازگشت «لرد سیاه» روی می‌دهد؛ جمعی از جادوگران، گروهی را به ریاست «آلبوس دامبلدور»، با نام «محفل ققنوس» تشکیل میدهند، تا برای مبارزه با «ولدمورت» آماده شوند؛ این کتاب یکی از سیاه‌ترین، و تلخ‌ترین ماجراهای «هری پاتر» است؛ هشدار: اگر داستان را هنوز نخوانده اید و میخواهید بخوانید، ادامه ریویو، داستان را لو میدهددر پایان کتاب، «رولینگ»، خوانشگرانش را، با سازمان اسرار آشنا می‌سازد؛ که بسیار شگفت انگیز است؛ در وزارت سحر و جادو، نبرد اعجاب آوری بین «لرد ولدمورت» و «آلبوس دامبلدور»، روی می‌دهد؛ و سرانجام خوانشگران درمی‌یابند، که «ولدمورت»، برای پیشگیری از پیشگویی، که «سیبل تریلانی (یکی از استادان پیشگویی مدرسه هاگوارتز)» در آن اعلام کرده بود، که تنها کسیکه می‌تواند «ولدمورت» را، شکستی ابدی بدهد، در واپسین روز ماه «ژوئیه» به دنیا میآید، و پدر و مادر این پسر، پیش‌تر، سه بار در برابر «ولدمورت» ایستادگی کرده‌ اند؛ در این داستان «دلورس آمبریج»، که از وزارت سحر و جادو، برای تدریس درس «دفاع در برابر جادوی سیاه»، در مدرسه «هاگوارتز» برگزیده شده‌، رفته رفته از سوی وزارت سحر و جادو، رتبه‌ اش بالاتر می‌رود؛ او قوانین دشواری در مدرسه برقرار می‌کند؛ او به عنوان تنبیه، «هری پاتر» را وادار می‌کند، که با خون خودش، روی دستش حک کند، که: «من نباید دروغ بگویم»؛ در اواخر داستان، «فرد» و «جرج ویزلی»، از مدرسه جادوگری «هاگوارتز»، فرار می‌کنند، و با این فرار، نام خود را زبانزد خاص و عام می‌کنند؛ در این شماره از مجموعه داستان‌های «هری پاتر»، نگهبان مدرسه «هاگوارتز»، «هاگرید»، با خانم «ماکسیم»، به ماموریتی، برای صلح، میان غولها به سفر می‌روند، و با «گراوپ»، برادر «هاگرید» که غول است، حتی نمی‌تواند به زبان انسان‌ها سخن بگوید، برمی‌گردند؛ «هاگرید» از «هری»، و «هرمیون (هرماینی)» درخواست می‌کند، که به برادرش الفبا را، یاد بدهند؛ در پایان داستان، «بلاتریکس لسترنج»، پدر خوانده ی «هری»، یعنی «سیریوس بلک» را، به قتل می‌رساند، «آلبوس دامبلدور» نیز، با «لرد ولدمورت»، در وزارت سحر و جادو، درگیر می‌شوند و میجنگند؛نقل متن از کتاب دوم برگردان خانم «ویدا اسلامیه»: (ماه دسامبر که از راه رسید، برف بیش‌تری به همراه داشت، و بهمنی از تکالیف، برای دانش آموزان سال پنجمی، به ارمغان آورد؛ با نزدیک شدن «کریسمس»، وظایف ارشدی «رون»، و «هرمیون» سنگین‌تر می‌شد؛ به آن‌ها گفته بودند، که بر تزیین قلعه، نظارت کنند (رون می‌گفت: «درست موقعی که آدم می‌خواد ریسه ‌های پرزرق‌وبرق رو ببنده، بدعنق یه سر دیگه شو می‌گیره، و می‌خواد با اون آدمو خفه کنه.»)، و مراقب باشند تا دانش آموزان سال اوّل و دوم، زنگ تفریحشان را در قلعه بگذرانند، چرا که هوا سرد و سوز دار بود (رون می‌گفت: «نمی‌دونی چه بچه پرروهایی هستن، کی ما وقتی کلاس اول بودیم، اينقدر رومون زیاد بودا») و به نوبت با «آرگوس فیلچ»، در راهروها سرکشی کنند، زیرا «فیلچ» تصور می‌کرد، ممکن است، حال و هوای تعطیلات باعث شود، بچه‌ ها با هم دوئل کنند (رون با خشم گفته بود: «توی کلّه‌ش به جای مغز، پهنه!»)؛ کارشان آنقدر زیاد بود، که «هرمیون» بافتن کلاه، برای جن‌های خانگی را، کنار گذاشته بود، و غرغر می‌کرد، که فقط سه کلاه دیگر برایش مانده است.)؛ پایان نقلتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 22/12/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 26/09/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی",189,-0.9168,0.035,0.939,0.025,0.6254124579124578,NEGATIVE,0.747

I know it's not fair to compare, but because the film version of Order of the Phoenix isn't one of my favorites, coupled with the fact that this is the longest novel in the series, I was really nervous to get to this one. Obviously I was a muggle fool who deserves to be chased around by Peeves for a full 24 hours, because this was such a vital installment that really breathed a mature life into the series. The ending of Goblet of Fire is quite dark, but I felt book #5 is where the series really gets down to business and loses the childlike innocence that it clasped tightly for some long. What a brilliant, hauntingly beautiful way to write a series that grows as the reader does.

There's blackout here ;_;  4.9 Stars 
'Yeah' said Harry, 'but you, unlike me, are a git, so get out and leave us alone.' 
I supposed to post the review yesterday but there was a blackout while I was reviewing and you can imagine how pissed I was when suddenly my computer was off and the review was already quite long. I was like this : well, I wasn't screaming because it was midnight but I was really really angry. well let's talk about this book :D *breaths in Breaths out* there were lots of tears, laugh, sadness, happiness and anger while I was reading it and I'm here still can't accept the death of the guy I cared care. I mean, why do I always lose charcters that I love or care?!?! why Sirius?! not Kreacher or anyone, anyone means Cho Chang actually...okay let's begin with Cho Chang. 
I Ship Harry With Ginny Not Cho Chang
I totally HATE this girl. She is a cry baby and she is also weird. one minute she is happy and then suddenly she bursts into tears and she always exaggerate problems. little problem can be big problem with her and I still don't know why Harry had feelings to her. yes, had. because he doesn't like Cho Chang anymore. YAY! finally he opened his eyes! and these scenes made me hate her so much :   ➜ He turned to saw Cho standing in the middle of the room, tears pouring down her face. ➜ 'I thought,' she said, tears spattering down on to the table, 'I thought you'd u - u - understand! I need to talk about it! Surely you n - need to talk about it t - too! I mean, you saw it happen, d - didn't you?' ➜ 'I'll see you around, Harry,' she said dramatically , and hiccoughing slightly she dashed to the door, wrenched it open and hurried off into the pouring rain.➜ 'I'm really, really sorry. That interview was so brave ... it made me cry.' ➜ 'That was a really horrible trick of Hermione Granger's,' said Chp fiercely. 'She should have told us she'd jinxed that list -''I think it was brilliant idea,' said harry coldly, Cho flushed and her eyes grew brighter.'Oh yes, I forgot - of course, if it was darling Hermione's idea -''Don't start crying again,' said Harry warningly.'I wasn't going to! she shouted.'Yeah ... well ... good,' he said. 'I've got enough to cop with at the moment.''Go and cope with it then!' Cho said furiously, turning on her heel and stalking off. ➜ 'Yeah,' said Ron slowly, savouring the words, 'we won. Did you see the look on Cho's face when Ginny got the snitch right out from under her nose?''I suppose she cried, did she?' said Harry bitterly,'Well, yeah - more out of temper than anything, though ...' Ron frowned slightly. 'But you saw her chuck her broom away when she got back to the ground, didn't you?' and she was totally insane, why did she have to ask about Cedric to Harry while they were dating. of course Harry didn't want to talk abou Cedric! and Didn't she have feelings?! I'm sure Harry didn't want to remember that horrible memory. I ship Harry with Ginny because : ❤ Ginny is funny ❤ Ginny is not a crybaby ❤ Ginny is brave ❤ Ginny is more beautiful than Cho❤ She is basically more perfect than Cho 
I Don't Like Harry's Temper 
I know, Harry was having a hard time but that didn't mean he had the rights to be harsh to his best friends. they will always on his side and there was a scene where he snapped at Hermione.  'Been having a nice little chat with her about whether or not I'm a lying, attention-seeking prat, have you?' Harry said loudly.'No,' said Hermione calmly. 'I told her to keep her big fat mouth shut about you, actually. And it would be quite nice if you stopped jumping down our throats, Harry, because in case you haven't noticed, Ron and I are on your side.'There was a short pause.'Sorry,' said Harry in a low voice.'That's quite all right,' said Hermione with dignity. Then she shook her head. 'Don't you remember what Dumbledore said at the last end-of-term feast?' and they continued talking.oh! I also didn't like Harry when he shouted at professor Dumbledore because he just saved his life and he's clearly older than Harry, So Harry had to talk calmly to him even though he was angry and the most annoying thing was that he destroyed Dumbledore's possessions. he was totally rudeI know, I know he was sad because Sirius just died and I was sad too! I cried a lot! but I didn't angry with Dumbledore. I was angry with Kreacher, Bellatrix and Voldemort. I still am, actually. how could I forgive them?! they killed Sirius! 
I Love Sirius Especially Young Sirius
With another shock of excitement, Harry saw Sirius give James the thumbs-up. Sirius was lounging in his chair at ease, tilting it back on two legs. He was very good-looking; his dark hair fell into his eyes with a sort of casual elegance neither James's nor Harry's could ever have achieved, and a girl sitting behind him was eyeing him hopefully, though he didn't seem to have noticed.OH.MY.GOD. HE IS SO HANDSOME. BUT WHY!?! WHY DID HE HAVE TO DIE?!?! I LIKE SIRIUS SO MUCH!! AND NOW, I WILL NEVER SEE HIM ANYMORE! LIFE IS SO UNFAIR. thank you for reading and liking this review, guys! hope you guys have a great day! ❤❤P.S.

She crafted it beautifully throughout the series. - Harry’s grief was palpable and it hurt. A lot. - Harry and Cho’s relationship was boring as hell. - Dumbledore is my favourite character ever.

32,2516681,06/28/2007,1.0,"hrrmmpp.This is my least favourite of the Harry Potter series, and almost borders on the ""don't bother"". It is saved only by the virtue that it is a Harry Potter book and moves the series along to the still yet unknown finale.My issues with it:- deals with complex social/political problems in a simplified, extreme, and dichotomous manner- characterisations are too easy/lazy- all good or all bad (with the exception of Snape who's good/evil intentions are yet unknown), all courageous or cowardly, the righteous or the corrupt. - Malfoy junior is the most incompetent nemesis in the history of evil. And whilst this was acceptable in the earlier books where there was an element of the comical in his attempts to be evil, by book 5, where the themes have become signifantly darker, he and his side-kicks' unchanging and inane attempts to foil Harry's ultimate fate have just become annoying. The only saving grace is that Harry has more than enough true and worthwhile enemies and obstacles for the reader to really get bogged down by Malfoy's silliness. - the laudable themes of power/corruption/propaganda/censorship are played out with such naive characterisations, extreme situations and melodramaticism that it results in inflammatory knee-jerk reactions rather than furthering understanding of the subleties of these ideas. - the plot seems confused, as if JK Rowling has all these ideas, but is unsure of where she ultimately wants to go, thereby leaving in all these subplots that neither has entertainment, wisdom nor story-advancing value. EG what's with Grawp and the freaking giants??Overall- read it only as a part of the greater goal of coming closer to the ending of the series.",156,-0.9491,0.131,0.796,0.073,0.6385521885521885,NEGATIVE,1.0

I’ve been reading it for SO LONG. The notes I took at the beginning have long since disappeared and I just can’t remember vast swaths of this book. This might be a review of the last 200 pages.Okay, the extreme Ravenclaw in me is coming out here - WHY DON’T HARRY AND RON EVER DO THEIR HOMEWORK? I swear to God the sub-plotline in the middle of every single book is them falling behind in their classes, and it stresses me out. Get on top of your work!And then every once in awhile, the stakes will be way higher...and these boys still apply the same procrastination to it. It happened in Goblet of Fire, when Harry would put off working on the task hints - WAY MORE IMPORTANT THAN DIVINATION DREAM CHARTS. And it happened in this book, when Harry just...didn’t try at Occlumency. I know you don’t like Snape, kid. Neither do I. In fact, my list of notes for my anti-Snape rant just kept growing through this book. BUT IT’S FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY AND THE SAFETY OF COUNTLESS OTHERS! PEOPLE YOU LOVE!And poor Ron in this book, right? He finally gets good at Quidditch - good at something - and there’s no one there to see him. His brothers leave him at school. Harry just...freaks out at him sometimes. Things are always rough for poor unappreciated Ron, but this is particularly tragic. And don’t even get me STARTED on Neville in this book. The Gryffindor in him really comes out. His life is so hard, and he is still so brave and loving. Oh my God, I’m legitimately getting choked up.Well, not actually. But as close as I get. And disclaimer, 25 percent of that sadness is because “Audition (The Fools Who Dream)” just came up on my Spotify and LA LA LAND IS AN EMOTIONAL FILM.Rating this book is going to be a struggle. I didn’t enjoy the first 600 pages, like, at all. And then I goddamn loved the last 200. Oh god. Now I have to both delineate why the first 600 pages - which I can barely remember - were bad, while the last 200 were good.Alright, I’ll try to do this quickly because clearly I’m ramble-y tonight. The first 600 pages were a terrible combination of boring AND upsetting. I’m still surprised by how Grimmauld Place managed to be such a snoozefest. A secret rebel order of wizards inhabiting a hidden house filled with dangerous relics manages to make me doze off? Unreal. Then we have to watch as a world we all hold dear is torn apart by terrible leadership - Umbridge, yes, but I also think we don’t discuss Minister of Magic Fudge’s incompetency enough.As if that weren’t enough, all these fabulous characters we know and love are at their WORST in this book. I won’t go off on Snape yet, but I’ll explain for the others. Harry is a massive brat throughout. Hermione, my absolute fave, is a bad friend, pretentious and untrusting the whole time. Hagrid has his head particularly shoved up his ass. Dumbledore acts like an idiot, a self-admitted idiot. And Sirius ruins himself for me in this book. When he says, “You’re less like your father than I thought [...] The risk would’ve been what made it fun for James,” he is shaming a fifteen year old, guilting him into acting against his own interest and safety by bringing up his DEAD FATHER. Disgusting.DON’T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THE JAMES FLASHBACK. Lupin and Sirius’s speech to Harry on it? Seriously. Lacking. James and Lily should never have ended up together, never. I get why Sirius and James were so close. THEY BOTH SUCK. But there were bright sides. Neville and Ginny are absolutely fantastic in this book, and did their best to rescue it from itself. But Luna is eh for me. I just don’t care about her. AND WE LOSE FRED AND GEORGE. I didn’t realize how much I loved their hijinks until they ruckus’d their way out of Hogwarts.But if the first 600 pages were one, one and a half stars, the last 200 were four and a half or five. I love the setting of the Department of Mysteries, I loved that big Death Eaters battle scene. I sort of liked Dumbledore’s speech, but still was kind of like...okay buddy, you should know what the Right Thing is. Most importantly, I felt like Harry’s mourning at the end was really well captured. Which is, you know, not an impression I get often from these books. (The Harry Potter series isn’t renowned for, like, its capturing of the human experience.) And that last moment at the train station? Where all of Harry’s loved ones are defending him? Killed.

36,2469684889,07/31/2018,5.0,"I don't think I (once again) need to mention how much I love J.K. Rowling's writing style. She is able to create this magical world filled with lovable, interesting and layered characters with simple, but very effective words. Her storytelling is the perfect blend of humor, sadness, suspense and pretty much everything else that makes a good book, and it's going to be something I will highly miss once I finish this wonderful series.One might think that the fifth book in a series doesn't bring much new stuff to the overall plot and might even just be written to prolong the finale, but this is not the case here. The story that gets told helps to establish and develop so many things - no book of the series has been a filler so far!

I didn't even feel like I read so many pages, because it was so entertaining.Like in my review of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, I need to praise the portrayal of friendship! These characters are just normal teenagers with normal conflicts and fights, and I'm so happy that (besides all the fantastical elements) these ordinary things find a place in the story as well. This makes this adventure so much more special, because you truly see these characters grow up and learn!",130,0.9932,0.096,0.661,0.243,0.6588613172541745,POSITIVE,1.0

“Things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end, if not always in the way we expect.”
It's been a long and hot summer and Harry is anxious to know what Voldemort has been up to now that he is in full power. Back at Hogwarts Harry is not a favourite person as everyone believes him to be a liar. But as least he has the support of his good friends, Ron and Hermione. The Ministry of Magic has taken it upon themselves to make sure Harry and Dumbledore don't spread more ‘lies’ about the return of Voldemort. And so the students of Hogwarts are forced to be taught by Professor Umbridge. A ministry official who refuses to teach them how to properly defend themselves and has authority to interfere in the way things are run at Hogwarts. Harry and a few fellow students decide to take their education into their own hands. The first time I read this book I didn't think much of it. But then (during a summer holiday where it was the only book I had with me) I read it multiple times after that and quickly started to see its brilliance. I think this book is underrated. I know many people hate this one because of Harry's outbursts and moods. I however thought Order of the Phoenix was one of the best because of those reasons. It would have been unrealistic if Harry was normal after his experience in the graveyard and after Cedric's death. And also people tend to complain that YA characters are unrealistic but then are irritated when they're moody. Make up your minds! My favourite scenes were the ones spent in the Room of Requirement. I just loved everything about the DA. I think Harry would be an amazing Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.Umbridge will always be that one character I hate above everyone else. She is the most despicable person and I hate her even more than Voldemort.  “Is it true that you shouted at Professor Umbridge?""""Yes.""""You called her a liar?""""Yes.""""You told her He Who Must Not Be Named is back?""""Yes.""""Have a biscuit, Potter.” Just the thought of the end of this book fills me with sadness. Poor Harry just can't catch a break. Throughout this whole book he has to deal with people treating him like crap and being told he is a liar and an attention seeker. And then on top of that (view spoiler)[he loses his only parent figure. (hide spoiler)]This book was probably one of the first times I'd read about mental illness, as I was 12/13 when I read it. Don't know how Harry deals with everything, I'd probably be crying in a corner. • Buddy read with You-Know-Who •",127,-0.9784,0.121,0.805,0.074,0.5272946859903381,NEGATIVE,0.703

43,1428312,05/24/2007,3.0,"This is my favorite installment of the quintessential modern bildungsroman. Nevertheless, it has its problems, familiar to any reader of Rowling's.She never seems to gain control of her writing, which spirals out into thousand-page doorstops filled with unimportant side characters and rambling plots. The story is moved along by arbitrary plot devices, often magic. Instead of using the magic to make her world seem more strange and wondrous, she uses it to cover up plot holes. Why write a consistent plot when you can just put in a spell or two to fix the problems?Likewise her world is poorly defined. She did not start by constructing the 'wizarding world' and then base her stories off of it, rather she changes her setting to fit whatever she needs at the moment. This constantly shifting setting means the world doesn't make much sense if you take the time to sit and think about it.Her fractured plots are not the result of 'realism', which some authors use to create a sense of a 'real world', separate from archetypes. Rowling is just trying to fit in all the disparate ideas and characters she has in her notepad. She becomes so attached to her characters and ideas that she is unwilling to sacrifice them for a more streamlined book.She has problems connecting the many dots of her story, but uses her magical 'plot devices' to keep us from noticing that the scaffolding behind the facade is rather bare (indeed: crumbly). Her rabid plot movement points away from the cracks in her storytelling: ""move along, nothing to see here"".I find it somewhat ironic that Rowling wants to 'graduate' from Potter to writing adult mysteries. A mystery needs to have a tight plot, based not in the characters but in the events surrounding them. Though many people tried to 'figure out' the Potter books and predict them, in truth there is nothing to figure out. Rowling's foreshadowing is vague and unsupported, and there are just as many clues as red herrings. The only reason some of the elements seem predictable is because there was a crack team of several million people making every guess under the sun. Combine that with the fact that the final book introduces completely new elements to finish the plot, and we can see that Rowling is not really in charge of her own pen. She is a slave to her own sentimentality. Then again, so are millions around the world.The only thing which makes these meandering plots move along at a reasonable pace are her characters. They connect us to the magical world, so that even if it doesn't make sense, at least we can see how it might work for the people who live in it.Her characters are vivid, emotional, motivated, and archetypal without being banal. They may not be psychologically deep, but for a monomyth like this, that is hardly the point. Most people aren't that complex, either.In the series, this book gets the prize for the most psychological depth and also the most consistent mood. Before this, Rowling was still trying to get her footing, figuring out what exactly she was writing, and trying to explain the world to her readers. She finally hit her stride in 'Prisoner of Azkaban', and got much of her unsure world-building out of the way in 'Goblet of Fire'. This is before she started feeling the pressure to wrap things up in a neat package, which again begins to take its toll on her consistency. This is the first, and really the last of her books where Rowling is able to write without being overly concerned with either the beginning or ending of her series.Instead of placing a scattered plot over her characters, Rowling was instead able to let the characters travel through their own path of growth and self-exploration. The change is the most apparent in Harry himself, and though his transformation is somewhat sudden, it is still honest and believable for the character.By focusing chiefly on her strength--character building--and escaping the constraints of the monomyth, if only for a moment, Rowling is able to avoid her weakest points as a writer and turn out her strongest book.My Fantasy Book Suggestions",119,0.9274,0.044,0.894,0.062,0.5449332357783061,NEGATIVE,0.9991
44,353311537,06/22/2012,5.0," Edit #3: 27/3/2015  I am still getting positive feedback over this and every time I read what you guys and girls have told me, my heart swells. Gosh, I am so proud of this review.  Edit #2: 25\7\2014So I came across this article today, and for some reason, it made me happy!! I feel evil *evil laugh* http://mea-news.net/en/index.php/2014...  Edit #1: 8\3\2014It has been four months that I posted this review. And so far I have received great feedback. Thank you everyone for yo#ur support ^^ Remember, this is not a benign cause. 6/11/2013I know that I have neglected the subject of the new Goodreads policy a lot recently, and I ought not to have done that. You see, I wasn’t very free recently, and well because I didn’t know what to either say or on what book should I post it. And then I read this book, and the rebelliousness in this book made me think that hey, this book is perfect for what I have in mind. Oh, and guess what! I am going to be aggressive. Let me tell you something maybe a lot of you people are not aware of. We, people who live in the Middle East, look up towards the west, where presumably, everyone is free to say and do whatever they want, bounded by no tradition or religious law whatsoever. But when this kind of law is forced upon everyone from the west itself, we lose hope. We lose hope that anything will be good again. And well for someone (me), who has suffered a lot because of that (Facebook only made my freedom of speech more restricted), I found a haven for myself in Goodreads, where apparently no one gives a damn whether you insult or disagree with them because well, they don’t care. And because they are mature enough to ignore any insults under the pretext that it is “your opinion”.Do you know how much I love that? I have suffered A LOT because of that. Let me tell you something about myself. I never EVER stay quiet about something that I believe to be true – even if I was wrong to many other people – and now Mister Money-Head-Of-Amazon has to ruin that for me. All right, I realized that everything that was said about the new policy was said in the utmost civilized way. But guess what! I am a teenager. I don’t give a damn about manners, and I am about to say what everyone has wanted to say for a long time. Goodreads by succumbing to the green papers have restricted my freedom of speech. In the last few years, I have been bullied, put down, humiliated, insulted, punished… just because I wanted to say what I had in mind, just because I always stand up to what I believe in. And since because ALL OF THAT HAPPENED TO ME, I turned towards Goodreads where I was surprised that no one cared about whatever I said, and always respected me when I wanted to express myself. No review of mine has been removed, but a lot of people’s reviews have been removed. Since it didn’t affect me yet, I should shut up, right? No! Just the fact that it exists is bothering me. It is like having this law around forbidding people to eat chicken, and I hate chicken, but that doesn’t mean I should keep quiet. Okay, that was a bad example, but the closest I had to the ridiculousness of what we are fighting for. No one should fight for his right to express himself freely. It is a right. We are born with that right. And no number of reviews removed is going to change that. It is not going to frighten us. It is not going to make us back out. You can remove all the reviews you want, Goodreads, but this is something I believe in. So I am fighting, even if you have to ban me. Well, according to your own policy, you can't do that. Well, you can't even remove the reviews that have been put  before  the declaration of that censorship but you do it anyway. So you are bunch of hypocrites. You, Goodreads managers, anyone with the IQ of a peacock can realize that what you have done is so wrong on so many levels. If I were the Goodreads manager, I would say this to the Amazon Manager when he came offering the new law “You can take your money and your pathetic ass out of my office! You cannot threaten us with money or hold it over our heads! This company has so far made you millions of money just by existing and promoting your books! More than half of our members buy regularly from your website! In fact, according to this logic, you owe us!” GR Manager slaps Amazon Manager. Jackie Shan bursts into the scene wearing nothing but a newspaper around his waist. Kung fu! Jackie kicks Amazon Manager’s head off, and his body goes around looking for its head. Meanwhile, GR Manager holds both the head and the body and throws them from the window of the headquarters. BOOM! The end. This policy is so wrong. If people like us cannot express themselves online, then where will they? I might not insult your precious little authors, Amazon Manager (in my opinion they shouldn’t be called authors if they can’t take god damn criticism. Not everyone should approve with them), but I have every god damn right to express myself freely without having to worry whether my review would be removed or not. The management even has no right to go around reading whatever we say online because well, I thought they had better things to do. It turns out I was wrong, don’t you think? Anyway, what we say online is OUR concern, not yours. You shouldn’t threaten us. You shouldn’t condemn us. Maybe to you, you are only deleting a review, but to us you are restricting our freedom. And no one really appreciates freedom but the ones who have been deprived from it. I wonder how the Goodreads Management even agreed to this. I had a lot more to say about this on my mind, but I think I have made my point quite clearly. Us, readers, and the ones who write a bit like I do, find words our strongest weapon. Back to my review about this book. THIS WAS THE WORST BOOK I HAVE READ! I have cried 50 pages straight. (view spoiler)[ why did she have to kill Sirius?WHAT DID HE EVER DO TO HER? I AM STILL CRYING YOU KNOW!  (hide spoiler)]The 5 stars I have given it, it was not a “WOW I LOVED THIS BOOK AUTOMATIC FIVE STARS!” No. It was this kind of books “it deserves 5 stars, with a little dash of wow at the end”. This is the kind of perfect books that makes you feel as though all happiness, innocence and hope had been sucked out of the world, and until everything in the book is fixed, nothing in the world will ever be right again. I have really a lot of controversial feelings about this book, but it all goes down to one point. It is good. It is worthy of five stars.

Well first of all, there's leaps and bounds in terms of plot development. Things are starting to get dark, they're starting to get serious and it sets the tone for the next two books to come.

Neville, Luna, GINNY, Fred and George, Dean, Seamus, Tonks, Sirius, Remus, Cho and soo many other characters who I just adore SHINE and it makes me so happy. I love the side characters as much as the trio and they get so much more screen time (page time?) then in earlier booksSO MANY COOL SCENES: I mean, the Weasley escape, the interview in three broomsticks, every DA meeting, Harry's first date, THE QUIDDITCH PITCH BRAWL, Umbridge being taken by Centaurs, the fight in the ministry, Dumbledore and Voldermorts epic duel ! There are so many scenes to love in this one. Literally iconic scenes like DA and the Weasley's leaving school can be exclusively found in ootp and I love them so much.

I laugh out loud when I'm reading this book, and I don't usually properly laugh when I'm reading. I literally just don't understand how anyone can not like ootp.

Book Review

4 out of 5 stars for Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, the 5th book in the original 7 book ""Harry Potter"" young adult fantasy series published in 2003 by J.K. Rowling. I cannot believe this is over 15 years old, as I think about what I want to put in my review. Given it's HP, and everyone does review on it, I'm keeping it short. A few things I loved about this book:1. Dolores Umbridge is awesome. Awesome as a villain, that is. She brings out the worst in so many people, and other then the Death Eaters and Lord Voldemort, Harry needs a foil on a day-to-day basis.2. More dementors! Those have always been one of my favorite parts. And to see Harry protect his cousin Dudley... well that's just cool!3. The whole Pollyjuice potion usage at the trial is awesome.4. Snape's history is slowly unveiled.5. It sets them on the battle against the Dark One to end all battles in the next couple of books!

I can tell you that on a re-read, this story really stands out as both a very dark turn and a wonderfully complex story. Why is my memory so poor, you ask? Because while I remember it being this good when I first read it, I've only had the altered perceptions of the movie to go by ever since! And that is a MISTAKE.I should have known. Short movies like that can't do real justice to heavy, heavy tomes like this novel. :)Notably missing: the TWINS! Sure, they get their big time to shine in the movie, but they don't get the backstory of where they got their money or the sheer amount of legwork and field-testing for their jokes right on Hogwarts' grounds. So delicious! Also missing: an actually delightful Dobby. I can't believe how much knitting Hermione went through on her quest to free all the house elves and only Dobby was willing to take her clothing, all to save her feelings. How Sweet!Also missing: long explanations and carefully constructed dream-plots and traps that make complete sense unlike that mess we saw in the movie that just kinda slaps us in a direction and lets us be surprised...

Yours was actually a pretty good plan even if you're missing a certain piece of intelligence.""All told, I can honestly say that I liked this one better than all the rest up to this point.

52,1471598063,07/04/2016,5.0,"A lot of people consider The Order of the Phoenix to be the weakest book in the entire Harry Potter series. I haven't read the last two installments yet, but from what I have read so far ... this one was my favorite. I enjoyed two other books in the series more than this one (The Sorcerer's Stone and The Goblet of Fire), but enjoyment is not necessarily the only aspect allowing a book to turn into a favorite.Let's go on the dark side here. While the previous books were still light-hearted in the overall atmosphere in spite of certain parts of the storylines, this one consisted to approximately 95% of darkness and a lack of happiness for all the characters involved. Studying at Hogwarts is not enjoyable anymore, life has become dangerous for everyone everywhere, favorite teachers have been replaced by unlikeable ones, dangers and traps are looming wherever you set your feet. Life is not easy for Harry Potter and his friends in this book, because not only do the dangers floating above their heads cloud their moods - they also slowly enter puberty with all the feelings and emotions involved with the process of growing-up. Not only because of the darkness of the various themes, but also due to the character development is it impossible to call this book a children's book anymore. Justice is what a lot of readers - including myself - probably missed in this book. Harry has won the Triwizard Tournament, but nobody truly acknowledges his victory. He still has to spend the summer with his merciless family, he still has to fight for his reputation and his dignity. After everything Harry achieved, life reveals itself to him in its cruelest colors, the Dark Lord's return only being one of the many aspects influencing his decline of happiness. This book also introduces one of the most despised characters in the Harry Potter universe, Dolores Jane Umbridge. Who could possibly like such a woman? Apart from imagining Imelda Staunton's inspiring portrayal from the movies which helped a lot with exploring Dolores' role in the book, her unforgiving decisions and her unforgettable appearances, it can be discussed whether Dolores Umbridge is truly a realistic character, but she supported J.K. Rowling's general direction into the dark themes of the series, and if there is one thing Dolores Umbridge's presence was good for, then it is this: It made Harry and his friends, but also the book's readers realize that life is never the way you imagine it to be. Life is cruel, life is hard, life is merciless.I love this book because it doesn't beautify things. Death is presented as a necessary part of everyone's life. All the characters are created as human beings who are full of faults and mistakes. The perfect images everyone had in their minds of characters like Albus Dumbledore, James Potter or even Sirius Black are shattered in the course of the book, only to allow the readers to form new opinions on those characters again. Those books are set in the fantasy genre, but it all felt so realistic that it was impossible not to share the thrill and the excitement of those pages - mainly because the characters felt so realistic. They are flawed. They are full of emotions. They come to decisions, and they regret decisions. But in their essence, they are human. Which is perhaps why so many readers love this series - because it feels like you accompany people into a completely different world who might as well be your friends who are sitting at your school desk next to you.[Major spoiler for this novel: (view spoiler)[I am not even angry with J.K. Rowling for killing off Sirius Black. Obviously, he was a character beloved by a lot of readers, and I would have loved to see Sirius being redeemed officially as not having committed the crimes he was accused of. But that's the very reason for why this is my favorite novel in the series so far: Just like in real life, it's not a given that the good people survive and the bad people die. You can't even always say who is good and who is evil, because there is a thin line because good and bad. (hide spoiler)]]A lot of fantasy authors tend to kill off the antagonists and create a happy ending with the good-hearted major characters, which is my main reason for my troubles with the fantasy genre. J.K. Rowling doesn't mind all this; with her novels, you never know who is going to survive and who is going to die, because it could be everyone. As long as you haven't been spoiled already, that is.Yes, maybe this book is too long indeed. I needed more days to finish it than I needed for all the other four books combined (considering only the respective reading time I spent with them). Yes, maybe it could be shortened, although I am the last one who knows how that could possibly be done. Yes, it is darker than all the other books in the series so far. And yes, I loved it for all those reasons.

-----------Pre-Review (4th July):It has been three months since I finished Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, and only now do I finally begin reading this fifth book in the series. (Which I am reading for the first time. Can this confession become even more embarassing?)Maybe it can be accepted as an explanation that I left the fourth book feeling like this and obviously needing to recuperate:So, let's continue my journey through the world of Hogwarts!Review to come once I'm finished. Which might take a while, because while it's evidently Harry Potter and shouldn't take much time to get through, my copy of this book has 1040 pages. That's loooong. And, of course, a pretty good thing, considering that it's Harry Potter we talk about.My reviews in the Harry Potter series:1) Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone: Go to review2) Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets: Go to review3) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban: Go to review4) Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire: Go to review",93,0.9965,0.113,0.726,0.161,0.5945846606223965,NEGATIVE,0.9993

NON-BINARY PEOPLE ARE NON-BINARY.Harry Potter changed my life and the memories I have associated with it can never be changed or tarnished no matter what its creator says or does. Her comments have caused me so much pain and disappointment and even if one day she realises how ignorant and hateful she has been it is now too late to amend the harm she has caused. Nevertheless, like Daniel Radcliffe said the relationship between a reader and a book is sacred and nothing can change that. Harry Potter is no longer hers and I will continue loving and cherishing this world and these characters forever (and yes, I will be re-reading the series and watching the movies time and time again during my lifetime). However, I can no longer support her or her future work. Rowling is TRANSPHOBIC and supporting her in any way, shape or form supports her views and harms trans people and the LGBTQ+ community profoundly. I cannot take back the money I have given her already, but I can choose to never again spend money that will go directly in her pockets. I want to use this space to encourage everyone to support trans authors and read more literature featuring trans characters. This page is a good place to start.Please consider donating to a trans charity of your choice (MermaidsUK could be a place to start, because they have been directly attacked by Rowling) and click here to find about more trans organisations in the UK and what you can do to help.

Let’s all actively work together to make this fandom inclusive to everyone and show trans people especially that we are a loving community who would never question their identity or experience.PS.

His expression was calm, almost detached. “You care so much you feel as though you will bleed to death with the pain of it.”Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix follows a world where Lord Voldemort has officially returned. Harry is starting his fifth year in a world where his influence is everywhere in the Wizarding World and his followers are quickly returning to his side. In response, the Order of the Phoenix, a group created during the first war to stop him, has gathered together again, now with some new members. Problems are showing up at Hogwarts, too, where government officials are meddling in everything. Harry also has a powerful connection to Voldemort, which seems to be growing even stronger, and he soon realizes that he has direct access to the Dark Lord’s mind. It’s time for Harry and his friends to take action, but the course they choose will have terrible consequences.Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is my second favorite book in this series, despite a character death that has hurt my soul my entire life. J.K. Rowling takes no liberties in this book, and was absolutely determined to make this story even darker and more complex as it goes on. There’s so, so much plot and character development, and the series has officially taken a dark, awful turn. Since this is my 24th reread of the series, I’m no longer surprised when I read it, but I’m still amazed by how incredible and captivating this book is. And how absolutely frustrating it is for Harry, honestly.“The mind is not a book, to be opened at will and examined at leisure. Thoughts are not etched on the inside of skulls, to be perused by an invader. The mind is a complex and many-layered thing.”As much as I think the characters have had some wonderful character development, I still dislike Ginny, and this book is kind of a big reason why. I’m not going to go fully into it (because I’ve had rants longer than this book on it), but I absolutely, 100% do not agree with people who say she handled Harry’s moods and depression really well in this book. She definitely didn’t, and honestly, neither did Hermione most of the time. That being said, anyone who says Harry is a whiny child in this book can fucking fight me—Ginny and Hermione included. He deserves so much better, but we know that. Also, Luna. That's all.Overall, I loved Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix so, so much, obviously. I loved the humor and the characters and the world that’s developing so nicely. I love these rereads and getting back into the world J.K. Rowling created. I know it’s been fifteen years, but that’s not going to stop me from being absolutely devastated by the major character death in this book, and thinking he also deserves so much better. I can’t wait to get to my reread of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.“Harry witnessed Professor McGonagall walking right past Peeves who was determinedly loosening a crystal chandelier and could have sworn he heard her tell the poltergeist out of the corner of her mouth, “It unscrews the other way.“”↠ Reread #25: February 2-3, 2019.↠ Reread #26: May 27-28, 2019.↠ Reread #27: July 14-15, 2019.↠ Reread #28: January 7-8, 2020.↠ Reread #29: March 24-25, 2020.↠ Reread #30: January 4-5, 2021.↠ Reread #31: August 27-28, 2021.↠ Reread #32: December 28-29, 2021.",91,0.8471,0.107,0.775,0.119,0.567455808080808,POSITIVE,0.9917

“Wit beyond measure is a man's greatest treasure.” 
Reread - Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix always gives me a challenge whenever I start reading. It's 870 pages for US edition and 1000+ pages for Thai edition. The book starts off with a summer when Harry banters with Dudley, and there comes the Dementors. So Harry has to use his magic to expel those nasty things. He never knows before his act will bring him to M.o.M. In the beginning, J.K. Rowling used the first few chapters to introduce us about the Order of the Phoenix. That got me chilled the first time I was reading about this order. I loved to see the good guys being together and figthing the Dark Lord. I was so excited about this book anyway.I have a feeling that Harry in this book is not like Harry, the one I know, he throws a tantrum when his friends don't believe about what happened last year. I understand about his age making him not stable, if I can call it. The only person I want to talk about is Professor Umbrige, I call her the pink toad, she's the character that unify everything around this book impeccably. Seeing everyone fighting with her and restraining her not to destroy the Hogwart's system make this book unique unlike the first four books. I couldn't stop laughing then.
“Is it true that you shouted at Professor Umbridge?""""Yes.""""You called her a liar?""""Yes.""""You told her He Who Must Not Be Named is back?""""Yes.""""Have a biscuit, Potter.” 
I laughed out loud because of this scene. This book contains many emotions I can't describe all of it in one review. Do you believe me ? It is far better than the movie and the last M.o.M. scene is beyond exciting. The movie cut it out and I was so angry for that !
“You know, Minister, I disagree with Dumbledore on many counts...but you cannot deny he's got style...” 
The sad thing in this book is about Sirius. If you've read it, you'll know why. Every time I get my head around it, I want to cry and cry. It's so touching and heartwrenching to see that thing happens. Nonetheless, reading this book is like growing up. There's not only happiness in your life, you have to face so many regrets and learn how to move on like Harry and his friends.

I didn’t know whether it was the plot, the characters OR the fact this book super long. Despite this being my least favorite I still, of course, loved it but now that I’ve reread it I’ve noticed many different things I’ve missed when I read it for the first time. This book is still amazing and I obviously will give it five stars. Let me start off by saying this book as many can tell, is humongous and requires a lot of commitment. I know that many including myself are intimidated by this book. Can I also just say the writing also very small. Don’t get me wrong I have nothing against long books. In fact, I prefer long books over books with only 100 pages but this book was just unnecessarily too long. I’ve realized that there is a huge amount of pointless information. I know sometimes authors can’t help it but I feel like I’m reading for so long but am not getting anywhere. Now you’re probably asking why I gave it 5 stars if I think some of it was unnecessary. I am a big fan of Harry Potter and I know what I’m saying isn’t true but if I gave HP less than 5 stars it would make me (and I’m not saying this about anyone else) feel like I'm not a true fan. I know that’s not true but it’s what I think of myself. I don’t know about anyone else but in bookstores, HP has always been in the children’s section. And I know I know HP is a supposed to be children series but honestly, I do not consider this a children’s series because well 1. I think anyone of any age can read it and 2. I cannot imagine 7 years or whatever reading an 800-page book. I don’t maybe there are children that age that do but personally I can’t imagine it. This book made me realize something I never realized before which is…Harry Potter is the most stuck up person ever and thinks he’s amazing. Honestly, this book made realize why Draco is so mean to him. I’m warning you right now I am going to rant so I’m sorry. 
***** WARNING WARNING WARNING**********SPOILERS AHEAD SPOILERS AHEAD**********FOR THE FIRST FIVE BOOKS**********SKIP IF YOU WANT*****
What I hate so much is how Harry gets all the credit! He’s not that amazing and without his friends, he would have done nothing. Do you think in the first book he could have going to through that place where they had to play chess and figure out the potion without his friends? Ron figured the chess game and Hermione found out which potion. The only reason he could defeat Voldemort was because he couldn’t be touched. Also in the second book do you think he would have any idea what was down in the chamber of secrets and what was freezing all the student without Hermione. I guess in the third book he did do a Patronus, I’ll give him that. In the fourth book, he only won because someone was helping him but I’ll give him credit for escaping Voldemort but that was because of his wand and that Voldemort told him to fight him. I get he is powerful but most of it was done with help. Without Ron and Hermione, he couldn’t have done even half the things he did. I can’t even imagine what would have happened. He needs to stop thinking he’s amazing and that he is the only person to have gone through tough times because he isn’t. I actually understand Draco’s POV in the situation now. It pisses me off because Harry is actually so DUMB (I'll get into more detail about that in the 6th book) but manages to become famous and everyone thinks he so powerful. I'd like to see what he'd achieve without his friends.Wow…I needed to get that out

60,381017067,07/31/2012,4.0,"Harry Potter's fifth year at Hogwarts. The One Who Shall Not Be Named gathers power, but Harry Potter is completely sheltered from outside world and as the result has no clue about what Lord Voldemort is up to. This leads to frustration which in turn leads to angst. Speaking of the latter, the book is full of it. So as I was saying, Harry is full of angst through the whole book. This makes for slow moving plot sometimes. It does not help any that the book is probably the biggest in the series. To Harry's defense he has a pretty good reason for being such. A couple of reasons actually. Firstly, he is a 15-year-old boy in here. Remember 15-year-old yourself? You were full of angst, too. Secondly, Dumbledore failed Harry, hard. In fact he keep failing him over and over again until the last couple of chapters. The biggest lesson of it all: the adults can be wrong (as an adult it pains me to say it); even the ones you hold in the greatest respect like it is a case with Harry and Dumbledore.I do not think my review would be complete without mentioning the following character:This is how I envision her; the movie version was pretty good too. I am talking about Dolores Umbridge of cause. Compared to Lord Voldemort she is fairly low-level as far as villains go, but she was created in such a way that everybody and their brother love to hate her. So this is the first book of the series which gets less than perfect rating. The main reason is I feel that it could be made shorter - but I'll be damned if I know how. It is still great and everything, but 600+ pages are a little bit too much for a Harry Potter tale, especially the angst-y one. ",86,0.844,0.117,0.747,0.136,0.5173611111111112,NEGATIVE,0.9999

She wanted us to reach the dramatic conclusion earlier in the day, so the intensity of the ending wouldn't negatively impact her dreams. We've been reading book #5 at night, one chapter at a time, and the mature shift that has taken place in the last few chapters, into violence and loss, has been peppering her sleep lately with images of Bellatrix Lestrange and flashing green lights (hexes!).So, we finished the book today (it was the first time for her, a reread for me), and even though I still consider this book to be overweight by about 100 pages, I enjoyed it even more the second time. I cried a lot more this round, too.Without revealing spoilers, I will describe, simply, that the ending of Phoenix is intense and includes a violent climax between Lord Voldemort and Professor Dumbledore. On page 814, amid raised wands and loud explosions, Voldemort snarls, “There is nothing worse than death, Dumbledore!Dumbledore responds to this quietly (despite all of the commotion) by telling Voldemort, “You are quite wrong. . . Indeed, your failure to understand that there are things much worse than death has always been your greatest weakness--”I took a pause from reading here and closed the book and asked my daughter, “What do you think he means? What do you think is worse than death?”Without hesitation, my middle child answered, “Sadness. Like the kind of sadness that never stops.”I was taken aback by her answer. As a migraine sufferer, I would have answered “physical pain that won't stop.”But, pain is pain, right? And, if you suffer it long enough, regardless of its source, you may get to the point where you perceive death as a sweet release rather than a “worse case scenario.”When Dumbledore turns this thinking around to Harry and tells him “the fact that you can feel pain like this is your greatest strength,” Harry rejects this philosophy and shouts, “I DON'T CARE! I'VE HAD ENOUGH, I'VE SEEN ENOUGH, I WANT OUT, I WANT IT TO END, I DON'T CARE ANYMORE--”Wow. How brilliant was J.K. Rowling, in using the span of this big, bold, epic, magical story. . . to explain the loss of innocence, the frequent crippling sense of isolation, and the it-feels-impossible-to-go-on quality of adolescence?My hat's not just off, Ms. Rowling.

(Please ignore the date in this case because it has nothing to do with the book being good or bad. I experience the worst reading slump ever.) This book is a great read! I love learning about Sirius and his family tree. Further along, the story gets a bit boring and long winded. The first time I read this story I loved it but now I feel Harry whines too much and then he constantly landed himself in trouble despite his teammates asking him that they are relying on him or Hermione’s repeated sayings of his friends’ support. I decided to watch the movie again at page 330 and I must say, this movie has no Quidditch game at all. That’s disappointing. I pushed through even though those bans from Umbridge really ruin many excitements for me, like having Harry play the Quidditch. I don’t even get to enjoy how Ginny caught the snitch right under Cho’s nose. I do laugh out loud with Ron’s OWL test in divination though, hilarious!This book is told in the third person point of view following Harry Potter as he spends the summer at his aunt Petunia’s house. He’s feeling bored and frustrated that this past 2 months he hasn’t heard from his friends about what’s going on in the wizarding world, especially news of You-Know-Who after his encounter before the year ended. Then one day while out walking with his cousin Dudley, two dementors came to attack Harry. More people show up on Privet Drive to escort Harry to a secret society in London. Harry is being threatened with losing his wand and expulsion from Hogwarts for breaking the rules of using magic outside of school. Furthermore, Harry just now finds out that over the summer in the Wizarding World, he’s being ridiculed for lying that You Know Who is back. Life at school is no longer the place Harry loves to get away from his uncle and aunt’s house when Professor Dumbledore ignores him and the new Professor puts up new bans almost every other day.Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is very well written. I do like how the villain Professor Umbridge is written in this story. She appeared so sweet on the outside with her pink outfits and doilies but wicked evil on the inside with her mean ways punishments. I love Prof McGonagall’s stern attitude with Prof Umbridge. She’s really good with ignoring Umbridge’s throat clearing. I love the humor with past headmasters’ comments. I always love Prof Dumbledore’s uniqueness. The magical world is neat as always, with people moving in photos and picture frames to the magical powers of reading minds. Though it’s lengthy and ongoing at times, it at least offers a bit more of Quidditch than the movie, so I do recommend everyone to read this book!Pro: friendships, mystery, suspense, humor, magical world, fast paced, page turner, easy to read, illustrations, challenges and overcoming obstacles, cleverness, teamwork, anger managementCon: Harry is more whiny than usualI rate it 4.5 stars!***Disclaimer: Reading books I bought for a change..xoxo, Jasmine at www.howusefulitis.wordpress.com",85,0.9323,0.141,0.697,0.162,0.5065609098503836,NEGATIVE,0.9996

Also reading Harry Potter is often a snooze and so at nearly halfway through - where I put the book down for months with no intention to continue - I realised it was either audiobook or nothing. So for the rest of the story I had to listen to hours and hours of a plot with no actual development to end with about 50 pages of the only bit of action in the book?None of the characters were actually doing anything interesting throughout, so many unnecessary scenes! Why was there a Quidditch scene in there, it had nothing to do with the story! Do we really need to know what’s on every floor in St Mungo’s? There were so many useless scenes with Cho Chang that weren’t needed because it was clear the two were going nowhere. And to at least help redeem that, why didn’t Rowling at least make her likeable?? Her stupid unrealistic childish jealously nearly made me want to rip my hair out.I HATE HARRY. SO MUCH.Firstly, he couldn’t be any more cliché: dead parents, clever and dumb sidekicks, an evil master trying to kill him because he’s ‘the chosen one’ etc. (and before you fight me no, hp is not the starting point of novels with these clichés, Rowling took this idea from other books so shut up) and secondly, I read the previous books in this series, actually liking some, and I really can’t remember Harry being this much of a whiny and ridiculous character. He complained about EVERYTHING and he’s one of the dumbest characters I’ve ever read about, always making the wrong choices and he gets angry at every single person who tries to talk to him with a single bit of logic??? He’s 16, not 5! I couldn’t bring myself to like him one bit.The whole Umbridge thing is sooo over the top! Hogwarts would never allow someone like her in charge because of how extreme she is and the terrible portrayal of a ‘bad guy’ by Rowling. She is carving into Harry’s skin as punishment and Dumbledore somehow knows nothing about it? And if he does, he lets it happen in his school? Nah, I don’t buy it.The writing style is incredibly repetitive and boring (did I mention this yet?) with every character speaking in exactly the same way (only Hagrid stands out) and with Rowling feeling the need to add ‘said’ after nearly every line spoken. Some variation in words or sentence structure please???I’m still going to carry on with the series because although this one was a massive disappointment and the writing difficult to bear, I enjoyed POA and GOF enough to want to find out the differences between the film ending and the book ending at the very end. Those books are also fairly big and I’m hoping they’re not as painful to read as this one.THIS IS THE MOST OVERHYPED SERIES OF ALL TIME.

66,577785894,04/01/2013,5.0,"Instead of a review, I’m just going to share my memories of this book. Back when this came out was the high time of midnight bookstore release parties. Yes, I did go to one and no, I didn’t dress up.It was held at a Barnes and Noble and of course John Williams’s soundtrack for the first 2 movies was played on a loop throughout the night. Amidst the crowd eagerly awaiting the stroke of 12, were tired adult chaperones and sullen workers who had had enough already. My brother brought me to the store and one of his friends was working there; of course being the only ginger on staff he had to dress up like Ron and did not appreciate it. I think he actually hated Harry Potter so that kind of made it worse.Let me preface this next paragraph with the following: I grew up in Las Vegas, so some weird stuff went down that probably wouldn’t have happened anywhere else that night. Not only did the Mayor show up, but “Master Magician” Lance Burton did too. They are local celebs, though why they put in an appearance is beyond me. More on this in a minute.So at about 11:30 everyone starts lining up to get our books. The store decided to release them before midnight and that made it all the more like catnip. I remember seeing some four year olds plopped down in an aisle with their copies, pretending to read them…and I thought, who would stop me if I just took it from the kid and ran out? I didn’t though, obviously, but Potter fever makes you think strange thoughts, especially while waiting in line for a highly anticipated book.Both the Mayor and the “Master Magician” were signing copies of the book. I don’t understand this at all, and still think that somewhere on ebay somebody must have bid on an “autographed copy” and gotten one signed by one of these men. While that’s technically true, can you just imagine the disappointment??When I did finally have it in my hands… oh, that beautiful gloriously blue cover. You knew from Mary GrandPré’s artwork that something major was going to go down, and it did. I started reading it with a booklight on the drive home but was told that the light was distracting my brother’s driving. Buzzkill. Didn’t he know how important this was?!?!?!?!Arriving home, I went straight to bed and stayed up all night reading. At some point, I think at about 2am, my mom came into my room. She took the book from me, and flipped towards the end, read about Sirius’s death, then gave it back to me without a word. (She had read the first 4 to her third grade class and still chokes up at the mention of “the boy who lived”). She never actually read the fifth book or the rest, but always insisted I tell her everything that happened once I finished them.I finished it later that day. I didn't care too much that Sirius died, but I do remember being slightly miffed that Rowling never cleared up more about that Veil in the Department of Mysteries. That was such a cruel tease, Jo.",82,-0.9291,0.086,0.847,0.067,0.4804761904761904,NEGATIVE,0.9502
67,1166953258,01/13/2015,5.0,"#mystrangereading Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix by J. K. Rowling ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️""Youth can not know how age thinks and feels, but old men are guilty if they forget what it is to be young.""I absolutely love how Dumbledore gets a talk with Harry at the conclusion of each book and summarizes the main conflict and theme of the novel. The fifth installment of this series is so masterful. We finally get a broader picture of the wizarding community and realize that not everyone is so quick to believe that Voldemort is back. We see the aftermath of Cedric's death and Voldemort's rise and watch as Harry grows more and more angry at everyone's denial and disbelief. Things that make this book so incredible: 🧙🏻‍♀️ The Order of the Phoenix. Each member is so unique and special. I love that they all bring something different to the table and are all so bad-ass. 🧙🏻‍♀️Kreacher. He is horrible and hilarious. I love that a house elf gets an important storyline and is so subtlely apart of the overall 'big bad' in the story. 🧙🏻‍♀️ Dolores Umbridge. She is literally the worst. She almost makes you forget how much we hate Voldemort which I think is the brilliance of her character. 🧙🏻‍♀️ Sirius Black. 😭😭😭 He loves Harry so much. 🧙🏻‍♀️Ron and Hermoine. They are really the best representation of friends. They will call Harry on his crap but always back him up when it matters. 🧙🏻‍♀️ Luna and Nevil. I love them. I love how unassuming both of them are and yet how quickly they become apart of the gang and are so important to the resolution of the story. 🧙🏻‍♀️ Dumbledore's army. Hermoine was a rebel!! It makes my heart so happy. The kids sticking it to the Ministry by naming themselves the very thing the Ministry was afraid of. GENIUS. This book was amazing and this re-read was such a powerful reminder of how Rowling never writes anything by accident.

68,1575289621,03/10/2016,4.0,"I have read the Harry Potter septuology in its entirety at least ten times. This book is the turning point and also the most difficult for me to read. For starters, I detest Umbrage that foul woman. In fact I abhor her to the point that on occasion I have skipped from book 4 to 6 just to avoid her. Order of the Phoenix is a whopping 870 pages. J K Rowling's prose has transformed from being geared toward kids to teenagers, mirroring Harry's own development. In books 1-4, the language is easy enough that despite the length even middle grade kids should be able to read it. Book 5 is more tedious. The themes are darker and tougher to digest. Additionally the students are interested in dating, making the content slightly inappropriate for younger readers. Prose aside, we see new characters and many developments in the plot lines. We witness how powerful Dumbledore's abilities are the clear distinctions between Voldemort's death eaters and Dumbledore's army. The end makes it challenging for me to finish the entire book even after all these times because I know what is coming.

Fuck you. — Molly being unable to get rid of the boggart in Grimmauld Place because she is overtaken by emotion of seeing all of her loved ones dead… and then Lupin having to get rid of it after seeing Harry’s dead body on the floor - oh my lawd - and then Sirius having seen Harry’s dead body as well probably remembering the time he found James and Lily dead - WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME? — this year being the first year Harry wouldn’t be able to travel the Hogwarts Express with Ron since he and Hermione had to go to the Prefect’s carriage and then patrol the corridors, I cry — Dean telling the others that his parents are unaware of the deaths happening at Hogwarts because he doesn’t inform them. - ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME? DUMBLEDORE WHAT ARE YOU DOING??? YOU NEED TO INFORM THE FRIGGIN PARENTS? LIKE FOR REAL, ONE OF THESE DAYS I AM GETTING YOU OUT OF YOUR TOMB, OLD MAN, JUST TO SUE YOU! — Harry not seeking help after his first detention with Dolores is just such a Harry-thing to do, my boy has suffered so much abuse, he thinks he will “lose” if he lets other people see his pain (and not wanting to put his friends through the horror of seeing his wounds), ugh, I cry, — Pansy harassing the only Black girl in the series (Angelina Johnson) about her hairstyle (“Why would anyone want to look like they’ve got worms coming out of their head?”) is too fucking much, her ass has been cancelled a long time ago, but… no, just no!— Percy’s “congratulating” letter to Ron (about becoming prefect and not going down the “Fred and George route”) was too fucking much; the audacity that he criticised his fucking parents, boyy, you got a big storm coming — Sirius accusing (and thus manipulating) Harry by saying “You’re less like your father than I thought” was such a fucking low-point for me, it’s the worst thing he’s ever said and Harry deserves so much better; he was reaching out to Sirius as his last hope and he came out of the conversation feeling more shitty than ever because Sirius made him feel worthless, well done, mate… I’m just picturing James in heaven being super mega disappointed with Sirius in this moment… how dare he… I can’t even… Fuck you, Sirius! — Umbridge banning Harry, F & G from playing Quidditch was the fucking worst — when the Weasleys and Harry arrived at Grimmauld Place (after Arthur was attacked) and they all wanted to see their father immediately and Sirius said: “There are things worth dying for.” And Fred fucking replied: “Easy for you to say, stuck here. I don’t see you risking your neck.” It was just a little too fucking much for my heart, ugh — Molly crying because PERCY SENT BACK his CHRISTMAS JUMPER… how fucking dare he — Harry getting into Snape’s memory by using the Pensieve after Snape left his office.. m’boy, how stupid are you tho??? That whole situation when Snape found him there was just too fucking tense, I cannot deal ! — Umbridge revealing she sent the Dementors after Harry in Little Whinging … so fucking crazy, this hoe! — “Five years ago you arrived at Hogwarts, Harry, safe and whole, as I had planned and intended. Well - not quite whole, you had suffered.” - IS DUMBY FUCKING SERIOUS RIGHT NOW? Harry was severely abused (mentally, verbally and physically) for 10 fucking years and Dumby had the audacity to tell him that this was exactly what he had planned? Kill him with fire.REVIEW (2015): What can I say? This is my all time favorite Harry Potter book! (Probably my all time favorite book-book that isn't a classic even though it kinda is, right?)And funnily enough Order has always been my favorite, ever since I discovered as a 11 year old that my (German) copy of it had over 1000 pages (1024 pages to be exact :D) and I felt sooooooo accomplished by reading a book with over 1000 pages and ""getting"" it and loving it.The reason why Order is so precious to me is because in this one I got the best examination of Hogwarts as a school and how deep the bond between students, students and teachers and their sense of belonging to the Wizarding Community is. In my opinion the real villain in this wasn't Lord Voldermort but Dolores Umbridge. I loved that she was a threat INSIDE OF HOGWARTS and therefore made the students feel afraid and uncomfortable within bounds that used to be the most safest and comforting. I loved how the whole school united to take her down (except for some Slytherins... but oh well JKR really needed to keep that stereotype right? smh). I laughed tears when we got to the scene in which Umbridge is punishing Harry constantly because he did the Quibbler interview about how the Dark Lord is returning and Fudge is telling lies. And all the other teachers want to show Harry their support and so Madame Sprout awards Gryffindor 20 points because HARRY PASSED HER A FUCKING WATERING CAN or Flitwick secretly slips him sweets after his lessons and Trelawney ""sees in the future"" that Harry would live ""to ripe old age and become Minister for Magic"". I couldn't man, it was sooooo fucking perfect. It made me furiously happy.I also really loved the way Luna was introduced and what she brought to the story. Because she is kind of an outcast and a nutter but at the same time she is portrayed in such a way that you as a reader really get to see how clever and right she is about things. And her loyalty to Harry gets me every time. That she actually flew with the crew to the Ministry of Magic is just a crazy act of bravery (because she literally only got to know Harry & Co. half a year ago)... this girl, man, I love her so much.A lot of people think that Order is the worst in the series because ""Harry is so moody in this one"". To people who firmly believe that all I can say is: FUCK YOU. Well that is a little harsh but I have so much compassion when it comes to Harry. I feel so much protectiveness and I hate it when people give him shit. Harry fucking Potter was abused since he was a toddler in the most nastiest way by his uncle, aunt and cousin and he fucking remained a good person and didn't turn bitter or all psycho. He is the most humble character that I know and honestly sooo pure and innocent. He is used as a chess piece by Dumbledore but is still willing to sacrifice himself for the greater good and he is just my little baby and if you're coming for him I WILL FIGHT YOU. Of course he is fucking moody in Order. First and foremost HE IS A FRIGGIN TEENAGER and teenagers ARE MOODY (get over it) and he feels fucking left out because Dumbledore is purposefully leaving him in the dark and he is just confused as fuck. He feels estranged from his friends (and all the other students from Hogwarts) because the fucking News are reporting about him and what a lying little shit he is DAILY. How do you deal with that? Then we have the little shit Umbridge who is tormenting him more than any other student and if I were Harry I would be just as fucking moody as him. He has every right to be. The whole Sirius situation is also quite tragic. Sirius isn't my favorite character because he is so manipulative and basically causing a deeper drift between Harry and his friends. But on the other hand I understand Sirius' behaviour to the fullest because for him Harry equals James (his best friend he lost in a fucking tragic way; probs still blaming himself for his death) and on top of that he was held captive in Azkaban for 13 friggin' years (thanks for nothing, Dumbledore, you little shit) and his mind was just bound to be fucked because of this. So the whole Sirius situation is rather complex and I feel compassion for him - especially since Dumbledore (the little shit) forced him to be bound to his old childhood home - a place that only gives him anxiety and which is linked to his darkest memories (I mean can you imagine being exposed to a screaming portrait of the mother who hated you with all her heart). So overall, Order had just the perfect mix of funny, tragic, beautiful, witty, depressing and real moments of any of the Harry Potter books and it will forever stay in my heart.Things I forgot to mention but that are golden in this are RON AND HERMIONE BECOMING FUCKING PREFECTS, RON BECOMING A MEMBER OF THE QUIDDITCH TEAM (so proud of him and the whole Weasley is our King-subplot is all I needed in my life), Harry's disastrous date with Cho Chang in Hogsmeadeeee, Dumbledore's freaking Army.

78,478650441,12/16/2012,4.0,"“Indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike.” The last two chapters of this book are heart-wrenching. This book may not be perfect, but it was inching its way toward that finish line. I enjoy comedic, childlike humor as much as the rest of the fans, but to me when the story gets a little darker (deeper), it gets even better. We get a return of favorite characters, but as with the other books, we also get new ones. While the rest of the series introduced new characters that were fun and that we actually wanted to read about, here it just seems like two main hate-filled creatures show up: Dolores Umbridge (shudder) and Bellatrix (who I can't stand.)Harry is now 15 and showing it through teenage angst and mood swings. Happily this didn't bother me because - let's face it - these are dark times in the young wizard's life and him being happy-go-lucky would just be unrealistic. Plus the teenager hormones were already tweaked anyway because of his friends, Dumbledore, and the wizarding community basically ignoring him for a summer. Then you have the Voldemort strange triangle in his head, probably fueling that anger. I noticed when watching the movie that they played up the potential possession while in the book it was hinted as a possibility, left for the reader to muse about themselves and see what happens.Hermione and Ron show considerable patience with their temper-triggered friend, becoming of all things, perfects in the school. It was an ironic touch for the series but would have worked just as well without it. Loony Luna is a delight because the girl is simply so strange, although the convenience of her character's connected to a newspaper owning father comes into play as well. There's Fred and George, who I always loved in the books but who seem lusterless in the movies - here they rocked with their unique style of misbehavior, especially when showing up a certain new villain.Where this book shines character-wise is Neville, who is so awesome as a friend suddenly and co-fighter. There's a teary situation in the hospital, and how he stands by Harry (stuffed nose and all) in a fight later was heart-winning. Dumbledore finally gets to show us why he has such an awesome, badass reputation in the wizarding world, and I couldn't be happier with the two scenes that showed him flexing the magic muscle.“You know, Minister, I disagree with Dumbledore on many counts...but you cannot deny he's got style...” Since Snape is a favorite of mine but only shows his face occasionally, it was a further delight that Harry had to learn Occlumency from the professor. The scenes were intense and, although a small subplot, mesmerized me. They showed a glimpse into the life of Harry's parents before he put them on a pedestal.Can we all agree that McGonagall is even more likable after this book? I didn't care about her the first few, but she keeps growing on me. Here she's amazing. Sirius...ah, Sirius. This book shows even further that he is dependent upon Harry because he misses James so much and sees the father in the son. There was a sad scene in the fire where he withdraws from Harry a bit because he's disappointed. He spends much of the book frustrated and lonely, which was realistic and deep but depressing. I love their relationship, both without families but connecting to each other due to that.Let's wave aside the villain of Voldemort for this book, shall we? He's there, he's bad, but he's not that frequent and he isn't the one who really irritated readers in this one. Those badges go to the annoying Umbridge we all loved to hate and the evil Bellatrix. Umbridge is around for the majority of book, raising shivers of annoyance. Besides her arrogant attitude that made me want to slap her, there's the beyond disturbing punishment with that blood quill and poor Harry. It certainly brought a twisted touch to the series that was almost missing before.I hate to see Harry tricked at the end, but you can't keep a series real and have the character be perfect in predictions every time. The book misses that perfect finish line because there are too many lucky coincidences that come in handy and save the characters throughout fight scenes, but they were still imaginative and adventurous. It's a large book, 870 pages, and if you stand back and examine it, not a lot of action actually happens. Still, it's so easy to get sucked in and so hard to look away. There's a heartbreaking, soul-slapping death that I don't think I'll get over. I knew it was coming, but couldn't remember the order from the movies when it would show up. Sadness! It was sudden and shocking and just awful. Harry's emotion afterwards was realistic and well done.J.K. Rowling continues this series with talent, and the books really do keep getting better and better.

I actually like it.The first three books were silly children’s books with the occasional really good part. Enjoyable, but hardly remarkable. The fourth was an excruciatingly boring book that was saved by its amazing ending. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, on the other hand, is a great fantasy novel.The atmosphere is finally a lot darker, the story is a lot more coherent, and several new characters, organisations, places and scenes add a lot of complexity.One of the most important aspects is the expansion of Severus Snape’s character. One particular flashback made me understand all his actions (though not quite like him, at least not yet) and hate Harry’s sorry excuse for a father more than any literary character ever.The wildly interesting Order of the Phoenix is (obviously) introduced, several of Sirius’ ancestors show up in various forms (including the absodamnlutely amazing Phineas Nigellus Black), Dumbledore is truly shining in this instalment and the final scenes in the Department of Mysteries top the whole thing off greatly.All in all, the second half of the series has placed itself on a much higher level than the first, and I am fully immersed in it for the first time.",64,0.9939,0.038,0.728,0.234,0.4881189948263119,POSITIVE,0.9834
80,1829428918,07/03/2018,5.0,"[Warning: some slight spoilers but no name drops]The fifth installment of the Harry Potter gets a bit darker with the death of a fan favorite and a sadistic new master of the Dark Arts at Hogwarts. Rowling's writing style gets a bit more rounded out and the action is fairly non-stop throughout. The Order of the Phoenix will have a large role to play in these last few books and we start to see a bit more humanity in some characters who have up to now been nearly demi-gods. I feel like there are a few key themes throughout the HP universe in terms of critical values which I share with the author. One of the ones dealt with in Order of the Phoenix continues to be the mechanics of racism (in this case the (hypocritical) hate of Muggles by Voldemort & Co. The way that Rowling builds this up is a great study in terms of how both Jews in Europe and blacks in the US have been vilified and how even the rare Jew or black can adopt the oppressive mindset due to their own self-hate and just ignore the contradictions. Similarly, the treatment of house-elves which Hermione has so persistently fought for (and for which Ron has consistently teased her becomes a key element to the tragic climax of this particular novel.

Some things that stood out for me include the quirky Luna Lovegood (who sees and readily accepts a reality that is different from anyone else in Harry's circle) and 12 Grimmauld Place (the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix that remains invisible to all but the 'secret-keepers' because of a Fidelius Charm).

83,3624358346,11/15/2020,5.0,"The Harry Potter experience has little time for rest and relaxation, with this fifth book in the series. Things take a significant turn towards the dark and eerie, yet the story remains captivating as magic politics takes centre stage. What began with a boy wizard has become a fight for survival with the evil Voldemort appearing in strange and mysterious ways throughout the piece, even as many deny his presence. The reader will have to pay close attention to connect with all the plotlines that J.K. Rowling offers, though the dedication does not go unrewarded. Rowling surely has outdone herself here as readers push into what might be called the ‘maturation’ of the series, no longer short books that rely solely on humour. Perfect for those who want something more adventurous and without the guarantee of a happy ending!Harry has again been forced into a state of boredom all summer long. Still stuck living with the Dursleys, Harry must bide his time and hope the days pass quickly before it’s time to return to Hogwarts. While out one evening, Harry and his cousin, Dudley, are set upon by Dementors. Harry does the only thing he can think to do and accesses his magical capabilities, in direct violation of Ministry of Magic regulations. Harry is forced to attend a disciplinary hearing when his actions are made known, one that could cost him a spot at Hogwarts during his important Fifth Year!After an intense process, Harry is exonerated, but not before he learns of a secret society, the Order of the Phoenix. Created by his headmaster, Dumbledore, the Order is currently housed in the home of Sirius Black, who remains wanted by the Ministry. Harry’s eyes are opened to the inner workings of wizardry and the politics that keeps the Ministry of Magic at arm’s length.Harry’s return to Hogwarts brings a great deal of change. Not only is it Fifth Year, but the OWL exams await students, a set of tests that help streamline further educational and career aspirations. Plus, a new professor has joined the faculty, Delores Umbridge, who has strong ties to the Ministry. While Ron and Hermione are eager to see what the year brings, an ominous cloud hangs over Harry, not to mention the constant ache of his forehead scar.While Harry tells anyone who will listen that he had a run-in with Voldemort, many follow the Ministry line and deny that it happened, choosing to consider that Harry and Dumbledore are mad and seeking to steal the limelight. Leading the denials is Delores Umbridge, who does all in her power to break Harry down in secretive and destructive ways. The reader discovers the pains Harry must endure at the hands of Umbridge, who appears to be power hungry herself.As the Ministry of Magic seeks to put Hogwarts in its place, they nominate Professor Umbridge as High Inquisitor, allowing her to vet and remove any on the teaching faculty deemed out of line. Umbridge is also given the iron fist to bring the students in line, putting Harry in her crosshairs from Day One. Harry and Umbridge clash repeatedly, which eventually leads to a monumental decision that could ruin Fifth Year. Through a series of secret communications, Harry tries to explain himself to Sirius, who offers support but cannot come to the aid of his godson as effectively as he would like. Harry does the only thing he can do, rallying students who feel the squeeze of the High Inquisitor. The creation of Dumbledore’s Army is a protest movement that will pit Harry against the Ministry in a standoff like no other. Things go so far that one senior member of Hogwarts will have to pay the price. As the OWLs approach, Harry must juggle his studies, his ongoing romantic interest in one of his fellow students, and a series of dark dreams that he cannot fully comprehend. He receives help from a completely unexpected source to help block his mind from the powers that Voldemort appears to be trying to push. The scar aches repeatedly, which can only mean that evil awaits, though no one is entirely sure when or how!As Umbridge takes further control at Hogwarts, it is an epic battle over the future of the institution, as well as a clash of good versus evil. Harry and Voldemort are destined to collide, which could end badly for everyone. With Hogwarts in shambles, Harry can only hope that he will be able to wrest control back to the good side, or face likely expulsion for good. Then again, if he’s dead, school won’t matter at all!J.K. Rowling offers her readers, young and old alike, a story full of excitement and thrills on every page. As usual, there are nuances that appeal to various reading levels, making the story highly intriguing.Harry Potter retains the protagonist role, always maturing and finding new way to show this to the attentive reader. There are moments of significant backstory to offer, should the reader be paying close attention between the action-filled narrative in the present. Rowling again addresses the scar and its symbolism, providing more for the reader who has surely come with more questions. The reader gets another look at the personal side of Harry’s life, talking about his romantic interests as a more regular concern. Balancing that with an important school year provides needed depth for Harry’s character. With added struggles related to Voldemort, Harry proves to be one character who refuses to turn stagnant. The reader also sees the morose side of Harry Potter, especially in the final section of the novel.Rowling continues providing strong supporting characters for her readers, both individuals present throughout the entire series and those whose one-off status was specifically designed for this novel. The ever-evolving aspect of the story permits Rowling to add new perspectives to Hogwarts and focus on an ever-growing group of humans and creatures alike. There is some development in a handful of the characters, which helps contrast alongside the advancements that Harry makes and permits readers to see growth in their favourites.This was another of the ‘truly complex novels’, books that exceed the basics of what I would expect Neo might want to handle. However, he has been devouring them with relative ease. This was the longer of all the books, but it needed every pages to hash out some of the more complicated plot lines that could not have effectively been divided over a few novels. I can only hope that this does/did not scare some readers away, as there is such an attachment to a number of the characters that can develop for the dedicated and attentive reader.The book uses a strong narrative to push it along and leaves the reader wanting more with every chapter. Much is revealed in relation of the Ministry of Magic and some of its more nefarious plans, as well as the darker side of the Potter-Voldemort clashes. Both of these appear to be essential to understanding the larger story arc that Rowling injects into the narrative. I can see many of the truths unveiled in this book are to be important parts as the series progresses, so I am trying to stay alert. Longer chapters help build a deeper story and entertaining the eager reader. I cannot wait to see what awaits me in the final few novels, as Harry surely is not done learning about himself, his family, and his role in the larger Hogwarts/Ministry struggles.Kudos, Madam Rowling, another stellar piece of writing. I cannot wait to see what else you have for your reading fans.Love/hate the review?

Yes Harry is angsty. Yes it's a tad bit whiny. But after having read the whole series, while Goblet was the turning point, Order of the Phoenix was where we saw the universe change and set the course for the rest of the series. PLUS it's the book that introduced Luna Lovegood!!!! How could it not be a great book???Spoilers ahead for those who haven't read the series (and if you haven't I can't even with you). This takes place after the murder of Cedric Diggory and everyone is prepping to face the Dark Lord. Harry is often kept out of the loop, which doesn't help because he's feeling isolated as is. When the Ministry of Magic starts interfering at Hogwart's, things can only go down from there...  “Hello, Harry"" said George, beaming at him. ""We thought we heard your dulcet tones.""""You don't want to bottle up your anger like that, Harry, let it all out,"" said Fred, also beaming. ""There might be a couple of people fifty miles away who didn't hear you.”  Love this book! Despite the shouty caps angst from Harry, this book is full of fun moments and information I missed the first time around. It's also Harry's book of disillusionment, with Dumbledore and the memory of his father. There were also giant hints at Snape and Lily in this one that are so much more obvious now...I loved getting to know more about Neville, dear sweet boy he is. I kind of want a spinoff series from his point of view, kind of like Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow. Plus I loved that we get to know Ginny a bit more in this book too, now that she's not afraid to talk in front of Harry. Anyways, love this book.

That’s who we really are.”A secret order gathers at Grimmauld Place to try and fight against the dark forces, whilst Harry must learn how to protect himself from Voldemort’s mind-penetrating assaults.Probably one of my least favourites in the series, and yet I still absolutely LOVE it. I love all the scenes with Dumbledore’s Army, the introduction of thestrals(!!!), Luna Lovegood... the way Neville Longbottom is so frickin’ brave and loyal at the Ministry of Magic. Just ALL of it!!Order of the Phoenix also gives us the most DESPICABLE villain ever in the form of Dolores Umbridge. There is nothing redeeming about this monster in pink. Her treatment of Hagrid in particular simultaneously makes me want to both cry and punch a wall. Or her face.This book is really when the series transitions from being a story for children to becoming more young adult (although I do believe HP transcends all ages, but ya get what I mean!). The storyline gets more dark, our hearts are shattered into a million pieces, we have to face the reality of death and loss. It’s just a lot, okay?! We learn that the world is not black and white, it exists in shades of grey. Even your parents are not perfect (see James Potter), and the adults who we hope will always be our infallible protecters will fail at times too (see Dumbledore and Sirius). It’s heartbreaking but Rowling explores these topics and themes in such a real and resonating way.This one is just a tad too long, I feel - particularly when a good portion of it is just Harry shouting. I can wholeheartedly understand his outbursts - he isn’t being told anything, he’s kept in the dark, his hormones are running wild, but it does grate on my nerves after a while.Otherwise - I loved this one!

93,3596346085,10/25/2020,5.0,"***Please note that this review may contain spoilers for the overall series, not just this book.***This seems to be the most divisive Harry Potter book, with many people not enjoying the length, the slow start, the angst, the amount of time it takes to get back to Hogwarts etc. I think people have every right to not enjoy these things of course, but I do find it amusing that the things that seem to irritate some readers so much are the things I especially love. I love that Harry is traumatised (he should be), bitter, angry, and depressed. That he is furious with his friends, with Dumbledore, with the unfairness of the world. He has every right to be, and frankly I would be concerned if he responded to the conclusion of the previous book by spending a joyful summer skipping around Privet Drive. You watch someone be murdered, come face to face with the man who killed your parents and has tried tried to kill you multiple times, see ""echoes"" of your dead parents -- not to mention the whole Moody/Barty Crouch JR incident --- depression and PTDS feels inevitable. Harry might exist in a world of fantasy and magic, but J.K. Rowling makes sure to keep it grounded in emotional realism. The slowness of Harry's time in Privet Drive works so well to me because it captures perfectly the anguish of waiting and the suffocating yet mundane weight of it. I can still remember how my heart plummeted when Harry is expelled. That was the light at the end of the tunnel snatched away. And even when he got it back it wasn't really the same. I love the time spent with Sirius in his miserable yet intriguing house. The insights into the more 'ordinary' aspects of wizard life always fascinate me. Housekeeping, house elves, the portraits -- day to day stuff with a magical twist. Harry's hearing at the Ministry of Magic contrasts all of this with a jolt. The ministry itself is grand, imposing, with a fountain that makes me roll my eyes at the arrogance of many (most) wizards that it so cleverly highlights, representing this false ideal of wizarding superiority that feels a little too in-line with Voldemort's view on the world to be entirely comfortable.   Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore sweeps in and makes everything OK, as expected, but the difference in his treatment of Harry, the way he avoids him, is like having expected solid ground suddenly vanish. Even knowing the reason, it still hurts my feelings! I feel affronted on Harry's behalf and let down by Dumbledore, for ignoring Harry when he needs him most. Dumbledore's calm, assured manner during the hearing contrasts beautifully with Fudge's blustery, blundering one. Fudge demands respect he hasn't earned, which sadly seems to reflect the vast majority of public figures whose opinions I encounter each day via the news. He's full of his own self-importance and self-image, too focused (I think) on rank, or fame, or symbolic power or some dangerous combination of all three, and threatened by Dumbledore because he doesn't need those things to be brilliant. Dumbledore is Dumbledore, with or without titles or seats on 'important' councils such as the Wizengamot. He has an entirely different and undeniable kind of power, one that will always remain unattainable to Fudge and men like him. This was the first time I remember feeling sad that it was time to return to Hogwarts, I suppose because this was the first time Harry really had something he was leaving behind. Number 12 Grimmauld Place is a thoroughly unpleasant house, but it provides Harry with the chance to spend some real time with Sirius. Knowing how the book ends, I think I valued that more than Harry was able to.  I also enjoy how much more Fred, George and Ginny feature, and how dynamic all three are. As a general rule I don't find pranks that funny as they don't gel that well with my sense of humour, but for Fred and George I make an exception. Their pranks transcend into an art form and I can't help but admire them for it. Umbridge. Ugh -- I really hate her. She is maddening and smug and I despise her with an intensity that is probably unreasonable. Is she worse than Voldemort? No, not really I suppose. But at least Voldemort is honest about who and what he is. He isn't a villain pretending to be a hero. Umbridge is everything I hate about Fudge magnified many times over. Her simpering and self-aggrandising manner may not be worse than being a mass murderer, but it is much more irritating. To balance the misery of Dolores Jane Umbridge however, we get more Neville Longbottom, more Sirius, more Dobby, more Weasley's and the introduction of the wonderful Luna Lovegood. Harry's romance with Cho is awkward, rather sweet and never quite works. I've always enjoyed it, the way they genuinely like each other but aren't really well suited. Harry's reliance on Hermione to explain everything Cho is thinking is quite funny, but also shows in such a simple way why it won't really work. I don't think relationships should require an emotional interpreter! I know a lot of people feel like Cho was underwritten, but I always thought that was kind of the point. So often when you have a crush on someone, you don't really know them. I do like Cho, and to be frank, I think the biggest issue between her and Harry (other than Cedric) is that Harry is too immature for her at this point in time. She is grieving and he is not equipped to deal with that. In fairness, he's distracted with his own trauma. I just looked on the Harry Potter wiki character thing, and apparently the form Cho's boggart takes is Lord Voldemort, which is actually really sad but also endears her to me even more. I know that is a common fear for wizards, but I imagine she links it with Cedric's death. I love the Thestrals and don't really care too much about the argument that Harry should have been able to see them earlier, or at least at the end previous book. I get it, and understand the inconsistencies but I'm willing to accept J.K. Rowling's explanations about it all. https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/T...I spent quite a long time reading through this wiki entry and found it interesting. I could spend hours reading these articles, so I make a point to limit myself and only venture into them if I am looking for specific information!The chapters focused on the DA meetings are amongst my favourite, in part because they are fun and also because there is something nice about following along as the characters take initiative and rebel in a practical, useful way. I've seen people express that Harry should have become a teacher because he enjoyed leading these meetings. I'm not sure I agree -- enjoying something doesn't mean you have to make it your career. Also, I thought he enjoyed them less for the teaching and more for the way he got to be hands on with Defense Against the Dark Arts --- something that seems to me makes him very well suited to being an Auror. Wizards seem to live long lives (if not killed). Perhaps he might enjoy teaching after retiring from being an Auror ---- he would have more practical skills and knowledge to pass on if he wanted to. (I've just realised it is a tad ridiculous to be speculating on Harry's retirement plans during a review of a book that takes place when he is a teenager!).Harry (understandably) dreads his Occlumency lessons, but as a reader I look forward to them. I am very drawn to this branch of magic. Knowing how it is going to play out makes it easy to feel frustrated with Harry for not trying hard enough, but I know that the feeling is slightly misplaced. I think Dumbledore is right when he later claims the fault lies with him rather than Harry. If Harry had been informed, knew why it was so desperately important, he would have cared more and made more of an effort.  When Harry ventures into Snape's memories (snooping in a way that is really a great violation of privacy, akin to reading a deeply personal journal without permission) he is confronted with a version of his father he was unprepared for. James and Sirius are young, attractive, talented jerks who think far too highly of themselves. Remus is uncomfortable with their behaviour but makes no move to rein it in. James treats Snape abysmally -- he might be nice overall, but here he is a bully, and this shakes Harry deeply. In a way it throws him off even more than the events of the previous book. Disillusionment, especially when it applies to a revered, dead parent is difficult to process. His need to talk to Sirius about this is, for me at least, one of the most heart-wrenching aspects of the book. Not just because Sirius is the person he turns to but because Umbridge's power to censor people and control who they speak to is such a violation of human rights. The scheme to get Harry into Umbridge's office is great fun, and then we get the the last proper conversation between Harry and his godfather (at least, last proper conversation while they are both alive). When I was younger I never quite bought into Sirius's explanation for James behaviour, but I think I understand it know. James was young and stupid but he eventually grew up. It doesn't excuse the bullying, but people can change. I think we do them a disservice if we assume that they can't.  During this reread of the series, I've noticed more than ever how young characters like Sirius and Lupin really are. Adults, yes, but so young really. According to this: https://harrypottercanon.fandom.com/w...Sirius was only 36 years when he was killed. He lived through one war, only to be killed near the beginning of another. This kind of thing was (and is) a reality for so many people, and it is deeply sad but also an important thing to highlight. Sirius's death does feel cruel. When I was very young, each time I would watch The Lion King I would hope that this time Mufasa would live, because I hadn't quite grasped how movies work. I feel that way about Sirius dying, despite knowing better, even though I have outgrown that mindset. I just hope it won't happen and hate when it does. It hits me as hard every time. I find his death scene oddly beautiful, with the veil and everything, but I also can't even write about it without wanting to cry. I took his fictional death as hard as I would have if he had been a real person I actually knew. There is a lot of Gary Oldman in my minds version of Sirius Black, because he was so excellent in the films and is such a brilliant actor that he of course made a permanent mark on the character, but parts of my ""original"" Sirius still bleed though. I don't really know how to describe the differences, but it's sort of like when you have a dream about someone and then wake up and remember that they don't quite look like that.Sirius's death is also a good reminder that, for all his power, Dumbledore can't fix everything. He can't save Sirius, he can't keep Harry from experiencing that grief, he can't stop a war. The battle between Dumbledore and Voldemort is riveting. Voldemort taking over Harry's body works better in the book than it does in the film. It's a scene that is powerful in the book, but I've never felt like they got it right in the movie. It feels overdone and briefly makes me cringe when it happens on screen, but it feels seamless in the novel. Fawkes' part in the battle between Dumbledore and Voldemort is incredible. I couldn't help thinking of Fawkes as Dumbledore's Dæmon, even though that is a concept that belongs to Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials. I think Fawkes is the the most beautiful character in the series and probably my favourite. His bond with Dumbledore seems like this sacred thing that is far more significant than the more everyday magic of the Wizarding World.This turned into a longer review than I typically write, and I think I have spent most of it blathering away to myself about my Harry Potter opinions, but I guess Goodreads is the ideal place to post a book related ramble! I feel a bit like that woman in Mean Girls who says, ""I just have a lot of feelings"". I could write more, but I think it's best that I don't. Editing has never being my strong suit, so I think all of this, which will mostly remain as I first wrote it, is more than enough. I have years worth of thoughts and theories about these books, and I also read them prior to online discussions being as much of a thing, so it's quite odd to try and sum up all that I feel about it. One final thing I want to add--- I appreciated the balance Stephen Fry struck between making Umbridge appropriately annoying while not taking it so far that it ruined the audio experience.

94,2324857578,03/12/2018,4.0,"4.5 Stars!""Hem, Hem!""Where to even begin with this book. My god it was long that’s the first thing I have to say. I understand why it’s as bis as what it is because it’s introducing new characters, setting the scene, going into more depth with other characters, but honestly some of it wasn’t really necessary; my main example was the cleaning of the house. Now moving on, I love that it’s getting darker and the story is really really coming along, we’re getting more answers on what is going to happen, there’s so much more time in school with the learning aspect and DA meetings which was so exciting to see!Now I know lots of people know and love these characters and I don’t normally do a “character” section because people know them but I have to mention just a few because I would put it under my likes and what not but this needs its own bit!Firstly I’m going to come out and say it. I adored Neville in these books, we really see him come into his own, especially in regards to the DA meetings, we see him thrive in something. Throughout other books he comes across as someone who isn’t seen to be really special and not very good at things, however in this. My god! I felt SO proud! I think what was important is that people actually found out what happened to his parents, and because no one reacted to that he took it in his stride and actually did something about it. He stood up for Harry when others were being cruel to him and he refused to take no for an answer. He was one of the last two standing! He needs MORE appreciation!Then we have Professor McGonagall, I already loved her as a character but in this, boy I loved her even more! She took no nonsense from Umbridge, she was there to support others, she’s loyal and if you’re on her bad side, well. The protectiveness she has for her students and Dumbledore. Ahhh, my heart!This time around I wasn’t as keen on Harry to begin with. Like don’t get me wrong I know he’s been through a lot, but he was just so angry all of the time (like I said I know why) but it was sometimes just too much. He was fighting with anyone who tried to help, the backwards and forwards with Cho didn’t really do anything for me either. However towards the end he got much better and as “The Chosen One” he took it in his stride and realisation has set in so I look forward to seeing how he progresses throughout. LONG LIVE FRED AND GEORGE they are 100000000% my favourite characters. I think because the book is getting darker we need someone like these in the series to lighten it up a bit. We saw them up to their usual tricks, however we also see that they’re actually quite smart with all of the crazy inventions they make.How could I possibly forget Umbridge? You know, when you love to loathe a character? Well this is a perfect example. She’s not a nice person, she’s cruel and highly irritating BUT as a character it was so gripping to see what she’d do next.What I liked?- The family tree in the Black house, it was really interesting to see how certain characters linked up with one another- Little reference to SPEW- Prefects!- There was so much back story, we got the original Order, we learnt more about Neville and his family, got answers from Dumbledore on Prophecies- Anything Fred and George related (along with Hermione trying to tell them off) not only that but their farewell to Hogwarts, with the Broomsticks (I legit laughed for the longest time) and the fight on the Quidditch pitch!- Hermione saying Voldermorts name, I was like YOU GO GIRL!- In fact just how intelligent she is, in regards to DA, she made the coins, the Jinx (god I loved it), setting revision sessions up.- Hagrid’s Journey!- Seeing old characters again; Sirius, Lupin, Moody, Lockhart, Centaurs then we get the new ones; - Tonks, Luna, Bellatrix, Umbridge, Giants, Kreacher-The unity of the school coming together against Umbridge… it was great!What I didn’t like?- I know it’s part of the story but I really detested Percy in this book, like BOY don’t turn your back on your family, and the way he treated them, it broke my little heart! I’m supposed to love all of the Weasleys! - I find it really difficult to like Snape, we see his backstory (and it hurt like hell I must admit) but he bullies Harry for something his father did, yet Dumbledore doesn’t really say anything in regards to it?!- It was sooooooooooo longOverall I’m looking forward to Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, I’m really excited to carry on and see what happens, hopefully I’ll be able to actually buddy read this with Fathima instead of powering on ahead.

“Wit beyond measure is a man's greatest treasure.”
 Each time & every time I start an HP book I'm blown away by how much every book is different than the last one..From the very beginning of the book, just like Harry, I was mad at Dumbledore cause he really seemed to ignoring Harry, which as a fact he was, but then at last when Dumbledore told Harry the reasons why he had been acting so distant I couldn't help feeling sorry for Dumbledore and the fact that instead of stopping Harry from shouting at him or shattering his office he egged him to do so, I felt my stomach churn, I simply loved Dumbledore from that moment on that much more..This was huge, when I say huge, I mean huge. Every book gets bigger and bigger, this is unbelievably dark and so different than any other book. Reading the first book I never would have guessed how it all takes such a dark turn or that it'd come to this. This book is the epitome of plot twists.The tyranny of Dolores Umbridge. The hunt. The ministry. The fight. The tension between everything and everyone. The suspense was real, I felt it in my bones every time something would happen or someone would get hurt. Near-death experiences. Harry and Voldemort. The fight in the ministry between Voldemort and Dumbledore is one of the most amazing scenes I've ever read. It was breath-taking in all of its aspects. Whichever way you want to see this, it was incredible. I loved and hated the fact that our heroes are being through so much pain. Not just Harry, or Ron & Hermione. I'm talking about every one. Event those in the Order of the Phoenix and those in Dumbledore's Army (coolest names ever, right?). Mrs. Rowling makes a leap every time, she takes every book to an entire different level.

A combination of frustration over being kept in the dark and fear that he will be expelled fuels much of Harry's anger, and it all comes out at once, directly aimed at Ron and Hermione. Rowling perfectly portrays Harry's frustration at being too old to shirk responsibility, but too young to be accepted as part of the fight that he knows is coming. * Harry's detention with Professor Umbridge. Rowling shows her darker side, leading readers to believe that Hogwarts is no longer a safe haven for young wizards. Dolores represents a bureaucratic tyrant capable of real evil, and Harry is forced to endure their private battle of wills alone. * Harry and Cho's painfully awkward interactions. Rowling clearly remembers what it was like to be a teenager. * Harry's Occlumency lessons with Snape. * Dumbledore's confession to Harry.* Harry yet again loses another loved one.* We meet Hagrid's brother and come to love him as much as Hagrid does.* We learn more about the destiny of Harry and Voldemort.* We also see first hand how destructive government can be when predjudice, ignorance, and pride are at the helm. (i.e. Fudge and Umbridge)Amazon ReviewAs his fifth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry approaches, 15-year-old Harry Potter is in full-blown adolescence, complete with regular outbursts of rage, a nearly debilitating crush, and the blooming of a powerful sense of rebellion. It's been yet another infuriating and boring summer with the despicable Dursleys, this time with minimal contact from our hero's non-Muggle friends from school. Harry is feeling especially edgy at the lack of news from the magic world, wondering when the freshly revived evil Lord Voldemort will strike. Returning to Hogwarts will be a relief... or will it?The fifth book in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series follows the darkest year yet for our young wizard, who finds himself knocked down a peg or three after the events of last year. Somehow, over the summer, gossip (usually traced back to the magic world's newspaper, the Daily Prophet) has turned Harry's tragic and heroic encounter with Voldemort at the Triwizard Tournament into an excuse to ridicule and discount the teen. Even Professor Dumbledore, headmaster of the school, has come under scrutiny by the Ministry of Magic, which refuses to officially acknowledge the terrifying truth that Voldemort is back. Enter a particularly loathsome new character: the toadlike and simpering (""hem, hem"") Dolores Umbridge, senior undersecretary to the Minister of Magic, who takes over the vacant position of Defense Against Dark Arts teacher--and in no time manages to become the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts, as well. Life isn't getting any easier for Harry Potter. With an overwhelming course load as the fifth years prepare for their Ordinary Wizarding Levels examinations (O.W.Ls), devastating changes in the Gryffindor Quidditch team lineup, vivid dreams about long hallways and closed doors, and increasing pain in his lightning-shaped scar, Harry's resilience is sorely tested.Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, more than any of the four previous novels in the series, is a coming-of-age story. Harry faces the thorny transition into adulthood, when adult heroes are revealed to be fallible, and matters that seemed black-and-white suddenly come out in shades of gray. Gone is the wide-eyed innocent, the whiz kid of Sorcerer's Stone. Here we have an adolescent who's sometimes sullen, often confused (especially about girls), and always self-questioning. Confronting death again, as well as a startling prophecy, Harry ends his year at Hogwarts exhausted and pensive. Readers, on the other hand, will be energized as they enter yet again the long waiting period for the next title in the marvelous, magical series.

OVERVIEWAfter the return of Voldemort in the last book, Dumbledore re-create a group of wizards named: Order of Phoenix to face Voldemort who is also creating his army to attack. Ministry of Magic doesn't believe Dumbledore when he says 'Voldemort has returned'. So, he has to do what must be done on his own. But the Ministry doesn't sit watching. It also intervenes in Dumbledore's working by sending its spy, Professor Umbridge, at Hogwarts.  RANDOM THOUGHTS=> In every book, we have a new  Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher who has to do anything with Voldemort or is very suspicious. This fact has become very predictable for me. When Umbridge appeared, I had guessed that she isn't good for Hogwarts. And I was right.=> Order of Phoenix. Loved the name. I wish I could make sense of it.=> I was beyond happy after reading what happened to Umbridge in ending. She is more bad than Malfoy. Well, Malfoy is good in its own role. Not that bad.

I so completely and utterly loathed this book that I can't even be bothered to be bring the snark. This novel is a time sink and I refuse to waste too much time reviewing it. I hate that I spent almost a month of my life reading it. In fact, I read The Last Temptation of Christ while reading this, and I actually wanted to read the Christ book more than I wanted to read about Potter. And I'm a fucking atheist. After the near-constant action of GOBLET, I expected more from this one. What I got was 800 pages of ""Let me tell you ALL THIS so I can set up the next two books"" and 70 pages of shit actually happening (the dementors at the beginning and the final fight). Somewhere in the middle of all this is this chick named Umbridge who is really good at being insufferable. You know she's going to get hers in the end because this is a Harry Potter book, so it's no surprise when she gets her comeuppance. At this point, I would have much rather seen her take over the school permanently and the students continuing their education in a fucking cave... or something else unpredictable. I was so ready for something different that I cheered when a main character died. I almost gave this an extra star because Rowling killed off this character, but I changed my mind. That one scene doesn't make up for the rest of this tedious attempt to fulfill her promise of a seven book series.In summation: If it wasn't for my goddamned OCD I would never have finished this.

 'Things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end, if not always in the way we expect.' 
If I had to pick one of these seven books as a favourite, it would be this one. It was the longest of them when it was published, and I love every bit that made it longer: this one has a lot more of Hogwarts' daily life. There's a lot of things which have always been there, but are now being presented far more detailed. Especially the classes, all the teenagy bits about Harry and Cho, and of course, Umbridge. 
'I know [Umbridge] by reputation and I'm sure she's no Death Eater-''She's foul enough to be one...''Yes, but the world isn't split into good people and Death Eaters.'
I've read hundreds of books, but the one person I detest with all my heart, even more than shitty Joffrey Baratheon or that damned Falconer, is Dolores Jane Umbridge. I hate her so much. The whole Dumbledore's Army thing, Harry's detentions, all of it: there's always Umbridge ruining everything. Well, not everything. Another great thing about Order of the Phoenix are the funny passages: the Weasley Twins, and most of all, Minerva Badass McGonagall. McGonagall is growing reaaaally strong in this one. From helping Peeves to destroy school property up to completely destroying Umbridge during Harry's interview about joining the aurors, McGonagall never fails to deliver excellency. 
'Is it true that you shouted at Professor Umbridge?''Yes.''You called her a liar?''Yes.''You told her He Who Must Not Be Named is back?''Yes.''Have a biscuit, Potter.' 'Harry witnessed Professor McGonagall walking right past Peeves who was determinedly loosening a crystal chandelier and could have sworn he heard her tell the poltergeist out of the corner of her mouth, 'It unscrews the other way.'
Well, as to the end? It's been getting darker every year: first year, Harry wins the day completely. Second year, Harry wins, but Lucius gets away. Third year, Sirius can't be cleared and Wormtail escapes. Fourth year, Cedric died and Voldemort returns. Of course, it was only logical that there'd be a major character death in this one ('You care so much you feel as though you will bleed to death with the pain of it', so true), and it's getting even bigger in the next one. Then, the grand finale. Which has Umbridge in it again. Eugh.----SO: my thoughts after my last reread: DUMBLEDORE IS THE BIGGEST DOUCHEBAG OF ALL TIME BECAUSE a) HE'S JUST NOT ABLE TO TELL PEOPLE THE FRIGGIN TRUTHb) HE COULD'VE JUST KILLED VOLDY DURING THEIR DUEL BUT DIDN'Tc) HE CONSTRUCTS THIS STUPID EXCUSE FOR KREACHER.The stupid Kreacher redemption arc is one of the plot decisions that I've always despised - yes, he was being indoctrinated by pureblood supremacists for all his life, but he's still a little shit.Also: Umbridge still sucks.----Dialogue 5Setting 5Characters 6Writing Style 5Plot 4",50,-0.9945,0.177,0.719,0.104,0.4480820105820105,POSITIVE,0.9673

106,578312010,04/01/2013,2.0,"Sweet Jeezuz this is an ENORMOUS book.It's also hella dark. Particularly the last two-hundred-odd pages, which are a total drainer.So here's my thoughts, summed up in nice, concise bullet points:
Good things:
-The Weasley Twins causing mayhem-More Snape-More Sirius-Flashback to young Marauders-Adults actually getting involved for once-Heaps more spells-The Weasley Twins causing more mayhem-That Slytherin dude, Phineas, saying everything I'm thinking-Everyone finally calling out Harry on being a self-absorbed dick-Cho making Harry totally awkward-Bellatrix being Bad to the Bone-The Weasley Twins just being the Weasley Twins. I love those guys.
Bad things:
-Umbridge being a troll-Harry upping the angst 100000%-Still not enough Sirius-Sirius being sad and pathetic-Hermione's house-elf obsession-Harry's quidditch obsession-Dumbledore being a dick-Harry not listening to Snape-So much drama-All the ministry politics-The massive delay getting to the ministry at the end-Harry whining about everything-The whole Grawp debacle(view spoiler)[-Harry getting Sirius killed because he doesn't listen to anyone-Sirius dying for Harry-The pathetic explanation of Sirius's death, and the mysterious arch-Harry not unwrapping the mirror until it was useless-Dumbledore's ridiculous, long-winded explanations for everything-The whole prophecy drama (hide spoiler)]-The entire book taking the series from fun magical happenings to dark, dramatic, wizard-warSo yeah. My original rating was one star, because I hate that this book goes so dark and depressing. But I'm throwing in an extra star for the Weasleys and Snape, coz they were the stars of my favourite scenes from this book.Harry still needs a good smack over the head, though. He honestly screws up ALL THE TIME.***
Original delayed review:
Look, I'm just not a Harry Potter fan, okay? I do concede that the books are (marginally) better than the films (except for the ending of the final book - what a train wreck that was) and, yes, okay, I devoured the series pretty fast when I finally started, but they were just way too hyped for me.So let me focus on this particular volume - possibly my least favourite of the series. Umbridge is a troll, so there's that. Harry's basically a dick the entire time (so nothing's really changed there, I guess) and these kids are doing ridiculous things that just shouldn't be necessary from students of an educational institute that boasts such magical talent. Harry's got this ridiculous arrogance that makes him think he basically is the only one who can save the world, and it's never so evident as in this book.Now, don't get me wrong - there are some characters I grew rather fond of. Hermione's pretty cool, and I associate with her love of knowledge and books. And the Weasley twins crack me up and basically steal the show when they decide they're done with schooling. (Is that a spoiler? Is anything a spoiler at this stage??) Luna's ridiculous and I have to respect that. But I just feel like the logic in this series went downhill from here.Is one star too harsh? I mean, I did get through it, and it certainly kept the reader hanging on. I know some people who think of this as their favourite in the series, because this is where things start to get really dark.

In both the movie and the book, this was the first installment where the darkness seemed to be a main character.On a more personal note, this was the first book to make me genuinely cry.

When reading, the past heads of Hogwarts are aghast by this boy destroying and throwing things. Then, they too, become somber in recognition. This boy, this young boy of fifteen; has been privy to both his parents as well as the closest thing to a parent he had ever known, be murdered.

This book is one of my favourite books in the entire series and i know a lot of people don't like this one but to me it's full of information, story progression and darker as lord voldemort has returned and is gaining more power.  Plot:  Harry is once again at number 4 privet drive and is feeling mad and restless feeling left in the dark after no news of the wizarding world from either his friends or the order. But trouble once again finds trouble when dementors attack Harry and Dudley, after a magical hearing Harry is released with no charges and safe to return to Hogwarts. Things at Hogwarts is set on their heads when the Minister of Magic appoints Dolores Umbridge as the new defence against the dark arts teacher. I loved the defiance that the students and teachers show towards umbridge during the school year and after all of her stupid rules are announced each day, showing how evil she truly is. So many new plot points are tied up in this book with new ones starting up to set up the last two books in the series. I loved every bit of detail that JK rowling provided in this book and i think it was necessary because every bit of detail was needed.  Characters:  Harry Potter:  Harry has grown up a lot since the fourth book and since the events of the fourth book you understand why he is so moody and angry because i feel like he deserves to be because of everything he has seen and been through. Some things that Harry did annoy me but i had to take a step back and realise that he had every single right to be angry at everything. I feel like if the adult characters told him more he wouldn't have been so angry towards everyone and i if in Harry's shoes i would be angry to because no one was telling him anything.  Hermione Granger:  Hermione is starting to grow into herself in this book and she's starting to lose up and not be so uptight about things that Harry and Ron do. Hermione is truly one of the brightest witches of her year because she shows how truly smart she is with all the magic she learns and how she uses it. Hermione becomes a prefect in this book along with Ron and i feel like she if she returned to her 7th year would have been made Head girl. I can truly see how much Ron and Hermione are slowly showing interest in each other and i still to this day that i like these two characters together.  Ron Weasley  Ron is still very underestimated between the three of them and if he was more confident he could truly evolve and honestly over take Harry in so many ways. I feel that he lives in the shadows of his brothers and Harry this makes him seem like he isn't worthy of the true potential that i feel like he truly processes. The one moment that i truly enjoyed about Ron was when he helped win the Quidditch match for Gryffindor and i feel like this is one of his best moments in the book other than when he helped the fight in the department of mysteries.  Neville Longbottom:  Ah Nevill one of the characters in this book who gets more of a larger role in this book and i loved all of the backstory that we got for him and i feel like i got to know this character in this book then i ever did in the entire series. I felt truly sad for Neville especially the St mungos trip that the group took where we find out about his parents torture and there permanent resident there. Neville is one of those underestimated characters and i feel like he comes out of his shell in this book. Luna Lovegood:  Luna my favourite character makes her first appearance in this book and i loved every single moment we were given with her. I love how she doesn't care what people think of her and how she just expresses herself without any care in the world. I feel like luna plays a huge part into getting people to believe Harry that he is in fact telling the truth about Lord Voldemort returning. Just because you have the emotional range of a teaspoon doesn't mean we all have.  Is it true that you shouted at Professor Umbridge?""""Yes.""""You called her a liar?""""Yes.""""You told her He Who Must Not Be Named is back?""""Yes.""""Have a biscuit, Potter.  side notes about this book - Professor McGonagall is a total badass in this book and i loved how she fought back with Umbridge and she is fiercely loyal and badass. - Neville provides in this book that he truly is so strong and how much fight he truly has. - I loved the Dumbledore's Army and i would totally would have also being involved in that secret group.

“We can't choose our fate, but we can choose others. Be careful in knowing that.”

The Order of the Phoenix is to me the greatest book in this series thus far simply because of the attention to characters. Harry’s grief and frustration were both far more palpable in this instalment; his anger allowed me to sympathize with him more strongly than ever. I was so glad to see old faces return (Sirius and Lupin), new faces introduced (Luna and Tonks), and pasts explained (Snape and James). The cast of characters continues to grow each book, and yet everyone is developed really well!While one could argue that The Order of the Phoenix is rather uneventful considering it’s length, I think there was a good balance between plot and characterization. We learned great bounds of information on Voldemort and the Death Eaters’ pasts, were introduced to a tinge of romance, and as usual received a lengthy but thrilling action scene nearing the end.Dolores Umbridge was an incredible antagonist, especially considering she’s only been around for one book. The amount of hatred I feel for that woman is worlds above anything I hold against Voldemort. She is easily one of the most irritating characters I’ve ever come across (in a good way considering she’s meant to be this way, of course), and this in itself is a great feat achieved by Rowling.While I think this book could have definitely been shortened, it’s length does not take away from the story (whereas to me The Goblet of Fire’s length did). I was really pleased to get more incite into the characters struggles, and am looking forward to the rest of the series!

114,9065782,11/13/2007,3.0,"I've been told this was the most difficult to read of the series and I found it to be true. Harry is full of teen angst and spends a lot of the book furious (and being quite infuriating) at the fact that nothing is happening, and that when things do happen, he's not allowed to be involved. Of course not being allowed do things should never stop a boy like Harry Potter from getting involved - except that amazingly it does. This book isn’t really so much about Harry Potter, but about all the other characters and the events that are sweeping the wizarding world. Harry eventually gets caught up with fighting the new headmistress brought in due the great changes taking place outside Hogwarts, but he’s more a witness caught up in events than an actor trying to sort them out. While the book lays a great deal of background information and sets up for the last two books, there isn't a strong central adventure story that makes this book stand alone. What results feels less like a story in the middle of a larger tale, and more like a closet where all of the information and loose ends that must be sorted to finish the series have been crammed in like so many bogarts. There is a ream’s worth of scenes an editor could have blue penciled out to emphasize the story arc, with all essential events quite intact. Still the narration and dialog is often enjoyable and the actions that Harry does finally end up involving himself in become key in the end. Let’s hope Harry is past his angst and ready for final battle. ",46,0.2001,0.104,0.8,0.097,0.4724376633467542,NEGATIVE,0.6697
115,615213643,05/14/2013,5.0,"I bawled my eyes out during the last fifty pages. I cried for almost an hour. I went to sleep at 1 AM with a headache, tachycardia and a slight fever. I'm being perfectly Sirius. Oh God, no, that was so lame. I'm sorry, guys.Aaannyyywwayyyy, this book shot my expectations through the roof. It's like J.K. Rowling keeps getting better, but to do this she needs to smash my heart to pieces that get smaller with every book.For example, right here she has created my #1 Most Hated Character Of All Time (tie with Dan from SF, but that's a whole 'nother rant): Dolores Umbridge. Now, I swear, if I'm not developing this, it's because I know I would go on and on and on for about three Word pages.Close on her heels is Bellatrix Lestrange, whom I'd probably hate more if I'd spent more time with her. Thankfully, I didn't, because I would have set the book on fire. She did the one and only thing that could have made break down, and I did - big time.Another character that I used to hate is Snape, but now I think I actually love him a little bit. For one, he was bullied - by none other than (view spoiler)[perfect James (hide spoiler)], which explains a lot of things. (I know, there's probably around three people left in the entire world who haven't read this book, but you never know who might come across this.) For two, he's way more complex than he initially seemed. His involvement in the Order left me flabbergasted - not the simple fact that he was a part of it, but the way he acted. He was still an asshole, because that's just who he is, but he was badass too.Mrs Weasley made me so mad with the way she tried to keep our heroes in the dark about what was happening and to control them. She has wonderfully good intentions, I know that, but you can't expect me to tolerate the way she treats these guys. They're fifteen, after all, and they've been through things more dangerous that anything she has ever faced.I also got to hate James a little. Which is something I enjoyed like crazy, since I couldn't believe him as perfect as he was pictured in the first books. He was a conceited, insensitive bully, to put it plain and simple. And even though I would have liked not to like him, I'm still going through that phase where I'm impressed by the cool guy. Lily, on the other hand, was amazing. She actively loathed James, and that made me want to hug her. She's completely different from what I had imagined and I definitely hope we'll get to see more of the young Marauders, Lily and Snape. Yes, him too.Oh, and hey! I was pretty pissed at Dumbledore, too. He's a bit of an idiot, to be honest, but his explanation in the end made everything so much better... and it made me cry so much harder. (Oh, God.) He's finally human now, isn't he? He has feelings and does stupid things. And he's badass, too. I finally got to see him in action!For the first time ever, I felt more than a vague annoyance with Peeves - I actually liked him. Although he shows it in a particular way, he loves the school, guys! He's a brat, but he loves it, and he'd even do what people tell him to protect it.Cho: such a girl. Get a fucking grip, bitch! Though it's good that she managed to put Harry off her, because now he's free to look for someone more worthy of him. (This is half ironic, but not quite. I have a bit of a hero worship thing going on here.)But do you know why I still loved this book so much it hurts? Because all of this stuff up there rings true. Not in the oh-yes-finally-this-character-is-not-that-perfect way, or in the there-need-to-be-villains-in-every-book way (and anyway at least half of the characters I wanted to beat up were not villains); for the simple reason that there are idiots and jackasses everywhere, all the time. They might have good intentions, they might simply be too stupid to understand the consequences of their actions, they might just be cruel, but they're there. I mean, you have no idea of how many people I would love to kill daily.A weird thing: despite the number of ""finally""s and ""for the first time""s that appear here, which hint that I should be satified with this book, I still crave more. Unexpected.---I don't know where to fit this in the text, so I'll leave it down here. (Yes, I still haven't mastered the art of writing a coherent review. If you can call the rants I write reviews.)I have a never-ending and ever-growing admiration for Fred and George, because they're hilarious, brave and (okay, let's see if you can guess this one... [because self-deprecation is the weapon of the incompetent]) badass, but I'm getting more and more curious about Lee.

He may annoy you, but his temperament is the perfect reaction to the ending of Goblet of Fire and to being fifteen in general.

I'm a slow reader, but even for me, an installment of Harry Potter wouldn't take more than two weeks. What then was the problem with this one? The most pressing one was the length. For a book that started so well,  The Order of the Phoenix suffered heavily in the middle with long and tedious chapters. There was no need to drag the story and make it a chore to the readers. And I believe if few chapters were chopped and another few were edited and combined, the book would have done wonders. If truth be admitted, it was the first quarter and the last that were worthy of notice. Not even the excitement brought by Dolores Umbridge was enough to save the middle half of the story which dragged on and on. To add to the misery, Harry's image was thoroughly destroyed in the process. He was portrayed as a wilful child who's given in to whining. This Harry was so inconsistent with the brave, prudent, and caring Harry we've come to know. This Harry irritated me beyond measures, and I lost my sympathy for him. Even in his grief, I couldn't feel much for him. I hope that I'll find the Harry of old days in the next book. Otherwise, continuing with the series is going to be a difficult job. Also, I was quite unhappy with how little was shown of the Order and the activities of its members. After the initial association with them, the readers only meet them at the very end. There were parts I liked, however: Harry's fight with the Dementors, the DA (Dumbledore's Army) Umbridge's defeat, and Dumbledore's duel with Lord Voldemort.

In fact, it was worse because you know you can't do anything, and you're actually expecting the bad things to happen.But the thing is, the first time I read these books, I only liked them; I wasn't attached to neither the story nor the characters - I simply enjoyed them. All that changed with this reread, in which I found myself surprisingly immersed in them and I was a victim of what most book-lovers suffer: Caring about them.Oh yes, Dumbledore is right: Pain makes me human. At least I can say that the fact that I feel hurt after finishing this book is a clear sign of a talented author, since it is so rare that I mourn book characters as if they were real.So what makes this book better than the others? It's mainly the fantastic character development, and of course, the complexity of the storyline, which was now full with politics and many more dark moments.The Boy Who Lived... He has grown a lot, hasn't he? And his sufferings have grown with him too. Now not only are his parents dead, but the one person he cared about the most is too.Which brings me again as to why it was worse knowing it would happen. Because Sirius Black had been one of my favourite characters so far. In fact, it's probable that his death hurt more because I commited a great mistake called ""relating to the characters,"" or better said, ""finding yourself in parts of them.""Yeah, I related to Sirius. His personality is not similar to mine, but the feelings and experiences he underwent in his youth are. And again, there's the fact that he was Harry's last family. Oh no, there we go again...Anyway, the last thing I can say is that at least everything in this series happens for a reason, and not because the author only wants some tears shed. Now I can only prepare myself for the many more depressing deaths (of the rest of my favourite characters *weeps*) that are coming.Off to reread book 6, then!P.S.: I didn't want this review to be ramblings about how sad this book is.

Let's investigate the whys!Length - This is the longest book in the series. I love the Harry Potter series, so I should want more of it, right? I don't know, sometimes a lot is too much. Rowling did her best to pack a lot into this one and it feels too bulgy. If this was carry-on luggage, TSA would make her check it for going over the size limit. Dolores Umbridge - What a great evil character she is, isn't she? Quite the bitch. And the kicker is she's supposed to be on the good side! I like a well-crafted, dual-natured character as much as the next reader, but I do not like when characters are made to be so blind to what's going on that it's beyond belief. Umbridge's absolute unwillingness to believe in the return of Voldemort is trying to say the least. She's Hitler-esque at times. That's fine, a little over the top, but fine. But she cares sooo very much for the Ministry of Magic and Hogwarts, or at least in her position there, that one would expect her to do her due diligence in investigating any threat to her own power and interests.Sirius Black - Now, this one's on me. I LOVE Sirius Black and I really wanted to see the development of a strong bond between he and Harry. Since book three I'd been waiting for some Black/Potter tag team action. I wanted to see them hanging out, doing Uncle/Nephew kind of things. That's not quite how it played out. Oh well... It's nobody's fault but mine that I let this missing aspect get me down. Still, a book review is subjective and so I must admit a personal bias that affected my overall enjoyment.Harry's Yellow Fever - That's so racist! Okay, now that I've got that out of the way... I was disappointed when Harry's love affair with Cho Chang went south. I liked the relationship. It was complicated. It was difficult for him. It could have made for a fine romance. But no, Rowling had other ideas - very British ideas, like ""keeping it in the family"". Frankly, Harry's eventual attachment to Ginny Weasley felt too close.

This is my 2nd time reading the series (I read it for the first time almost exactly a year ago) and I was surprised at how fresh it felt. I wasn't feeling like ""hey I read this before,I know what's going to happen"" , but instead I relived all of the emotions as they were new. - I am not even going to explain how much I hate Umbridge. I know we all do. I will say that it is terrifying though, how much a person with government power can do, and how helpless everybody else can be. Talking about government and politics, I have to say that I love how books grew with the audience. 1st book was quite light and easy to access for the middle grade reader, and now book 5 carries messages that are better understood by an older audience. - The true evil in this book (for me at least) was not Voldemort, but the Ministry. Because wizards are a figment of imagination, but people like Fudge and Umbridge are very much real. - Harry was very hard to read in this book. Because he portrayed every single emotion all of us felt at least once in our life. Jealousy of your friends (that one was so relatable it hurt), betrayal, pain, rage, loss, confusion, guilt and many, many more. - Bullying is always present in J.K. Rowling's books, but in this book it was especially painful. I was ENRAGED to see Hermione (and the whole lot of them) call Luna ""loony"" behind her back.  . I'm pretty sure Hermione went downhill for me from now on - in the books at least. Movie handled it better I think.- When Harry reads the message on the back of the mirror that Sirius gave him...That scene broke the last piece of my heart that was still intact. If only Harry wasn't so proud and stubborn and opened his present from Sirius, he could have contacted him so much easier.

I mean, they're doing spells on animals, which the animals clearly aren't keen on, given how often they try to escape. So.)13/11/2019The Silver Trio are precious and I adore them. Hermione is kind of terrifying tbh. Someone please get Harry some therapy. 28/12/2018I'm bumping it up to 5 stars this time around simply because of how much I love Neville's character development in this book. Also Severus Snape can go die in a fire. Fight me.17/10/2017Sticking with 4.5 stars again. This book really is incredibly long. It takes nearly 200 pages just for them to get back to Hogwarts, and then the last 100 pages or so is at the Ministry. So really, the school year FLIES by simply because so much of the book is dedicated to other things. Minerva McGonagall is the teacher that everyone deserves and I aspire to be like her. Snape is the teacher who deserves to be sacked for child abuse and bullying. Harry really needs to be in therapy holy hell. Umbridge is possibly the character I hate the most out of any fictional character ever. Voldemort is after power and to stand above everyone around him. Umbridge wants control, wants the whole world to conform to her belief system. And that, to me, makes her so much more terrifying. Because people like Umbridge can be found in every parliament, the world over. Also? I have a lot of feelings about Neville. Poor lil squish. 19/12/2016OH HEY LOOK AT ME AND MY MAD SKILLS, FINISHING THIS BOOK EXACTLY A YEAR AFTER I LAST FINISHED IT. Anyway. I'm sticking with a 4.5 star rating for this one, simply because it's SO STINKING LONG and I feel like it doesn't need to be? I think what I love most about this is that this is the book where the Silver Trio really come into their own. There's an obvious friendship between Hermione and Ginny, Neville - as I said this time last year - really demonstrates (particularly at the Ministry) that he could have been the Chosen One had Voldemort decided differently, and Luna is a delightfully quirky gift to the world. Please ignore all of 2012 Kirsti's complaints about Emo!Harry - poor baby clearly has a lot of issues to deal with post Goblet of Fire and insufficient access to mental health services. Instead, he gets Severus Snape, Crappy Teacher and General Asshat, the man whose teaching method is ""I'm not going to tell you anything except ""Clear your mind, now I'm going to attack your brain"" and then I'm going to get mad at you for not trying hard enough when it's all because I gave you shitty directions"". Clearly, 2016 Kirsti has a LOT of feelings about Snape and how terrible a teacher he is. 19/12/20154.5 stars. I know I basically said this last time, but I don't know who I love more in this book - McGonagall for being an extreme sass explosion and general badass, or Neville for finally becoming the wizard he's capable of being. Harry, in contrast, kind of breaks my heart.4/6/2014My God, do I love McGonagall in this book. From ""Have a biscuit, Potter"" to lending Peeves her walking stick to chase Umbridge out of the school, she's fabulous from start to finish. As is Neville, who finally comes into his own and shows throughout that he deserves to be in Gryffindor. He may not be the best wizard in the school, but he tries his hardest at everything, and when the shit hits the fan at the Ministry, he's right by Harry's side the whole time even though he's got a broken nose and no wand. Though he may not be the Chosen One, he shows at the Ministry that he's more than he seems. 28/12/2012Dolores Umbridge is definitely the character that everyone loves to hate. I don't think I've ever met anyone who hasn't expressed a desire to be violent towards her if she were real! That said, I'm not sure that she deserves the fate that she gets. Especially when it comes at the hands of Hermione - girlfriend has a hidden dark streak! As much as I love Dumbledore's Army, Harry's tendency to act before thinking in this book means that it loses a star for me. Plus, Harry spends so much time yelling and moping and generally being a bit emo that I think I love this book more for the secondary characters. I love Fred and George and all the havoc they wreak. I love Professor McGonagall, particularly when she tells Peeves that the chandelier unscrews the other way. I love Neville, and the hidden depths that we start to see here. He's no longer the added source of comedy that he's been for so much of the series up to this point. And I love Luna. She's just fantastic.

143,1221841416,03/08/2015,5.0,"I wasn't so enthusiastic about revisiting The Order of The Phoenix. The water’s run deep in this one and I admit (while dodging flying rotten tomatoes) that this is my least favourite Harry Potter book because SO MANY AWFUL STUFFS happened, and will continue to happen in the later books…This is the mark of a turning point for Harry and his friends. His innocent fascination of the wizarding world is clearly over and the situations he’ll have to face now will be darker and full of losses.With each reread I've come to dread many scenes especially that one death that will always strike me as unfair and unjustified. YES, IT STILL HURTS EVEN AFTER MANY REREADS. For one stupid, stupid moment I even dare to wish that the scene might somehow alter itself magically this time so that, that one death might never happened at all. Dolores Umbridge’s presence throughout the book soured the situations. Everytime she turned up, I’ll find myself wishing for her death or her expulsion. Such a vile old bat, I swear. Hell, I don't know whether to hate her or to admire her sometimes.On the plus side, I notice that some of the side characters have stood up to a bit of their full heights here. Ginny Weasley’s become her own person, and a bit of Neville Longbottom's courage shone through. Also, LUNA LOVEGOOD.

145,2077491708,08/03/2017,5.0,"| |  blog |  tumblr | ko-fi | |Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix repeatedly stomped all over my feelings. “Harry had an unpleasant constricted sensation in his chest; he did not want to say good-bye to Sirius. He had a bad feeling about this parting;”With the exception of Hermione, throughout the course of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix teenage angst and hormones cloud the judgement of our beloved characters. After the traumatic events that marred his fourth year at Hogwarts, Harry has to suffer another miserable summer with the Dursleys...this time round however it's the radio silence from the wizarding world that weighs on Harry's mind. From here onwards Rowling does a fantastic job in describing Harry's ever conflicted feelings. His moodiness, anger, and bitterness are perfectly understandable given his circumstances. No one in the order seems willing to tell him the truth or to put him in the loop of things (he is deemed too young to partake in the order's meetings/missions).Soon his mind is occupied by other things. Hogwarts is no longer a place of comfort (although one could argue that Harry has always been exposed to some danger or other whilst under its roof) as the arrival of the most vile character in this series (spoiler: it is not Voldemort) upends Dumbledore's 'rule'. Dolores Umbridge is the type of character that makes me seethe with anger. Holy-moly, how I hate her. In a certain way she is much worse than Voldemort and his followers as she actually believes she is serving the wizarding community and is willing to do pretty much anything for the so called 'greater good'. Lying beneath her saccharine voice and girlish mannerism is a cruel and sadistic nature. It isn't easy to read of what she does to Hogwarts. Unsurprisingly Harry in particular clashes with her. Yet, Harry already has plenty to keep him occupied. After being publicly dismissed by the ministry, and the many defamatory articles that followed, Harry is considered by many as a persona non grata. He is once again the subject of other students' rumours and ridicules. Add to that the stress of his fifth-year exams and the anguish of an uneasy first-love...and well, Harry can't catch a break.“He was finding it hard at the moment to decide whether he wanted to be with people or not. Whenever he was in company he wanted to get away, and whenever he was alone he wanted to be in company.”Harry also begins to realise that there is no such thing as a perfect role model. Those he looks up to avoid him, misunderstand him, or are too busy with their own worries. Feeling misunderstood and singled-out Harry becomes moodier than ever. Thankfully, his loyal best-friends remain by his side (although this golden trio sure likes to bicker).In spite of its length Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix has an incredibly propelling narrative. There sub-plots and side-plots, all of which are seamlessly woven together. Reading this book feels like riding a rollercoaster. The final section of this novel is not only action-packed but emotionally devastating. The last few chapters are real tearjerkers. By then Harry has experienced such sorrows that one can completely understand why he is so full of rage and sadness.J.K. Rowling once again alleviates the tension by adding humour to her narrative. Occasionally she does so through quirky and visual descriptions (“His gloom seeped through the house, oozing under doorways like some noxious gas”) and other times through her characters (Dumbledore telling Fudge that: “Well—it's just that you seem to be laboring under the delusion that i am going to—what is the phrase? 'Come quietly'.”).This is one of my favourite instalment in the HP series. It isn't easy to read, the narrative doesn't shy away from criticising its characters (from their present behaviour to their past actions) or from showing the devastating consequences of hating those who are different from you.“Indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike.”Read more reviews on my blog / / / View all my reviews on Goodreads",34,-0.9965,0.15,0.793,0.057,0.543437574034589,NEGATIVE,0.9989

. Lupin, Alastor Moody, Nymphadora (hi there), Kingsley Shacklebolt, Elphias Dodge, Dedalus Diggle, Emmeline Vance and Hestia Jones. They are there to take him aways to their headquarters, 
Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place
.That’s Sirius Black's place and in there Harry is reunited with Hermione and the Weasleys.Hermione will explain to Harry what she knows about the Order because she knows always everything. And we learn here than the twins are taking very seriously their new business and have actually pretty useful items as well. Extendable Ears anyone? There’s Weasley gossip too… Bill and Fleur are working together at Gringotts now and Percy is still too focused on his job, but his obsession has been taken to the next level now, making him even avoid his own family, like what is wrong with you?It’s time a new house elf, 
Kreacher
 but he doesn’t seem like to be as friendly as Dobby.Meeting time for the Order now, they talk a little bit of everything and we discover some new things too.But… What’s that thing, the “tapestry Kreacher had been trying to protect”? That’s actually one of my favorite things from the books: 
The Black Family Tree
. We get a little glimpse at Sirius past too and that’s very interesting.
62442
 does that sound familiar? It’s time for the hearing at the Ministry. Special mention here that ALL the floors were actually described with their “roles”.We take a little trip of Arthur’s office as well, we meet his colleague, Perkins and we finally encounter 
The Quibbler
.I know, I know, we nearly passed 100 pages and we are already introduced to that 
Dolores Jean Umbridge
…But thankfully, after what seemed an eternity, Harry actually made it, he was cleared of all charges!Back “at home” now and surprise! The envelopes with the new book list are here PLUS prefect badges! Not for Harry though.. Ron and Hermione were the chosen ones.After the celebration dinner Harry was heading upstairs when he suddenly started to hear some noises…That was actually a very strong scene to watch and read. Molly is struggling with the boggart “haunting” Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place and we have the chance to see her boggart and it’s terrifying…School term is gonna start soon and it’s time once again to go back to Hogwarts. We finally meet 
Luna Lovegood
 during the journey to get to the castle! About time! She actually doesn’t seem to have a nice reputation among students… they call her Loony, we later discover that people hide her stuff, people are so skeptical on The Quibbler…And we learn that Malfoy has been made prefect too.Pay attention here: the carriages TO HARRY seem NOT to be horseless now… We will go back to those winged horses later during Hagrid’s class but so far we know that Harry AND Luna are the only ones among the group of friends that can see these creatures.Feast time, but it’s not too cheerful this time, once the new professor are introduced we learn that Hagrid is momentary absent and Umbridge is the new DATDA teacher… Nice speech you had there Dolores… “It means the Ministry is interfering at Hogwarts” that’s what Hermione said.Fairly slow-paced chapter now, back to study and lessons and it was super fun to read about Hogwarts classes again.Friendly reminder that is 
OWLs year
, so extra homework for those teens. First class with Umbridge and Harry has already lost his temper and he is already in detention lol But he has actually his rights to be angry at Umbridge, it’s pretty easy to think and say very nice things to her… “have a biscuit, Potter” said a wise lady.In the next chapter there’s A LOT going on. Fred and George are all focused on testing their new things, Hermione is knitting house-elves’ hats to free them in honor of SPEW, Ron is miraculously the new Gryffindor keeper and Harry is stuck with Dolores in detention. And what a detention guys, oh boy. “Punishments certainly cannot be adjusted to suit the guilty one’s convenience.”If this is not enough let’s wait to read that super nice and sweet letter that Percy sent to Ron, seriously what’s your problem bro?At least Harry will later have the opportunity to speak to Sirius via fire and have some sense chit chat…Meanwhile Umbridge becomes Hogwarts High Inquisitor and in was actually pretty fun even if terribly mean to read all the possible flaws she can find in a teacher.Special mention here to the grades: O(utstanding), E(exceeded Expectations), A(cceptable), P(oor), D(readful) or T(roll)?In all this mess Hermione actually got an illumination, why don’t we learn to defend ourselves by our own with a competent teacher? That’s actually well asked…Let’s do a meeting about to discuss about this and to recruit some people at the Hog’s Head!Hermione actually did a very good job, she spread the voice pretty well and even she was very surprised when that many people showed up.After everything was settled down everyone decided to sign for this secret association. (But Hermione is no fool so once you signed you had to keep it a secret otherwise, surprise! But we will come back later to that)It’s time to find a place where to hide all of this tho, and here Dobby the house elf has the perfect and coolest place for them, the 
Room of Requirement
, the Come and Go room! That’s my FAVORITE place of all the books.And finally they decided with which name they want to call this society, nice try Cho but Ginny’s idea is way better: 
Dumbledore’s Army
!How fun were those pages, where we read all those spells and practices…Hermione will then reveal the idea she had to make sure everyone will know when a new meeting is about to be set and that’s pure genius there.It’s time for Ron’s first Quidditch match now and things can’t actually get any worse for him… no, wait, actually….“In addition to the usual green and silver scarves and hats, every one of them was wearing a silver badge in the shape of what seemed to be a crown.” - with love, from the Slytherins.Thankfully Luna is there to save the day with her epic hat shaped like a lion.The match was actually pretty hurtful to read but that lyrics are, no matter what, stuck in my head… Of course after the match Malfoy is there to tease Ron but Harry and George completely lost their heads and the only thing that achieved was a life ban from Quidditch from the one and only Dolores Umbridge… well done, guys!At least a happy news now, more or less, Hagrid is back even if not in a very good shape and told the trio everything that happened to him during his absence.He is finally back at the Care of Magical Creatures post BUT Umbridge is just around the corner ready to inspect him and his way of teaching and we know how Hagrid is…First lesson back in action: 
Thestrals
. And finally is explained why actually no one can see these winged horses except for Harry, Luna and Neville.Hermione? Explain please: “The only people who can see Thestrals are people who have seen death.”It’s Christmas Tiiime. “Have a very Harry Christmas”! The banned one got finally replaced and it’s time to one last DA meeting before the holidays.And in here happens… The kiss we were all being waiting for (kinda, not me at least lol). After months of blushing here and there and thinking oh her and blah blah Harry finally kissed Cho!Then situation was pretty awkward if you ask me, she was actually crying her eyes out for Cedric and suddenly their mouths just met, okay. Oh wait, there was mistletoe so…Epic line here, Hermione has as always the perfect words when boys just can’t get it: “Just because you’ve got the emotional range of a teaspoon doesn’t mean we all have.” Oooooh snap, Ron lolAnd from here things get worse and worse… Starting with the super creepy but unfortunately real dream/vision Harry had during a tumultuous night. Arthur Weasley just got injured by a snake.And soon after they are actually heading to 
St Mungos’ Hospital
 to visit Mr Weasley.Another special mention here to the descriptions around St Mungo’s, from how to get there, who works there, the floors guide.The kids though are now starting to question why Arthur got attacked by this snake and is George asking if he was actually attacked because he was guarding the thing that LV is after. And adults are starting too to ask questions on how it was possible that Harry could see all of this and they are worried that LV is actually possessing the boy…Even if Harry is not feeling cheerful at all because he’s thinking that it was actually HIM who attacked Arthur it’s time to celebrate Christmas at Grimmauld Place and to visit again Mr Weasley at St Mungo’s.This time though the trio will encounter two other people they know in there, the one and only Gilderoy Lockhart and their fellow friend Neville. Harry already knows his past and thinking about it it’s very heartbreaking.Back at Grimmauld Place, Harry will have a little talk with Severus Snape, he is there on Dumbledore’s orders, he has the task to teach 
Occlumency
 to Harry, he has to shut his mind basically.We learn here that Harry is very bad at doing this and for Snape is very easy to take a ride in Harry’s memories, but is Harry himself that tells him about the Department of Mysteries' visions…Shortly after there’s a mass breakout from Azkaban and in all this mess Harry actually managed to ask Cho out for Valentine’s Day lolThe famous date is set during their Hogsmeade trip but this went terribly wrong. Cho in here is acts like an infant and I’m so glad that all this romance between the two is officially over, thank you Hermione lolShe has in fact way more important stuff to think of and her geniousness brought her to “collab” even with Rita Skeeter, hey what’s better than a journalist for the most famous newspaper to try to convince people that Harry is telling the truth about LV comeback uh? But there’s Luna too there and her father has a magazine too, and between the two, it is Luna that wins Harry’s interview. And soon after it’s released for real.Meanwhile Harry keeps having those visions and has once again Occlumency lessons with Snape. In here Harry successfully protects himself but he gets a first glimpse at Snape’s memories.Umbridge takes a step (too) forward now. She decides based on what she saw that Professor Tralawney must leave the school for good. In here we see a pretty pissed Dumbledore that immediately takes the situation under control (more or less) and convinces Sybill to stay, because Umbridge has actually no power to decide who has to actually leave the castle. She is going to be replaced though, by Firenze (decided by Dumbledore).Finally during DA lessons they started working on Patronuses, but this is actually going to be their last DA meeting. Umbridge and the the people going under the name “Inquisitorial Squad” found them, with a little help, right Marietta?Cool thing is that Dumbledore tells that it’s Dumbledore’s Army so he organized all of this and tonight was supposed to be their first meeting, yeah… From here he fights with Fudge about the same matters and what an exit, guys, “You know. Minister, I disagree with Dumbledore on many counts… but you cannot den he’s got style…”Good thing is that now 
Umbridge is Headmistress
, yuhu, well no that’s the worst thing that could have happened after Dumbledore leaving the school…In here get a first glimpse of what the Weasley’s twins will be up soon, those fireworks, guys!But Harry has to focus on Snape’s lesson, so back to Occlumency. No, wait… Umbridge requires Snape’s help shortly after lol And it 's not Harry Potter anymore if he is left alone in Snape’s office and after seeing a silver light on a Pensive he just stays away. Nope, that’s Harry, of course he will dive almost immediately into the memory without almost even thinking about the consequences. This is a VERY important moment. We finally learn a lot more of 
Snape’s past
 and how he was doing during school time, not so great friends by the way, poor thing.And boom, present Snape is back in his office and throws at Harry a jar of dead cockroaches… Well that’s not actually so bad, it could have been worse, come on.Before starting the OWLs exams, students are having some chit chat with their teachers to learn which path they will take after school, which job.This chapter is actually pretty interesting and we learn a little bit more of the various possibilities that you can choose.Harry’s first thought though, is about his father. After what he saw in the Pensieve he is not that sure if he see his father like a hero as he used to do… But for that there’s Sirius with all his advices and explanations.Meanwhile the twins give Ron a special appointment: “Gregory the Smarmy’s corridor around about five o’clock tomorrow”.“You think it’s amusing to turn a school corridor into a swamp, do you?”HELL YEAH I’d say lol That exit was EPIC and now let’s all together go to 
number ninety-three, Diagon Alley
 shall we? Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes it’s finally a thing.Back to school activities now, it’s time for another Quidditch Match, but when actually Ron succeeds the other two are in the Forest with Hagrid because he decided that it was time for them to meet his brother 
Grawp
, NOW?Ok, another super cool and slow-paced chapter. It’s examination time. That chapter is one of my favourites ever. We truly follow the exams journey, all the subjects and arguments too. The Astronomy one turn out a little too much animated, there was a series of not too joyful events going on outside…And of course during his last examination Harry has another vision…Harry is super worried now because he saw Sirius being attacked and he feels so powerless right now, he has no idea what to do and his friends are a little reluctant too about all this.But he is the boss there so he begs them to distract Umbridge while he uses her fireplace (which is the only one not watched) to see if he is at Grimmauld Place safe or if the vision might be actual true.Of course he is busted and with him all his friends an together they have to deal with Umbridge and the Slytherins. Snape is there too and Harry sends him a cryptic (but not so cryptic for him) message: “He’s got Padfoot at the place where it’s hidden!”.Meanwhile genius Hermione finds a way to have Umbridge’s attention revealing that they were trying to speak to Dumbledore because the secret weapon in finally ready. Where is it found? In the Forbidden Forest and so all together they went. But that’s home of the centaurs too and we know that they are not that friendly, especially after they were insulted by Dolores. She is in fact finally taken away by them, only problem is that the centaurs are angry with the other two too, thank goodness Grawp is there ready to save his Hermy.Now Harry, Hermione and Ron are reunited with some allies too, Ginny, Neville and Luna are there to help and together they fly on thestrals to the Department of Mysteries.It took them a while in there to finally find something curious and extremely valuable “It’s - it’s got your name on”, yes, Ron found THE 
prophecy
.This is the beginning of an epic battle between Death Eaters and students, later helped by the Order of the Phoenix.But we have to focus mainly of the duel 
Sirius vs Bellatrix
. One of the most iconic scenes in here at least for me. Everything happens in a blink of a eye, you seriously don’t even realize what’s going to happened.“The second jet of flight hit him squarely on the chest.It seemed to take Sirius an age to fall: his body curved in a graceful arc as he sank backwards through the ragged veil hanging from the arch.”I will never forget how in next chapter I could feel all Harry’s feeling, it was like a bomb thrown at this boy, and his instinct tells him to immediately go after the killer, Bellatrix and experiment with her favorite spell, crucio, LV has appeared meanwhile…Dumbledore finally arrives too to save the situation, at least what it’s possible. Another epic battle here between LV and the Headmaster.And of course in the end everyone at the Ministry decided to show up, Fudge included and finally believes in what’s has been told to him for a year now.Back in the castle now, Harry is in Dumbledore’s office and he is soo pissed and angry. He has a mess of emotions but can you blame him? The prophecy got smashed, LV is after him like a crazy psycho, Bella just killed his only remaining family member… Just give him a break…Fortunately Dumbledore has always the right words and even in this case, taking things way slower, he is able to talk to Harry about a ton of important and fatal things here.“Harry, I own you an explanation, an explanation of an old man’s mistake.”This chapter is probably the most important out of the all book. In here the Headmaster tell Harry the prophecy made by the one and only Sybill, and we finally know why LV is after this kid and especially that 

“neither can live while the other survives…”

Hey that’s A LOT to handle for a 15 year old teen, after everything he has already been through, especially during that same day.After the official announcement of the Dark Lord’s comeback, time will even darker and darker and people are most frightened than ever.Another school year has ended, everyone is heading home, not in a cheerful way because they know that next year will be even worse, and we know that too.Last but least, Ron spoils us with a little touch of Ginny + Harry ship… _As final thoughts I think the beginning is pretty “slow-paced” compared to the others. There are still so many events but it could have been cut a little, my personal opinion.This doesn’t discredit the book that is probably the most important of the series. We finally have the big reveal and separates the series between before LV official return and after. We see even more characters’ development in here, the emotions felt by this kids are very on focus as well as the plot development. Every time something new is added, new hints are left here and there but at the same time the main storyline keeps growing bigger and bigger every time.",33,0.999,0.098,0.772,0.13,0.5409750219106045,NEGATIVE,0.9984
148,2069437060,07/23/2017,5.0," Re-read Again  Re-read Again  When I am lost, I read these books to find my way back to myself <3  Re-read 09/23/18   ""After all this time? Always.""  No matter what, I always find myself returning to these books. Nostalgia can be such a powerful emotion, and as an adult, I appreciate the intricacies of this series so much more. Lately, I have been listening to these books before going to bed. And I would say this audiobook is the equivalent of melatonin for me. Nothing helps my racing thoughts and insomnia better than a trip to Hogwarts.  Re-read 06/18/18  of course! As usual, this book was a pleasure to read, and I can't judge it through a critical lens because of how much it means to me. I love the characters - especially Hermione who will always be my home girl - and the story. In my opinion, reading Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the equivalent of going on a free vacation.  Previous Review 2017: Oh...my...gosh! I finally finished reading this book and it definitely took me a lot longer than I expected. I think the audiobook for this was approximately 27 hours long, but nonetheless, I'm so glad I got through it because this book was amazing! Reading this was completely worth being put behind my reading goal for 2017. Of course, I expected no less from Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. ""Hogwarts will always be there to welcome you home.""  The quote above resonates with me and it was something JK Rowling said during the premiere of the last Harry Potter movie. No matter how much my life changes, I'm honored that this series will always contain a part of my childhood. I know I'm getting sentimental, but it has been 10 years since I first read this book... Even saying that makes me feel nostalgic. Re-reading this series makes me understand how much I've matured as a person. When I read this book as a child, I enjoyed the way it was written. JK Rowling is the queen of foreshadowing - she hints at crucial events throughout the book, but only reveals them when the time is right. It helps the books feel organic and satisfying as opposed to forced. As a child, although I appreciated the writing style of this book, I did not care much for the subject matter. I was too busy feeling angry with Harry for the way he kept treating the people who were trying to help him. But I reckon I was too immature at the age of 11 to really appreciate this book. Now that I know what being a teenager is like, I can relate to the anguish, confusion and darkness Harry feels. I also understand that life is imperfect and not everything ends happily. THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS 1) Wizards are not immune from mental illness.  Obviously, as someone studying to become a mental health professional, I had to talk about this. Although this book does not explicitly talk about mental illness, I'm grateful the author described the pain the characters are experiencing in vivid detail. I'm positive Harry experienced some PTSD symptoms after the ordeal he underwent in his 4th year - as is evident in the nightmares he experiences upon returning to Privet Drive. Reading this passage made me wonder if Hogwarts has a counselor for the students? I guess the school nurse and Head of House are responsible for managing the emotional wellbeing of the students. Upon returning to school, not only does Harry have to cope with trauma, but also anxiety about taking his final exams. As a student, I found the stress the fifth years experience about taking their O.W.Ls to be relatable. Some of the students even experienced panic attacks and nervous breakdowns. There was a passage where Hannah Abbot contemplated dropping out of Hogwarts and Madam Pomfrey administered her a calming draught potion (maybe this is the magical equivalent of benzodiazepine?). I might be the biggest nerd alive, but reading about the characters prepare for their exams was my favourite part of the book because it inspires me to study. Another character that made me think about mental illness in the Wizarding World was Sirius Black. He lacks maturity and sometimes treats Harry like a brother as opposed to a Godchild. He misses James and it makes sense that he sees so much of his old best friend in Harry. Despite meaning well, his recklessness makes me think spending so many years in Azkaban impacted his psychological development. 2) Seeing Ron and Hermione grow up was delightful. I have always admired Ron, but I loved his character in this book! He experienced so much growth and had the opportunity to establish his individuality. In the previous books, Ron always feels overshadowed by his older brothers and best friend. But by making Ron a prefect, I think Dumbledore enables him to discover who he is. He even tries out for the Gryffindor Qudditch team team and slowly becomes a successful keeper. Hermione was a total badass in this book (as usual)! I was completely blown away by her wit and knowledge in this book. She also remains a progressive voice (although if knitting clothes for unexpected house elves to pick up is a good idea remains controversial) in the story and sheds light on the inequalities in the Wizarding World. As she grows older, she even becomes more lenient about breaking rules as long as it is for good and not just to create mischief. Reading about the lengths Harry's friends go to stand by his side is admirable. Even when the whole world regard him as a fool, his friends take his side and in doing so they isolate themselves from others. His friends risk being expelled and also their lives to stay loyal to Harry.  3) We need to think critically about mass media. At only 14-years-old, Harry has to put up with the whole world thinking he is making up the return of Voldemort. Imagine telling the truth, but having everybody think you are lying. It sounds like a terrible ordeal to go through. Moreover, Harry has to deal with people assassinating his character and portraying him as a mad man in the Daily Prophet. The only newspaper that is willing to publish his story is the Quibbler, which is a news outlet that is frowned upon in the magical community. I think this book helps readers understand the importance of thinking analytically about our media and looking at multiple resources before drawing any conclusions. Reading this book also made me understand the strength and resiliency Harry has to keep telling the truth about what happened to him.  4) Dumbledore is only human.  Dumbledore has always been an all-knowing, wise and impeccable character. He is the one the others characters count on for guidance and reassurance. However, this book enabled readers to see the more human side of Dumbledore. He acknowledged he made mistakes and I think this plays a valuable role in his character development. It helps me as a reader understand that nobody is perfect, not even Albus Dumbledore.  5) Not all villains wear masks.  How could I end this review without talking about Dolores Umbridge? I try to be civil and see the best in people, but she was just horrible in this book. There was a part in this book where Sirius claimed not all bad people are death eaters and Umbridge is the greatest example of that. JK Rowling created a fantastic villain who readers despise just as much as Voldemort. What makes Umbridge scary is that she represents the evil that exists in our everyday lives. Umbridge is your everyday asshole boss, co-worker, politician or teacher. Although the majority of people despise her, it can be difficult to overrule somebody who has so much social power.  6) Neville and Luna are too adorable for words  Out of all the characters in the book, I feel like I can relate the most to Neville and Luna. When I was in middle school, I was a really awkward teenager and had few friends who understood me. Similar to Neville and Luna, I coped with bullying and being misunderstood. It makes me have a soft spot in my heart for these characters. Reading this book made me want to reach out and give Neville a hug. He has an innocent, gentle and admirable character. As I read the passage about his parents being driven to madness, I felt empathy for Neville. I think the Battle in the Department of Mysteries proves Neville is one brave Gryffindor. This is the first time Luna is introduced and I completely understand why so many readers fell in love with her. Her quirky, witty and amusing character adds a lot to the story line. Despite the bullies, Luna never budges and remains faithful to her beliefs, which I found admirable. Ah! So I had the opportunity to complete yet another year at Hogwarts! :)This book review contains a huge babbling of information, but I just wanted to express my full opinion of this book.

150,1824510976,01/02/2017,5.0,"Moving along in my Harry Potter re-readathon, I was super excited to start Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix! I listened to the audiobook for Order of the Phoenix in the past, but unfortunately, I don't remember much from it. But I'm ok with that, because it's almost like getting to read the series from the beginning again!Harry Potter continues to amaze me more and more as this series goes along. As do Ron and Hermione. I was not nearly as clever as these kids were when I was their age, and there's no way I could have made it through some of the things they went through. But their friendship is everything, and I'm so glad that they have each other.I love seeing my favorite characters from the past return in this story. Professor Mcgonagall, Hagrid, and Dumbledore will forever be some of my favorite characters, and I especially enjoyed seeing Siruis and Lupin again as well. And like with most books in the series, in Order of the Phoenix, we are introduced to a lot of interesting new characters. I absolutely adore Luna Lovegood, Tonks and Grawp. They are all awesome. There is, however, one character in this story, who I know you'll know who I'm talking about before I even say the name, that made me rage so many times!! I don't think I've EVER hated a character so much as I hated Delores Umbridge. Oh my, this woman was pure evil, and I can totally see why so many people hate her.The storyline for this book felt a lot darker than any of the previous books, and to be honest, it was hard to read at times. So much anger in so many people. Which, of course, was completely justifiable. I was SO angry as well. I did love that we got some answers along with the story, and a lot of things are starting to make better sense now. Can I also add that this book was massive? Coming in at 800+ pages, I was really worried that it was going to take a while to read, but I managed to read the bulk of it in one weekend, and I'm surprised that the time flew by so quickly while I was reading!Overall; I didn't remember much from when I read Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix the first time, so rereading this book was a great refresher. I'm enjoying this series so much, and I really can't wait to get started on Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, which I have NOT read before!Happy Reading!

“Is it true that you shouted at Professor Umbridge?""""Yes.""""You called her a liar?""""Yes.""""You told her He Who Must Not Be Named is back?""""Yes.""""Have a biscuit, Potter.”
I had finished this book yesterday night, tears rolling down my face. I am just not sure how I managed to get through that ending and read it till the end. I feel so heartbroken. My favourite book from Harry Potter is Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban for all the obvious reasons so that ending literally shredded my heart into pieces. Also, Umbridge can rot in hell. This is a SAD book but antics of the twins and the witty banter stopped the book from getting too depressing. I also loved how much character this book gave to Ginny Weasley. As always, one of the many reasons I go back to a HP book is for Dumbledore's lessons.

152,177283872,06/16/2011,4.0,"I am so thankful that I revisited this book again after so long away. When I originally read this instalment of the Harry Potter series, I gave it 3 stars, and now on a re-read I'm seeing it in a new light and it's up to a 4. Who knows, will it be a 5 on another re-read? We'll see!The things that annoyed me so much the first time around (namely Harry's teenage angst) actually seemed a lot more understandable and relatable at the age I am now, as opposed to the very early teens that I was upon publication. In fact, it was interesting to read this book at the age of 27 and feel more critical of some of the adult characters that I know and love so much (namely Sirius and Molly). They made decisions and said things that I 100% did not agree with and actually made me quite critical of their characters, but it just allowed me to appreciate the writing and construction of the characters more.Dolores Umbridge is still in my eyes 100% the most evil thing about this book series - screw Voldemort, this woman is the devil! I absolutely loved (and hated) reading her character again, because I could live vicariously through the DA.Overall this was so much fun, and I'm so glad I finally got around to re-reading this one as I've put it off for more than 10 years.

Harry Potter and the Sacred Text Podcast
 and I am loving it. I cannot believe how Vanessa, Casper, Arianna and all their (live) show guests broadened my understanding of the HP world. It helps me to internalize that HP is so much more than a children's fiction. It is a tool in the form of fantasy writing that helps me make sense of the real world.It has literally taught me to be more compassionate with others. Sadly, just like my mum, I used to be a very hard and judging character, being led by my bitterness instead of my happiness. Finding something good to say even about the characters I despise (ya'll konw it: Umbridge and - sometimes - the Dursleys are at the top of that list). I am here to review the book and not the Podcast, but I really encourage all of you to go and find Harry Potter and the Sacred Text Podacast wherever you listen to podcasts.

This book is for you if…you enjoyed the previous HP books and are fan of fantastic tales of young teenagers that have ten times as much balls as any grown up I've ever met.
➺What's happening.This book begins with something spectacular, something people who've only heard about the weather in Great Britain probably have a heart time believing: a draught. With nothing to occupy himself, Harry can do nothing but stroll along dried out meadows and sweat while reliving the events of the past school year: Voldemort has returned and the GB Ministry of Magic is in denial. Reading the newspapers is frustrating: The Daily Prophet does nothing but tell lies about how Harry is a wild wacker, and Lord V seems to lie low as no dark headlines make it into the papers.May this be evidence of the ministry's incapacity, it is still shocking news to Harry that he encounters two dementors in this little town of his. He barely manages to save Dudley and himself from them - with the unexpected aid of one utterly adorable Mrs Fick. One might think congratulations are in order - the Ministry of Magic begs to differ. Instead, Harry now faces expulsion, the destruction of his wand included.And as if this wasn't troublesome enough, his friends seem to have forgotten about him altogether. They weren't very chatty in any of their letters. This emotional baggage combined with the looming expulsion makes Harry snap, and we finally meet who we all came to love so dearly in this book ALL-CAPS-HARRY. As some members of the Order of the Phoenix - an order formed by our dear Albus Dumbledore that already existed back when Lord V was in power the first time - pick him up from the Dursley's and take him to live with the rest of the order, the Weasleys and Sirius for the rest of the summer, Harry's joy only lasts so long. He lashes out at everyone who looks at him sideways, forgetting who the real enemy is and what the motives for the secrecy that left him in the dark are.I think I'm kidding myself if I stop now and don't give more of my view on the plot because I don't wanna spoil anything for the readers. At this point, I feel like SO MANY people have read HP multiple times already. Potterheads are everywhere. And I'm loving it. If you're not a Potterhead because you've never tried, I really recommend doing so. If you're not a Potterhead because you've tried and didn't like the books, SCREW YOU, YOU UNCULTURED SW- just kidding :). Remember, Harry Potter and the Sacred Text Podacast tought me a great deal about how to be a proper human. I understand. I really don't. People still gawk at me for not enjoying Star Wars, but I just don't get the hype around it.P.S.: Goodreads says I've read this two times now, but I swear to you, all my fingers are not enough to count the times I've listened to the German audiobooks - read by the fabulous Rufus Beck, a magician in his own special way.___________________

156,2958488370,09/06/2019,4.0,"The Empire Strikes Back of the Harry Potter books.While there are many and sundry thematic differences between the two works, what drew me to make this comparison is the inclusion of heavy emotions and the overall dark and brooding nature of the story.First published in 2003, and after the blockbuster success of the 2001 film starring Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson, this is the longest Potter book at 870 pages. It is also the darkest up to this point in the storyline.No doubt author JK Rowling had been increasing the maturity and depth of the narratives as the main characters grew older and progressed in their Hogwarts career, and subsequently the distance from the original YA settings.But Order of the Phoenix is YA only in that it involves teenagers in school.Rowling has in her previous books made a premium of dialogue and characterization but here she really takes off. Fans of the series will know the catalogue of colorful characters but in this fifth book Rowling opens up a depth and complexity of the characters that we have not seen yet and existing players are provided an additional well of experiences and emotions to more fully develop them within the world building (which is also extensively expanded).As in the previous books, the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor is a show stealer and that trend may have reached its zenith with Dolores Umbridge (played so well by Imelda Staunton in the 2007 film). Her villainy is made all the worst by its insidiousness, she rivals The Dark Lord himself for an antagonist we can all loath.Another excellent Harry Potter book and I’m off to read the next.

It's pretty normal for me to finish a book this size in a week or so, but, this one has took me over a month to consume. If there are any hard-core Potter fans here, you may not want to read this review, as it seems that for this book, that I'm in the minority.First of all, I'll begin by saying, that I do like this series, and I can totally appreciate why Rowlings incredible creation has captured the imaginations and hearts of so many, but this book didn't work well enough for me. My first problem was the size of this book. I mean, really? Does it seriously need to be this long, when I could easily pick out parts in the book that didn't have to be in there? That's about 100 pages shorter already! My favourite characters are Dumbledore and Snape. However, in the book Dumbledore comes across as being completely laid back, and even though all hell is breaking loose, he's happily sitting back in his chair... Until the last minute. The actual end scenes were the best part about this book. They were thrilling and I was almost on the edge of my seat. Unfortunately, there were only about 40 pages of these thrilling scenes. Yes, there are positives! I love the intricate world building that Rowling manages to do. It's always done in amazing detail, and it makes you want to physically be at Hogwarts. I also hold a great appreciation for Neville. He really develops in this book, and his true colours are really beginning to shine through. I love the whole concept of Hogwarts. The magic, the quiditch games, the dragons, the great hall, the characters, the spells, but, most of all, I love how Rowling has this ability to take us to Hogwarts, when really, we're just sitting on our sofa, with a cup of coffee.

The format of this book, book 4 in the Potter series and the Cuckoos Calling series are the same, it's a long slog of page after page after page of not much and then bang, the ending is enough to make you want to read the next book. Theres nothing wrong with this format in a 500 page book but when its 800 pages its tiring. There are some things I loved about this book which made the 800 pages easier to get through though. Arthur Weasley's love of muggles is the best character trait ever, him and Harry on the London Underground was the best ever. The fact that my master of chaos Peeves teamed up with the Weasley twins was also a massive highlight, those scenes were awesome. I also am loving that Hermione is really starting to shine beyond Harry as the problem solver, this does make up for the lack of representation and diversity in the main characters. The one thing I have in common with Harry right now is not being about to speak about Sirius. I do hold Harry responsible for this but as hes buckling under the guilt theres no need for me, as an adult, to rub salt in his wounds. Rowling is clearly very good at wrapping up a book. Seeing as book 6 is a reasonable size for her level of content and that this book ended on such a high, I shall look forward to seeing where this plot line goes. 4 wands for our Hermione, Peeves, Arthur and the future of the joke shop!",34,0.9927,0.052,0.771,0.177,0.4935619047619047,NEGATIVE,0.8886

When you consider his life and experiences up to this point, it is amazing that he hadn’t ‘lost’ it before!Rowling took a lot of the usual elements away in this instalment. Dumbledore and Hagrid are ‘absent’ for most of the book, leaving Harry alone/isolated to deal with difficult situations and feelings, which I guess is a part of growing up. Additionally, the Hogwarts Headmaster is shown to be ‘human’ after all and not an infallible person. Things aren't black or white, but various shades of grey, and what Harry took for granted is again and again shown not to be so.It was inevitable that the tone of this book would be darker and more threatening now that Voldemort is back, but the creation of the odious Dolores Umbridge was a stroke of genius, especially with her toad-like girlish appearance. I still shiver at the sight of pink kittens plates… Luna is a lovely addition and Neville is finally showing his inner worth.For the longest book of the series, it does read very quickly :0)",32,0.7186,0.045,0.875,0.081,0.5225,POSITIVE,0.9417

“We've all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to act on. That's who we really are.”

I love, love Harry Potter books but boy, I had such a hard time with this one. It took me almost a month to finish Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix and that's a lot for me. I usually have a problem with the long and slow start of HP books and it takes me a little bit longer to get into the story, but this book got me from the first page. However - approx. 150 pages later - I kind of lost interest. For two weeks I couldn't bring myself to pick this book and read. I don't know why, but then - determined to finish it - I couldn't stop reading. There was something happening on every page!Fun fact: the best place for me to read this book was in a cafe. I spent so much time in one cafe house that the waiting staff knows me by my name already. Some thoughts:- Dolores Umbridge is a perfect example of a villain. She is probably the best written villain ever. - Minerva McGonagall is my hero!

“Potter,” she said in ringing tones, “I will assist you to become an Auror if it is the last thing I do! If I have to coach you nightly I will make sure you achieve the required results!”

- There was finally more of Hermione! I liked that she stepped out of her comfort zone so she could help Harry. GO, HERMIONE!- Everytime when Hermione snapped at Ron because he jerked when someone said Voldemort's name, I laughed!- Let's not forget Fred and George's legendary leaving.- I loved how the whole school united against Umbridge. #goal

“Umbridge only had to enter her classroom for the students assembled there to faint, vomit, develop dangerous fevers, or else spout blood from both nostrils.”

- Cho. Weepy Cho. I don't blame Harry when he snapped at her. - Harry would deserve a slap for his behaviour. It was so unfair how he treated with Ron and Hermione and vented his anger on them.- I wish Lee Jordan commentate all sport events!

“And it’s Johnson, Johnson with the Quaffle, what a player that girl is, I’ve been saying it for years but she still won’t go out with me —''JORDAN!' yelled Professor McGonagall.'Just a fun fact, Professor, adds a bit of interest —” 

- THAT BITCH BELLATRIX! THAT. BITCH.Well, I am looking forward to continue with Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince but I need to wait for my mum to send me the book, so it can take a while. Mum, hurry up!",31,0.9882,0.088,0.754,0.159,0.5206228956228957,NEGATIVE,0.9997

The Ministry!) and the expansion of characters old and new. I really want to work in the department of mysteries. We finally see Neville come into his own too. That scene where we meet his parents still makes me cry. Also, this is where Luna is introduced. Not biased or anything, but surely she's the most underrated of the DAs? I love her.

Gathering his army of Death Eaters, releasing dark wizards from their cells in Azkaban, regaining influence over the Dementors, unleashing despair, discord and darkness all around. Harry and Dumbledore want to spread the news of Voldemort's return so they can gather support and plan a counterattack, but the grimy tactics used by the Ministry of Magic to slander their efforts so they can keep themselves in power throws a wrench in the equation. To undermine Dumbledore, the Ministry of Magic employs the delightfully dreadful Dolores Umbridge to dismantle Hogwarts from the inside. With Dolores spreading harmful misinformation, humiliating the teachers, torturing the students and destroying any chance of being able to stand up to Voldemort out of pure ignorance and selfishness, Harry and his friends take matters into their own hands by gathering a rebellious group of young wizards and teaching them all they need to know about defense against the dark arts. Illegally training a private pack of young wizards, dealing with puberty, awkward romance, excessive teen angst, standing up to the corrupt officials running the Ministry of Magic and taking a stand against Voldemort's wicked supporters, Harry has more on his plate than ever before.Order of the Phoenix is a rollercoaster of emotions, mostly negative but in a good way. For example, the main characters got on my nerves more than they ever have. Harry, Ron, Sirius, Hagrid, Snape, Dumbledore and even some of the new characters were painfully selfish and pigheaded at times, yet their reactions to their circumstances were often so realistic and believable that I never viewed them in a way that I felt was poorly written. Rowling does a great job of portraying just how frustratingly self-centered, illogical, petty and obnoxious teens can be at the height of their angst. There were times where Harry was so passive-aggressive, short-tempered and petty that I wanted to slap him silly, but at the same time I perfectly understood his feelings and never blamed him for reacting how he did.Rowling also does a good job of portraying the ignorance, entitlement, close-mindedness and pretentiousness that many adults exhibit as well. Dumbledore makes many mistakes and is often too forgiving for his own good. Snape is a childish jerk that's unjustifiably cruel and unfair, yet his feelings and actions are understandable when you learn the context of his horrific upbringing. Sirius has a lovable rockstar attitude but is sometimes reckless and causes trouble for others. Even Hagrid who normally comes off as a lovable guy is hard to make excuses for this time around because his bad habit of endangering peoples lives with good intentions just keeps getting worse and worse (still love his character though). Then there's Umbridge, the excruciating queen of sass who acts like an amalgamation of every evil school teacher and politician stereotype you can imagine. The teens and adults were equally frustrating, but their character development throughout the story is better than it's ever been.I especially enjoyed the much-desired development of the more minor characters such as Neville. Neville went from being a forgettable side character to being a respectable secondary protagonist with a tragic backstory and an awesome turnaround as he joins Harry in his fight against Voldemort to avenge his parents against Voldemort's most loyal servant Bellatrix. Ginny gets much more personality other than just being known as ""the girl who has a crush on Harry."" Luna Lovegood is a fun and quirky new character who brings out the best in the others. We get more context about Sirius's dark family history as well as Snape's upsetting background. Hermione is as reliable as ever. Even the comic relief characters Fred and George had quite a few badass moments and I often found their chaotically carefree attitudes endearing.Similar to Goblet of Fire, I really didn't appreciate the mistreatment of Hermione from Harry and Ron once again. They continue to take her for granted, disrespect her and make unnecessary passive-aggressive remarks about her in spite of her constant support. She's a great character, a loyal friend and always has everyone's best interests in mind, but no one seems to give her the respect or affection she deserves. I also felt like Luna suffered similar undeserved treatment this time around. They both deserve better.I did have my gripes here and there, but most were justified and understandable in the context of the plot. The final quarter of the book really escalated things to new heights. A huge climactic battle between Harry's new crew and the Death Eaters, the sudden death of one of the best characters, a heart-wrenching confession from Dumbledore, as well as the foreboding sense that things are bound to get much worse before they get better. Overall, I felt the character work was fantastic and I loved the development of all the side characters. Neville was really the star of the show this time, he had the most triumphant and sympathetic moments.Though he annoyed me for much of the book, Harry himself also got some good development. He realizes that his role models aren't as perfect as he once thought after learning about the questionable choices of Dumbledore, Sirius and his father James. His mess of a relationship with Cho teaching him about romance, respect and empathy. Taking on the role of a teacher and leading a group of rebel wizards around also gave him an opportunity to prove his worth as the lead hero.",27,0.9742,0.181,0.626,0.193,0.5857172643869892,NEGATIVE,0.8808
179,18131947,03/19/2008,5.0,"Well, I know that for the last three books the story of how I read them has been less than epic but fear not, the story picks up a bit from here. Summer 2003 came along, I had just graduated from college and I was anxiously awaiting the release of the fifth Harry Potter book. I was so anxious in fact that I actually fell for and spread around the story that volume 5 would be called “Harry Potter and The Green Flamed Torch.” Not one of my prouder moments. As soon as the book became available for preorder I went to my college computer lab (which I mysteriously still had access to) and ordered my copy online. Unfortunately, I failed to order it from an online store that would deliver it on the day it came out. It would be shipped on the day it came out. As it turned out, my brother got married the weekend of the book’s release. The wedding was on Friday and the book came out on Saturday. Saturday morning my sister, brother-in-law, my niece and I all got in their car and started heading home. We pulled off the highway into the first major town we could find and started driving around looking for a Walmart® so they could get their copies of the book. Finally, we spotted one and my sister and I started cheering like crazy people. My 1-½ year old niece stared at us with a very confused look on her face as she wondered what in the world Crazy Uncle Ryan and mommy were doing. My sister and her husband both bought copies of the book and we started back out on the road. As we drove we took turns reading out loud and as Harry was sitting with Luna and Neville on the Hogwarts’ Express we pulled into my apartment complex. They left me there and I was stuck without a book. I watched countless friends reading the book over the next few days. I expressly forbad them from telling me anything about what happened as I checked the mail every single day wondering when my copy would actually arrive. During that wait a nice girl I knew let me borrow her copy one evening as she told me she was not going to read any more that night. I ran back to my apartment with the book under my arm cackling fiendishly and I read as much as I could knowing that I would have to return the book the next day. All in all, I ended up using three or four different copies before I finished reading this book. I then didn’t see it for at least a month as I loaned it out to several friends to read.There were several times during this book that I get really frustrated with Harry. These times involve him loosing his temper with Umbridge. So many times I just found myself shouting at the book telling Harry to control his temper and not yell at her again. That woman is the DEVIL! I can’t think of any character in the whole series that I dislike more than her and I include Voldemort in that. It’s no wonder that Rowling named her Dolores Umbridge. The name “Dolores” comes from the Latin word for pain. “Umbrage” (yes, Rowling changed the spelling for the name) means “anger or resentment caused by some real or imagined wrong.” That certainly describes her attitude and outlook accurately. “Umbrage” can also mean a shadow. She certainly is a dark presence that seems to brood over people.This book also contains what I think are the two most powerful and moving scenes in the series. Neither of which, incidentally, made it into the movie version. The first of these is the scene in St. Mungo’s where we see Neville visiting his parents. That scene along with the battle in the Department of Mysteries should leave no doubt in any reader’s mind that, in spite of the fact that he is rather clumsy and awkward, Neville is extremely brave and absolutely belongs in Gryffindor. The second is the scene at the end after Sirius’ death when Harry rages at Dumbledore and their subsequent conversation. You finally see all the anger and sadness that had been building up inside Harry since the end of book 4 come out and we all FINALLY get the answer we had been waiting for so long as to why Voldemort came after Harry in the first place. That’s a very good scene.Of course, one of the coolest parts in this book, if not in the whole series, is the wizard’s duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort. I love how Dumbledore is dueling the most feared dark wizard ever and keeps calling him Tom and speaking to him as though he we still his teacher and Voldemort is nothing more than a misbehaving student. That and the scene where Dumbledore tells Fudge that he has no intentions of going to Azkaban and than proceeds to knock out everyone is his office and disappears with Fawkes in a flash of fire just make you realize that Dumbledore is the most awesome wizard ever.",27,-0.9946,0.12,0.817,0.063,0.4747125850340134,NEGATIVE,0.9924

Harry's understandably more hot tempered than before as what he's been through would change anyone. There were also many very hilarious moments that brought tears into my eyes.

186,1890412659,02/12/2017,5.0,"This book is amazing. It's so lovely to be back at Hogwarts. Nonetheless, this book takes a dark turn and we see the political struggle and denials that anything bad could happen. It also contains the most horrific, frustrating, hated character ever, so at times I was raging. This book really does put you through many emotions. Happiness, anger, sadness, joy and humor. And as is tradition with this series now, here is my rambling notes from along the way...• Fun fact, the heatwave at the start of this book did actually happen in 2003, the year this book was written. It was the hottest recorded summer, until this year.• It must have been so hard for Harry to go back to the muggle world after the end of last year. He was completely cut off and so worried. Anything could have happened, bless him.• I don't know why but I've always read Little Whinging as Little Whining. Either way it's a horrible name• Wow Harry, dont give anyone else credit for ever helping you in the past. Just act like it's all you and not Hermione saving your but.• Percy reaches peak awful in this book• I don't particularly like Dumbledore in this book either. I think he goes about things the wrong way• Oh but I do love Sirius Black• Mrs Weasley saying Harry is as good as her son is so sweet.• I love that everyone is so protective of Harry. Molly, Lupin and Sirius as a trio would make good parents to him.• I like that Sirius and Lupin are the ones that call Voldemort by his name. Its almost as a defiance against him since he killed their best friend. Damn I really want a Maurauders spin off• They found in Grimauld Place 'a heavy locket that none of them could open.' If only they knew then what that would come to mean• 'Snape might refer to their work as cleaning' - What's snape got to do with the cleaning, should this be Sirius? Is this a mistake?• Tonks is as clumsy as me, I can relate.• Why is Mr Weasley so adamant that Harry can't apparate to the Ministry but then he's able to apparate with Dumbledore next year• Imagine going to face the wizengamot, age 15, all by yourself. 50 adult wizards all looking down on you like you were the worst person in the world. It must have been horrifying for Harry.• Dumbledore should be a lawyer• I may not 100% agree with Dumbledore's methods but I would definitely want him on my side• Mrs Weasley about Ron's prefect badge, 'that's everyone in the family' 'What are Fred and I, next door neighbours?' I love Fred and George• Does Ginny get to be a prefect? I don't remember. We'll find out in the next book.• I don't know if I would have wanted to be a prefect. Showing round and helping first years I would do, but not telling off other students, I'd just feel like a hypocrite. No one likes students who do that sort of thing. I do like bending rules and sneakily finding loopholes in things so I would have hated if students called me out on things teachers ignored. I was the sort of student that would be thought of as the 'model' student because I always got good grades but really I was just sneakily getting away with things or thinking of good excuses. • Did they really not get their school books lists until the last day of term because that's terrible for people who live no where near Diagon alley. As someone who doesnt live anywhere near London, I always pick up things like this. Some people would have to plan their travel. Especially those in Ireland.• Did Mad Eye Moody see the Boggart in it's true form or did it know he was looking at it? Is it still the form of the last person who saw it?• Oh my I hate Umbridge.• As much as Umbridge is wrong and needs someone to bring her down, Harry just stop talking.• 'Have a biscuit Potter' - Iconic• I'm like Hermione in many ways but I like to think I'm not as much of a a spoil sport as her. I love Fred and George and their mischief so I definitely wouldn't be threatening to stop them. • Also who were prefects last year, did they ever do anything?• All the teachers lecturing them about O.W.Ls on the first lesson is literally year 11.• Why did Harry not become the DADA teacher after school? He's literally the perfect guy for the job• Why do they need to learn how to vanish mice and kittens? So they can buy a sneaky pet and hide it from their parents? Though you learn a lot of useless stuff in muggle school so I guess this is more fun useless stuff• Why is Susan Bones just described before her name is revealed later. Harry has known her from 4 years now, she shouldn't have to introduce herself surely. I know shes in a different house but she's definitely in his Herbology class.• I've always read the name Zacharias as Zachariah. I have no idea how his name is supposed to be pronounced but I will always say Zachariah when reading it• Hermione is very blunt with Luna. She's a bit rude sometimes• Bless Neville having a go at Malfoy for taking the mick out of St Mungos.• WEASLEY IS OUR KING• I like how the Slytherins must have all got together to actually write and learn Weasley is our king. That's dedication• Harry and George going for Malfoy is honestly what he deserved, but I wish they'd have just thought of something witty to throw back at him instead if making a scene• Umbridge making out Hagrid doesn't talk properly is so awful. She is such a hag.• 'Just because you have the emotional range of a teaspoon' - another iconic line• I really do feel for Harry when Mr Weasley is attacked. Imagine having a dream that you've attacked someone and then you wake up and find they really have been attacked. How awful would that be• I've never know anyone say 'wotcher' ever. Is it a Southern English thing? Is it just a Tonks thing? I have no idea• So awful of Percy to send back his Christmas jumper from his parents• I actually love reading the hate between Sirius and Snape. It would have been great if at the end of all this, they would have survived and become friends• Harry and Cho's date is so awkward. As any 15/16 year olds date surely is. He should have thought of a better reason to meet up with Hermione though• Parvati was curling her eyelashes around her wand?? How long are her eyelashes• Dumbledore is incredibly cunning and quick thinking. I agree with Shacklebot in 'I may not agree with Dumbledore on many counts, but you can't deny he's got style.'• Fred and George's exit is iconic• Poor Lee Jordan left behind without Fred and George though. At least he tries to continue the mischief• Honestly Hagrid showing Harry and Hermione Grawp, what is he thinking?Like two teens can look after a giant that keeps injuring another half giant. He is a bit too optimistic and careless sometimes• WEASLEY IS OUR KING• McGonagal is a badass, getting stunned 4 times in the chest and still coming back strong. What a legend• I love that Neville never questions Harry about the rescue mission for supposed death eater Sirius Black.• What is the Department of Mysteries, though? What are the brains and the time changing thing? Just why?• Oh Sirius. This scene was done really well in the film. It was so emotional.• Yes Dumbledore, leaving out vital pieces of information is not a good idea is it.• Imagine, age 15, your told you have to kill someone or they will kill you. 15 year old me couldn't cope with my exams, never mind that• Changed your tune Fudge, haha, I can't help but be like 'in your face'• Harry to Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle: ""Well, I'm terrified now... I s'pose Lord Voldemort's just a warm up act compared to you three"" - Absolutely savage. This book has the most iconic lines• The Order all threatening the Dursleys at the end is such a nice way to end this book really. End it on a lighter tone.",26,0.9923,0.123,0.729,0.148,0.4991468253968255,POSITIVE,0.8461

“Youth can not know how age thinks and feels. But old men are guilty if they forget what it was to be young.” 
Actual rating : 4.5 stars The order of the Phoenix , The fifth book of the series is a little bit controversial . the very same feeling harry had about his last week in Hogwarts , i do have about this whole book .he thought that his week seemed to last much longer than it really did because it stretched between two universes , one with Sirius and one with out .same experience i have with the book , the time when i first opened the order of the phoenix and started reading seems literally a lifetime ago , and though maybe it was because meanwhile i was a bit distracted from reading by some real life matters , or that the book's gigantic length of nearly 900 pages can be a significant reason , but there is also the other reason , that this book too stretches between two universes , the one Before and the one After , and the cutting event is the blunt recognition of the war ahead , the actual cutting line is , the beginning of the war.The first half of the book was a bit slow paced , but then the second half would flow so rapidly you forget all about it , the book reaches it’s climax when, after a dream, Harry and several other members of the student’s secret club the“DA” ( Dumbledore’s Army) venture to the Ministry of Magic to prevent Voldermort from torturing Sirius (or so they think ) .Both Harry and his readers are becoming adults throughout the duration of the series, the progression into a young adult is made evident in here through how Rowling shows a 15-year-old boy mind , harry deals with feelings of abandonment, yet he’s also unable to stop thinking about how all the adults around him are either know-nothing , judgmental or unwilling to understand . He is definitely a lot angrier in this book . and there also were more fights and more arguments , In other words , he’s 15 .Yes , right . he is growing a bit annoying and he isn't my favorite character , at least not in this one , But ! literature at its best reflects real life, whether placed in a realistic or an unrealistic theme . children’s literature has been always showing that life is all rainbows and sun shines , when ever it starts telling the truth its no children book anymore , But Rowling’s turn at realistic adolescence places the Harry Potter series in the realm of great children’s literature. though I wouldn't have wanted to mention it , but its a bit hard not to , here this Major character loss is one of the most significant things that happened in this book , its utterly sad , I can even describe it devastating , because I think Sirius's death had came much earlier than it should .we experienced one of the first real losses here .I actually knew that Sirius black would die in this particular book , though no idea when or how , i was kind of waiting dreading the moment , though figures i had to wait for long 800 pages before my dread got confirmed , and inspite of that it still was shocking . i didn't expect it to happen this way , just like this , in the middle of a sentence , maybe i was kind of imagining a last moment conversation with harry , maybe because they never really had a proper one before , many things were pending between them , Harry actually never expressed himself to his Godfather , like Sirius never knew that the Dursleys we abusing , he was even surprised at some point that Harry was excited at the idea of leaving the Dursleys to live with him .and though i neither watched the movie nor read the book before , but to tell you it was spoiled for me just the same , by FB posts , Tumblre , Pintrest and whatever else , but does it matter ? it really doesn't .i usually do really mind spoilers , a series that's spoiled for me would be hard to catch my full attention , but as i said , not harry potter , its different here .
“We've all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to act on. That's who we really are.”

But this one was trying my patience and I really wasn’t sure I was going to make it to reading the series through completion.!! minor spoilers ahead so do please read at your own peril. But I am assuming most of you have read this series by this point because I’m a latecomer to the hype !!I listened to the audiobook and even that was trying my patience. (Even though Stephen Fry reading this series is one of the best things for it and I couldn’t make it through without him. Don’t worry Fry, I still love you <3)Let me tell you a story. Imagine:Imagine if this book was told from the perspective of Hagrid, or Dumbledore, or Lupin – or basically anyone who is actually in the Order of the Phoenix themselves. That way, we could get an exciting novel where we get to see adventures happening (like with Hagrid) or where perilous battles and fights are to be had (Daddy Weasley) or where they are actually in the know and have some influence over what is happening. Imagine that? We could have an actually exciting story!Instead, we are stuck to reading about a group of students who don’t know anything about what is going on. We only get tales from the people who are fighting the great battle on the down low while the students… study for exams and do homework. Sure, they have their own little struggle under the rule of a very horrible person. But. But. That isn’t so exciting – and it isn’t nearly as wonderful as a tale from a different perspective could’ve been. Sure, one of them (aka Harry boy) has his scar and things happening with that. But what does he do every time he has a situation like that? He has to tell someone else so they can handle it! How boring is that? Ugh.So yeah, I wasn’t too happy being stuck in a perspective where I felt like nothing much happened when a lot more could have happened.This one was also far too long for what it is. Why did the author need to include all these details that I didn’t care about? That didn’t seem to be too relevant to the story? I am so surprised that for all that happened in the book she managed to make it that long. Honestly, it’s almost impressive.There are a few good things going for this book, hence why it gets two stars:- Molly Weasley is a wonderful mother and I am so here for that kind of parenting in children and YA literature so you do you, Molly Weasley. I am here for it.- The ending actually wasn’t that bad. If the whole book was like that I would be a lot less bitter. But as I almost DNFed at 5 different times, I wonder how people make it to that ending.- There’s a neat little clean up of why Voldemort only attacks Harry at school and I love when authors do that. So tidy. (Kind of like Meyer with the Twilight series plot holes in Breaking Dawn. And yes. Yes, I did compare Twilight and Harry Potter. You’re welcome.)- I have a biased appreciativeness for books set in the UK because I love British characters who express their Britishness in speech. So, Ron talking makes me happy. Because he uses words like ‘mate’ and is just the pinnacle of Britishness.I mean, there are quite a lot of good things, actually. But they are small points, and I thought I’d get too much hate dragging all the terrible things in this book. In my opinion, the bad outweighed the good by far.This review and others can originally be found on Olivia's Catastrophe: https://oliviascatastrophe.com/2020/0...",26,0.9953,0.076,0.768,0.157,0.6276675485008818,NEGATIVE,1.0
189,1262407515,04/23/2015,5.0,"I have to laugh at myself for writing a review after thousands upon thousands already written (I think just about everyone on my friends list and all of the people I follow have read and rated/reviewed it!), but I just have to throw in my two cents. I could not put it down! I gasped out loud several times as I read the last few chapters, causing my wife to ask me what was wrong. I am a 50-year old management analyst who is probably the most even-keeled person you'll ever meet, and not given to emotional outbursts. The book really grabs your interest and holds it! I'm really glad I accepted the RMFAO Young Adult challenge, as well as the challenge from my son and daughter-in-law!Other reviews state that the Harry Potter books are not terribly original in their plots, characters, settings, etc., and I have to agree. However, the books are EXTREMELY well written so far. Very little happens that is not foreshadowed in some small way hundreds of pages earlier in the book, or in a previous book, and the foreshadowing is completely seamless. The overall effect is that, even though there ARE surprises, everything makes sense. It gives all of the fantastic events a feel of ""reasonableness"". There is nothing in the book that does not have a reason for being there. All of the events fit together perfectly, like the pieces of an extremely complex puzzle.The use of language is superb. The descriptions of people, things, situations, and so on are very engaging. It is hard to use the word ""realistic"" about a fantasy setting, but the descriptions really draw you into the story. You feel that you are living the story, truly feeling the emotions of the characters. You can feel Harry's powerful, heart-rending sorrow and remorse at the end of the book as if it were your own. You can feel the fear, suspense, anger, joy, laughter, and fury that you would feel if the events of the story were truly happening to you.The characters are the most engaging aspect of the book. They are so well done that you can immediately relate to them. The setting may be fantastic, but the characters are very, very real. More than that, you come to truly care about the characters. What happens to them matters to you. When someone dies in the book, you feel the loss personally. It is as if someone you knew and liked, someone close to you, had died.In my opinion, the fifth book is the best of the series so far, and I can't wait to start number six. I feel that some of the other reviewers are overly fussy in their criticisms of the main character and the feelings he displays in this book. Two of the main themes of this book -- death and the turbulent emotions of adolescent men -- are much more mature than those of the previous books. Book four dealt with death in some small way, but it was a ""clean"" death in that the main character could not reasonably feel any responsibility for it. Death in this book is ""messy""; there is plenty of guilt to stir in with sorrow and remorse.On to the next one!",26,0.9946,0.099,0.719,0.182,0.4937301587301587,POSITIVE,1.0

Sometimes something needs to happen to you before you can appreciate other peoples situations.Reading a chapter a day also made me more attentive to things I kinda dismissed previously, because of my strong dislike of Harry’s attitude. Can't wait to see how I'll interpret the next book.2016I've always liked this book least of all, but this year re-reading it, I've change my mind.Yes Harry's anger still got to me and yes I still feel it's not part of his character, but now I've realize that maybe it's because of Voldemort he's acting out; and with this in mind the entire meaning of the book changed.The way Rowling build this story and made all of us hate Umbridge more than the original villain is amazing!

191,1123288713,12/04/2014,5.0," Reread December 2014 This is only the second time I have read Order of the Phoenix as opposed to having reread all the other books in the series at least once. And I can say that I think I enjoyed it a lot more the second time around. I've always said this one was my least favorite in the series because it's a bit more depressing, Harry is so moody, and everything seems to be going wrong--oh, and Umbridge. But this time, I totally understood Harry's frustration and angst, and I sympathized with his mood swings and outbreaks a lot more. He is under so much pressure for a 15 year old boy. And no one believes anything he says. I found Harry less 'moody' and more justified in his anger.One thing that I continue to find myself thinking, as opposed to the first time reading the series, is how much I dislike Snape. Even though I know the end of the series and how Rowling plays it all out, I still don't like him. I don't think his reasons for hating Harry are justifiable, even when we see in his memory in this book. Something fun that I noticed reading this was that when Harry first arrives at Grimmauld Place and helps the crew clean up the house, as they are searching Kreacher's nook they find 'a locket,' but they don't think anything of it. Easter egg!Overall, obviously 5/5 for the construction of the story, the character development, and just my love for the series overall.

200,1356213861,08/06/2015,5.0,"BLOG REVIEW:https://passthefeels.wordpress.com/20...(my blog review has more content... It's better, I promise)From the moment I started this book, I knew it would end up being my favourite in the Harry Potter series so far, and I was not mistaken. I loved this book so much. It's definitely going in my favourites of all time list.This novel took me sooo long to read it, and I mean come on, give me a break, it was 800 pages... However somehow, Rowling made not even one page feel tedious or boring, which is amazing, considering its size.Perhaps I should've written notes whilst reading this, because I can't remember a lot in detail anymore as I read it over such a long time-span. Therefore, I make no promises about this review being any form of decent. (or in chronological order)The characters, I feel, in this book developed so much throughout, and really just left me loving (or hating, *cough* Umbridge *cough*) them even more, which I can't believe is even possible. It was so interesting to see into Snapes memories, and that whole scene in my head, rather than on screen. I can't wait to read more into Snape in the future books, he is such a complex character.I also loved Dumbledore as much as ever, as well as McGonagall (who was SO sassy in this book), her sass was honestly the best. I found myself cheering her along most of the time.Harrys friendship circle continues to grow and develop, I love reading how they all interact and protect one other.Sirius, the whole Order, and the Weasleys, I just loved! Especially at the end when everyone had Harrys back. Ah, love it.Umbridge, OH, don't even get me started on her... she was possibly even worse in the book than in the movie, I truly thought that wouldn't be possible, but *hem hem*, that woman is insane.You'll notice I'm spreading a few quotes out throughout this review, and that's because I couldn't simply choose just one to include. If you're reading them, I'm sure you'd understand why.Anyway, I noticed whilst reading this that there is so much in the book that is not in the movie! I actually loved that aspect, because it gave me a bit of surprise and apprehension when reading it.I also found that I got so much more out of the book, than in the movie, which is to be expected, but, having watched the movies countless times, it was amazing to be able to pick up the things I may have missed simply by watching it play out on screen. The whole 'prophecy' aspect, what that entailed, the small details, and even just the depths of the characters I found that I understood so much more by reading this.Basically, I just loved and adored this novel, and it is definitely my favourite in the series so far. I'm so excited to read the last 2, because those are the movies I remember least about, and I even find that I don't fully understand everything that goes on in Deathly Hallows.",25,0.982,0.055,0.826,0.119,0.5576452892985152,POSITIVE,0.9968
201,3906531,08/01/2007,1.0,"This is the worst Harry Potter book. The characterization is unbelievable and annoying, taking the various holes in the world J.K. has created with Harry Potter and throwing them in the face of the reader with the expectation that they will accept anything at this point. Events in the world that main characters (and by extension, the reader) find outrageous and crazy are accepted by everyone else in the world without adequate reasons for their acceptance.Harry whines incessantly throughout this book. The entire time he is complaining about not getting what he wants and people not liking him, while turning away attempts by his friends to help him. He sort of acts like this throughout the rest of the series, but his outlook of wanting help from everyone except those who are trying to help him is really stressed in this book.This book also contains one of J.K.'s now signature death scenes. Rather than turning the death of a character into something touching and important to the reader, it happens in one sentence and it is not really apparent what exactly is happening. I had to go back and re-read the death scene after they started talking about it in later chapters because I was not sure that it actually had happened. Every one of the deaths throughout the rest of the book is (poorly) written in exactly this same way.In short, the only reason to read this book is because it is part of the series. I would almost suggest just watching the movie instead, as it is about five times better. I only wish that this book did not bring down the rest of the series by making the inconsistancies and logical problems in J.K.'s world abundantly obvious.",25,-0.9305,0.122,0.789,0.089,0.5101532567049808,NEGATIVE,1.0

It’s a very unique world and you can pretty much dive in and out of it when you want. Now on to the review:Basically this isn’t my favorite HP book because duh Sirius dies:(((. But it is a coming of age story that really shows the HP gang growing up. My favorite parts in this book had three points. 1 is the DA meetings: Ahhh they were so fun to read. It really showed how Neville was really trying and it was just super heartwarming. Next point was FRIENDSHIPPPP(throws many rainbow) the gang really stuck together throughout the story and it was really sweet. And third was the most important. Fred and George obviously was the best part of the book. They were hilarious and rebellious and just so much love toward them as always :) And as an extra lets just say how great Neville is. He’s awesome all around great person, who has grown so much since the first book. The cons of this book which may I add was super hard to come up with was it was a bit hard to get through. The beginning was a bit slow. Which the beginning was important it just was hard to get through. Next, I was so sad that Harry couldn’t play quidditch because I love reading something that Harry likes to compete in. Overall it was witty and an important book to the series.

I get it, I get it - Cedric died, Harry feels like no one is listening to him or keeping him in the loop, he has a lot of dumb stuff to deal with in regard to Umbridge, his mind is not his own, etc. Perhaps that explains his angst, but it did not make him easy to sympathize with, or really care about. He whines to Dumbledore, he yells at Hermione (and everyone else) even though she's right, and he complains that Cho cries too much... even though it's not like he's handling his grief any better.Nothing grabbed me or moved me here - I wish Harry's angst had some resolution to it or played a part in his character growth, but that mostly came in the sixth and seventh books.

Two stars.]Read as part of The Infinite Variety Reading Challenge, based on the BBC's Big Read Poll of 2003.I was looking forward to this book for one and only one reason: Luna Lovegood. I don't remember much of the book from when I first read it all those years ago, and most of my memories were definitely from the film only, but I have to say it was incredibly disappointing in many ways.The writing during the series has definitely improved since The Prizoner of Azkaban, which you'd expect with the fifth. I suppose since the length of each book has almost tripled since the first book, that should have had to be the case. However, despite the improvements to the writing, I still can't see much improvement to the story as a whole.We're getting more characters (more diverse characters) but I still find that most of the bad-or just the ones were supposed to dislike-ones are all a little ugly or fat. As if to say, this is how you know who're you're supposed to like and who you're supposed to hate. Whilst I know these books are aimed primarily at children, I don't find this a good excuse. Children aren't that stupid.Ron and Harry haven't changed much since day one, either. They're both gotten themselves an awful lot of hormones, which happens to anyone, unavoidable, and Harry was super annoying in this one (though, whilst I find that understandable considering how he feels that he might be more like Voldemort than he would like, there was no need for so much caps lock) but I haven't noticed any kind of change in either of them that you'd expect by the fifth book. Hermione, however, seems to change almost every book. At first I enjoyed this change, and whilst I would agree that in general girls change at a faster rate than boys do, it still feels like overcompensation.And now we come to Luna. I thought it was odd that she just turns up and becomes quite an important character from the off, but she was also incredibly flat in the book. I didn't realise that Film Luna had had a bigger impact on me than Book Luna did, and in fact I'd go far as to say that I didn't enjoy Book Luna at all. Not because she was weird, or odd, or picked on, or a little aloof, but because she was just a ""There"" character. Yes, we get she's weird, but it feels like that's the only reason she was there.The story has a whole didn't keep me all that entertained, either. It felt like a repeat of, well, all the other books, with just a bit more death thrown in. I like that the books are getting darker, but I don't think just adding death really counts. I feel like the moment of falling in love-or even just like-with this series like I was when I was twelve has passed by and it won't come back.Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Pinterest | Shop | Etsy",21,0.9126,0.099,0.777,0.124,0.5364583333333333,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Altogether this is longer and darker than any book in the series previously, but it deals with weightier issues and the characters are built upon as they go through hell and back. As I'm too lazy to write an actual review, I'm simply going to paste in a quote by Stephen King, who I think hits the nail on the head in his sentiment towards The Order of the Phoenix:""Is Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix as good as the other Harry Potter books? No. This one is actually quite a bit better. The tone is darker, and this has the unexpected- but very pleasing- effect of making Rowling's wit and playful black humor shine all the brighter... Will kids (and adults as well) still be wild about Harry 100 years from now, or 200? My best guess is that he will indeed stand time's test and wind up on a shelf where only the best are kept; I think Harry will take his place with Alice, Huck, Frodo, and Dorothy, and this is one series not just for the decade, but for the ages.""EDIT- 17 DECEMBER 2015: I was thinking about this book recently, and I feel I should tell you that my most hated characters in this series are Voldemort, Umbridge, and Ron.

Ok. I'm just going to start typing whatever comes to mind first.HARRY'S MOODINESS: OH MY GOD it was so FRUSTRATING being inside his head during this book because he was always so ANGRY. And I didn't exactly hate that. Ok, it was INFURIATING when he went off on Ron & Hermione, but his angst was so raw and real, it took the story itself on a whole other level. Can you blame him for being upset? He's basically shut out from the situation all summer break, without anyone telling him whats going on in the Wizarding World, it's not exactly fair, is it? But it was so sad watching him have a difficult time this time around in Hogwarts because of all the nasty things happening once Umbridge showed up, and nobody believed him about Voldemort's return.UMBRIDGE: OH MY GOD. The b**ch. I LITERALLY CRINGED EVERY TIME SHE SHOWED UP, SHE WAS SO AWFUL MY GOD HOW TO EXPRESS MY HATRED AAGSHGDH! But. BUT. I watched the movies before reading this series. So I knew what happened to this god-awful toad looking creature. So I truly enjoyed every single scene she was in, just thinking of how it ends for her. :')Dumbledore's detachment: this time around, Harry can't confide in Dumbledore, because he's basically avoiding Harry. Watching Harry feel so alone and betrayed by Dumbledore physically hurts. BUT THAT ENDING WHERE DUMBLEDORE BEARS HIS HEART AND SOUL TO HARRY. WOWOWOWOWOWOW. No words can explain. That was a FANTASTIC scene.Dumbledore's Army: THESE SCENES WERE EVERYTHING. Every time it was announced that a meeting would take place my heart would soar, because they were absolutely my favorite parts of the book. They were the rare times where Harry was truly happy in this story, which made every single scene spectacular.Cho: God. I can't. I CANNOT. Out of everybody, EVEN UMBRIDGE, I really REALLY couldn't stand Cho.Ginny: Her badassery is FINALLY coming to the surface and I'm LOVING EVERY MOMENT. She's becoming a very interesting character, because she's basically a mixture of her brothers' best qualities: she's loyal, mischievous, brave, quirky, funny, an amazing girl. Can you see the ship floating? Can you see it? The fact that Ron is also 100% onboard the Harry/Ginny ship is giving me life. I CANNOT WAIT for Half-Blood Prince, because I think it's when they'll finally have their moment, now that Cho is finally out of the picture.Hagrid's story: I didn't really...like it? I found it very anti-climactic, and frankly pointless.. Grawp was an excellent addition to the story, but Hagrid's secrecy and detachment in a time when Harry really needed him was extremely frustrating.Occlumency: You know when I said that the DA meetings were my favorite parts? Yeah, well I lied, because OCCLUMENCY MEETINGS WITH SNAPE ARE EVERYTHING. You guys may not know, but Snape is one of my most beloved characters of all time. For SO LONG I love/hated him during the movies, but once the final movie came out I became loyal to him. Snape is one of the most fascinating characters I've ever read/watched and this book cemented my love for him. The Occlumency meetings were perfection, and now that I've read the book I can honestly slow-clap to the movie actors because that scene was SPOT-ON. When I read the book I was literally picturing every single word in my head just like the movie portrayed it, and that was amazing. The things we learn from Snape's past during these meetings were so revealing and eye-opening; it's the beginning of cracking his exterior to find out what he's really like; I'm SO excited for Half-Blood Prince because it has SO MUCH SNAPE <3Luna Lovegood: her introduction to the series was basically one of my most anticipated parts of reading the books for the first time, and it did NOT disappoint. What I didn't expect was adoring Luna's movie version a lot more than the book version, because the actress did an amazing job in showcasing Luna's strangeness with a lovableness that's sort of absent in the book. I'm very much obsessed with her character so reading about her was everything I wished for, and more.The end: I don't really want to sit here and hash-out all my heartbreak because I would have to type for 500000 hours, so I'll just say this: it was one of the best literary work I've ever read in my life. The chapters throughout #36-38 were absolutely breathtaking, and so tense, it was an experience like no other. J.K. Rowling continues to astound me. AND THE DA KILLED IT. Harry should be proud. I'm SO EXCITED TO CONTINUE WITH THIS SERIES but getting slightly concerned because I'm almost done with it... two more books. And that's it. No more Harry Potter.... I'm going to go now, before I lose it. <3",19,0.9981,0.116,0.702,0.182,0.6621682061899453,NEGATIVE,0.5775
221,2610257056,12/09/2018,4.0,"Harry watched him go, wondering how much more bad news he could stand.You and me both, Harry. In the end, this book was probably five stars but somewhere in the middle it was feeling more like three. It was just. too. long. So I don't know if it's fair, but I'm going to give it four (Come at me, GoodReads!)Sure, it's 870 pages, but it also just felt long. I'm paraphrasing here, but Roger Ebert once said if you keep looking at your watch during a movie then the movie isn't working. And in the middle stretch of this book, I counted how many pages there were until the end on more than one occasion and sighed. Dramatically.Maybe some of this was the introduction of D0lores Umbridge. To the uninitiated public, Voldemort is the villain of Harry Potter. But the rest of us know Dolores is worse: a bureaucrat who is so unshakeable in her belief of her own importance and righteousness that she does very evil things on the reg. She is a terrible teacher. She inflicts corporal punishment on the students. She fires Hagrid. She tries to have Dumbledore arrested. She very nearly ruins Quidditch by banning Harry, Fred, and George. And then there is the business about (view spoiler)[trying to murder a child when she sends Dementors after Harry, nevermind how many unfortunate bystanders as well. (hide spoiler)] She is not only just as bad as the Death Eaters she opposes, she not only very nearly ruins Harry's fifth year at Hogwarts, she ruins mine. I don't know about you guys, but I read these books for enjoyment so I don't appreciate a rotted cun....uhm, bitch spoiling it. We GET that she's evil, J.K. We don't need it hammered home for hundreds of pages.(And speaking of rotted--while his mother is made nearly hysterical by boggart-fabricated visions of her husband and children murdered, Percy Weasley is returning her Christmas presents unopened and writing letters to Ron encouraging him to inform on them. Seriously, fuck Percy.) I mean, plenty of other things happen: Harry has a disastrous Valentine's Date with Cho, we learn why Professor Trelawney has a job, Harry learns his Dad and Sirius weren't always saints, Weasley's Wizard Wheezes is officially open for business, and Ron becomes a Prefect and joins the Quidditch team and it's nice to see him get something of his own. And the last 100 pages are quite exciting. Although (view spoiler)[Jeez, I got a little misty when Cedric Diggory was killed, but even though I suspected it was coming, when Sirius dies!! Then Dumbledore crying. Then Harry's conversation with Nearly Headless Nick about why Sirius wouldn't return as a ghost. My tear ducts are broken. BROKEN. (hide spoiler)](Ponder this bit of self-obliviousness: Harry Potter is almost too grimdark for me, yet I kid myself I'm going to get thru Game of Thrones one day.)But if I didn't care about these damn characters so much, I obviously wouldn't have this reaction. And the little interactions between them--when they know each other so well at this point and we, in turn, know them --really make this book shine:""Are you quite sure it's him, Lupin?"" he growled. ""It'd be a nice lookout if we bring back some Death Eater impersonating him. We ought to ask him something only the real Potter would know. Unless anyone brought any Veritaserum?""""Harry, what form does your Patronus take?"" said Lupin.""A stag,"" said Harry nervously.""That's him, Mad-Eye,"" said Lupin.""Didn't you listen to Dolores Umbridge's speech at the start-of-term feast, Potter?""""Yeah,"" said Harry. ""Yeah...she said...progress will be prohibited or...well, it meant that...that the Ministry of Magic is trying to interfere at Hogwarts.""Professor McGonagall eyed him for a moment, then sniffed, walked around her desk, and held open the door for him.""Well, I'm glad you listen to Hermoine Granger at any rate,"" she said, pointing him out of her office.""Well--well, if he {Kreacher, the traitorous house elf} is a bit strange, it's not his fault--""Ron rolled his eyes at Harry.""Hermione still hasn't given up on spew--""""It's not 'spew'!"" said Hermione heatedly. ""It's the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare....""(And later, one of the funniest moments in the book, courtesy of Dobby.)""....Nor do the other house-elves. None of them will clean Gryffindor Tower anymore, not with the hats and socks hidden everywhere, they find them insulting, sir.""So while my Potter friend Jen will be vexed (whatever, you can come at me as well, Jen!! Because I'm fearless, and also, erm, I know she rarely gets on GoodReads....), I need a little Potter break. Probably till January. But I'll be back.

“We won't be seeing you,"" Fred told Professor Umbridge, swinging his leg over his broomstick.""Yeah, don't bother to keep in touch,"" said George, mounting his own.
Also,I was laughing so much while reading this,there are some simply hilarious lines(the twins,sarcastic Harry,etc.) but there are also many sad moments and moments&lines that just make you think,you know,about life,love,family,death.I seriously applaud good ol' J.K.Rowling for writing this masterpiece.Favourite quotes:“Is it true that you shouted at Professor Umbridge?""""Yes.""""You called her a liar?""""Yes.""""You told her He Who Must Not Be Named is back?""""Yes.""""Have a biscuit, Potter.” “You're a prefect?

'What d'you reckon that means?''Probably that you're going to be eaten by a giant marshmallow or something,' said Harry.” “One more lesson like that and I might just do a Weasley.” ",19,0.922,0.075,0.821,0.104,0.5428160919540229,POSITIVE,0.999
223,1906728864,05/24/2019,5.0,"Objectively speaking, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is probably the best book in the series. It's just so well done.Following on from the events of The Goblet of Fire, this instalment gets necessarily darker. And despite all the magic and fantasy of it all, the way in which events unfold is painfully real. (So real in fact that I struggled to read this amongst the events of the Australian federal election.) The way that the Ministry denies that which it doesn't want to hear sucks. It's frustrating and the most painful kind of dramatic irony, but as a reader, you're also uncomfortably aware that your government would likely do the same. The way in which Harry is shut out, ignored, and patronised forces readers to remember that despite everything he has been through, this he a child and he will be treated as such. It's frustrating to read, but it's good writing. I admire how self-aware Rowling was, how she addressed Harry's heroic tendencies. I admire that she said, this is someone who does great things, but he is a child, and frustrating though it may be, he isn't ready to front a war effort. So, yeah, it's a frustrating book. Between Umbridge and the Ministry and Dumbledore and Hagrid, you just want them to know, you want Harry to be let in, for everyone to understand. But the really important thing, is that it's not annoying to read. Rowling still balances it all with lighter moments: Fred and George's antics, a quidditch sequence that I found myself actively engaged in, Harry's awkward first steps into romance. It's really an impressively crafted novel. I said that subjectively, this is probably the series' best book. Objectively, it is possibly my least favourite because my favourite character in the whole of Harry Potter is Sirius Black. And despite every other frustrating thing that happens in Order of the Phoenix, nothing, 
nothing
 will ever frustrate me more than Sirius' fate. For me, it's probably the most pessimistic thing that happens in the series. Every other character death, I'm okay with. I accept them, I understand their place, but not this one. Sirius never got to escape his demons or have a real chance at making up for time that was stolen from him, and I'll forever be upset and mad about it. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix truly is an impressive novel, with a lot of emotional and political nuance that I don't think anyone expects of a middle grade fantasy novel. But it's fucking good. Now with the series' chunkiest book done, I'm really in the home stretch of this re-read and I'm eager to get back into the world (and eager to get hurt again, I guess).

224,705874090,08/28/2013,5.0,"This marks the third time I have read book 5 in the Harry Potter series. I'm not much of an intelligent review will ensue, as I am incredibly bias and affectionate towards this series.I grew up with Harry Potter and waited anxiously year after year for each book and subsequently, movie, to be released. I am an avid fan and will never tire or become bored of the Wizarding World. I look forward to the day when my two young children are old enough to start the Harry Potter journey on their own - it will always live on in our household.So enough about my ultimate fan feels, you're here to hear my thoughts about the book.Order of the Phoenix begins the painful trifecta that is the last three books in the series that tear your heart out of your chest and leave it bleeding on your sleeve. Order of the Phoenix is the longest book out of all seven and can be quite lengthly at times. This is due to the action that takes place in the book.Order of the Phoenix is the most internally ""Harry"" book in the series. It focuses mainly on Harry's internal struggles and the battles raging on in his mind. I had forgotten how internal the book was, as it had been quite a few years since I last reread it, and I've been referencing the movies in my mind since they've been released. The movie version of Order of the Phoenix moves much of the story out of Harry's mind, but as I was rereading the book, I released how manipulated and tormented Harry truly was for most of the story.In the movie, they zoomed in on Dumbledore's Army and minimized Harry's dreams. It makes sense cinematically, as they allowed them to showcase more characters and an entire movie in Harry's head wouldn't have translated well onto screen. But I think there is something different to be taken away from the book, there is a sense of error from several parties.I will say, however, that I think the battle scene at the end was captured perfectly in the movie, and conveyed all the right emotions that the book did. That was the part of the book I most clearly saw as the ""movie version"" while I read.And while Order of the Phoenix is a bit lengthy, possibly too lengthy at parts, the last 100 pages are completely worth it and make this book perfect and essential to the series.My love for JK Rowling in her world of Harry Potter is infinite.

225,1302178485,07/08/2017,5.0,"Despite all odds, Harry overcomes all by refusing to let his superiors define how he sees the world and chooses to act upon it. In a book filled with mental and physical struggles, friendship and courage help pull Harry through a life that was destined to be far from ordinary, when that is all he desires to be. This book makes you laugh out loud, most likely at Ron's immature comments, or at Luna's strange and yet charming demeanour. The next minute, it makes you angry, most likely at Umbridge's power hungry behavior, and then you'll be holding back tears as this book truly takes you down dark paths. The symbolised prejudice is so strikingly painful, and hurtful to know we live in a world where people are seen as inferior due to traits others define as less worthy. However this book takes this dark reality and shows us that young minds are capable of questioning and rejecting these ideas, and are capable of seeing things in their own light. Hermione's consistent battle to reject the house elf system is one of the most striking aspects of this series, and a darn shame it was excluded from the film franchise. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a well loved edition to the series. While a little drawn out in some scenes, this book flies past so quickly and has you gripped from page one. The most note worthy aspect of this book was the realistic and refreshing take on people. That good people still do bad things, and makes you think about liking a character, rather than it being an automatic given.

237,314266126,04/17/2012,1.0,"Ladies and gentlemen My story with Harry Potter began with the premiere in the cinemas of ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" that I went to see with my friends from La Salle school. I loved it, and I bought all the books until the fourth book (post, which the fifth hadn't come out yet). I loved it, I reread them Harry Potter was like an ideal for me, and i counted the days when the fifth book would be published, and it was from the fifth book that the Harry Potter saga ceased to please me. Perhaps it is an exaggeration to say, as my sister says, that I do not like Harry Potter, in fact, I like it until the fifth book (not being included). Initially J.K. Rowling, a self-made single mother, managed on her own merits to leave the state she was in thanks to the Harry Potter series a Boy Wizard. He abuted many of the influences of the books that he had liked among them the Very Christian ""Chronicles of Narnia"" liked among them the very Christian ""Chronicles of Narnia"" https://www.goodreads.com/series/4907... ""Camelot"" by T.H. White https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4... the wonderful books of Malory and St. Clare and which are a decisive influence of Enid Blyton https://www.goodreads.com/series/5200... https://www.goodreads.com/series/1103... and like ""Peter Pan"" by James Mathew Barrie, Kenneth Grahame's ""The Wind and the Willows,"" ""Winnie The Poo"" A.A. Milne and J.R.R. Tolkien's ""The Hobbit"" were counted, and read to the children of the aforementioned writers. However, all this changed in the fifth book. I admit, it didn't take me long to read it, because it was read well. But J.K. Rowling who's always wanted to write a black novel. He decided to get out of the canons of the first four making him more grown-up. In Christian, it made it more morally confusing. Already the fourth book, it ended dramatically, and this is noticeable in the fifth book. The whole crux of this book is based on one thing. Harry Potter has not matured, and is unable to accept the murder of Cedric Diggory at the hands of Lord Voldemort and Wormtail. Harry Potter demonstrates one thing and is a great immaturity, and he is unable to act maturely, and sensiblely. Every time I think of Harry Potter, I remember another writer, which I recommend to Harry Potter fans. I'll mention it now, because it will come out from time to time in my review. Miyuki Miyabe https://www.goodreads.com/author/show... this woman, and I will surely be in the political, and religious antipodes, but I must admit, that I like the way she writes, and how she poses the ethical and moral dilemmas. He even tries to understand the bad guys. I like the way Miyuki Miyabe's characters deal with life. Waturu Mitani (star of the wonderful ""Brave Story"" https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1... perhaps the best modern fantasy novel I've ever read) let's compare it to Harry Potter. His father has left home, and left them for another woman, his mother has tried to kill himself, ends up in a magical world, where his animal friends are exterminated by an empire, and above him realizes that he or Mitsuru must die to save the world of Vision. Although at first it happens to him as Harry Potter, he behaves better and more humane, and acts with more humanity. Nor does Harry Potter even if he has lost his father, he has the stigma that his father is a thief like Mamoru Kusaka's ""The Whisper of the Devil"" https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8... although the ending is very controversial. It's very curious, how Mamoru reacts to discovering the real criminal. It would be interesting how ""Harry Potter in the Prisoner of Azkaban"" acts where he first tries to kill Sirius Black (just like Mamoru), but does not forgive him for charity, but because he discovers that he is not the real villain. Although Remus Lupin has described to him what the dementor's kiss is like, he insists on taking WormTail there. Although Lord Voldemort is a monster his reaction when found in ""The Goblet of Fire"" is understandable, because he wants to save his life, but he is of great cruelty. He wishes he got drowned. . But he's certainly the worst Harry Potter harassing his cousin Dudley, who's a bully, but this time he hasn't done anything to him. It takes time to help you when the dementor attacks you (does not act until the last second). We see the irascible, shown with friends. Excuse me, and you don't strongly condemn your father's evils. For me it has been one of the things, which I was most disliked to see how the renowned James Potter was indeed, and to see that Snape was right about him. Despite being provoked by Malfoy we see him attacked aided by the Weasleys (who are stronger and older than Malfoy). These are the things, they me off a little bit of J.K. Rowling. I believe that the British must have a great inferiority complex, because they are obsessed with class struggle. The problem is that they don't mess with plutocrats like Frank Capara, or G.K. Chesterton https://www.goodreads.com/author/show... they don't mess with millionaires like Soros, Rockefeller, Bezos, or Bill Gates, but with people of the nobility. It's funny how skilled certain writers are to make a novel of denunciation against fascism, and Nazism, but it fails them when they try to condemn communism. J.K. Rowling has the same thing as Charles Chaplin as he brilliantly denounced that he is very good at making satire against fascism, and Nazism, but then as he feels sympathy for communism is very soft at condemning him, and this happens to Rowling and many others writers. We see as in T.H. White's ""Camelot"" that he magnificently portrays the Nazis incarnated by Modred, but unlike T.H. White who also attacks communism using ants. J.K. Rowling doesn't do that. In the case of J.K. Rowling there are obvious links between the Nazism represented by Slytherin and his obsession with blood cleansing, and Voldemort would be very inspired by Hitler. Dumbledore drops it when he mentions the subject of tyrants in ""Harry Potter and the Half-Breedprince"" I return to something other than the problem is not the political system. In a democracy too, we can do barbarities, as we are seeing. Besides, people don't always choose the best, or the most optimal. The thing is not to do what you want but true freedom is to have weighed the options choose the right, and the best. Alexis de Tocqueville, https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1... https://www.goodreads.com/author/show... and recommend C.V. Georghiu's wonderful novel from ""The Hour 25"" https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1... I do not lean forward to any of the proposed alternatives or Nazism-fascism, neither communism-socialdemocrata, nor liberal capitalism (after all, as Dostoyevsky put it in ""The Demons"" https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1... nihilistic communism is not the nemesis of liberal capitalism born of Luther's Protestant Reformation, and Calvin, and consolidated by the 1688 coup d'état the ill-called Glorious legitimized by John Locke and spread throughout Europe by a French Revolution of 1789 that based everything on a genocide, and in which what died most were not clerics, nobles, but peasants, bourgeois, women, workers, and slaves I bet on the distributionism of G.K. Chesterton and Hilaire Belloc https://www.goodreads.com/author/show... https://www.goodreads.com/author/show... though I don't think, that any system will work, but you have to look for the fairest. . Another detail that angers me about the novel is the way cho Chang and Harry Potter break down. Most people with a little lights knew that that relationship wasn't going to last, and that Harry Potter would end up or in the arms of Hermione Granger, or Ginny Weasley something for which J.K. Rowling has apologized, but I think, that matching Harry Potter with Ginny Weasley was not bad idea . 1o Because he strengthens his alliance with the Weasleys (his traditional allies) and 2nd because it was always known that Ron was in love with Hermione. I think Ron would have forgiven Harry Potter, who's going to take Hermione away. It's true that Harry's afraid That Ron will be angry about being in love with Ginny Weasley, but I think Ron as a good brother is that someone who deserves it will come. The second book ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" (which by the way is my favorite) if you rescue Ginny and then don't marry her, she's very poor. None of Gryffindor and Hufflepuff's teammates are up to Ginny or Seamus Finnigan, or Dean Thomas. Now the solitude doesn't look bad, but it was a little poor that, or getting married by Neville Longbottom no matter how good a boy. So if I'm happy that Harry Potter chose to marry Harry to Ginny and not Hermione Granger, who is better off with Ron (we'll talk later about the topic of Rowling's regrets). We all hate Malfoy, but I'm unjust first to go with two palm trees, and I hit him with the Snitch. This isn't the Harry I admired and wanted. If they had been Crabbe, or Gregory Goyle at least it would have been more balanced. He also shows great pride, when he is guided by his visions. However, the worst, most pitiful moment is when he casts an incurable curse on Bellatrix Lestrange. Maybe he deserved it, but Harry Potter with this action threw away all the credit he had to the trash. It happened to the false Kalon, who was never the same again after he fell off his mask. Only by this act should I have ended up in Azkaban. Then the final scene is pitiful by behaving like an energyman, and Dumbledore scolding Dedalus for rebuking Harry Potter. I was always outraged when Harry Potter was punished for any hardship this time he does something very fat, and Dumbledore shows a cloying, disgusting version . It makes sense that he felt a fascination with the main hero, but he was brazen. Although the director of St. Clare felt a penchant for Lawrence Durrell and Sally Hawking, she still retained things. The ending is cloying, ñoño, and unconscionable cheesy. It's not the only thing Ron Weasley fails with his deterioration, if in the fourth book we saw him turned into an envious pig, here he is much worse. He is out of place turned into an anxious, nervous man unable to give any to the right. That he was the impulsive, and vital friend of Harry Potter, who got him into trouble. Hermione is also as out of place. Its function is almost irrelevant. The new characters don't attract me at all Lunatica Lovegood is an eccentric woman, without any charisma. What am I going to say about Draco Malfoy, that after this book is reduced to the role of jester, and a bunch that everyone can beat up. It's a kind of boxing sparring. It is not understood that in the sixth book J.K. Rowling entrusts him with such an important mission. There are several characters who could have played a tremendous game, but J.K. Rowling wastes them I'm thinking about Theodore Nott (a guy from Slytheryn who could have been Harry Potter's nemesis, or put him in huge trouble. His story is very appealing, but J.K. Rowling doesn't give him the chance, he deserves it.) Neville Longbottom's reaction isn't logical either which goes from being a nullity to Houdini. I can't believe it's progressing so much in such a short time. His evolution is fast running, and badly done. I'm not going to believe that the worst student in the class suddenly goes from zero to infinity, and then back to total darkness. However I believe, that the worst aberration of the novel was what was done with Sirius Black and I'm not talking about his final destination so misspelled, that to paraphrase the divine Oscar Wilde quoting his opinion on ""Antique Shop"" ""you have to have a heart of stone so you don't laugh."" First it shouldn't have been leaking what was going to happen to Sirius Black, and second, describe it better a lot of people were deceived, and he didn't believe it, what ever kept him in the hope that what happened to him would not happen to him. But his fate is not the worst, but to make him an immature man with Peter Pan syndrome. A clear epigono from May '68. A child trapped in the body of a forty-year-old man. Rowling has done worse than get Sirius Black out of the way has destroyed it, turning it into a painful caricature. Everyone reproaches J.K. Rowling for the character of the villain Juana Dolores Umbridge, but I don't think, that character is wrong. He fulfills the mission, which has been awarded a hateful, detestable character that the public may hate. I as a Spaniard were very sorry for the reference to the Inquisition and I would tell Rowling that before being guided by the Monty Python, he read serious books on the subject. The Inquisition may not be a marvel, but I am spoenaled that your country which betrayed two kings to Mary Stuart, and Charles I. That he established a bloodthirsty theocracy through John Knox, and that he dedicated himself to burning epileptic girls until the 19th century and that he pursued Catholics with a sage. He's not here to teach my country lessons. I would recommend it, that to cure your ignorance or bad faith you read Maria Elvira Roca Barea, and if not you can other compatriots of yours Compton Mackenzie https://www.goodreads.com/author/show... Scott Moncrieff, Bruce Marshall https://www.goodreads.com/author/show... George Mackay Brown https://www.goodreads.com/author/show... or my friend Elena Maria Vidal https://www.goodreads.com/author/show... A.J. Cronin https://www.goodreads.com/author/show... maybe take away his insular prejudices, and instead of talking about inquisitions he talks about Starry Chambers. It's funny J.K. Rowling wants to give his book an adult air, but he totally fails He can't find the medium of the fantasy genre and the Hard Boiled that Ian Rankin usually writes https://www.goodreads.com/author/show... when he wants to give it a dark air fails. In fact, it has the most childish scenes in the saga when the Hogwarts boys are dedicated to boycotting Juana Dolores Umbridge, or the centaur crisis. It's an example of not knowing how to control your creation. Remaining like an anarchic, chaotic, crazy and misspelled product. I don't believe this book at all. In the first book he believed that Harry Potter could overcome the riddles and find the Philosopher's Stone, in the second he could defeat the besilysco and save Ginny, in the third save Buckbeak and Sirius, in the fourth win the tournament, and survive Voldemort.
