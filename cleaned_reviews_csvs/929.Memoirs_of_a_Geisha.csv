0,5969907,09/09/2007,3.0,"Like eating fancy dessert at a gourmet restaurant, Memoirs of a Geisha is beautiful, melts lightly off the tongue and will be forgotten shortly after it's done. The language is strikingly lovely, and Golden paints a remarkable picture of a time and place. If you're looking to learn something deep about the psychology of Japanese culture, or meet nuanced characters, then I'd steer you elsewhere. The story only skims the top of the more complicated aspects of a Japan in decline, focusing mostly on a genteel lifestyle that probably seems more appealing from the outside. There's a way in which the book, written by a man and a westerner, is slightly fetishistic, but less so than you might imagine.Another reader suggested that perhaps the superficiality of the story is intentional, and that the book, in a way, resembles a geisha. Beautiful and eager to please, yet too distant to really learn much from and ultimately little more than a beautiful, well-crafted object to be appreciated. If that's the case, Arthur Golden is remarkably clever, and I applaud him. If it's not the case, the book remains very pretty and an easy read.",482,0.9933,0.007,0.769,0.224,0.5399999999999999,POSITIVE,0.9861
1,775847113,11/28/2013,4.0,"”Whatever our struggles and triumphs, however we may suffer them, all too soon they bleed into a wash, just like watery ink on paper. “

Geisha Mineko Iwasaki basis for Chiyo/Sayori.Chiyo, with her sister Satsu, and her mother and father live in a shack by the sea on the coast of Japan. The shack leans, and has to be propped up to keep from total collapse. Her mother is sick and on the verge of death. Her father is a fisherman, uneducated, and generally befuddled by anything that doesn’t have to do with his fishing nets. When a businessman from the village comes to them with an offer to take their girls to the city it doesn’t take much to convince the father that nearly any opportunity is better than staying there in the tilted shack by the sea. He was wrong. Or was he? Without a crystal ball or access to a series of timelines showing the variations created by changing key decisions at critical junctures how can we know? Satsu, who is fifteen, is promptly placed with a brothel. Not exactly what her father had in mind. I’m sure he was told she would be trained for “domestic service”. Chiyo, who is nine, is deemed young enough to be trained to be a geisha. She is a lovely child with startling rare gray/blue eyes. 

Those Blue Eyes are what set her apart.The Mother of her geisha house is equally startling in appearance. ”Instead of being white and clear, the whites of her eyes had a hideous yellow cast, and made me think at once of a toilet into which someone had just urinated. They were rimmed with the raw lip of her lids, in which a cloudy moisture was pooled, and all around them the skin was sagging.”Obvious a bit of a failing liver issue going on here, but wait she is really much more mugly. ”I drew my eyes downward as far as her mouth, which still hung open. The colors of her face were all mixed up: the rims of her eyelids were red like meat, and her gums and tongue were gray. And to make things more horrible, each of her lower teeth seemed to be anchored in a little pool of blood at the gums.” Okay so Chiyo lets out a gasp. She starts out her new life in trouble. It doesn’t end there. She is quickly considered a threat to the lovely and vindictive Hatsumomo who is the only fully trained geisha working for the house. Chiyo is accused of stealing (not true). She is accused of ruining an expensive kimono with ink (true but under duress). She is caught trying to escape ( she broke her arm in the process so try and give the kid a break). Well, all of this ends up costing her two years working as a housemaid when she could have been training as a geisha. She receives an unexpected benefactress, a mortal enemy of Hatsumomo named Mameha decides to take Chiyo under her wing and insure that she has another opportunity to become a geisha. Chiyo, tired of scrubbing floors and being the do-this and do-that girl of the household realizes her best chance at some form of freedom is to elevate herself. 

The Movie based on this book was released in 2005 and directed by Rob Marshall.At age 15 her virginity or mizuage is put up for auction. It is hard not to think of this as a barbaric custom, but for a geisha, if a bidding war erupts, she can earn enough money to pay off all the debts that have accumulated for her training. Chiyo, now called Sayuri, is fortunate to have two prominent men wanting to harvest her flower. The winner is Dr. Crab who paid a record amount for the privilege.”Of course his name wasn’t really Dr. Crab, but if you’d seen him I’m sure the same name would have occurred to you, because he had his shoulders hunched up and his elbows sticking out so much, he couldn’t have done a better imitation of a crab if he’d made a study of it. He even led with one shoulder when he walked, just like a crab moving along sideways.”Not the vision that any girl would have for her first time, but ultimately it is a business transaction that frees Sayori from the bonds of debt. After the deed is done, the eel spit in the cave, Dr. Crab brought out a kit filled with bottles that would have made Dexter jealous. Each bottle has a blood sample, soaked in a cotton ball or a piece of towel of every geisha he has ever treated including the blood from his couplings for their virginity. He cuts a piece of blood soaked towel that was under Sayori and added it to the bottle with her name. Ewwehhh! with a head snapping *shiver*.The cultural obsession, every country seems to have one, with female virginity is simply pathological. Girls can’t help, but be fearful of the process. Not strapped to a table by a serial killer type fear, but still there has to be that underlying hum as the man prepares to enter her. I wonder if men, especially those who avidly pursue the deflowering of maidens, are getting off on that fear? I’ve made myself feel a little queasy now. Sayori is on her way to a successful career. She is in love with a man called The Chairman and wishes that he will become her danna, a patron, who can afford to keep a geisha as a mistress. There are people in the way, keeping them from being together, and so even though there were many geishas who wished for her level of success she still couldn’t help feeling sad. ”And then I became aware of all the magnificent silk wrapped about my body, and had the feeling I might drown in beauty. At that moment, beauty itself struck me as a kind of painful melancholy. “It was fascinating watching this young girl grow up in such a controlling environment; and yet, a system that can also be very deadly. One misstep, one bit of scandal, and many geishas found themselves ostracized by the community. They could very easily find themselves in a brothel. During WW2 the geisha community was disbanded, and the girls had to find work elsewhere. Sayori was fortunate. Despite all the hardships I know she was enduring, Arthur Golden chose not to dwell on them in great detail. I was surprised by this because authors usually want and need to press home those poignant moments, so that when the character emerges from the depths of despair the reader can have a heady emotional response to triumph over tragedy. I really did feel like I was sitting down for tea with Sayori, many years later, and she, as a way of entertaining me, was telling me her life story. Golden interviewed a retired geisha by the name of Mineko Iwasaki who later sued him for using too much of her life story to produce this book. She even had light brown eyes not as striking as Sayori's blue/gray eyes, but certainly light enough to be unusual. I wonder if Iwasaki was still the perfect geisha, keeping her story uplifting, and glossing over the aspects that could make her company uncomfortable. 

Mineko IwasakiThe book is listed in the 1,001 Books You Must Read Before You Die. It was also made into a film, which I’ve been avoiding, knowing that I wanted to read the book first. I notice some reviewers take issue with Sayori. They feel she did not assert herself, and take control of her life. She does in the end, but she is patient, and waits for a moment when she can predict the outcome. I feel that she did what she needed to do to survive. Most of the time she enjoyed being a geisha. It takes a long time to learn not only the ways to entertain, but also all the rigid traditions that must be understood to be a successful geisha. As she gets older, and can clearly define the pitfalls of her actions, we see her manipulating the system in her favor.

2,124791392,10/04/2010,4.0,"(Book 93 From 1001 Books) -	Memoirs of A Geisha, Arthur GoldenMemoirs of a Geisha is a historical novel by American author Arthur Golden, published in 1997. The novel, told in first person perspective, tells the story of a fictional geisha working in Kyoto, Japan, before and after World War II.In 1929, nine year-old Chiyo Sakamoto and her 15 year-old sister, Satsu, are sold by their father to work within the entertainment districts of Kyoto. They are taken from their home, the coastal fishing village of Yoroido along the Sea of Japan, and travel to Kyoto by train; upon arrival, Chiyo is taken to the Nitta okiya (geisha boarding house) in Gion, whereas Satsu - deemed less attractive and therefore a poor investment - is instead taken to a brothel within Kyoto's pleasure district.Chiyo is taken inside, and is introduced to Auntie, Mother (Auntie's adoptive older sister and the matriarch of the house) and Granny, their elderly and poor-natured adoptive mother and the okiya's former ""mother"". Both Auntie and Mother are strict, though Auntie is kinder to Chiyo, whereas Mother is driven by money and business. Chiyo is also introduced to Hatsumomo - the premier geisha of the okiya, its primary earner, and one of the most famous, beautiful and ill-mannered geisha of Gion. Hatsumomo takes an instant disliking to Chiyo, and goes out of her way to torment her. Auntie warns Chiyo against both angering and trusting Hatsumomo, knowing the ill-mannered geisha's true nature very well. ...خاطرات یک گیشا - آرتور گلدن (سخن) ادبیات؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش: در ماه مارس سال 2003میلادیعنوان: خاطرات یک گیشا؛ نوشته: آرتور گلدن؛ مترجم: مریم بیات؛ تهران، سخن، 1380، در 640ص؛ شابک 9646961703؛ موضوع: داستان - ژاپن - تاریخ از نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا- سده 20منمیدانم، یادم نمانده، کدامیک از سالهای بگذشته بود، که برای نخستین بار، یک پی.دی.اف از همین کتاب، با ترجمه ی بانو «مریم بیات»، برایم رسید، برنامه ای نوشتم، تا متن پی.دی.اف را به فارسی آفیس نسخه 2003میلادی برگردانم، بسیار سخت گذشت، بارها و بارها برنامه را مجبور شدم هوشمندتر کنم، تا اینکه کتاب را پس از تلاش بسیار، در 174733کلمه، و در 409صفحه ی 31سطری، و هر سطر میانگین 22واژه، و هر واژه میانگین بیش از چهار حرف، برای خویش آراستم، البته باز هم مجبور شدم، بیشتر صفحات را ویراستاری کنمنقل نمونه متن: (یادداشت «آرتور گلدن»: چهارده ساله بودم، که در غروبی در بهار سال 1936میلادی، پدرم مرا به تماشای یک برنامه ی رقص، در «کیوتو» برد؛ از آن برنامه، تنها دو چیز را به یاد دارم؛ نخست اینکه من و پدرم، تنها تماشاچی غربی در میان تماشاگران بودیم، تنها دو سه هفته بود که از کشورمان «هلند»، به آنجا سفر کرده بودیم، بنابراین هنوز نتوانسته بودم، خود را با انزوای فرهنگی تطبیق دهم، و تاثیر آن بر من هنوز فوق العاده زیاد بود؛ دوم اینکه خوشحال بودم، که پس از ماهها فراگیری زبان «ژاپنی»، آنهم به صورت فشرده، میتوانستم از حرفهایی که میشنیدم، جسته گریخته، چیزی سر دربیاورم؛ از زنهای جوان «ژاپنی»، که روی صحنه میرقصیدند، به جز اشکالی مبهم، از «کیمونو»های الوان درخشانی که، بر تن داشتند، چیزی به یاد ندارم؛ مسلم است که به هیچ راه، به ذهنم هم خطور نمیکرد، که در زمان و مکانی بسیار دور، یعنی تقریباً پنجاه سال بعد، و در مکانی به دوری «نیویورک»، یکی از همان زنان، نزدیکترین دوستم خواهد شد، و خاطرات استثنایی اش را برایم تقریر خواهد کرد؛ در جایگاه یک تاریخ نگار، همیشه خاطرات را به چشم منبعی از مواد نگاه میکنم؛ خاطرات، سوابقی را فراهم میآورد، که بیشتر به دنیای خاطره نویس، تا خود او مربوط است؛ خاطرات با «بیوگرافی» فرق دارد، چون در «بیوگرافی»، خاطره نویس نمیتواند، جنبه هایی را ببیند، که برای «بیوگراف» نویس، امری عادی و منطقی است؛ «اتوبیوگرافی»، البته اگر واقعاً چنین چیزی وجود داشته باشد، به این میماند، که از خرگوش بخواهیم برایمان بگوید: وقتی توی علفزار، بالا و پایین میپرد، به چه شکل درمیآید؟ از کجا بداند؟ از طرفی، اگر بخواهیم چیزی در مورد علفزار بدانیم، هیچ کس بهتر از او، نمیتواند برای ما آنرا توصیف کند، مگر آنکه در نظرمان باشد، که در جستجوی چیزهایی هستیم، که خرگوش، قادر به مشاهده ی آنها نیست؛ ....)؛ پایان نقلتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 28/05/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 09/05/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی",312,0.9334,0.02,0.938,0.042,0.4833333333333334,POSITIVE,0.6559

I was fifteen and precocious, and the narrative was arresting. I couldn't put the book down. I wrote this in 2000:""Golden has hit pay dirt with this masterpiece. An insightful, curious, and caring look into the mysterious world of geisha, Arthur Golden peels away the ignorance and labeling that westerners have covered the secretive Japanese profession. Although it sinks at times into a near melodramatic prose, the book's protagonist is interesting, insightful, and enjoyable. Her witty anecdotes and thoughtful mannerisms in speaking make Memoirs of a Geisha a delightful and unstoppable read.""Then I got older, went to college and graduate school, and developed a critical, thinking eye.And I'm mad at myself.insightful? Really? God, I was naive. This novel, while entertaining is so problematic I rarely have time to descend into my criticism. It continues the Orientalism that Edward Said loathed so very much; rather than ""skillfully entering"" the world of a Japanese woman, it apes her identity, and ultimately deprives her of a voice, creating a sort of Orientalist imagination for us to enjoy without ever really seeing her. The book is still engaging as a narrative, but the sappy ending, the frankly sexist portrayals at some points, and Sayuri's outright inability to identify outside of her Chairman is rather frightening. It serves to objectify fetishism at its worst. Yet I can only give you three stars, because I'm still partly under your spell, Golden.

4,2319456076,03/07/2018,5.0,"A timeless genre picture of a strong woman making the best out of terrible circumstances. Not just the personal story of the main protagonist is very well written, it´s how Japans´culture and history are shown in a new perspective one wouldn´t have ever thought of because of the stigmas and prejudices the same men haunting the poor women are imposing on them with their conservative, misogynic policy.The Asian waySexist male dominance manifested in many different forms and how the Japanese culture arranged prostitution has hardly ever been described in such memorable words, metaphors, and pictures. The strange thing is that all that glitter and glamour around it, letting it seem cultivated and less primitive, creates the disturbing impression that it´s not as bad as it is, something so cognitive biasy that it´s hard to stomach, understand, and put in context to the cultural impact, especially when comparing the very different approaches towards it around the world.  Prostituion by regionhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostit...As so often, the Scandinavians set the best, new policieshttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostit...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostit..., with „Neo-abolitionism - illegal to buy sex and for 3rd party involvement, legal to sell sex“ (that´s once a word with Neo that is not evil)thereby making it illegal for the clients to buy sex and not criminalize the prostitutes. That´s an important approach away from victim blaming and slut shaming, the punishment of the female victims, and offender protection that is law in many other bigoted, conservative, sexist states, towards a more enlightened society. Critics like to claim that this would increase sexual violence and rape, but maybe just every sexual offender should be facing life imprisonment without any chance of probation, maybe including permanent chemical castration so that he can´t all the time happily masturbate to his snuff rape fantasies in his cell. Traditions and culture of exploitationAccording to the stereotypical calm, silent, mindful, and introverted Asian mentality, even the sex business is full of ceremonies, traditions, and elements that couldn´t have developed in other cultures with less focus on elegance and aesthetics. Of course, it´s still sick and disgusting, but at least it goes with the option for women to reach a certain status and adds art, culture, and class to the perverted mix. Talent and obsessionIt´s one of the greatest fiction without fantasy novels I´ve read, one of the rare cases when talent meets the lifelong interest of an author in a topic or culture and is distilled to something so amazing that it isn´t exaggerated to say that there might hardly be ever a similar novel written that has the same intensity in dealing with this theme.  Sociocultural impact of prostitutionWhat´s more bigoted, letting it all seem shiny, noble, and cultivated, hiding it or making it illegal or the open, direct, strangely still somewhat illegal, Western way? There is so much behind this, parts of it already mentioned in „Prostitution by region“, and it would take far too long to mention all the complexity, and especially misogyny, behind it. And who is causing and promoting it for millennia, and I don´t mean the male sex drive alone, but to what institutions, that make sex and love punished, abolished, or dominated by crazy, stupid rules full of sexism, hate, and misogyny, its degeneracy has mutated. The faithful creating hell on Earth for multi k years since the neolithic, first agricultural revolution to install bloody dictatorships, what a slogan.  DrugsI don´t know if there are hidden implications and innuendos about Western trade traditions, especially how to get bestselling products into the Chinese market,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium_W...I don´t get, but it seems quite probable that there is something deep lurking in the big history meta background. However, even without that, and me overanalyzing and seeing things that aren´t there as if high as heck, it´s always a great trope to get someone insane in the membrane to get the plot started, show ones´ brain on whatever, and how people slowly fall to pieces. Subjective insecurityThis is absolutely not my genre, so my impression and subjective review might be more than incompetent regarding established rating standards, but I definitively like this different, character focused style of storytelling that teaches much about foreign cultures. Hopefully, the writer did his research and it´s accurate, because some reviewers seem to be critical regarding this fact. But, as said, I am an absolute amateur in reading protagonist´ focused stuff and just loved the show.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...",241,-0.4637,0.135,0.736,0.13,0.528479125041625,POSITIVE,0.9999

6,696542099,08/16/2013,5.0,"I became fascinated with Japanese culture when I was a teenage girl and since then I have read many Japanese-related books and articles and have watched many movies and animes that depict parts of Japanese culture but the fact remains that I am not Japanese, I have never been to Japan and I am a foreigner, captivated by this exotic and very different culture.As a foreigner, I see many beautiful and unique aspects to Japanese culture but I also know about certain painful historical facts such as treatment of women in certain eras of Japan. My point is, I don’t want to discuss accuracy of this book regarding Geisha life. I am not Japanese and I am not a historian and therefore, I am not qualified to judge. So I keep my opinion and impression Geisha to myself.It appears that this story is based on the life of a certain geisha, but the author clearly states that both the story and characters are fictional and I am going to stick with that.I admit that I was disappointed when I realized that this turned out to be fiction, only and only because I had been told otherwise by author himself while reading the preface. I mean, what’s with the contradiction? I couldn’t understand the pretense. Why pretend this is a real story when it’s a beautiful fiction? What’s wrong with fiction? I admit, as I reached the end of the book, I came to realize why the author tried to portray this story as a real life story when writing the introduction but I will write about that later.I liked the writing style. Some people may find it pretentious but I understood that this is an attempt to write as close as possible to Japanese style of writing and story-telling and to seem poetic. The writing also helped me to see the world through Chiyo’s eyes and better understand her mind. I should mention that Chiyo and Sayuri are the same person.Some people may say, parts of the story drag on and on and yet nothing important happens. I quickly get bored but I couldn’t put this book down once I had started reading and I had already seen the movie years ago. This is not a perfect book but it is an amazing one. Little Chiyo simply captivated me with her story.I wanted her to survive, to fight and to find happiness. There isn’t a single character in this story that I actually hate. They are all different human-beings with flaws of their own that struggle to survive and get by their hard lives. Some choose to do so by crushing others and some choose to do so by fighting their way through and lending a helping hand when they can.I might have had a few explosions regarding treatment of women and the way chiyo’s mind operates if I didn’t know Japanese culture at the time of this story well enough. I have Japanese friends, so I know what I am talking about it.Chiyo is quite young when she falls in love with a man much older than her, too young in my opinion to fall in love but I understood her feelings. The moment she meets the love of her life, Chairman, is a turning point in her story and happens to be my most favorite part.Yes, she focuses her entire life on reaching this man. As a woman, I would have liked her to have bigger goals and dreams of her own and for example, seek freedom or independence but when I think about her situation, her education and upbringing, I get her.Chiyo is a slave, being trained for the sole purpose of pleasuring men. Men that mean nothing to her and are like alien beings. Up to this point, not a single person has shown her any kindness without ill intentions and when she is about to lose her faith in humanity, a man appears out of nowhere and shows her true kindness. Finally, a man means something to her. One of these men that she is supposed to serve has a face and value to her. I am not surprised she made it her life-purpose to reach him. I would have liked her to interact more with him during the course of the story but it wasn’t really necessary. Chairman was the man SHE wanted and SHE desired for herself. Considering her life, that was a big goal. And I didn’t really need to know more about Chairman. He was the symbol of true kindness. Her dedication to reach him was moving and touched me very deeply.As I said before, during parts of this story, nothing important really happens, but I was eager to learn more about Geisha life. The author is obviously well-informed and has done his research. The story was interesting enough. All characters seemed real and relatable. I even liked Hatsumomo! And even though I wanted Chiyo to reach the love of her life and therefore happiness more than anything, I liked Nobu a lot too. He was a great man but it’s not like we can change our emotions or how we feel about different people and their behaviors whenever we want to. I could feel Sayuri’s misery and fear as she had to make decisions that would ultimately hurt people dear to her, from Pumpkin to Nobu. Sayuri is simply human. She too acts selfish and neglects her friends. I don’t blame her but I wish she had acted differently at certain times, at least regarding poor Pumpkin.I also clearly felt the touch of war and the darkness that spreads over hearts and souls at such a time. The fear, pain and misery as everything changes and there is no longer any certainty to the future.I was touched by the relationship between Chairman and Nobu, even though it was only behind the scene and between the lines. Once you think about it, it was a very deep and touching bond. Although poor Sayuri had to suffer because of this very bond, I understood why Chairman had to act the way he did.The only part of the book that made me laugh and shake my head at the author, the AMERICAN author, was the part regarding American soldiers throwing candy at children. It was mentioned abruptly and I found it very funny. Two nuclear bombs and this is what Sayuri comments about. Yes, I am sure American soldiers weren’t as scary as they were supposed to be but they were still invaders. It takes time for certain wounds to heal. It’s not about American soldiers. It’s about war, invasion and loss!At the end, this is not a fairy-tale. I am a fan of fairy tales and I firmly believe in happy endings. Ironic, since in real life, I am very realistic and even cynical. But when I open a book, I want happy endings. Somewhere along the way, I had started to dream of a fairy-tale style happy ending for little Chiyo and reading the last pages of the book left me a little sad. That’s why as I mentioned above, it was after finishing the book that I understood why the author has tried to sell this story as a real one. All throughout the book, the story tries to remain realistic(Which is why sometimes nothing really happens) and it's important to remember this, when reading the bittersweet ending, Otherwise, the ending might feel a little unsatisfactory and even rushed. But the truth is, the bittersweet ending was still a happy ending, just a realistic one. Still, I wasn’t 100% happy with it. I agree that the author could have done better just by adding 50 pages or so.In conclusion, this is the beautiful story of a little innocent girl as she fights her way through life and hardships in an unfair society and struggles to reach her loved one and have a reason to simply wake up every day and live. This is not a fairy tale but it does contain certain elements of those tales therefore this book is not for everyone, but I really enjoyed it and find it very memorable and special.",191,0.9993,0.098,0.715,0.187,0.5657687864175206,NEGATIVE,0.9643

This time, the fairy tale (with ""Girl"" it seems as if we're more comfortable with the cautionary tale in the 10's) has a Cinderella and many suitors after her. It is absolutely immersive... a page turner that has as many colors as a used-up coloring book. I see the geisha in that light: like La Marilyn, the geisha are symbol of tragedy and misplaced youth and beauty.The plot is orchestrated in that well-intentioned Great Novel tradition. A Great Expectations-meets-Great Gatsby novelty item that's as pure as winter's snow, that shimmers & attracts the senses like a ruby from some volcano deep in the Pacific. Metaphors and similes are very effectively used here, & their dual purpose is clear: it tells the life story in a very non-nebulous manner, in clear, concise, not-to-be-misconstrued mode; and the words seem authentic enough to evoke an actual geisha-- it is her telling you her memoirs, sitting there with you, drinking tea.Also, Hastumomo, in the role of ugly stepsister, is an adversary from hell. Grrrreat character! Too bad she leaves the narrative at too-crucial a juncture (the anticlimax meaning, then, the immediate displacement of anything that did not fit into the societal standards from the board... Lame!). She is a worthy nemesis to our heroine--as voracious for fresh meat as a Great White. The feud between them two is the centerpiece of this Fanny Hill-like tale, this enormously feminist (?) text.

9,2533126039,09/17/2018,5.0,"This was one of the best-written books I have ever read. There was something so special about the writing style, I can't really put it into words. It was just so ""fitting"" and transported me right into this fascinating world. I knew absolutely nothing about the Geisha tradition going into this book, and I feel like I've learnt so much! It is extremely evident that the author did a lot of extensive research and clearly appreciates the Japanese culture. I never would have guessed that I could become so invested in the life of a single girl, who is growing up in a country I don't have any connection to, and who is living a lifestyle I've never thought all too much about before.I thing the exquisite writing style is what truly makes this book. Of course the plot is interesting as well (especially if, like me, you don't know anything about all the work that goes into becoming a Geisha), but without  Arthur Golden's wonderful storytelling it would have been only half as good. He made me feel things I wouldn't have felt otherwise. He managed to make even the most mundane things sound exciting and interesting. I especially need to mention the fact that there were many things happening I would have found disgusting and appalling under different circumstances (this is not a critique on the book itself; these situations are realistic and an attribute to the time period the book takes place in). However, the author pulled me so far into the story and had such a beautiful way of describing things, that I just couldn't bring myself to be angry at anything.All in all, this was an absolute perfect book to me.

10,1706339444,08/27/2018,4.0,"This one is going to be a bit difficult for me to review. I enjoyed it, but it was kinda weird. It was interesting, but kind of slow. The historical fiction aspect is interesting, but I have seen many reviews critical of the actual truth of it all. The pros:- Very good storytelling - Each chapter was its own short story and I found it easy to read and stay interested.- Characters - I was invested in the characters. In fact, I was so invested I could feel my loathing for one of the bad characters curdling in my very soul. It's usually a good sign when you want to reach into the book and smack a character.- The setting and the history - it was fascinating to learn about Geisha culture in pre-WWII Japan and how different it is from anything in American history.The Cons- This one may not be fair because it is probably historically accurate, but the Geisha culture made all the male characters seem like creepers. So, even when there is one you are supposed to like or who is supposed to be a hero, you know that he is all about pre-pubescent, up-and-coming Geisha and hoping to be able to deflower as many as possible. Just skews things a bit.- Kind of slow - even thought I thought the storytelling was great, there were a few times where it started to drag and I was ready to move on to the next part of the story.- Accuracy - Without Goodreads, I would have probably never have known this, but it seems there is some question as to the accuracy of the account in this book. Often, other, more reliable titles are suggested. But, was this supposed to be a non-fiction memoir, a story based on some facts surrounding the Geisha culture but equal parts fact and fiction, or just a completely made up story? I am not completely sure, but it should provide some interesting follow up research.So, I am going to go with 4 stars because it was an interesting story and despite some slow spots and creepers, it was pretty entertaining. Also, questions/controversy over its accuracy might actually raise the entertainment value!",165,0.9955,0.057,0.754,0.189,0.5418055555555554,NEGATIVE,0.9987

14,1037975017,08/27/2014,2.0,"What a disappointment. Why is it that in most books' reviews, only the marginal niche fans vote massively, upholstering the average score so unfairly. Unless, it is the romantics who do read diversely that in their unbiased way, gave the book four to five stars. Even people who gave the book the same score as me must have done so for different reasons. Maybe the ending threw them. Maybe I'll never know. I'm left scratching my head as to why this book is considered the best historical fiction on this site. I'll pool all my misgivings from the last third of the book in this paragraph. Chiyo's outlook towards life is delusional, and is vindicated by her being united with her beau. I wonder what friends I myself would have had my life been more successful. Chiyo's memories of her past are very selective. Sometimes she wants to be a geisha, but anyway she has no choice. Her heart breaks and reseals itself over her journey in becoming one. Her infatuation with the Chairman and her laughable dressing of her repulsion to Nobu sums up the genre of romance. The book is an ungodly mess in its themes. The analogies and lesson-like counsel that passed for wisdom at the end made it all clear. This book's just an escapist dream for delusional romantics of all genders and ages. My reason for my score is mainly that at not one point did the book reel me in. I was never hooked. I have to consider Hatsumomo, most of the book's main archenemy. She is described as stupid, but reveals herself as cunning. The latter attribute is proved beyond doubt. But her stupidity, abetted by drunkenness, only comes at the end. This was a missed opportunity to dress up a promising character. When Hatsumomo mars a kimono belonging to her rival, it's almost an act of vandalism. But we are never allowed to get the insight whether the act itself has the fuel of 30% meanness and 70% stupidity, or the other way round, or some other permutation. I first intended to write more than I'm doing. But I want to put this book behind me quickly. I want to make two points (which is more than my favorite team can make at the moment). First, I knew that such a dishonest and cowardly book would make of the tragic Pumpkin, a mean spirited person. I knew it! Her separation from Chiyo should have been temporary. Instead, she estranges herself from joy and purpose in life in the most random way. She is very wimpy in her decision to ""join the dark side"". It's just not that convincing. Maybe her scavenging act early on foreshadows what the author did with her. It's not an excuse though. Second thing, the stupid and bizarre episode between Chiyo and the Baron. It should have had consequences, but it seemed like the mother of all treaties had been signed between all parties. Very inexplicable. Inexplicable but quite welcome. It's an occurrence that made me distance myself from the narrator. I don't have to be concerned with her when she troubled trouble. This book, were it a flawed masterpiece and dealt with a genre I detest, would still have gotten more than two stars. But at no point did Memoirs reach a pinnacle or peak of sorts. No event was reciprocal, there was no theme except from a rags to riches story. Nature sometimes was described richly, but new objects of unfamiliarity and technology were glossed over, which is cool, as we're all aware of modern contrivances. It's just that everything I've mentioned makes the narrator fake. It's just sad. It means I'll never read this book again.

Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || PinterestAs a reader of bodice-rippers and books that are a part of the Luxury Suite Trash Experience™, I'm prepared to discuss how and when some of my favorite reads can be problematic. I don't feel bad about enjoying them but I do think it's important to have dialogues about why others might not, and why this is 100% okay for others to feel this way without having their opinions lambasted by stans. I, for example, refuse to buy or read anything by Orson Scott Card for personal reasons and once had an Angry White Man
  ™ call me names for being unable to separate my personal feelings about what Card has said about the LGBT+ from my feelings about his books. We all have those lines that can't and mustn't be crossed, so I totally understand why others choose to get political with their wallets.



  MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA came under fire for multiple reasons, parts of which had to do with the book, and parts of which had to do with the film. The book has obvious surface issues, like cultural white-washing (giving the heroine blue-grey eyes, downplaying the tragedy of Hiroshima by portraying all American soldiers as fun-loving rascals who are definitely not rapey (seriously)), as well as presenting Chiyo's rise to geisha as a glorified Cinderella story shrouded in Orientalism (and some of the blurbs in this book really underscore that view with coded language, such as the Chicago Tribune's describing the book as ""[a]n exotic fable"" (emphasis mine) and Vogue's ""a startling act of literary impersonation, a feat of cross-cultural masquerade"" (emphasis mine). I'm not sure what ""cross-cultural masquerade"" means but it sounds unfortunately like, ""literary yellow-face.""



  The deeper issue came with one of Arthur Holden's sources, an actual real life geisha named Mineko Iwasaki, who took umbrage with the way the details of her life were mangled in the telling of this novel. I had always been aware of the controversy, and knew it had prompted her to write a memoir detailing her life with more accuracy called, GEISHA: A LIFE, but only found out today while researching the background for this book that she apparently sued both the author and the publisher on the grounds that he had allegedly promised to keep her identity secret, and yet her name features prominently in the ""acknowledgements"" section of the book.



  The movie was controversial because Chinese actresses Ziyi Zhang (Sayuri), Michelle Yeoh (Mameha), and Gong Li (Hatsumomo) were cast to play the roles of the Japanese women in the book. The response to this was the typical ""white people who are of X descent play characters of Y descent all the time, and no one bats an eyelash,"" but the problem with that line of reasoning is that it assumes that actors of color have the same opportunities and varieties of roles open to them that white actors do, which isn't the case. Actors of color have far fewer opportunities, and when opportunities do turn up, they are usually type-cast. Memoirs of a Geisha was a beautifully filmed movie and I felt very grown-up when my mom took me to see it with her after I'd read the book for my high school book club, and it will always have a place in my heart, and I still admit that it smacks of cultural appropriation.



  Getting to the book, MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA is one of those rare books that I have reread several times, and I consider it the entre to my love of epic stories and bodice-rippers. There is something so exciting about following a character from childhood and seeing them evolve and grow over the course of a novel, following them as they navigate new and exciting life changes and forge new relationships. Chiyo/Sayuri was a very readable protagonist and her goal - become a successful geisha  - is a very clear one to follow, and root for, because the Cinderella story is so universal.



  Upon this subsequent reread, I did notice things that somehow escaped my notice before. Chiyo's detachment from her family, and her under-reaction by the news of their deaths was very strange. I was also bothered by the fact that she never met her sister, Satsu, again, as it kind of felt like the author had left the door open for that reunion, seeing as how Chiyo/Sayuri experienced so many other reunions in her life. I also remember feeling sorrier and more sympathetic for Nobu the first time around, but now, as an educated and wise woman, I see that he is one of those ""nice guys"" who puts women on pedestals and cannot forgive them for toppling or getting dusty. Even when Chiyo/Sayuri was in his good graces, he was so mean to her, and it was kind of hard to read about that this time.



  There were also some wtf moments, like the mizuage scene (or the virginity auction), which I guess was one of the portrayals that Iwasaki was much more upset about. Then the man who buys Sayuri's mizuage takes the blood stained towel her maidenhead dripped on and puts it in a briefcase holding his virginity collection, or vials containing blood-stained fabrics from all the geisha he has despoiled. What a creep! I couldn't believe I'd forgotten the virginity briefcase. It reminded me of a scene from a historical bodice ripper I read about this Norman invader who had a necklace made of the pubes from all the women he'd raped. You can't make this stuff up, guys. Romance novels are the wild, wild west.



  To the author's credit, he wrote a somewhat convincing woman, especially with regard to sex and her views of her body and her relationships with other women. While reading this book, I couldn't help but compare this to Jason Matthews's RED SPARROW, in which the heroine didn't resemble an actual human being so much as an emotionless sex robot. Sayuri had hopes and dreams, and Golden doesn't kid himself that pretty young women dream about banging geeky older men for their personalities or their pasty looks; Sayuri does what she does to survive, but she prefers men she's attracted to on her own terms and isn't truly happy until she settles down with someone who can give her what she really wants. It's such a simple thing, but so many dudes either choose not to understand this or don't want to understand this in their writing of women and man, it shows. So, kudos.



  I enjoyed this book, problematic content and all. I'm sorry it caused pain, and controversy, but I am reviewing this from my own biased, privileged perspective as a white lady, so take my opinion with several grains of salt. It helps to read this as a trashy bodice-ripper and not as 'historical' fiction.

Memoirs of a Geisha is a very picturesque and dramatic tale of a young village girl taken from her family and raised in Kyoto as a geisha. Usually I don't go in for romance. Don't get me wrong, I love love. But I prefer my love stories to be true. There is something immensely powerful about real love. As far as I've been able to discover, much of this story is based on the actual events of the life of former geisha Mineko Iwasaki. Why do I think so? She sued Golden for defamation of character. Apparently he included details she'd told him during their interviews that were not meant for print. Well, that's good enough for me!I was dazzled by the details and enchanted by the well-paced plot. It's not for everyone, but if you liked the movie version you shouldn't be disappointed by the book, being that the two are identical in most ways. Around the time I read Memoirs... I got the chance to visit Kyoto and made a point, as many tourists do, of seeking out the Gion District. The preservation of the area makes it worth the effort and cost of traveling in Japan. Almost medieval in its narrowness, the main historical road is a delight to behold, with its architecture and decor stuck in time as it is and the occasional geisha shuffling to and from buildings.

Geisha do not love, they do not choose their fate, and their life is owned by the men they entertain. They are not meant to feel. The very word geisha means moving art. That’s all they’re meant to be. Not humans but paintings. Like a sculpture, beautiful but cold as the stone their made of. Memoirs of a Geisha is a book that is based on a true story and let’s us catch a glimpse	of the world where the women paint their faces and don’t deserve to love.Based in the 1920’s in Kyoto, Japan a young girl named Chiyo lives with her sister Satsu, in a poor town called Yoriodo along with her sick mother and elderly father. Her father sells Chiyo and her sister to Mr. Tanaka to be taken to an office where they decide that Chiyo will become Geisha for her good looks and blue eyes but Satsu will be taken to a prostitution house in the pleasure district. Chiyo is taken to the Nitta okiya (Geisha House) to become a Maiko (apprentice geisha). She breaks her leg from trying to run away and her training is stopped. Chiyo is then told that both of her parents have died. She meets the Chairmen of Iwamura Electric Company and falls in love with him. She dedicates her life for him to become her danna (not a husband but similar, the danna gives geisha kimono, and money to afford an apartment. Danna are usually wealthy men). Hatsumomo is the lead Geisha in the Okiya and is jealous of Chiyo’s good looks and the attention she gets. Thus, she treats Chiyo like the dirt she walks on. The only person in the okiya kind to Chiyo is Pumpkin, an aspiring geisha the same age as Chiyo. Her dream is to be adopted by oka-san (owner of the okiya) and be the lead geisha of the okiya. Mameha, a renowned geisha, comes to the okiya to offer to be Chiyo’s onee-san (older sister). She teaches Chiyo all of the secrets to becoming a great geiko or geisha. She is no longer known as Chiyo but, Sayuri. Sayuri meets Mameha’s danna, the Baron. He takes an unusual interest in Sayuri, and when she goes to the cherry blossom festival held at his estate he brings her into his quarters. He presents to her, a beautiful kimono. He offers to give the kimono to her if she merely would take hers off. Sayuri panics and the Baron starts removing her obi. He did not violate her, just merely looked at her. Rumors spread that Sayuri is now a worthless Meiko (Meiko must be virgins for their mizuage; their first sexual experience which is sold to the highest bidder). With her debut not far away Sayuri has to mend all wounds with the patrons who heard the rumors that Hatsumomo spread. The bidding begins and Dr. Crab, one of Sayuri’s patrons, wins her mizuage. Sayuri then becomes a geisha, and unexpectedly is adopted by oka-san and is the head of the okiya. Pumpkin is extremely upset for that was her dream. Sayuri is given yet another name, Nitta Sayuri (taking the name of the okiya is a custom in the geisha world). She then obtains a danna, a general in the army whom she doesn’t really like. War is declared on Japan. Sayuri’s danna leaves to fight in the war and is killed. Nobu, a patron and good friend, takes Sayuri into hiding in northern Japan. She lives there for years working at a dye factory owned by Nobu’s friend. Nobu comes for her and offers to become her danna. Sayuri, still in love with the Chairman, doesn’t know what to say. Nobu says that before she answers Sayuri and Pumpkin need to entertain a party with an American general to try and make peace. She accepts and tries to look like the geisha she was years before. Nobu clearly doesn’t like the General so Sayuri uses the general to make Nobu hate her. Sayuri tells Pumpkin to bring Nobu to the warehouse later at night. Sayuri brings the General with her and starts to be intimate with him. The door opens and instead of bringing Nobu as Sayuri asked, Pumpkin brought the Chairmen! The Chairmen sees and walks away. Sayuri runs to Pumpkin and asks why she would bring the Chairmen. Pumpkin says that Sayuri stole the one thing that she wanted, to be adopted by oka-san. She took what Sayuri wanted as vengeance. Sayuri is depressed. She almost certainly lost the one she loved. She gets invited to a small get together and is surprised to find that the only person in the tea house is the Chairmen. He begins by saying that Nobu was supposed to come but heard about what happened and now is livid at her. He continues that he was the one who told Nobu because he understood Sayuri’s intentions. He says that Pumpkin explained and begins to kiss Sayuri. He confesses his love to her and offers to become her danna.A danna is not a husband. Danna’s are usually married and have a geisha as a mistress. No matter how much she would like to marry the Chairmen she can’t. Sayuri moves to America because of a feud with who would inherit the Iwamura Electric Company, the Chairmen’s son-in-law married to the daughter he had with his wife or a rumored son with his mistress, Sayuri. She moves to New York and the Chairmen visits regularly.The book ends with Sayuri saying that the day Mr. Tanaka took her away was the worst and best day of her life. She says, “As a young girl I believed my life would never have been a struggle if Mr. Tanaka hadn’t torn me away from my (house Yoriodo). But now I know that our world is no more permanent than a wave rising on the ocean. Whatever our struggles and triumphs, however we may suffer them, all too soon they bleed into a wash, just like watery ink on paper.”I would highly recommend reading this book. It’s a window into a different world and makes you admire but pity the geisha. ‘Memoirs of a Geisha’ is an empowering novel that every person should read to appreciate what they have.

28,1673833839,06/20/2016,1.0,"Read as part of The Infinite Variety Reading Challenge, based on the BBC's Big Read Poll of 2003.There's nothing positive about this book, so let's just go straight in to why it was so bad.The narrative was unbelievable. And I don't mean ""OMGA DID YOU SEE THAT?"" kind of unbelievable, I mean it was so unconvincing it was dire. At not point did it feel like a woman, a Geisha, a girl, a human being was telling me a story. It felt so flat and boring and my gosh, she was tedious. She had the emotional range of an egg.The world description was non-existent. The beginning, when we are in the Japanese countryside, was the only part that was descriptive: we had a lovely house and lovely scenery, and then we moved to Tokyo and all of a sudden it's just grey and stone, and that's it. And oddly empty of people. No atmosphere, no city scenery; it was vague at best. It could have still been happening in the fish factory.There also needs to be an amendment to the Bechdel Test. 3.1: Two women have a conversation about something that isn't just bitching about other women.And, whilst I don't agree that ""culture"" automatically means you forgive something, and I realise it was a different time and a different place, but I don't want to read about creepy old men who creep about pubic hair growing on twelve year olds' vaginas. I just don't.And I know this is the most unhinged and incoherent review ever, but I also didn't find myself learning anything particular about Geisha. In fact, I'd agree with most other reviewers and say it was far too Westernised and almost Romanticised.Fun Fact Amendment: All Geisha were originally men. Think about that.

29,731292,04/15/2007,4.0,"Memoirs of a Geisha is an amazing novel that discusses the life of a Geisha, a Japanese artist-entertainer. Both its very exotic setting, with its extremely different value system, and its fascinating plot, which grabs your interest early on and keeps you waiting for more all along, contribute to making this novel a special book worthy of reading.The best quality in this novel, in my opinion, is the way the narrator (Chiyo), tells the story. Her reflections concerning much of the events in the novel are very similar to those of the reader. At least I felt I could connect with her, and approved of – even if I didn't always agree with – many of her actions. The pain she suffered is well-depicted in the novel, we almost start to feel that pain with her; we often share the same surprises with her about the different things a geisha should or should not do, and even share the pleasures of success regardless of the fact that most of us despise the geisha way of life.A slave, sold by your own family, and trained for the sole purpose of pleasuring men, whether you like it or not. Imagine living such a life; I know I cannot. Yet, at some point, you are happy that Chiyo succeeded in becoming a geisha. If that's an indication of anything, it's the skills of the author.They say a geisha is no prostitute; well, that may be true, but as the story truly shows, the main revenue for a geisha is through sex, at least when she is a successful one. To me, sex for money, no matter how much you sugar coat it, is still some form of prostitution.I don't like what she did with Nobu, but I understand her perspective. Our emotions are not necessarily affected by how other people treat us, but by how we feel about their behavior. The chairman in my opinion was much more the Chiyo type than Nobu is, and her dedication to reach him amazes me, though not the methods she used to achieve it after her desperation. The destruction of Hatsumomo was, in my opinion, the brightest point in the story. I feel that the story, and the geisha life, has changed forever after the Second World War, so Chiyo, or any other geisha at the time for that matter, could not have been more successful after the war, nor could the story be more fun.Yet, another bright point was the encounter with the Chairman. Since Pumpkin caused the Chairman to run into Chiyo and the Minister, I knew the Chairman and Chiyo are going to have a future together. In fact, when Iwamura Electric called for Chiyo to the Ichiriki Teahouse, I guessed – correctly – that Nobu won't be there, but the Chairman.The most disappointing thing in this novel, in my opinion, is the way the author talked about the US. If the novel had talked about any other place than his country, this might have been tolerable, but when an American author, writing a novel that takes place in Japan for the most part, makes the main character fall in love with the US, and talks about it like a country much better than Japan, there is something wrong. Unless, and I hope this is the case, he did this mainly because the actual geisha upon which he based his novel had described this to him. Then I might accept it.",66,0.9957,0.066,0.755,0.179,0.5095189504373178,POSITIVE,0.9833

This book is an awful example of a white man writing an Asian woman's perspective, benefiting financially from doing so, and contributing to the silencing and fetishization of Asian women. T.J. describes it very well in his review: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...This article also does an excellent job of going in-depth about how problematic this book is: https://kyotojournal.org/culture-arts...I wonder if this book was published today if people would have spoken out about it more like they did about American Dirt. I hope so.Original review from 2011:People were skeptical when Kathryn Stockett wrote in the voice of two black women in The Help. Arthur Golden took it to another level when he, a white, middle-aged man, narrated as an orphaned Japanese girl on her way to becoming a geisha.It worked, though. Even without knowledge of Golden's extensive experience studying Japanese culture and history, the reader is led to believe that the protagonist is telling the story herself. Memoirs of a Geisha transported me to a different era, where superficiality and beauty were more important traits for a women than practicality and intelligence.I enjoyed the writing style Golden utilized with this book, especially the analogies. Here are two I marked:""For it's one thing to find your secrets suddenly exposed, but when your own foolishness has exposed them... well, if I was prepared to curse anyone, it was myself... A shopkeeper who leaves his window open can hardly be angry at the rainstorm for ruining his wares.""""Her skin was waxy-looking, and her features puffy. Or perhaps I was only seeing her that way. A tree may look as beautiful as ever; but when you notice the insects infecting it, and the tips of the branches that are brown from disease, even the trunk seems to lose some of its magnificence.""A great read - I am so thankful for my friend who bought me this as a birthday present.

33,24911607,06/19/2008,2.0,"The book in itself presents an interesting story, and makes for an entertaining read, but what bothers me about this book is that the vast majority of Western readers interpret it as a historically accurate memoir, when in fact it was written by an American author for an American audience, and therefore has achieved its success through appealing to and reinforcing the stereotypes about Japanese culture in America. Another reviewer on this website writes, ""It is a wonderful introduction to... Japanese culture,"" illustrating how many Western readers (including countless personal friends) interpret the lifestyle and culture depicted in Memoirs of a Geisha as absolute historical fact.In the tradition of Ruth Benedict's The Chrysanthemum and the Sword, Golden presents Japan and Japanese culture as ""exotic"" and ""strange,"" reinforcing the major theses of the Nihonjinron (which literally means ""theories about the Japanese"") genre..When looking at ever-popular images of a lone, white man in a crowded Tokyo street, many Westerners see the surrounding Japanese as identical to one another, and inherently different from that white man and his native culture, a belief that Golden's novel only serves to perpetuate. What disappoints me the most is that Golden holds a degree in Japanese History, and still the inaccuracies and stereotypes that he was raised with win out over historical fact in his writing. In conclusion, Golden presents an interesting story in Memoirs of a Geisha that should only be read if the reader is prepared to believe none of it.Additional readings: Yellow by Frank H.

Memoirs is about the life of this peasanth girl, Sayuri, in pre and post-WW2 Japan who is sold into life as an apprentive Geisha, and then ultimately, an actual Geisha. The novel is full of these really great, vivid details of a variety of characters: gorgeous but evil rivals, the heinous older ladies who run the Geisha houses and practically enslave these girls, and the Geishas' patrons. Readers discover the world of the Geisha through the eyes of Sayuri, as she struggles to find her place in this society and at the same time, follow her heart(very cliche, I know, but I don't want to give away the story!). So the Geisha are women in Japan who are trained in the arts - playing music, dancing, acting, performing tea ceremonies, etc. They make their living entertaining wealthy Japanese men (business men, doctors, political figures), usually in large groups, in tea houses. In pretty rare cases, some of the most popular Geisha undergo a binding ceremony where the geisha is hooked up for life with a Dannah- a very wealthy man who supports her and takes care of her, in exchange for intimacy with her. There are some pretty disgusting scenarios in the book where they just come off like highly-paid prostitutes, but for the most part, the girls in the book are very colorful, strong-willed, and interesting.

From what I read, the history portrayed in Memoirs of a Geisha was rather close to the truth, minus the made-up characters.""Because, you see, when a geisha wakes up in the morning she is just like any other woman. ...

The characters in the story attribute Sayuri's startling blue eyes to an abundance of water in her soul. Throughout the book, she's alluding to water — how it flows, bends and can wear down rocks.

42,108596520,06/24/2010,3.0,"The Book Report: The politics of the okiya, or geisha house, closely examined through the rise of Chiyo, an unpromising girl sold into slavery by her peasant family, to become Sayuri, a sought-after and renowned geisha in pre-WWII Kyoto.Chiyo's arrival in the okiya is inauspicious, and her introduction into the horrible world of all-female hatreds and politics comes at a heavy price. She attempts to run away back to the family that sold her into slavery in the first place, which shows that kids don't think in logical patterns; fortunately, she falls off the roof and breaks her arm. Her friendship with a fellow slave, Pumpkin, thus begins, and with it the events that will lead her into rivalry with Hatsumomo, the okiya's lead geisha, and ultimately into her new identity as Sayuri, a full-fledged geisha.Golden treats us to the full world of geisha, including its roots as slavery and its unpalatable customs, such as misuage, the ritualized and monetized deflowering of barely pubescent girls as a preparatory step to their ascent into geishahood.Sayuri lives through the tribulations of having only a minimal say in the men she must serve as companion, as hetaira, as whore; she falls in love with one man, whom she cannot, for good reasons, pursue a relationship with; and she uses her wits, her wiles, and her body to survive and thrive during the national trauma of WWII and its aftermath. By the end of the story, Sayuri is a free woman, possessed of a life many many women across the world would envy, and telling us the remarkable and astonishing story of a slave girl's rise to wealth and position. My Review: Quite a lovely book to read, and really very nicely made. Well, except for that whole missing bit that we like to call “World War Two.” The author spends what, five pages maybe, on the *entire*second*world*war. One whole star off for that, so we're down to four.Then there's the whole issue of sourcing. Golden interviewed an actual reitred geisha and used her life as a basis for his novel. Nothing untoward there, is there? Well, apparently so...the lady was acknowledged in the book and she was subject to death threats and other reprisals. She sued Golden and the publishers, claiming breach of contract, and got an out-of-court settlement. Then she went on to publish her memoirs! After getting the settlement for having her privacy broached! Oh gross. Greed is a turn-off for me, and so, despite the fact that Golden didn't do jack poop wrong, half a star off. Three and a half, for those counting along.But the last half star vanished more recently than I read the book (back in 1999). It went away because Arthur Golden's source, Mineko Iwasaki, painted in her memoir a very very different picture of her life and that of a modern geisha than Golden did. Different enough that I felt the novel, representing itself as an accurate portrayal of a geisha's life, was flying false colors. It's fiction, so changing stuff up is normal and acceptable, but the background of the book is what made it interesting, the world of the okiya and its rituals and its rhythms were the *point* of my reading the book...and the source herself, in a polite Japanese way, said “pfui” to it.And now we're at three stars.

Of course I realize this story is historical fiction and may not correctly depict the life of a geisha during the 1930s and 1940s in Japan in its entirety. I do feel, however, that I know quite a bit more about the geisha than I did before reading this book - both because of the book itself and of it inspiring me to research a little on my own. My heart was absolutely broken for Sayuri (Chiyo) almost from the get-go. I cannot even begin to fathom how desperate a parent would have to be to sell his or her children into the life of slavery. You may argue that the geisha were not slaves, but when you have absolutely no other choice, you are a slave at least to your circumstances. The women of the okiya were so horrible to Sayuri. I understand they also led terrible lives, but that does not excuse cruelty toward a child. I did have to confront my distaste of polygamy in this book. To my understanding, Japanese marriages, at least during this time period, were mostly arranged among the upper class. They didn't marry for love. I still couldn't help feeling sorry for the wives of the men who were patrons of the geisha. I can only imagine how hurt I would feel if my husband became the danna of another woman. I would feel betrayed at the very least. (view spoiler)[While I did very much want Sayuri and the Chairman to end up together, him being married was a hard pill to swallow.

I felt that he did truly love Sayuri, and while she shouldn't have been with him if she didn't truly love him in return, I was simply saddened at the cruelty of life for him.

47,7618136,10/12/2007,3.0,"A beautiful story that explores the secret world of the Japanese geisha (if you think that geisha = prostitue, you need to read this book just to learn how wrong that assumption is), told in the style of an interview with a woman named Sayuri Nitta, who used to be one of the most famous geisha in Kyoto. My favorite parts of the story were the detailed descriptions of geisha beauty rituals (they wax their hair and sleep with their necks resting on wooden blocks so they don't mess up the hairstyles) and tradtions (when a geisha leaves her okiya, or geisha house, a spark is struck against her back for good luck). The descriptions of the kimono worn by Sayuri and the other geisha in the book are also gorgeous. The only part of this book that I didn't love was Sayuri's constant adoration of a man know only as the Chairman. Sayuri meets him when she's eight, and because he's kind to her and buys her a flavored ice, she decides that she's going to become a geisha just so she can meet him again. Did I mention that the chairman was about forty at the time? I didn't have a lot of faith in the level of Sayuri's love for him, and just couldn't wrap my head around the idea of an eight-year-old girl falling in love with a man more than thirty years her senior. UPDATE: So, I wrote this review when I was in high school and didn't know much about the actual writing process of this book. Turns out Arthur Golden didn't actually do that much real research and had a bad habit of just making shit up. This book apparently pissed off a real geisha so much that she wrote her own book in response. I'm writing this update now because today in my literature class we were talking about how we all basically read only British and American books, and this one girl starts talking about how she used to only read American books and then one day read Memoirs of a Geisha and it just, like, totally opened her eyes to other cultures. And everyone is looking at her like she just said that watching The Godfather helped her understand Italian history. So basically what I'm saying is, don't come to this story looking for historical accuracy. It's still a good story, just not necessarily an accurate one. Think of it as fiction, and you'll be fine.

I happened to devour all 400+ pages in one weekend trip in the mountains of New Hampshire, just a few weeks shy of a trip to Japan myself, and I am so happy I chose this book before my trip. Arthur Golden only wrote one work of fiction that I can tell (this one) but it does not lessen the impact his prose and story had on the literary world, at least in the West (not sure how this was actually received in Japan). Historical fiction authors are often guilty of focusing so much on their settings and events that they neglect a vital part of the story - character, and a lack of inventive and smooth prose. Golden is guilty of neither, and paints a rich story that reads more like an autobiography of the protagonist Chiyo, than a regular run of the mill novel. At times, I even found myself forgetting that this was fiction. Such is the power of the story in  Memoirs of a Geisha. Also, Hatsumomo, the story’s villain, may be one of my favorite antagonists ever - once you realize the tragic societal factors at play that led to her position in life, you’ll realize that life is never so simple, something that Golden drives home in this wonderful book time and time again.",37,-0.2763,0.115,0.771,0.114,0.5742968836718837,POSITIVE,0.9998
49,1779243463,12/15/2016,4.0,"3.5 Stars - Great book. It took me a few chapters to get into the story and the characters – just about everything. The opening is fine but that’s it, just fine. I wasn’t pulled into the story in any way. Mediocre may be too strong of a word for the first three to four chapters but it definitely teeters on mediocre.There are many different ways to draw me into a book but mostly I have to feel some sort of connection to the characters. I didn’t feel that in the first few chapters here. Honestly, I don’t know why I kept reading but ultimately I’m glad I did. As for the characters, there’s not one character that I liked but I didn’t necessarily dislike or hate them either (except for Hatsumomo and Mother, those two I despise). Sayuri isn’t even that great of a person, and yet I was rooting for her, even through her stupid mistakes. I think part of the problem with the characters is that the situations they’re in and the culture they’re in are just so different than anything I’ve read before. I must sadly say that my reading experience tends to be heavy on the Western Hemisphere. I think I need to adapt my reading skills to really appreciate characters from other cultures. I say all that, and that doesn’t mean the characters aren’t well written. They are impeccably written and I can see that. I just don’t like the characters as people. I don’t like them but I do respect them, well I respect most of them. Part of the problem is that the whole subject matter was new to me so I was so focused on grasping certain concepts and understanding the Geisha experience/life that I forgot the little things. So much of the character “issue” is on me. But some of it is on the author because I’m not that terrible of a reader. One of the good things about the characters were their complex backstories and that for most of them, I could sympathize or at least understand why they were the way they were. For instance, Sayuri’s character development is fascinating to watch. Sure, she isn’t perfect but who is? I can relate to certain feelings of hers and that helps create a bond between myself and the main character. Though, I did always feel a certain disconnect. I will say that the author created someone, in my opinion, that is purely evil - Hatsumomo. I know her circumstances and life may not have always been kind to her but I’m a firm believer that people have choices. They can’t control what happens to them, but they can control how they act. Hatsumomo chose incorrectly. This may be a bit of a stretch but since I just finished Rebecca, I saw some major title characters between the title character and Hatsumomo. Both absolutely beautiful bitches that could fool people into believe they were better people than they actually were - less for for Hatsumomo at the end of the book though.The writing is fine and really plays to the scenes. By that I mean that when the author needs to be descriptive he uses beautiful, flowery language and when he needs to be more concise he molds his words to do just that. The author really knows how to form phrases and sentences and so on to create scenes. My main issue is that he doesn’t know how to break-up paragraphs. If I was taught anything in school, it’s that you can’t let a paragraph go on for too long because you lose your reader and this book certainly proves that point. It was straining on my eyes and I eventually had to go back over and read some of those arduous passages again. I thought the ending came up very fast. That is to say, (view spoiler)[that when Sayuri and the Chairman finally “got together” there were only a few chapters left. And that was even cut short because of Sayuri’s move to New York. I understand that this book is supposed to focus on her life as a Geisha, but I still felt short-changed. (hide spoiler)] When I finished, I can’t say I felt satisfied. It appears that Sayuri is happy, or at least content, with where life eventually brought here but I wasn’t satisfied as a reader. That’s probably because I wanted (view spoiler)[Sayuri and the Chairman to be together forever, as the cliche goes (even though I never got of the ridiculous age difference. Creeps me out a little) (hide spoiler)] but even as I write it I know that’s just not how the Geisha culture is. Overall, I can happily recommend this book. It’s a great book and even though I’m not sure I actually liked it I appreciated it and the storyline. ",35,0.9987,0.064,0.754,0.182,0.5740920125626008,NEGATIVE,0.8247

Unfortunately, the real narrator, Arthur Golden, took some dramatic liberties with history and cultural practices, and the fallacious elements sprinkled throughout detract from a potentially fascinating story. (This may not present a major issue to a reader who has no prior knowledge of Japanese culture, but such a reader should also be warned NOT to take this book as a factual representation of life in Japan.)Additionally, although the narrative starts strong, it loses momentum partway through the story. By the time the inevitable tremors of World War II began to shake the cultural bedrock of Japan, I was already beginning to lose interest in the artificial suspense.Overall, the book is written fairly well, and I can see why some readers would like it... but even while I was reading, I couldn't help feeling that I should have enjoyed it more.",34,0.0876,0.152,0.702,0.145,0.4868055555555554,NEGATIVE,0.976

54,3221856197,03/07/2020,4.0,"American author Arthur Golden studied Japanese art and history at Harvard and Columbia and did extensive research to write this fictional account of the life of a geisha in Kyoto before, during and after WW II. And it shows: The story offers a lot of information about the time and the profession, and the storyline, though rather conventionally crafted, unfolds wonderfully. At the same time, the text is clearly targeted at a Western audience that also wants to be enchanted and entertained, and this aspect of exoticism combined with a certain degree of kitsch is a little questionable. Our protagonist and first-person narrator is Sayuri who, as a 9-year-old child, is sold into slavery and forced to become a geisha - but her dream is not to be free, but to be loved by the so-called chairman, a powerful, married businessman. Maybe it is unfair to frame the story like that, because Sayuri grows up and has to survive in a world where the idea of a woman living on her own terms would be fantastical, but still, there is a degree of romanticization of the ""Pretty Woman"" variety, Eastern style. Then again, ""Pretty Woman"" is great fun and a classic, and so is this book. And it's certainly not without its literary merits: Golden does a great job illustrating the life in Kyoto's geisha district, the dependence and fear that comes with the job, the focus on reputation and superficial traits - but the novel never gets gritty, and even when Sayuri's virginity is auctioned off, the sex scene does not make it seem like this is a woman undergoing trauma because she has to give her body to the highest bidder to get rid of her debt and because custom requires it. While the chairman is portrayed as a real romantic interest, he is de facto more of a fantasy than a real-life character, a man Sayuri hardly knows and onto whom she projects her love (the ending makes the whole thing even more surreal). This always remains a comfortable read, which isn't necessarily a plus considering what Sayuri has to undergo. We accompany Sayuri from her childhood in a fishing village through her training in Kyoto, we learn about the occupation of a geisha and the course of history and often, it's utterly fascinating to read. Golden interviewed several geisha for this novel, among them Mineko Iwasaki who later sued him for defamation and using confidential information (they settled out of court). The movie version of the book looks stunning and won three Oscars for Cinematography, Art Direction and Costume Design. So all in all, this has the flaws of a popular book explaining complex cultural phenomena while aiming at a broad audience, but it is still intelligent and just very fun to read.",34,0.9981,0.052,0.742,0.206,0.5244711538461538,POSITIVE,0.9994
55,1777126120,06/03/2019,5.0,"Two sisters in a poor, remote fishing village are sold off and sent to Kyoto. Thus the epic tale begins, with an abundance of distinct characters influencing the life of Chiyo, the younger sister: there's her age-mate and immediate consoler,Pumpkin, the elderly and grumbling Granny, money-obsessed Mother, and Auntie, a failed geisha with a walking disability. Also living in the geisha house is the famous and ill-mannered geisha, Hatsumomo, renowned for her wickedness and dazzling beauty, and most importantly, Mameha, who becomes her future mentor and guardian. All these characters and their actions form a grand cultural-historical soap opera that spans decades.The prose is elegant and the character development exquisite. As you read, you become immersed into a world of a different time and place. As Japanese culture is extremely complex, this was no small feat on the part of the author.The other feature of the novel examines the phenomenon that when women are reduced to slaves and prostitutes in a male-dominated society, i.e. when their livelihood depends solely on appeasing the other sex, they will turn upon each other, trying by all means to destroy one another so that they will be the only one holding men's favor. Women can be as poisonous and merciless as you can imagine when it is a matter of survival. In this respect, the novel reminds me of the story told in Raise the Red Lantern: Three Novellas, which I did not read but saw the movie.The main source for Mr. Golden's book was Mineko Iwasaki, a retired geisha he had interviewed for background information while writing the novel. Iwasaki later went on to write an autobiography, which shows a very different picture of twentieth-century geisha life than the one shown in Golden's novel Geisha, a Life.There had been quite a bit of criticism of the book from Japanese readers regarding insensitivity and inaccuracies in portryaing japanese culture, which may be justified, however I gave it 5 stars soley for the reading pleasure.

Historical romances can go either way for me and this one most definitely went the right way. The writing was gorgeous and the characters were perfection. I hated it when I had to put this book down at the end of the night, but I knew that every time I picked it back up that I would instantly be transported back to Sayuri’s vibrant world. My favorite detail was when the author described the color and pattern on any one of the many kimonos mentioned in the story. I would pause and imagine one before me, wishing it was there so I could take my hand and gently graze my fingers across the intricate pattern worked into it. I was pleasantly surprised by the romance hidden away in the folds of the story and was emotionally torn by the options available to Sayuri and which would be preferred. I went in to the story expecting a relationship of duty, forced by the world to benefit one and leave the other desiring more.

And that is just for starters. I was thoroughly immersed in this story, which is based on interviews with former geishas, so although fiction, it mirrors the life of women who practiced ""the art'.The Western world generally has little understanding of this culture and assumes that being a geisha means being a prostitute. In English, it is easier defined as indentured servant, artist, paid companion and mistress. I based these definitions on the following facts. Indentured servant: Young women (even children) are sold by their parents to the owner of a geisha house and are treated poorly as maids (scrubbing floors, washing clothes, etc) in their first few years of residence as they are evaluated on their potential earning power.Artist: Those considered worthy enter a rigorous training/education program which teaches the art of the unusual make-up worn by only geishas, conversational skills, manners and deportment, the complicated and exotic tea ceremony, music, and dance.Paid companion: The girls are then hired (although the house gets the majority of the money) to attend social events where their main purpose is decorative and to provide companionship to those wealthy men in attendance. But sex is not part of the package.Mistress: Once a girl has established herself as popular, her virginity is sold to the highest bidder. She may become his mistress or the mistress of another wealthy patron which is the ultimate prize for the geisha. If not, she will continue as a paid companion throughout her career.And so the story of Sayuri unfolds through the various landmarks of her career and we meet the interesting characters that populate her life. The story is told in the first person which gives it authenticity and Sayuri's point of view and impressions which are necessary to fully understand the culture of the geisha.

65,2174062031,11/18/2017,4.0,"I finally got around to reading this book! I've had it sitting in the bookcase for time, so I'm glad to say I've read it. I was almost afraid it would disappoint, but I'm happy to say, disappoint it did not. This novel really is quite something. The story is told in such an exquisite style, that it captures your interest from the very beginning. The story tells us of the life of a Geisha, called Chiyo. The setting in which the story is told is beautiful and I felt as if I was with Chiyo, in her story. Japan has always fascinated me, and this has just made me feel like I'd love to learn more. As the reader, I felt rather connected to Chiyo somewhat, or at least to a certain extent. Many of the choices she made or was forced to make, I could certainly relate to, even if I didn't necessarily agree with them. When she felt pain, the narration was written in such as way, that you, as the reader, could prominently feel that pain too. The life of a Geisha really interests me, and this book helped feed that interest. I simply cannot imagine what it would be like to be sold as a slave by your own family, just to be trained up, to live a life just pleasuring men. It sends shivers down my spine just to even think about it. I do disagree with a Geisha not being classed as a prostitute. That may be how it is seen through their eyes, but a Geisha's main income comes from them having sex. I think sex, especially when it involves any kind of payment, is a form of prostitution.The ending of the story I found to be rather abrupt, and I didn't feel fully satisfied when I'd closed the book. I think I still have a few questions that will remain unanswered. Overall though, it remains a remarkable book and I can understand why it is such a classic.

66,11553338,01/03/2008,5.0,"Read it in four days, couldn't put it down. I had to keep remembering that it wasn't 100% true. But I think that it was as close as we could have gotten. Mineko - The geisha that Golden interviewed did a great job on educating him on the way of a Geisha according to a lecture he gave. I wasn't as shocked as everyone else seemed to be about the way things were in Japan. Women were not permitted to think or act for themselves. And just like everywhere else, there really wasn't any use for a daughter except to marry her off to a husband with money in hopes of securing future for the daughter's parents and family. There was also a strict code of honor and respect among geishas and the Japanese culture. That is what prevented Sayuri from acting out on Hatsumomo and why she couldn't reveal her feelings nor could the chairman disrespect his friend to be with Sayuri. I admired that about The Chairman and Sayuri, they did what they knew was right and did not follow their feelings. In the end, look where it got them. They were happy, growing old together, probably had a child, she lived peacefully and very well in New York taken care of until the day she died. I wonder what would have happened to Sayuri if she acted out and exchanged Hatsumomo's make-up with rat poison. More than likely, she would have been thrown out of the house and made into a prostitute until she died. In the end, Hatsumomo ended up suffering because she didn't follow the code of honor. Also, fate punished Sayuri for disobeying, when she tried to escape and fell off the roof and I'm sure that had an effect on her future decision makings.I wish that Sayuri was able to reunite with her sister but in a way I'm glad that they didn't and avoided the typical Hollywood ending. Sayuri reminded me a lot of Scout from To Kill a Mockingbird. She had her own way of seeing things but they were always clever and accurate. I loved the part when she says that her the back of her father's head was as old and his face but it was smooth like an egg, not deep set in wrinkles. There's living proof in every bald head of why stress and worry creates wrinkles in the face.Other characters: The Doctor - warped and twisted at least he was useful in help Mameha win the bet against Mother and secured Sayuri place in the house.The Baron - Hated that he hurt Mameha by going after Sayuri - His disrespectfulness got him in the end.The Chairman - A man that believed in honor and respect above all. And he was rewarded for it until his death.Nobu - Despite his rudeness and abruptness, he did care for Sayuri and made sure she was safe. I wish we learned what happened to him in the end but based on the pattern of the story those who lived with honor, died with honor.Mameha - Loved her, she was smart, sweet, strong - she didn't let anyone push her around and her subtleness was just as effective in getting what she wants as any man. Actually it was better because no one realized that they helped her so they never came back to be repaid.Pumpkin - Started out sweet and nice but finally acted out after years of betrayal. She was abused and used by Hatsumomo and the household, lied to about being adopted, forced to prostitution during the war. If Sayuri wasn't so wrapped up in her own issues she might have been able to see past herself and try to help Pumpkin more. Despite Pumpkin's betrayal to Sayuri, I hope she went against the pattern of the book and lived the rest of her years happily. Probably the smartest, after all, up until the end, Sayuri thought that Pumpkin made a mistake in bringing the Chairman to the theater instead of Nobu. Never thought that Pumpkin did it on purpose.http://www.randomhouse.com/vintage/re... - The official site about the bookhttp://www.theherald.org/issues/03089... - Recap of a lecture Arthur Golden gavehttp://www.cnn.com/books/dialogue/990... - Interview with Arthur Golden about the book.",27,0.9971,0.093,0.719,0.189,0.5318928198238543,POSITIVE,0.7461

Those who know me and my iranian feminism view of things know that despite my free spirit in all matters, I’m truly a strict critic of men writing about women especially as the case of this book, writing from the point of view of the woman, however...This story of destiny, hope, despair, love, lust, friendship, womanhood, identity and history resonated with me.

70,2796462663,04/23/2019,1.0,"This is not a memoir. Do your research people! Arthur Golden invented it all, and shamelessly used up Mineko (the retired geisha) who trusted him enough to tell him her life story. A real story and not the fiction printed on these pages. Mineko received death threats because of his lies. These are serious things. Many Asian women were sexually assaulted by Western man because of books like this one, books that paint them as promiscuous prostitutes. This author was sued for breach of contract for mentioning Mineko in the acknowledgements and as they came to some kind of agreement in the court, I don't think the author still advertises this novel as a true story, but didn't he use to do in the past? At any rate, a lot of people think that was Golden wrote was based on a real life account and that is definitely not the case. What do I think about his actions? Not only did the author trivialize and insult Japanese culture but he invented the whole thing. It is fiction, not memoir. Obviously nobody cares about that. What interest me is how readers be so stupid (or perhaps better to say culture ignorant) as to think this is a memoir? Haven't you noticed passages literally rewritten from Gone with the Wind? That episode when the heroine hides her hands after having to work during the war. Gone With the Wind rip off for sure. There are other Western movie references that I can think of but forgive me if I don't feel too inclined to overly analyze this excuse for a novel. So, what do I think about this novel? If the author wasn't so immoral in advertising it falsely, had he been clear it was all invention- it would still be a terrible and shameless book. I mean maybe I could give it two stars if it was placed in an imaginary land. The story isn't great as such, but apart from being wildly racist, it's somewhat readable. Nevertheless, it is a shameless and racist attack on Japanese culture. The author should be ashamed of himself. ",25,-0.959,0.161,0.716,0.123,0.4823350694444445,NEGATIVE,1.0

We forget that there are innocent victims on both sides of battles that are usually started by our worldly governments. The people in the middle and the poor are always caught in the middle trying to survive. The proud Geisha Women were just those poor women caught in bad situations blessed by one gift - beauty or exotic elegance enough to become a thing of beauty as a slave in the hands of men to exist in a world ; not live, but exist.

74,2366890547,04/19/2018,4.0," 3.5/5 stars Despite its popularity, I was hesitant to pick up Memoirs of a Geisha. I know its portrayal of both Japanese and Geisha culture stirred quite the controversy. I, unfortunately, cannot comment on that since my knowledge in both subject areas is limited. Instead, I based my review on the rich narrative, social commentary, and characters of this story. Although I grew up in a different culture and time, I could not help seeing myself in Chiyo. Chiyo is taken from her village and sold to an Okiya, a geisha boarding school, in Kyoto. Her future success now depends on her ability to build a rapport with influential men. Although Chiyo has peculiar grey eyes and beauty, her pathway is unbecoming. She is forced to sacrifice her autonomy; recognize romance as a façade, and auction off her virginity.  Amidst these hardships, Chiyo remains unwavering in her resilience, and decides to weave her turmoil into an opportunity.  I found the hope she holds for a better life to be inspiring. I am surprised Arthur Golden is the author of this book.  If I had not known, I would have assumed a former geisha wrote it.  The way Chiyo describes her metamorphosis into womanhood feels authentic and relatable. I remember going through a similar experience when I graduated high school. Before I enrolled in university, my mother described my life as an egg. I mean, I was the textbook definition of an introverted teenager. Other than extracurriculars, all I did was go to school, walk home, and study. When I was in high school, my family was not wealthy enough to afford vacations, summer camps, or any after-school programs. So of course, as someone who grew up in such an isolated manner, I was started when I came to university. I had the privilege of learning from talented educators and forming connections with people from around the globe. As my worldview broadened, I had to accept that I was no longer a child. I was a woman with growing responsibilities. And to be honest, I mourned my childhood a lot when I turned 18. But unlike Chiyo, I was not forced to leave every aspect of my old life behind. I still had my parents, childhood friends, and siblings. I could hop on a bus and be back in my hometown within hours. But Chiyo would never return to her village or be reunited with her family. She learned to accept her fate, but this conclusion was not reached without pain. The author described the sorrow she felt leaving the remnants of her childhood behind beautifully. It is clear that destiny is a dominant notion in this book, and I believe it was what made the story feel fluid. Chiyo never had the opportunity to live a stable life, but her time spent on Earth was enjoyable and remarkable all the same.  When I finished this book, I saw the sporadic events in her life as strings tying together to form a beautiful ending.  It made me reflect on how the unexpected events of my own life shaped my future self for both the better and worse. Overall, I saw Chiyo as an inspiration. She reminded me that we often have no control over our fate. Yet, we must hold onto the reins of hope and let it guide us. It is difficult to not throw the towel and give up, especially when everything seems so bleak. To keep going despite hardship takes a great deal of courage and fortitude. Things might not turn out perfectly for any of us, but at the end, all we can do is try. And Chiyo has convinced me to keep persevering.I could not give this book a 5-star rating because, in my opinion, it was not a page-turner. I was not fighting my circadian rhythm to stay up reading this book. Although the story was graceful and thought-provoking, I found some parts to be quite dull. Nonetheless, this was an interesting story, and despite my reservations, I would recommend it. Golden is also a talented writer; he sucks you into the story. He made me believe I was spending a day in the geisha district of Kyoto. To end off, I wanted to share a quote from the book that I liked: ""I never seek to defeat the main I am fighting,"" he explained. ""I seek to defeat his confidence. A mind troubled by doubt cannot focus on the course to victory. Two men are equals -  true  equals - only when they both have equal confidence"" ",24,0.9969,0.076,0.762,0.162,0.5345559334845049,POSITIVE,0.536

79,82471011,07/04/2019,3.0,"So I just want to say that while this story was entertaining to read, I struggle to give it higher than 3 Stars because I’m aware of the situation with Arthur Golden & the geisha he interviewed, Mineko Iwasaki, while writing this book. The short of it is, he said he would not reveal her identity, then went back on his word. She ended up suing him & writing her own memoir as a direct rebuttal to Golden’s portrayal of geisha life & Japanese tradition called Geisha, a Life. More in depth accounts of what happened are available online if you’re interested!I am not an expert on this aspect of Japanese culture & so any errors present were not at all obvious to me, but I’ve read that Golden lacked much of the nuance necessary to tell this story. Being a white American man, I’m not sure the story of a Japanese geisha was the best material for him to tackle, even in the context of historical fiction. The most authentic portrayals come from people who actually identify with the group they are portraying, and I think it’s important to remember that when reading a book like this. You aren’t coming away from this novel with a genuine knowledge of what it was to be a geisha in the early 1900’s, but rather what I imagine is more of an Americanized drama that hijacks Japanese culture for the sake of entertainment.But at the end of the day, this is fiction.

The culture of this book is what interested me the most. The role women played and their place in society. Although this is merely ""based on actual events"", I kind of took a lot of it as what really went on. I've always thought of a Geisha like a prostitute, not as a companion/entertainer. I never thought about it being a career that they would have had special schools for young girls to attend. I can't imagine being born into that life where from an early age that is what you are destined to do. But culturally, it was so glamorous and it was like wanting to be famous.Coming from her background, I can see why Sayuri would aspire to be a Geisha and feel it was out of reach.

82,1934159975,05/01/2017,5.0,"Like “watching” an extended cut of my FAVORITE movie!This has been my absolute favorite movie for nearly a decade and now this book has crept into my favorite books of all time! (I have no idea why I waited so long to read it seeing as I was an instant fan of the movie). A most definite reread! I really feel like I got to watch an extended cut to my favorite movie by visualizing all of the characters so vividly while reading. Though I found this much different than the movie I was able to appreciate it as if I were getting to see alternate and extended scenes. I especially love how we got inside Sayuri’s head much more than how in the movie she just looks like this demure, meek doll. I feel like I got a sense of her true personality more (which don’t get me wrong she was portrayed so lovely in the film). I love hearing more of the back story of other characters and how the book went into deeper detail with certain scenes that the movie just kind of glossed over. For example I loved the visual in the movie of when they were styling Sayuri’s (Chiyo’s) hair when she was studying to be a Maiko but I didn’t know why it looked so painful and the book answered some of those questions by going into detail with how they combed hot wax through their hair to get it styled and shiny as they do and it made me understand more of why the rice would stick to their hair if they should fall off their pedestal pillow (takamakura) at night. They used the rice as a teaching method to get Geisha to sleep without mussing their hair otherwise it was a daily, painful trip to get their hair restyled. I seem to recall reading somewhere that a lot of practicing Geisha had balding later in life because of how hard the styling treatments were on their scalp. Nowadays I believe wigs are used. I loved having the culture described in much more detail as well. For example when Chiyo is to receive her new name the book went into more detail of how “Sayuri” was chosen: “The ceremony, which was attended by the mistress of the Ichiriki, lasted only about ten minutes. A maid brought a tray with several sake cups, and Mameha and I drank together. I took three sips from a cup, and then passed it to her and she took three sips. We did this with three different cups, and then it was over. From that moment on, I was no longer known as Chiyo. I was the novice geisha Sayuri. During the first month of apprenticeship, a young geisha is known as a “novice” and cannot perform dances or entertain on her own without her older sister, and in fact does little besides watching and learning. As for my name of Sayuri, Mameha had worked with her fortune-teller a long while to choose it. The sound of a name isn’t all that matters, you see; the meaning of the characters is very important as well, and so is the number of strokes used to write them—for there are lucky and unlucky stroke counts. My new name came from “sa”, meaning “together,” “yu,” from the zodiac sign for Hen—in order to balance other elements in my personality—and “ri,” meaning “understanding.” All the combinations involving the element from Mameha’s name, unfortunately, had been pronounced inauspicious by the fortune teller.” [Usually a novice geisha received their new name as an offshoot of their big sister’s name but they had found using “Mam” in Chiyo’s case was inauspicious.]One of my favorite parts of the book that went into so much greater detail than in the movie is when Mameha talks to Chiyo about her misfortune and lack of success in running away: ""Now, Chiyo, stumbling along in life is a poor way to proceed. You must learn how to find thetime and place for things. A mouse who wishes to fool the cat doesn't simply scamper out ofits hole when it feels the slightest urge. Don't you know how to check your almanac?""I don't know if you've ever seen an almanac. To open one and flip through the pages, you'dfind it crammed with the most complicated charts and obscure characters. Geisha are a verysuperstitious lot, as I've said. Auntie and Mother, and even the cook and the maids, scarcelymade a decision as simple as buying a new pair of shoes without consulting an almanac. ButI'd never checked one in my life.""It's no wonder, all the misfortunes you've experienced,"" Mameha told me. ""Do you mean tosay that you tried to run away without checking if the day was auspicious?""I told her my sister had made the decision when we would leave. Mameha wanted to know ifI could remember the date, which I managed to do after looking at a calendar with her; it hadbeen the last Tuesday in October 1929, only a few months after Satsu and I were taken fromour home.Mameha told her maid to bring an almanac for that year; and then after asking my sign-theyear of the monkey-she spent some time checking and cross-checking various charts, aswell as a page that gave my general outlook for the month. Finally she read aloud:"" 'A most inauspicious time. Needles, unusual foods, and travel must be avoided at all costs.'"" Here she stopped to look up at me. ""Do you hear that? Travel: After that it goes on to saythat you must avoid the following things . . . let's see . . . 'bathing during the hour of therooster,' 'acquiring new clothing,' 'embarking on new enterprises,' and listen to this one,'changing residences.'"" Here Mameha closed the book and peered at me. ""Were you carefulabout any of those things?""Many people have doubts about this sort of fortune-telling; but any doubts you might havewould certainly have been swept away if you'd been there to see what happened next.Mameha asked my sister's sign and looked up the same information about her. ""Well,"" shesaid after looking at it for a while, ""it reads, 'An auspicious day for small changes.' Perhapsnot the best day for something as ambitious as running away, but certainly better than theother days that week or the next."" And then came the surprising thing. ""It goes on to say, 'Agood day for travel in the direction of the Sheep,'"" Mameha read. And when she brought outa map and found Yoroido, it lay to the north northeast of Kyoto, which was indeed thedirection corresponding to the zodiac sign of the Sheep. Satsu had checked her almanac.That was probably what she'd done when she left me there in the room under the stairwell atthe Tatsuyo for a few minutes. And she'd certainly been right to do it; she had escaped, whileI hadn't.I’m always glad when I fall in love with a movie first because then there’s no disappointment in who is cast for the beloved roll of the book version…whereas when I read the book prior to any movie release I usually invent and fall in love with my character ideal.

83,102790278,05/14/2010,5.0,"'Memoirs of a Geisha' is an incredibly exquisite novel to read. The life of the Japanese geisha Sayuri, the main character, in 1930's Japan is so realistically described I believed at times I was reading an actual memoir. The writing is as liquid and lovely as an ornamental pond with a small designed waterfall. Reading this book is entirely all delight - which it shouldn't be considering the subject is about forced formalized prostitution. However, Arthur Golden is a beautiful writer, and luckily, his main protagonist (based on a real geisha's interview) Sayuri is a fighter, the type of woman who made lemonade from lemons.She was born with the name Chiyo, but she kept it only as long as she was an ordinary little 9-year-old girl, daughter of a small village fisherman, living in a typsy shack by the ocean with her dying mother and older sister, Satsu. After her mother took to her bed with cancer, her father sold her and Satsu to a rich industrialist, who in turn quickly sold them into prostitution in Kyoto, Japan. Satsu ended up performing as a low-end prostitute immediately, being transferred to a very low-class house, but Chiyo is given to a high-class okiya, a place where geishas were trained and indentured for life. Chiyo has a destiny she is forced to embrace because she has the luck to be a beautiful child with grey-blue eyes, and poor parents sick with bad health.She struggles against her dictated fate and succeeds in derailing the house's owners, Granny, Mother and Auntie, from their plans to train her as a geisha. She does this with with an attempt to run away, intending to return to her parents. Instead the escape ends in disaster and she is returned to the okiya by the neighbors, all of whom fully support the okiyas and the geisha system, because without the money produced by the party-girls, there would be a lot of suppliers and other businesses which would struggle to lure wealthy businessmen to spend. So, although she is returned to her owners, she is in disgrace. Granny and Mother make the decision she is too much of a risk to train as a geisha, an education which will cost the house thousands of dollars by the time Chiyo is a teen. She becomes a maid, cleaning and polishing while watching the magnificent geisha, Hatsumomo, already in place and supporting the entire house through the entertaining of men in tea-houses and invitations to appear on the stage in plays. Hatsumomo is so important to the survival of the entire okiya, she is permitted every angry vengeful attack on everyone who displeases her. She is careful to maintain her appearance and dancing, singing and music lessons, keeping within the boundaries for her behavior by the traditions of the institution of the geisha - a Japanese word which means 'artist entertainer'- but her angry neurotic spite leads her to abuse every member of the house, especially those whose beauty or geisha apprenticeship threaten her place in the hierarchy of the house. She has hopes of being adopted as Mother's daughter, which means she would inherit the okiya upon Mother's death.When Hatsumomo's number one Kyoto competition, Mameha, an independent geisha supported partially by a danna, shows up in the okiya one day, offering to become Chiyo's older sister, an official designation in geisha culture of a personal trainer, it changes Chiyo's path once again. No longer a maid, she is given a new name - Sayuri. While these momentous happenings are shifting Sayuri's life around like a windblown leaf, the Depression is causing starvation throughout Japan. However, Japan's industrialists are doing well, so the geishas are also doing well since they are hired to entertain the wealthy industrialists. It isn't until near the end of WWII the geisha enclaves feel the upheaval all of Japan, including the industrialists, soon feel because of losing the war. Meanwhile, Sayuri, who has decided to be the best geisha she can be, is having to defend herself against the malicious attacks by Hatsumomo against her character and reputation. If she cannot build her clientele list or if she loses a single male supporter, she could end up in rags once again, scrubbing toilets and starving. Only one can be left standing...whoever becomes Mother's adopted daughter. Game on...I have used current idioms for my review, gentle reader, but Sayuri's narration, and Golden's words, are far more eloquent and beautiful than my more mundane review. I should also mention, that while Sayuri eventually embraced the geisha life, had to be one for survival, and the book emphasizes the Fine Arts a geisha are trained in, fully describing the makeup, clothes and the ceremonial work behind being a professional companion, along with the cultural environment and traditions of mid-20th century Japan, she believes sex is far down the list of what is expected of a geisha. I do not share the geisha viewpoint in this. There would not be a geisha institution if not for the sexual desires and hierarchical dog-pack requirements of rich men. It simply boils down to whether a girl is a high-priced talented courtesan or a street whore by the price she charges for her services and what effort she makes at providing an illusion of having a good time with horrible men.Examples of Golden's superb writing ability :""The path from our house followed the edge of the sea cliffs before turning toward the village. Walking it on a day like this was difficult, but I remember feeling grateful that the fierce wind drew my mind from the things which troubled me. The sea was violent, with waves like stones chipped into blades, sharp enough to cut. It seemed to me the world itself was feeling just as I felt. Was life nothing more than a storm that constantly washed away what had been there only a moment before, and left behind something barren and unrecognizable?""""During those first few days in that strange place, I don't think I could have felt worse if I'd lost my arms and legs, rather than my family and home. I had no doubt life would never again be the same. All I could think of was my confusion and misery; and I wondered day after day when I might see Satsu again. I was without my father, without my mother--without even the clothing I'd always worn. Yet somehow the thing that startled me most, after a week or two had passed, was that I had in fact survived. I remember one moment drying rice bowls in the kitchen, when all at once I felt so disoriented I had to stop what I was doing to stare for a long while at my hands; for I could scarcely understand that this person drying the bowls was actually me.""

I probably would not have been interested in Memoirs of a Geisha had I not just moved to Japan. But I found it to be one of the best books I've ever read.When I first started reading the book, I wanted to see what Sayuri looked like, so I did a Google search. It was then that I realized the book I was reading was not a biography, but fiction. Had me fooled! Still, it's easy to imagine that it is a true story. Even though I've only lived in Tokyo for about two months, I see how all of this story could be completely true.I love Golden's characters! Pumpkin is so funny. Some of the lines he gives her crack me up! And Sayuri, of course, is an incredible character. Through her stories I laughed and even cried a couple of times. The stories themselves were so plain, just as Japanese people truly speak. The fact that an American man wrote this (and I believe it was his first novel) still amazes me. You'd swear it was really the memoir of a geisha.Several nights in a row I stayed up reading until 5am. I just couldn't get enough of this book.

91,2063269581,03/17/2018,4.0,"4 starsMemoirs of a Geisha is a first for me in that I read a book about a geisha. Mind you, I wouldn't say this is a 100% accurate story of a geisha since there are a few errors, but I will give props to Golden for actually interviewing geisha and going to Japan instead of him just writing it without context. Especially since this was written in the late 90s and I don't know if the internet at the time had lots of info on Japanese culture and geisha. There are two books by geisha who have talked about their geisha life. Geisha, A Life by Mineko Iwasaki and Autobiography of a Geisha by Sayo Masuda. If you're looking for a more in-depth account of geisha, then those two are the ones you want to read.To give a basic rundown, Memoirs of a Geisha centers around Chiyo Sakamoto, a young girl living in a poor fishing village with her older sister, father, and dying mother. One day, a man finds Chiyo and her sister, Satsu, and are sold to become geisha. The sisters are separated and Chiyo is on her own. Her story of being a geisha in training to actually becoming a geisha is a hard one filled with uncertainty and pain. Even when she becomes a geisha, she will have more trials and tribulations to go through.What I liked about Memoirs of a Geisha is that it is historical fiction and it talks about geisha. I've been interested in geisha after reading The Bone Witch and wanted to learn more about it. I do have an interest in Japanese culture and wanted to learn more about geisha. And while Memoirs of a Geisha is fiction, there is truth to the life of being a geisha. I knew beforehand that it is hard to become a geisha and Golden does a good job describing the upbringing as well as Chiyo's struggle and success of being a geisha.What I got was a palpable experience of seeing what it means to not only be a young woman in Japan but the life of a geisha. Even with the few errors, I still got to know more about geisha life as well as Japanese culture.Chiyo's story is a bittersweet one with emotions ranging from pain to some happiness. I was both intrigued and also shocked to see the process of a young girl becoming a geisha. I have heard some people say that Chiyo's geisha story is kind of long, but I think that it's a good thing we get to see Chiyo's journey.Aside from that, I really did like the historical aspect of it as well. We get to see how the Great Depression affected Japan as well as World War II and even if I'm not a huge history fan, I do enjoy getting to see how life was back then. It gets even more points since it took place in Japan.The one flaw I did notice was that some parts did seem a bit long. Not Chiyo's story of being a geisha, just some parts here and there. I still liked those parts but I do wish some parts were a bit short.
Verdict
I'm glad I was able to read Memoirs of a Geisha. This was a new experience for me reading a very well known book. It may have flaws here and there, but I think it's a great story of growing up.Thanks for reading my review!-Cesar",20,0.9865,0.085,0.783,0.132,0.4837121212121211,POSITIVE,0.9921

The first half of the book was really interesting and poetic, and then in the middle the author began talking about how a geisha prepares her makeup and clothing. Boredom set in. And then it began to get sexually explicit, so I put the book down. Maybe this isn't such a good book I began thinking.Then I got on line to read about the book and learned that Arthur Golden had been sued by the geisha and had settled out of court. She said that he told her that he would not reveal her real name and had done just that. She also claimed that she was never sold by her father or even to a man later on. Next, she claimed defamation of character. That is when I realized that this was a biography of her real life. He had claimed that he had the tapes to prove that she had been sold, etc. I even listened to an interview with her, and the geisha community was upset with her for speaking of their secrets, and she lost friends as a result. That part was sad. Perhaps it was good that she was living in New York at the time and not Japan, because who knows what would have transpired in Japan. I felt bad for her and wondered if Golden actually did betray her, but either way I went back to reading the book and got though the parts that bothered me and was glad that I had finished the book, because it was beautiful overall. I really didn't see that her character was all that flawed but thought of her as a lovely person who was in a bad situation. I also noticed that Golden has never written another book. After reading an interview with Golden, it appears to me that he wanted to get the Geisha story correct and had thrown out his first manuscript due to this: ""You had to throw it away?""GOLDEN: I did. In fact, I threw two drafts away. But I wrote a draft based on a lot of book-learning. And I thought I had a pretty good idea of what the world of a geisha was like, and wrote a draft. Then a chance came along to meet a geisha, which, of course, I couldn't turn down. And she was so helpful to me that I realized I'd gotten everything wrong, and I ended up throwing out that entire first draft and doing the whole thing over again.""http://www.cnn.com/books/dialogue/990...But Golden still claims that Chiyo's life was fictional.

One of my book clubs picked it this month and I just saw the selection and realized I owned it and it was already on my list but didn't think I'd have time to read it in the next two weeks. But just for the heck of it, I picked it up and decided to just read the first chapter to see how I liked it. It took me less than three days to finish it. I absolutely loved this book. It was well written and gave an eloquent and sometime graphic portrayal of the lifestyle of a geisha. It was fascinating to learn about the culture through the eyes of this young girl. The way Golden describes the Japanese world is easy to picture and completely draws you in. You find yourself rooting for this girl as her life hits one roadblock after another. His beautiful descriptions of the setting and clothes is enough of a reason to read this book, but it offers so much more as well. I do think this is classic material. Although published not too long ago I think it has the potential to be around for awhile, therefore falling under the longevity category. I also think it's an original concept. Many books touch upon the culture and classes of the Japanese, but I'm unaware of one that writes about the taboo intimacies of a geisha. If there are, I'd have to read them, but I think this book is original enough to be the leader of that group. I also think it has the magic factor. The descriptions of the era, the dress, and especially the differences in facial features of the characters pull you into the story effortlessly. I highly recommend it and believe it's a classic, if not now, then one in the making. As for the movie, I have mixed opinions. When I first saw it years ago before reading the book, I thought it was lovely and moving. Since I just finished the book I decided to watch it again. Once again, I feel like a movie pales in comparison to the book, lacking in definition and finesse. Yes, it's good for what it is, and the actors they choose to play the parts did exceedingly well, but I found myself dictating constantly to my husband who was watching with me, parts that were never explained. Things like why they spark a flint at a geisha's back before they leave the okiya or why the girls had they hands frozen numb while they practiced the shamisen. To me this was imperative in experiencing the richness that all the culture had to offer. But alas, it's the downfall of a movie representing a book. They can't put everything in so you just have to enjoy it for what it is. That being the case, it was an adequate representation of the book, with talented actors playing the parts well.

103,538369987,02/17/2013,5.0,"This elegant novel, exquisitely written and beautifully painted is a true thing of rare beauty. I never thought that I'd find it as breath-taking as it is. It encapsulates you and draws you to it. It makes you feel as if you'd lived there, that you saw her, that you drank sake with her, listened to her playing shamizen, watched her dance, even made love to her. It made me feel the deepest connection that I've ever felt for a protagonist. I was taken completely. It was every bit like living her life. Arthur Golden succeeds in every possible way of writing. It was so complete, with that depth of emotion and that masterful stroke in the storytelling of rich history and culture, this is literary grandeur. I especially liked his way of associating feelings with memories of events, this gives the reader a clear distinct feeling of what Sayuri feels. Also, I was completely in awe of the practices and sacrifices of the Geisha and of the nature of the old Japanese entertainment business. This novel is every bit as informative as it is entertaining. But it isn't only informative, the message of resiliency, true love, and the novel's attitude towards life is already a thing of beauty in itself. Golden weaves Sayuri's life and dreams like an expensive silk kimono. The process is extremely difficult. One must be extra careful since the beauty of silk comes at the price of fragility. The entirety is filled with countless hardships yet amid all of this, the result is as dazzling as the most beautiful kimono in all of Japan. Considering everything I like about this novel, there is nothing I like more than the simple message of the ending. It can be found in two instances. One during Sayuri's last stroll with the Chairman. “Sometimes,"" he sighed, ""I think the things I remember are more real than the things I see. ” The other, Sayuri's parting words. “Now I know that our world is no more permanent than a wave rising on the ocean. Whatever our struggles and triumphs, however we may suffer them, all too soon they bleed into a wash, just like watery ink on paper.” This novel warns us that the struggles and difficulties we face in life, our small victories, our happiest moments, our friends, our enemies, our loved ones, all these things, they will all fade into the past and nothing will be left but our memory. “I began to feel that all the people I'd ever known who had died or left me had not in fact gone away, but continued to live on inside me just as this man's wife lived on inside him.” That might be the case, but we can always remember.

104,140433504,01/13/2011,1.0,"2011: Inane populist crap.2020: Having just had another discussion (lets call it that) about this book: Yes I know lots of people loved it, I don't care; my reviews are my own and they are subjective. If this had been the first time I read a book about/set in Japan or the East in general, maybe I too would have enjoyed it. Having read quite a lot from and about the country, History and modern both, I did not like it. I found the characters wooden and impossible to believe in, their motivations and behaviour were inconsistent. The apologetics were laughable. The author seemed to be struggling, on a page by page basis to think himself into the shoes of a teenage girl, which is fair. He obviously has put in a great deal of research into the era and country, but I do not feel that it has resulted in a believable book. At times, I felt I was reading about China, which is not Japan. Other times, most times in fact, I felt I was reading a book by an American. This constant representational struggle resulted in a writing that to me felt patchy, wooden and unpleasant to read.To be fair to the author, this is something I often do feel about books by Westerners trying to make the historic East accessible to modern readers. It is a good aim, I am sure it has really opened the eyes of many people who knew nothing about Asian countries to the wealth of history, art and culture that is there. Good on them all.

107,1916072667,03/01/2017,3.0,"At first, I was blown away by this book because the writing style seemed detailed and genuine. But after about 150 pages, I realised this is all I get - endless descriptions of kimono and metaphors with nature, with no real insight in our narrator’s mind and with the plot that doesn’t seem genuine. This book tells the story of Chiyo as she is sold to an okiya and trained to become the Geisha known as Sayuri. She talks mostly about her childhood at the okiya, her supposed friends and enemies, and of older men she’s infatuated with. While she faces some uncomfortable situations, overall her experience as a Geisha doesn’t seem that unpleasant. The author earns points for detailed narration, but loses them for inaccuracy and shallow development of both characters and the plot. With a risk of sounding like a horrible person, I expected more schemes, intrigues and flirtation, but instead most of the novel Sayuri is a 12-year old child trying to learn fragments of being a Geisha. The story focuses mostly on the glamorous aspect of the lifestyle that sadly seems more appealing than disturbing. Moreover, the ending feels rushed. The writing style is outstanding and captivating, but the plot is almost non-existent. Writing is compelling, the narrator is likeable, the plot is intriguing, but c'mon, for over 150 pages I've been reading about how she has been treated like a maid. The plot needed to move forward and it never did. Characters didn't feel real and the plot dragged on. Everything felt so emotionless. While I enjoyed reading about traditions and Geisha lifestyle, it was too obvious that it has been americanised. This novel, while it is entertaining, is thoroughly problematic. The book tries to prove that Geisha aren’t prostitutes but fails to establish this. A majority of the book is spent on mizuage, the convention of auctioning a girl’s virginity. Multiple times, the reader is reminded that “one night stand” is not acceptable for a Geisha, but an arranged period of time with a danna involving sexual relations is acceptable. What is the moral difference between paying for one night and paying for continuing period of time that can last months, or even years? What happened to Hatsumomo that made her so mean and cruel? Why has the author led me on into believing that Sayuri actually has fallen for Nobu along just to crush both his and mine hopes for her to have a healthy and civil relationship? Even the introduction tries to convince me that this portrayal is accurate and in-depth reflection of the life of a Geisha, when in reality painfully clear that this book is written by the outsider. The characterisation of Sayuri should be better fleshed out, since she is our narrator, but she feels flat, which had me struggle to finish the book. I hate how she has never done anything to change her condition, she was completely submissive woman who did everything her superiors told her to do, without even blinking. Even when she was an influential Geisha, she still did what she was told, it’s like she didn’t have a one real thought in her head. By the way who was that Chairman and why was he so intriguing to Sayuri? What's he like? Have they ever had a real conversation? I don't think so. She idealises him and never sees him for who he really is. She’s been obsessed with him since she was 13 years old, and it’s kind of sad and unrealistic for a grown up woman of 30 years to still feel that childish preoccupation.",14,0.8953,0.109,0.771,0.12,0.526571038251366,NEGATIVE,0.9999

I was surprised - given that it was written by a Western man - how accurately the Japanese culture was portrayed (at least from the limited knowledge I gleaned during my short time living there, and given that it was set in a time when Japan was, in many ways, very different from today).Perhaps it was because I'd just left this beautiful country, but I was clearly able to imagine the vivid depictions described by Chiyo/Sayuri. When I was in Kyoto, my friends and I were lucky enough to see a maiko-san walking back to her okiya (a relatively rare event these days), and I will forever associate my memory of that elegant young girl with this book.All of that said, if the author did violate a confidentiality agreement with his primary source, it is abhorrent that he did so. He allegedly also embellished the truth of certain aspects of life as a geisha, which is disappointing; and yet many authors take artistic license.

You become so enthralled in the story that you almost believe if you visited the era you could walk into a scene from the book. Even years later the details remain firm in your mind. This is a well-written, strong book that also enlightens and explains Japanese culture. I loved learning exactly what a geisha is and what the Japanese value and desire in them.

The narrative style and the simplicity of the book were okay. But, every moment I have spent reading this book, has annoyed me. So sorry Arthur Golden, 2 stars it is. Sayuri, the titular geisha, the oh-so charming girl, the narrator, was damn irritating. There is a literal bombardment of similes. One simple statement, which can be expressed just as simply has to be explained by comparing it to the hills or the sunset or the breeze blowing by or the river flowing by (you get the point). It felt very pretentious to me. Not a river really, more like an ocean, with its waves continuously crashing on the shore, destroying the sand castles of peace of mind (oooops! I caught the Sayuri syndrome). Also, major problem, CHAIRMAN, my dearest chairman, what does Sayuri see in you? I totally don’t get it. To devote one’s life to a man like him, eeks! He has set new standards of edwardishness (check out the ending of the book, you will know what I mean). That is not the way to treat a girl, as if she was a kind of birthday present. Nobu is just behind the chairman in the irritating character list. He is the biggest hypocrite in the book actually, because he pretends to not to be a hypocrite. In fact the only honest characters in the book were mother, Hatsumomo and pumpkin. They were bitches and they knew it. I don’t want to criticize this book so much and would like to stop here, but, I wasted my money on this book and it has made me regret it, so revenge time. THE CLIMAX ABSOLUTELY, ROYALLY SUCKED. One doesn’t just suffer from all that Sayuri went through and live happily ever after. This isn’t a Disney princess tale. It’s a tale of a geisha, and as Mameha puts it, one doesn’t become a geisha for fun, they do because they have no choice. The author absolutely ruined the book with the unrealistic ending. And no, it doesn’t end here, there is more. The book totally contradicts itself, it chants through out that a geisha is an artist not a prostitute, but Sayuri’s virginity is literally auctioned of. What’s more, this book is freaking historically inaccurate. I did some research and it turns out, mizuage was supposed to be more of a sweet 16 party, a change of hairstyle thing. And the geisha who was interviewed for this book even told the author so. So the changing of fact to make the story juicy was really slimy. Still, I guess many people might like it, so I am not really going to advice people against it(so what if I said all the things above), read at your own risk, it might change your life and you may end up thinking that this is the Japanese form of Titanic(sob, awwww, sob) and chairman is the dream come true.",13,-0.9585,0.125,0.78,0.095,0.5623844891491949,NEGATIVE,1.0

Stay with it. This book is tremendous.Why? Because it has everything you want in a work of literature:1. Living characters - I've read books with great characterization. The kind that make you stop and admire the writing and say to yourself, ""Wow, these characters are so real! How did the author manage to do this so succinctly and so well?"" This book was different. This book actually made me say ""Ah, that sounds like Auntie."" These characters were so alive, and so well-drawn, that I fell into their world completely. A world by the way (Kyoto, Japan) that is completely unfamiliar.2. Gorgeous writing - As a rule, I don't buy fiction, but I'm going to buy this book. I really just want to be able to hold on to the phrasing, the imagery, the many, many quotable passages. If I'd have stopped to write them all down in a journal, it would have taken me a month to read it. Here's one, just to give you a flavor: His face was very heavily creased, and into each crease he had tucked some worry or other, so that it wasn't really his own face any longer, but more like a tree that had nests of birds in all the branches. And that's just page nine.3. A rip-roaring plot - This is no action-packed thriller, and that's where the mastery is here. This is a story that pulls you in so thoroughly and so instantly that you don't even realize it. You never really realize it, actually. You're too busy turning the pages. There's no disconnect, not even a breath, or a crack, between the reader and the story. You are there, you care about the protagonist from page one, and if you have to put this book down, the audiobook better be handy. I've read very few novels that I could hardly bear to put down.

123,1259076358,06/29/2017,2.0," Originally posted on A Frolic Through FictionI honestly don’t know how to word my thoughts on this book.It’s like nothing I’ve read before – which was my very reason for picking it up. I knew nothing of geisha’s before starting this book, so of course I found out a whole host of new things while reading this. I found it fascinating to see the difference in cultures. Especially in such detail.But this is a work of fiction, and I don’t know anywhere near enough about the topic to know what’s actually true or false. There’s been a whole host of controversy surrounding this book, with it looked down upon for revealing things about geisha practices when they themselves are very secretive in their ways. Not only that, but even if this was a close following of a geisha’s life, with only a few changes to make it fiction – it’s still just one person’s point of view, and so it could be bias in a number of ways. I’m aware there are a number of books I could read to broaden my understanding – but I’m reviewing this book, not those.It will never be my place to claim this as a reliable telling or not. Just clearing that up.That being said, I still found it interesting, as mentioned before. I was intrigued to know more, especially with the level of detail.And yet, in a weird turn of events…the level of detail went from being amazing, to being this book’s downfall for me. It just dragged on way too long. I started getting bored halfway through the book, and come the end I just…skimmed the pages. And I feel awful, because everyone claims it to be this absolutely amazing book worth all the awards and whatnot. But I just lost interest. It can’t be helped.It also didn’t help that I started finding it hard to read. Many of the things geisha are taught in this book I couldn’t agree with. It’s a cultural difference, so I don’t want to argue against it or anything, but I just found it hard to read certain scenes at times.So for me, this book just wasn’t a hit, which is a shame.

124,36543298,10/30/2008,5.0,"Breaking my promise of keeping myself away from dramatic novels, I made up my mind to read this one, and just lucky me …….it was really worth it. Memoris of a geisha is an astonishing novel that exposes the questionable secretive life of geisha specifically, and the superb Japanese culture in general. It's a story of Chiyo, a-nine-year-old girl, who had happened to be driven away from her own family, town and the spontaneous innocence of childhood, to be thrown in a curst, sickening life. In a world where loneliness becomes the precise definition of life, Chiyo-chan seeks desperately surviving with some of her few shattered hopes and dreams. In somehow or another she could actually make it through the symphony of that suffering. It was quite stunning how a Western author could represent a totally exotic culture with such extremely intimate fine descriptions. I really loved his writing-style, the way he overuses similes and metaphors which just put you in that amazing pre-set fantasy.Nonetheless, as the story was approaching the end, I found it kinda boring. Until the very moment when Pumpkin betrayal takes place. Now I didn't see this one coming, which actually I found it ""superbly duperly"" brilliant. I just didn't imagine that clumsy girl would turn to be a nasty one.My favorite character was Mameha.

129,111051169,07/10/2010,2.0,"Ever since my childhood, I have been very interested in the Japanese culture. This book promised to give me a peek into the secret lifestyles of one particular group: the geisha.Plot:Chiyo and her sister, Satsu, are sold just before the death of their mother. Chiyo is sold to the Nitta okiya household in Gion; Satsu to a prostitute home. Chiyo is raised to become geisha but is thwarted by Hatsumomo, the primary geisha in the okiya and a successful geisha in Gion. Chiyo’s prospects of becoming geisha are ruined after an attempt to run away; her grief is further compounded when she learns that both her parents are dead and her sister ran off with a young man from her village. In the midst of her despair, she finds hope when a man known as the “Chairman” shows her kindness and gives her a handkerchief. Chiyo determines from that point on to become geisha to attract his attention.With the help of Mameha, one of the most popular geisha in Gion, Chiyo wins her freedom from debt, liberates herself from Hatsumomo’s tyrannical reign, and becomes a successful, popular geisha named Sayuri.Good:I enjoyed reading about the traditions, garments, etc. pertaining to the geisha lifestyle (although I am almost positive that it has been “Hollywood-ized”). I enjoyed the competition between Mameha and Hatsumomo. Some of my favorite characters include Mameha, Nobu, and Hatsumomo. I also did not mind Chiyo/Sayuri’s infatuation with an older man (she does like most young girls—myself included—and mistakes admiration for the Chairman’s good character for romantic love); however, I do have reservations about the direction of the relationship (explained later). Lastly, I felt Golden did a satisfactory job writing from the perspective of a young woman. I was about 100+ pages into the story when I remembered with more than a little amazement that the author was a man.Bad:There are two reasons people spend hours upon hours over a computer or a notebook: education or entertainment. This book wallows in both and ends up accomplishing neither.First: education. The book purports that geisha are not prostitutes but fails to establish this. A majority of the book (near 200 pages) is spent on mizuage, the convention of auctioning off a girl’s virginity. Mameha sleeps repetitively with her danna, the Baron. Several times, it is said that a “one night stand” is not acceptable; however, in the next breath, it is revealed that an arranged period of time with a danna involving sexual relations is acceptable (what, might I ask is the difference between a one-night prostitute and a paid mistress? Both are paid to sleep with their clients!). Lastly, Sayuri sleeps with her danna twice a week. If the sexual relations were those of passion, I might understand the situations, but this is not the case. Geisha were not prostitutes; I read somewhere that they were not allowed to sleep with men under any circumstances!Given this, perhaps the education the author intended was to elaborate on the objectification of women. In this case, the novel fairs better (although it does not provide a satisfactory outcome for the plight of women, merely a glimpse into what they are forced to put up with). After reading this, I feel sorry for women everywhere: geisha, actresses, models, singers, etc. whose entire lives are built on nothing more than their physical appearance. The geisha in this book cannot even choose to keep the children that their sexual relations produce (Mameha has had three abortions)!Second: entertainment. Authors sometimes write books to entertain, but I doubt this is why Golden wrote this book. Memoirs of a Geisha is simply not a book that will entertain you. Much of it is very depressing with few bright points. Books about heavy subjects such as those presented in Memoirs of a Geisha are not the type people will open up on a lazy evening or while reclining at the beach (at least, I’m not inclined to do so). They will read it for the prior reason (which, as I said above, is not very accurate or compelling).There are a few other areas that disturb me as a reader:It is frequently mentioned that Chiyo/Sayuri is clever; however, not much of what she does is clever. Most of her planning (including her scheme towards the end of the novel) falls flat. (In fact, throughout the novel, she really doesn’t do a whole lot of doing which leads me to the next point.)Much of what happens to Chiyo/Sayuri is everyone acting on her, not her doing a whole lot of anything. While I can understand some outside intervention, I got frustrated for her for not actively participating in her own life more (for instance, Nobu has to come to her hideaway in order to tell her to contact Mother to be allowed back in Gion three years after the geisha districts have been reopened. If I were Sayuri and truly longing to be a geisha again as she says she is, I would have waited a short time and written Mother about it.).There is inconsistency with the pacing of the novel. The first 150 pages concern Chiyo’s childhood, primarily when she is about 10 years old. The next 250 pages concern from when Chiyo/Sayuri is 12 to when she is 18, mostly concentrating on when she is 14 – 15 (and her mizuage). The last 100 pages elaborate from when she is 18 to the end of her life concentrating mostly on age 30. How can a woman remember so clearly the time she lost her virginity and things from her youth and not closer to the end of her life? I can understand her remembering her final moments in her hometown, Yoroido, and other firsts in her life (first time in a hair dresser, etc.) but other things she remembers (e.g. elaborate details about kimono) are just plain odd. And why the silence on the war? Five years and all of it is summed up in about twenty pages? The book reads less like a true memoir (which has no overreaching aim and should be a concoction of unrelated or random events in life) and more like a fictional novel which is written with a purpose, the purpose being to elaborate on the young geisha’s sex life and her romance with the Chairman.Golden makes a serious mistake: he mistakes metaphors and similes for imagery. Sometimes as often as twice in one paragraph, he will use metaphors like “Trying to survive in an okiya with Hatsumomo is like a pig trying to survive in a slaughterhouse” or “[they:] weren’t ‘spending time together’ any more than a squirrel is spending time with the insects that live in the same tree” or “I felt like a slab of tuna the grocer had just delivered”. A little of this goes a long way.It would be nice to see more about Hatsumomo and what makes her tick. As it stands, she is just a wicked woman who doesn’t want Chiyo to reduce her popularity. What happened to Hatsumomo that made her so mean and so cruel? Why was she so mean to such a young girl with nothing more than promise on her side?Pumpkin and Chiyo’s friendship is flat. I had a hard time believing that they were actual friends. A few mentions of them talking with each other while practicing shamisen and suddenly they are Anne and Diana from Anne of Green Gables.Halfway through the book, Golden makes me think that Sayuri likes Nobu. However, we quickly find out she does not and is still harping on a man whose affections she should have grown out of years ago (come on! She’s thirty for pete’s sake!). I feel that the chemistry between Sayuri and the Chairman died many years earlier (or never existed in the way Golden suggests). And the end is so corny, so fairy-tale-ish and not at all what one expects from a memoir (life rarely comes out with “happily ever-after”s). In my opinion, Sayuri should have been infatuated with the Chairman but learns he has no feelings for her. Then, her true feelings emerge and she realizes that she has always loved Nobu.Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:Maybe a few d**n’s, he**’s. Sexual situations range from the analogy of an eel in a cave to the description (albeit vague) of a girl’s mizuage to what some might perceive as an almost-rape. All of this is a little creepy when a reader realizes that the female partner is not even 18. Hatsumomo invites a man into the maid’s room and is caught after one of these encounters. Sayuri sleeps with several men as do many other geisha. Violence consists mostly of slapping and hitting.Overall:I watched the movie, so I had an idea of what I was getting myself into before I started reading. I knew this wouldn’t be a light-hearted book, but I didn’t realize there was so little levity (often, the movie omits items that are in the book). Besides the heavy subject matter, the character of Chiyo/Sayuri was rather dull and inactive, the pacing inconsistent, the imagery clunky and annoying (do Japanese really use this many weird metaphors and similes?), and the emphasis indeterminable. If you have the time to waste and want to read a Hollywood-ized version of the life of a geisha, this is your book.",11,0.9984,0.073,0.801,0.126,0.4750405255122236,NEGATIVE,0.9962
130,1551127914,02/16/2016,5.0,"I won’t discuss the historical inaccuracy of this book— it’s been done to death, and I also don’t really care about accuracy in historical fiction as long as it’s good reading or has artistic merit— so:This book is gripping. Completely immersive. You are lost in this world and unaware of it until something returns you to your surroundings. Like an Impressionist painting, when looked at closely, it’s nothing more than a bunch of unremarkable broad brushstrokes— or in this case, unadorned, straightforward, maybe even a little boring sentences. But taking a step back, reading it as a composite whole composed of all those simple little sentences, you see the breathtaking picture for what it is: a work of art.I have to disagree with those reviewers who protest the idea of Chiyo/Sayuri falling in love with the Chairman at the beginning of the novel, when she was only eleven years old. I think it’s quite plain that she didn’t fall in love with him then. Eleven-year-old Chiyo had no sense of romantic love or sexuality yet. No, I think that her fixation with him was innocent. Bear with me. Chiyo had lost her home, her family. She’d been betrayed by her beloved father and by Mr. Tanaka, whom she had liked and trusted, and then she was sold into slavery. Cushy slavery, but slavery nevertheless. Scarcely a single person had given her a word of kindness in all that time. Well cared for all her life up until her mother’s illness, Chiyo was quickly learning to distrust and fear everyone on sight. And along comes a man, a complete stranger, who subverts that expectation, violating the social norm in front of everyone on the street, in front of pretty geisha, in front of his friends. He looks at Chiyo, who appears an unimportant, uncouth little maid sobbing hysterically and making a fool of herself, and he offers her a kind word in spite of his friends’ incredulity. Then he gives her his handkerchief and money for a shaved ice to brighten her day.Can’t you see the impression that simple kindness might have made on Chiyo, a little girl, a lonely slave in all but name? I think she replayed their encounter over and over again in her head as a kind of refuge, a reminder that kindness without ulterior motives exists in the world, a reminder that the people around her are not all there is in the world. And I think that’s pretty clear in the book. I really don’t see any evidence for Chiyo/Sayuri actually being in love with this man that she met one time when she was eleven. I do think, though, that as she spent her early adolescence thinking about him, he morphed into something romantic. Not that she was in love with him, but more she hero-worshipped the idea of him, the way girls might fantasize about a character in a book. And then, when she actually got to know him, that image of him fed into and was integrated with the actual image of him she was getting to know, and that contributed to her falling in love with him.That’s totally plausible in my view and I don’t have any criticism for Golden on it. Or on anything, really. This novel is amazing.",11,0.9921,0.108,0.727,0.166,0.5175936768149884,POSITIVE,0.9341

It's vibrant descriptions, the tantalizing dialog, the stunning tale, all of it perfection. Memoirs is an exquisite look into the life of Sayuri, a celebrated geisha. See her humble beginnings as Chiyo, a girl from a small village and watch her rise into Sayuri, the strong woman who took her life back. Embark on a vivid journey into the splendor of the inner workings of a geisha's life. Watch as she is taught the art of entertaining by becoming a living piece of art. Hear her coy voice as she develops her skills for beguiling men. Feel her spirit as she finds the strength to do what she must to make her dreams come true. From her life in the tipsy house as Chiyo to her mizuaga ceremony and beyond, this was a masterpiece!*****As I reread this enchanting story this time around I paid more attention to the relationships. No idea why, I just did. As I did, I realized the amount of loss to gain ratio that Sayuri faced through the years. It's quite staggering! On the plus though, the friendships cultivated I feel outweigh those that were lost for the most part. The one friendship that I ache the most for was for Nobu. I found myself that with this read through, I kept putting myself in his shoes and I just hurt so much for his loss most of all. He finally FINALLY found someone whom he thought was destined to be together with him and was ultimately betrayed in the worst possible way. This was the first time that I looked at Sayuri through a negative light. I understood her motives and yet... She is the one that kept stringing him along and sought him out again after he distanced himself from her. It makes what she did all the more deplorable. Again, I totally get why she did it! I can not fault her for following her heart and I understand that without this course of action she couldn't succeed.

“We don’t become geisha so our lives will be satisfying. We become geisha because we have no other choice.”

✅ Atmosphere✅ Asian culture✅ Story and pace✅ Characters ✅ Descriptions✅🆗 Is it a true representation of the life of a geisha? I honestly don't know enough about geishas to say.I read this book quite quickly, it was really good! The writing style is compelling and the story is intriguing, beautiful, and tragic at the same time. There is mature content, and some parts of the book are darker, but it is well balanced with vivid descriptions of the Japanese culture and the reality of a geisha's life. A geisha is a hostess trained to entertain men with conversation and a variety of skills such as dancing, or playing music. The more talented and beautiful a geisha was the more admirers, value, and money she had. They were meant to be an intellectual company, but we realize while reading Memoirs of a Geisha that often, a geisha's life also included sexual acts and the purchase of sex. Although I know that the part about the sex trade was not the reality of every geisha. I don't know if the author made it seem that way to create a darker atmosphere for the story, or if it is misinformation, and honestly, I am not an expert in Japanese culture at all, so I don't want to get into this debate. Let's just say that according to the book, the purchase of sex was sometimes part of a geisha's life.The book follows Sayuri who was thrown into this lifestyle when she was very young. It is quite scary when you think about it. She was away from her home and family, sold into this new life that she knew nothing about, and with no other choice than to comply. The story is written in the first person, so it feels like we're in Sayuri's head as she is reminiscing about her time as a geisha and how she became one of the most famous geisha of all.The ending felt a bit forced and too idealistic, especially when compared to the darker atmosphere of the rest of the book. I am not sure at all that Sayuri just had a happily ever after as it is depicted in the book, but overall it was still a very good read. It is compelling, interesting, beautiful, and also dark and sad.Follow me on Instagram 🙂",14,0.9952,0.049,0.779,0.172,0.5794071669071669,POSITIVE,0.9997

She becomes a servant there first, and then - eventually - the very high-profile and beautiful geisha, Sayuri.The chronicle of her life is definitely not a balmy walk down memory lane. She is tested at every turn. One of the things I like most about the book is that Sayuri's lens is not solely pointed at the glamorous side of being a geisha. The best of them enjoyed expensive gifts, travel, and pampering, but there was always a cost. Bitter competition, fighting, and heartbreak were constant reminders of what Sayuri really was - not a wife, but a professional prostitute. She never forgot who she truly was inside, but she did what she needed to do to survive and to rise in the ranks of the position into which she had been sold.

I even went as far as to purchasing a copy. I was greatly disappointed by everything. The fact that such book is written by a Western man who claims to have so much knowledge about the Japanese culture is what upsets me the most. Golden has turned the protagonist, Sayuri, with so much potential in being a strong character, into someone lacking a sense of self, fitting right into the mould of how men would like women to be. What is even worse is that he made Sayuri into a character who actually enjoys being objectified by men. A reminder that a geisha is not a sexual entertainer but an artist. Even the profession name itself says it, but Golden constantly saturates the novel with so much sexual content, convincing the reader that a geisha is different who they are. I felt so uncomfortable reading it the entire time that I had to remind myself it was a work of fiction and that such a character cannot exist in real time. I believe that the author has successfully deceived many of the audience out there into believing his story, injecting in their mind the obnoxious love for exoticism. He has completely ripped the geisha culture apart and pieced it together into a story to suit the Western audience. He has written the novel in a way that appeals to general public's interest in foreign cultures, using concepts and themes like water, superstition, and butterflies. This entire novel is a show. Although I have not read Lolita, I feel like this book is the same case of deceiving the audience. Except, Golden is trying to write in the perspective of (has assumed the shoes of) a young Japanese woman while Nabokov has written in the perspective of a man looking at a young girl. Good job, Golden, on paralleling with one of the prominent themes in the novel that is deception. I look forward to writing a literary essay that underlyingly criticizes the authenticity of the novel. For more information about why I did not enjoy this book. Click here for an article that further criticizes the novel (and it's pretty much what I am trying to convey).

148,138778882,01/05/2011,4.0,"I loved Memoirs of a Geisha by Arthur Golden. It was a little slow & a little long but at the same time I enjoyed the leisurely depiction of a different world and the aching romanticism the book communications.The story begins with a little girl living with her parents and sister in a small Japanese fishing village in a ""tipsy house""- a house built on sticks. We follow the story of this little girl who grows up to become a famous geisha in pre-World War II Kyoto, Japan. It is a wonderful story-historically interesting and emotionally engaging. The voice of the geisha, Sayori, stayed with me long after I finished the novel.I listened to the audio version of the book which slowed down the experience. For me, this was probably a good thing. I get bored, I start rushing through and this a story about a world before rushing, a story in which many sad, even terrible, things happen but a story performed elegantly, with a style and grace belonging to another world in another time. The book offers the rare opportunity to visit a life we would never otherwise have access to and which, at any rate, no longer exists.This sounds like nostalgia, and in a way it is, nostalgia for something never known. But at the same time, it is not the life Sayori would have chosen had she been given free choice. But how many in the world have free choice? And it is amazing the grace she shows in taking what life has given her and creating her own position and identity within it.Because make no mistake, while Memoirs of a Geisha tells us much about pre-war Japan and about the world of geisha, this is not the story of just any geisha but of a very particular one, a beautifully rendered character that feels so vividly real that it may be hard to remember that this is fiction, and the writer a male.This is the very best I think I could say about a work of art: so artfully done, it seems real; so artistically rendered, it's more real than reality.",9,0.9934,0.077,0.74,0.183,0.5691402116402118,POSITIVE,0.9997

After reading the book, I felt that I had learned a lot.But, having said that, I'm not really sure what I learned. In other words I couldn't tell his insights from his own made-up embellishments.

The “but” for me that kept it from being 5 stars was that I never completely got lost in it. A young girl loses her mom, her Dad is not equipped to handle kids on his own. She is sent away by a benefactor to have a chance at a better life. Her betterlife unknown to her is being a Geisha. I do like stories about personal struggle to survive in difficult situations, and this is one of those stories. Being a Geisha is not a given, you have to fight hard for it. If you fail, you are tossed to the street, homeless in a big city, not many good options from there.Chiyo (the 14yr old girl main character) is having a hard time, a well to do stranger stops to help her, a random act of kindness. She holds on this memory in her heart. She has a fierce, powerful enemy Hatsumomo who is out to destroy her. She finds an equally powerful guardian to train her and help her (Mameha).The cunning and smarts Chiyo and Mameha display are impressive and fun to watch. The assets needed of a Geisha are extensive; a bare patch of skin (who knew the back of a girls neck could be a sexy thing), specific hairstyles that need special pillows, dance as a sophisticated way to entertain, expensive exquisite Kimonos, walking in that kimono, dinner group responsibilities.In the end, this is a love story about girl going through a lot and holding onto her dreams, fighting to succeed in a way that she can hold her head up in the end.

151,661577535,07/07/2013,4.0,"Firstly, I'd like to point out that owing to my small town westernized life I am by no means well-versed , or even medium-versed, on what being a Geisha entails. That being said I found this book intoxicating. The combination of beauty and elegance matched with the barbarism of this story is amazingly effective. Chiyo is a young girl full of dreams living in relative poverty in a small fishing village in Japan. With her mother's illness and immanent death looming overhead Chiyo is taken by a local businessman's interest in her well-being (Or perhaps more to the point her startling blue-grey eyes). Soon she finds herself taken from her home and sent to live in the Geisha district of Gion. Thrown into a world vastly different than the one she has grown up in Chiyo struggles with the rules and traditions of Gion. A place where innocence is sold to the highest bidder and make-up is used as a more keen weapon than the sword. This story is as elegant as a geisha's kimono and twice as complex. I'm glad I waited until now to read this, rather than reading it several years ago when it was given to me. Although my feminism shrieked in outrage at several points it didn't keep me from enjoying the entirety of the novel which it likely would have when I was younger. Overall Memoirs of a Geisha is by turns an elegant, charming, upsetting and painful story of a girl's journey into the world of womanhood in a time when, rather than celebrated, those moments were often exploited.Side note: Can someone explain to me how this novel is considered a romance?",9,0.9767,0.088,0.742,0.17,0.5012345679012346,POSITIVE,0.9999

I loved this story then and I still do upon re-reading more than ten years later.It’s hard to articulate what exactly it is about this story that I love so much. I think it is mainly Sayuri’s resilience and faith that even through hardships and the uncertain future that often seemed very bleak, she never gave up her hope. Of course I find all the details about the life of a Geisha just fascinating, and I drank all those details up. The ending is so satisfying and this book is still firmly one of my favourites though something troubled me this time that I read it. One thing that this book reiterates time and time again is that Geisha are not prostitutes but are rather artisans and a kind of professional entertainer. But of course they entertain mainly men, and at least in the historical period in which the book is set, auctioned off their virginity to the highest bidder. Afterwards, one of the greatest things a Geisha can hope for is to acquire a patron that pays all her expenses in return for... well regular sex I guess. So really a Geisha commonly ends up a mistress to married men. I mean.... you can see why people may have ick feelings towards the role of Geisha.

165,2874248903,07/22/2019,3.0,"Reviews and morehttps://edwardsghostengine.wordpress....Quite a mixed read for me because it had many things that set it out from other historical novels but also many aspects such as the pacing in parts that made it a bit of a dull and average story. Let me get the negatives out of the way by saying I couldn’t really connect with any of the characters and I suppose the characters weren’t really meant to be connected with because this book more focuses on culture rather than feelings and character, it certainly felt that way to me anyway. The main character Chiyo/Sayuri is someone that both frustrated me and had me turning the pages, she frustrated me because she never seemed to question anything that was happening in her life which for me made it seem she lacked character especially that part in the beginning when that old lady made both she and her sister have an invasive inspection! 😛 I’ll admit I don’t know anything about Japanese culture or how Japanese children are brought up or how they behave but with Chiyo it did feel a lot of the time like she had no feelings of her own (this is before her geisha training too).What I’ll say I liked about Chiyo/Sayuri’s story was the authenticity of all the geisha practices and the attention to detail in all the descriptions. It really did feel like I was getting a glimpse into this exotic yet brutal world and the narrative read more like a tour of this world rather than a story in some parts. But my main flaw was the lack of personality in the characters, and as I said in another post, I still think Chiyo/Sayuri would be a very interesting person to talk to in person as I have always wanted to ask in depth about Japanese culture and history and these were the parts of Sayuri’s narrative I really enjoyed in getting a feel for the culture.My other flaw with this book is I felt there was too much idle time going on around the middle where a lot of the plot just revolved around party chatter. I know some of these parts were much needed in the plot and getting to know more about the characters, but I did feel it was a bit of an overkill sometimes especially after the exciting start to the story. So things did start to slow down in the middle parts which made the book a bit boring and it took a while for things to start speeding up again but when they did I will say I thought the parts with WW2 were well written with the only problem once again being the lack of emotion in the narrative. It was obvious throughout that the author had done his research deeply as all the settings and culture felt fully brought to life even if not the characters so much.I will say I did enjoy this book, but I will also say I was expecting more in terms of making this book feel like a journey rather than just a viewing of the culture. I’ll definitely look for more non-western historical novels as this one proved to be a good choice of reads on my Japan trip this year! 🙂Who I’d recommend this forBasically all historical fiction fans who are tired of only reading about Europe and the West. The world is so big and diverse so I don’t know why there are not more historicals on other parts of the world… Anyway, if you like to read about Japanese culture and enjoy a guided storyline then I would say this book is for you 🙂",15,0.9807,0.058,0.842,0.1,0.4395084934558619,NEGATIVE,0.9994

167,1181494291,01/26/2015,4.0,"****SPOILERS****I was so sure that I was going to rate this book 5 stars, but the last chapter made me rate it 4 stars. I absolutely fell in love with Arthur Golden's writing style; I even gave him the nickname 'Golden Arthur'. What a talent.This is a truly wonderful book. Chiyo-chan/Sayuri is such a loveable protagonist. The reader becomes immediately attached to her, following her from the small fishermen's village, Yoriodo, where she lives with her dying mother, distant father, and older sibling; to when she and her sister are sold and separated: Chiyo-chan to become a Geisha, and her less attractive sister, Satsu, to become a prostitute.Chiyo-chan's journey to become a Geisha is filled with physical, verbal and sexual abuse; fear; escape attempts; loneliness; downfalls; second chances; success; war; poverty; unrequited love; rivalry.The feminist within me was constantly rattled by the treatment of women in the time and the culture that the story is set in: women worshipping men by putting on the men's shoes for them, giving their virginity to the highest bidder, forming relationships with a danna for security rather than lust or love or affection, never being pleasured, but used as an object. Once I finished the book and had time to reflect, I realised that the role of becoming and being a Geisha is a glamorisation of sex trafficking. Chiyo-chan was sold as a child into a world where she had to entertain, seduce, and worship men; sell her virginity, and hope to have a danna to pay for her living expenses in return for sex. This was her ""duty"", or rather, ""destiny"". I still adored the story and so much about the culture, but this realisation certainly dirtied my overall experience. This book would have been my all-time favourite - yes, ALL-TIME favourite - if I hadn't read the last chapter. The second-to-last chapter would have ended the book so well (it's how the film ends, too) but the last chapter just shattered the illusion for me. Why?1) Why have her move to the US? I truly felt the presence of the author's nationality here. I felt it ruined the whole theme of the story. 2) 'Yes! She's finally got together with the love of her life!' -- wait a minute. He's married. She is his mistress until the end. Is that seriously Chiyo-chan's destiny? To be the Chairman's bit on the side? When I realised this, I no longer saw this as a love story - or at least, a one-sided love story. Chiyo-chan adores the Chairman, and he is said to adore her too, but not enough to have her as his one love. Once reality sank in, I pitied Chiyo-chan more than ever. After decades of loving him, and all the pain and suffering she went through, she ended up as a mistress. Of course, that is the relationship between a Geisha and her danna, but aren't they soul mates? Didn't she give up being a Geisha to be with him? Didn't they long for each other for decades? This, I felt, was the most heartbreaking point of the story. Even though the feminist within me just HAD to rant, and the last chapter didn't settle well with me, I do absolutely adore this novel.",8,0.9978,0.094,0.699,0.207,0.4817372134038799,POSITIVE,0.7447

It just wasn't for me.I really wanted to love Memoirs, since it came highly recommended by a good friend, but then I proceeded to wait several chapters for it to charm me and was ultimately left disappointed. The basic premise is a rags to riches story by our protagonist (Sayuri), who's taken under the wing of her fairy godmother (Mameha) against the malevolent attentions of her antagonist (Hatsumomo). Usually I can enjoy a slow burner that develops a character layer upon layer over a period of years, finally coming into her own at the culmination of the story, but there just wasn't enough activity here to hold my interest. This inside look at the parties, preparation and posturing that suffuse the world of a geisha read to me more like a Dear Diary than an engaging tale.

169,182175283,07/05/2011,1.0,"Sometimes I do this thing where I only really read the title of the book before I pick it up and start reading it, especially if it was a book I heard was good or that I borrowed from somebody. So sometimes, I miss things like ""Book 1 of 10"" or ""not written by a real Japanese person, or even a woman really"". I read this book first on the assumption it was an actual memoir. It wasn't terrible, but not something I'd read again. Then I read the post script. I'm not one of those people who would argue that you are not allowed to set your novel in a place where you didn't grow up. If it needs to be set in ancient china, or Arkansas or Cairo or something, then do your research and set it there. I'm not even going to argue that men shouldn't write books from female perspectives, or that women shouldn't write books from male perspectives. After all, novels are fiction - everyone knows they are fiction and are prepared to accept fictional and semi fictional descriptions of places and people. Good authors will gently ask you to suspend your disbelief for the progress of the novel, and if they are really good, you won't even notice the suspension at all, or even the request. Memoirs, on the other hand, wants you to believe that it is not fiction at all. It starts by telling you that the Geisha is real, and her memories and writings have been translated from the original Japanese, via the cute little conceit of a ""translator's note"". It begs on its knees to be believed, and to be read unquestioned. So you will read this book, and it will seem very authentic, except in the places were it isn't quite except - well we've been told these are the real words of a real Geisha, perhaps somewhat fictionalized (it's a memoir!), and hell, I, the reader, am not a Japanese person at all, so I'll take her word for it. Then it's sort of amazing how America fixes everything, and how rigidly gender-stereotypical it all is. I almost believed it until the cookie cutter fairy tale ""Babies make everything better""(tm), ending, which came off as more than a little suspicious. It then ends by telling you that Golden made the whole thing up and stole some bits from some actual real Geisha's story - a real woman that Golden chose not to write about, just use as a reference for his exotic Asian fantasy story. When you peel away the conceit of a ""memoir"" you get a hum drum, cliche romance story with a backdrop considered exotic to most north Americans. The whole thing stinks of exploitation. If this book were actually any good, it would not have to hide behind a fake translator's note and Golden's name in minuscule print. It's possible that a white American dude could write a good book from the perspective of a Japanese woman - I am not discounting that. I just really, really don't think that this is that book.",8,0.9859,0.057,0.828,0.115,0.4518518518518519,NEGATIVE,0.9984

It was interesting to follow Chiyo/Sayuri's journey from poor village life into the world of the geisha in Kyoto. The detail about the process of becoming a geisha and life in the okiya was quite an education. Westerners tend to think of geisha as Japanese call girls. However, there was an elaborate system in place for training the girls in all aspects of entertaining and conversation. I did get tired of the cattiness among the women as they competed for customers and status. No doubt it was part of the culture, but it got a little old.I'm glad I read the book. The research and presentation were on the whole very good, and I thought Golden was quite convincing writing as a woman. There are no spoilers coming, but if you are looking forward to reading this book, you may want to stop here rather than read what I didn't like about the book. With that warning in place, onward we go. :-)I really struggled to get through the last 1/3 or so of the book. It didn't really seem to add much to the story that hadn't already been said. I was sick of Sayuri, Pumpkin, Auntie, Nobu-san, the Minister, and all the parties in which the geisha tried to fix the men's bad moods by getting them drunk on sake.

171,204363779,09/01/2011,5.0,"A beautiful, unique look at a world shrouded in secrecy. Wonderfully evocative and definitely intriguing, Memoirs of a Geisha is a modern classic that I recommend everyone should read. While the story is very loosely based on accounts from several geisha about their secrets, I would take most of it as fictional. Some of the concepts including actioning off young apprentice geisha's ""mizuage"" (or virginity) and having expenses paid by a danna (basically being bought as someone's mistress) were quite incredulous and difficult to grasp.For those who don't know about the controversy surrounding the book: A retired geisha who was famous in the 1950's and 60's Mineko Iwasaki opened her world to the author and revealed some intricacies about the world of Gion. In the acknowledgements, he published her by name and she in turn sued him for defamation of character and contract. She then went on to publish a more historical account of her life in a novel titled ""Geisha of Gion"". Based on such an unconventional topic, I was quite disappointed with how the book ended. Very cliche and not very realistic, but I guess happy endings are more palatable than ones which are not.

Well, it's one of those books that interested me in theory, but in reality, it was out of my reading comfort zone. I was also very dubious about a middle-aged, white, Western male writing about the experiences of a young female Geisha. This is far from an own voices novel.But I am so surprised by how much I enjoyed this! I thought it would likely start off well but get bogged down with lots of unneeded details. Okay, so there WERE unneeded details, but for me, they only added rather than detracted from the overall story experience.I really enjoyed Arthur Golden's writing style - it was so immersive! He completed transported me to a historic Japan, and whether this is remotely culturally accurate or not (which it has been criticised for), it was a fantastic story I could get lost in for hours. The story follows a young girl who is ripped away from her family and sent to a completely foreign town to train as a Geisha. The world she enters is harsh, unrelenting, and far from glamorous. She makes both friends and rivals along the way, and in the end, must decide between accepting the fate that others have laid out for her, or taking a chance at reaching for a meaningful future. The pure trials this girl goes through were enough to make me feel queasy and I rooted for her every step of the way.

185,834837139,07/15/2021,4.0,"As with The Help, this is another novel for which I feel I need to discuss the social context and controversy before reviewing the actual book. Arthur Golden, who is a white American man, has been criticised for appropriating the voice of a Japanese woman for the sake of this novel, but it is worth noting that he is well-educated on the subjects on which he writes (having an MA in Japanese History from Columbia), interviewed actual former geisha for his research (whether they like the finished product or not — more on this later), and in my view has approached the more sensitive topics and aspects with nuance and respect.However, the original controversy, preceding these more topical debates, was not about cultural appropriation or anything of that nature: as part of his research, Golden interviewed a retired geisha, Mineko Iwasaki, and used some aspects of her life as the basis of his novel, but she afterwards sued him for breach of contract and defamation of character, asserting that Golden had agreed to protect her anonymity due to the traditional code of silence followed by geisha regarding their clients, whose anonymity is considered extremely important (he originally published her name in the acknowledgements of his novel). They eventually settled out of court for an undisclosed sum of money. I think people have gravitated towards making this controversy racially based, when in fact they are guilty of overlooking ‘own voices’ and an aspect of cultural nuance themselves by ignoring the actual geisha’s stated feelings on the matter. Iwasaki also has her own memoir, written as a rebuttal of Memoirs, if critics would prefer to read that, but I perceive three problems with this approach. Firstly, if the original grievance surrounded the taboo of disclosing your clients’ secrets, then by publishing her own memoir she has done the same thing. Secondly, it seems her main grievance with the narrative is that she thinks geisha are able to profit off the delusions of men, who want to see an image of ideal womanly beauty — the problem with this approach is that you are still perpetuating those same standards by practising as a geisha at all, and perpetuating the male delusion by allowing them to believe it’s real. Thirdly, if the novel is so different from her own life, we should keep in mind it is only a piece of historical fiction (emphasis on the ‘fiction’ here), and the level of difference may suggest a significant degree of artistic license which moves the narrative further away from her own life, which may serve more as ‘inspiration’ rather than as a solid foundation. In any case, I did not feel that this controversy detracted from my enjoyment of the novel, and I will try to separate the art from the artist for the remainder of this review.For what it’s worth, I do think Golden’s interpretation of this geisha’s experience added authenticity to the novel, which I think was also his motivation for listing her in the acknowledgements in the first place, especially when considered alongside with the fictional translator’s note at the beginning. It seems to me he is going overboard with careful consideration and sensitivity, and in fact may have overthought it, and judging from other reviews the results have been highly variable among readers. I’ve seen a repeated criticism that the ‘Japanese’ naturalistic style to the imagery is overdone, but to me this is a pretty clear imitation of how actual Japanese writing, particularly poetry, comes across in translation, and not off the mark. The novel is told in first person from the perspective of Chiyo (later ‘Sayuri’), so it makes sense that she likens her experiences to things she herself has seen, touched, heard, and felt. It also emphasises Sayuri’s own affinity with the natural world, which stands in such stark relief to the heavy makeup and false smiles required of the geisha, which is what ultimately makes her stand out and capture the heart of an unpretentious person like Nobu. This character trait is also the source of her vulnerability: she is, in a sense, too genuine: her attempts to plot and scheme tend to fail, and cannot conquer her feelings.It initially occurred to me that Chiyo/Sayuri’s ‘special eyes’, a blue-grey colour unusual in Japan, are a little cliché, but Mineko Iwasaki had light brown eyes, so he has simply exaggerated the unusual quality of this one real-life geisha. It also at least goes some way to explaining why she’s treated as special in a setting that places such extreme emphasis on women’s looks, why she repeatedly manages to escape the fates of the less fortunate characters, and why the okiya women and Mameha make more of an effort to help her succeed as a geisha (and why she has so much success with the men when she gets there). The eyes also symbolise her association with water: she comes from a fishing village by the sea, and it is these eyes she shares with her mother, who dies at the beginning of the novel from ‘too much water’ in her, showing the vulnerability it can express. This is heavily emphasised throughout the text, most memorably in the following passage:“I can see you have a great deal of water in your personality. Water never waits. It changes shape and flows around things, and finds the secret paths no one else has thought about — the tiny hole through the roof or the bottom of the box. There’s no doubt it’s the most versatile of the five elements. It can wash away earth; it can put out fire; it can wear a piece of metal down and sweep it away. Even wood, which is its natural complement, can’t survive without being nurtured by water. And yet, you haven’t drawn on those strengths in living your life, have you?”The writing style also throws into relief the grace and elegance encompassed in the tradition of the geisha, the beautiful artistry of Japanese culture, alongside the brutality of the system, the beatings and exploitation, and the precariousness of the geisha’s existence, as fragile as beauty itself. Although some criticise this novel for romanticising and idealising this world, although it is certainly one lost to history (Sayuri notes in her old age that geisha are almost dying out in Gion now), the latter aspect avoids the impression of anything too perfect. Indeed, the novel conveys the perils of putting so much emphasis on beauty at the expense of all else: it is the obsession with controlling and possessing beauty that lies behind the machinery which serves to put the women so much at the mercy of the men. There is a reason why all the dances they perform are so melancholy, representing sad, untouchable beauty, and the fleeting nature of happiness and love.The whole vision of this novel is captivating and gripping, in a way that is rare for me to experience: I was hooked from the point at which Chiyo goes looking for her sister, wanting them to be reunited and escape the fate of terrible exploitation. Yet the book is also surprisingly soothing and comforting, despite all the protagonist’s trauma. Although the story was very engaging, it took a very long time for Chiyo to become a geisha: the book is rather long, at more than 500 pages, and is called Memoirs of a Geisha and told in a frame narrative after Sayuri has found success (meaning that, during the years when she is forced to serve as a maid as her punishment for trying to run away, we aren’t exactly in suspense over whether she will manage to become a geisha), yet Chiyo doesn’t even become an apprentice until about 30% of the way through. Given the apparent criticism of patriarchy that encompasses the whole novel, we might expect more positive portrayals of female relationships, but Sayuri finds little comfort here, besides her relationship with Mameha. We see the way patriarchy turns women against one another instead: envy is a major theme. Envy serves as Hatsumomo’s motivation, even when Sayuri is a tiny child; it characterises a turning point in Sayuri’s life (when she stars in the dance and in the painting and suddenly the other geisha are unfriendly); it’s the motivation of the okiya’s women to adopt her, although this really manifests as money-hunger and wanting her earnings; and it seems to be (view spoiler)[Pumpkin’s motivation to betray her at the end, because Sayuri is the star and things have gone badly for Pumpkin, who has had to prostitute herself and live in a half-wrecked house (hide spoiler)]. Some readers may dislike this aspect, but I thought it was realistic and effective; another sad truth of the setting.There’s some criticism of the portrayal of the American soldiers, who Sayuri describes “giving candy to the children”, making no mention of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. I am of two minds about this aspect: Sayuri does note that Kyoto was bombed much less than Tokyo or their military bases (because it wasn’t strategically important), but we still see how dramatically the characters’ lives are damaged by the war. It would have been more realistic to have some anger and fear expressed, even if Sayuri is generally an expert in suppressing her emotions. It would have been more realistic for her to at least have been suspicious of the soldiers, particularly given the often horrific experiences she’s had with more dignified and culturally familiar men. This only comes out in the physical descriptions: when Sayuri sees a drunk, naked American man and is shocked by how hairy he is, or when Europeans are described as “fat” or just very large compared to Japanese people. On the other hand, the geisha’s job is the entertain and to emanate positive energy: presumably this was a hard task in the Japanese community after the defeat. We see how dull and difficult her liaisons with Nobu and the Minister are, compared to the rowdy American parties — merriment contrasted with melancholy. A resourceful geisha, wanting to survive, is more likely to gravitate towards the latter, even if becoming a ‘comfort woman’ is part of the deal.I thought the ending was (view spoiler)[a bit abrupt, especially after such a long journey. Sayuri and the Chairman ultimately get together very quickly, but we see very little of their actual relationship. She idealises him throughout the novel, but ultimately doesn’t know him very well: he represents her goals, a life of kindness and a family for her to aspire to, but we never see how that idealism matches up with the man as he truly is. I would have liked more hints that the Chairman had feelings for Sayuri, and Pumpkin’s betrayal was a little sudden after so many years of early camaraderie; I would have preferred to have them meet one more time before Sayuri left for America. Overall, however, the ending seemed to fit; there was an acknowledgement that, for better or for worse, this beautiful but dangerous old world was gone for good, and I felt the whole story closed on a well-earned reflective note on the fleeting nature of life (hide spoiler)].",7,0.999,0.092,0.757,0.151,0.4852747226192203,NEGATIVE,0.7343

MY THOUGHTS
Wow. I actually read an adult book.For those who don't know me, which is probably everyone, I love to read Young Adult books. In fact, I've read maybe 5 adult books in my life, out of over 1,000 YA books. So, yeah, I see this as an accomplishment.Anyway, I unlikely was not planning to read this book. I saw the movie a few months ago. I usually hate watching the movie before the book, but it was my roommate's choice of movie so I just went with it. It wasn't until just recently when my local library had a challenge going on to read 5 books to either take place or were published in 5 different decades from the past hundred years (you could do this up to 4 times). I only had one more book to go to finish all 4 tickets and I had nothing in my stuffed bookshelf that would work. So, I asked my roommate, and she gave me this.This book took me what felt like forever to read, but I do think this was a beautiful book. This book tells the story of Chiyo/Sayuri. At the age of nine, she and her sisters are taken, separated, and sold. Chiyo, as her name is at the time, ends up in a geisha home (there is a word for it, but I don't remember how to spell it). This book chronicles her life as she begins to train as a geisha and as she eventually becomes one.The big interesting factor of this book, according to many reviews, is all of the Japanese culture. I really did like this aspect as well and it was obvious that the author did a lot of extensive research. Though, I felt like most of the culture in this book was the culture of those within the geisha lifestyle of those whom surrounded themselves with such. Also, the history within this book is particularly interesting. It details what it was like, for a geisha at least, in the years before World War 2 and after. The Depression was also a very defining factor. If you have a problem with slow-pacing, then this book is definitely not for you. As I already mentioned, this book spans decades of this woman's life. The years from age nine to around her thirties are very detailed. The pacing did bother me a little bit, as I'm not used to books like that, but it makes perfect sense considering. This book is about Chiyo/Sayuri and her life, which can not be told in a very fast way. I actually do think it worked for the story.My only actual issue with this book was the whole Chairman thing. The Chairman helps Chiyo/Sayuri with a very small act of kindness and after that, she kind of becomes obsessed with him. I could understand why, but it was particularly irritating since he never really paid any attention to her. He was also thirty years older and had a wife, but that didn't actually bother me as much just because of the fact that Chiyo/Sayuri wanted to, basically, be his mistress. Still disturbing though.
IN CONCLUSION
Despite the whole Chairman thing, I loved almost everything else about this book. Sure, the pacing is a bit slow, but it does work with the book. This book is very realistic, historistic, and beautiful. I do recommend it to those who enjoy looks on different cultures and historical fiction. I will say that, based on what I remember from the movie, it does follow the book :)",7,0.9926,0.053,0.822,0.125,0.5028752436647174,POSITIVE,0.899
187,2032792997,06/21/2017,4.0," 3.5 stars Memoirs of a geisha is a ‘memoir’ about the early years in the career of a former geisha in Kyoto, even complete with a faux translation note at the beginning of the novel. It’s a coming of age story that encompasses the years of the Great Depression and Second World War, which naturally caused huge social and economic upheavals across Japan. I don’t think I’ve ever read a book set in Japan before, so I found it fascinating for that reason alone. I have no idea how accurate Golden’s depiction of geisha culture actually was, so it definitely encouraged me to read up on an area of history I formerly knew nothing about. I sort of assumed that geishas were akin to high-profile escorts but Golden makes it clear that it is a much richer and more complex tradition than I ever could have imagined, and this book probably doesn’t even do it justice considering that Golden himself, writing from a western perspective, must have missed many of the finer nuances and details. The plot follows a young girl called Chiyo who at the start of book is eight years old and living in a rural area of Japan with her older sister, ailing mother and elderly father. With her mother on her deathbed, an older man starts taking an interest in her and her sister, leading Chiyo to naively assume that he plans to adopt her, but instead he sells her into what is essentially a form of slavery. She is sold to a okiya (a geisha home) where she is beaten if she tries to run away and is unable to earn any money of her own until she has become a fully trained geisha and has paid back her ‘debts’ to the okiya – a figure which includes the cost of her geisha education, medical care and even the fee they originally spent on ‘purchasing’ her. Admittedly, it was strange to see an American man write about such a distinctly feminine and Japanese tradition, especially as most of the main characters, and certainly those with the most personality, are women. Despite this, Golden makes for a pretty convincing female narrator, and Chiyo came across as a very likeable and well-rounded character. However, her inexplicable obsession with the ‘Chairman’, whom she’d spoken a grand total of two sentences throughout the course of her life, made her seem less relatable and genuine. I wasn’t a fan of the ending either, which I felt was too predictable and just too  neat . I felt like a grittier and more realistic ending would have suited the tone of the book much better than the sappy one we were left with. Also, some of the dialogue between certain characters felt a little too thespian to be realistic. I mean, I’ve never met a geisha entertaining in the Gion district before, so who am I to say how they talk, but some of those sentences were so flowery and long that I really can’t picture anybody, in any part of the world, speaking this way without generating some serious side-eye.However, it was still a very enjoyable and engaging read and I would highly recommend it for someone with an interest in Japanese culture and as a very basic starting point for anyone wanting to learn more about geisha culture in Japan.",7,0.9955,0.053,0.797,0.15,0.4181714285714286,POSITIVE,0.9778

I'm not a fan of romances (boys have cooties!) and definitely not a fan of love-at-first-sight and schoolgirl obsessions - especially when they linger for decades on end, so this had several marks against it even without taking other factors into account.This book, understandably, caused a lot of controversy once the Japanese release was planned. The waters seem murky enough that I really don't want to get into that debate in my review. However, I really wish Golden would have spent more than a sentence or two on topics like regional & class variations in geisha or common prostitutes pretending to geisha in the post-war period or historical changes in the community/profession over the last century.I think if he'd talked about those issues some more, that would have given it some badly needed nuance and a bit more scholarly bite. As it stands, with Golden over-sexualizing every little thing, it just feels like he's fetishizing the culture - which isn't cool IMO.And several aspects felt rather contrived to me. The ending felt like it was shoe-horned in just to ensure everyone thought it was happy enough. (view spoiler)[It's a 400 page book where they're mutually obsessed for over 300 pages but never really speak to each other until 30 from the end, and are sleeping together within 10 pages of them having their first real conversation.

B.S.Also unbelievable was the time they ended up discussing someone's abortion during a party.  Inadvertently or not, that doesn't ring true to me. As a really minor thing... Near the end, Sayuri muses that she never had reason to count herself fortunate before. Keep in mind - this is after she's made her career as a geisha and won her freedom from indentured servitude. After she's survived WWII in comparative comfort and safety. After she's seen so many other people's lives and hopes fall to pieces. And she's never thought herself fortunate??

DID YOU CALL ME WEIRD??REACTION 2 :I wish I could speak life into this book and beat it senseless with a wooden spatula for all the grief it gave me. Ultimately both reactions only proclaim my love for this book.MY THOUGHTS This book was both thought and image-provoking. Chiyo ( Later on to be known as Sayuri), gives an account of her story in reminiscent tones.We follow her as she makes her journey through childhood, adolescence and eventually geisha-hood--which really is what the story is based upon (life through geisha eyes). One thing that really endeared me to Sayuri was her narrative voice. It was very expressive and greatly into detail. For example, she wouldn't just tell you ""I poured the tea until I got it right."" She'd go further describing exactly what facets, gestures and composition make up the concept ""right"". It was a very endearing attribute to me. And then there were the contrasting characters of Mameha and Hatsumomo. These were two characters I particularly loved. They were so elegantly portrayed, similar and yet so different : For one thing, they are both schemers. Now, where they are different is in projection. Whereas Mameha is a more subtle and calculative character, Hatsumomo is a loud, over-expressive and untame one.The various themes in this book ranging from major to trite are ; The controversial concept of a geisha, War (The Great Depression), superstition, Japanese culture and mannerisms, reminiscence, dream and motivation, passion and dare I say love?  I also feel the need to say that the movie was a very poor interpretation and adaptation of the book.

Moreover, there are an abundant of lyrically captivating paragraphs illustrating a rich environment and lifestyle so different from that of the Western World. Honestly, I knew nothing about life as a Geisha going into this book, so I wasn’t prepared for certain events which appeared throughout. However, I’ve learned a lot, particularly about Japanese culture in the early-mid 20th century. I was completely invested in Sayuri’s story, in a world so different from my own, living a lifestyle I knew very little about. At a young age, her father sells her to a geisha house and she tells of her arrival at the Nitta okiya where she endures harsh treatment from everyone. Hatsumomo is cruel and manipulative and her okiya Mother demotes her to a maid after her trying to escape. Despite the hardships she faced, she grew to become a beautiful Geisha, accomplished in beguiling the most powerful men.This isn’t an easy read and it requires patience to finish. I spent more time with this book than most; it’s not a fast-paced book. However, the writing style is what makes this book so special.

Not that all men are incapable of writing an ending to a woman's story, but maybe just THIS man is oversimplifying things. I could be way off base (who has read this?? help me out), but after pining away for a man that she had a crush on as a girl--a man that she never REALLY knew and who never REALLY knew her, can it really be a happy ending for her after the last page of the book? On the one hand, after so much trauma, you DO just want Sayuri to be ""happy"" but I can't help but feel as though Nobu would have been a better path for her. Would that ending get in the way of her pursuing her own destiny?? Reading the memoir of the REAL geisha whom Golden based this book on (Mineko Iwasaki) threw many details of the story in doubt--though it is difficult to say whether Iwasaki is embarrassed by the truth, or whether Golden's version is simply wrong.

I didn't give it a lot of thought and just took the book at face value as a at least partially true story about a geisha.

I reread it recently and the whole thing has a pretty nasty flavor to it once you imagine a white modern American man penning these prose instead of a sweet older Japanese woman.

I had no idea of this culture in Japan and all its intricacies before reading its book. Both the historical aspects and the plot were very interesting. Many times you felt such sympathy for Sayuri and the other geishas. (view spoiler)[ Reading about the process used to sell of a geisha's virginity was hard to read and it was very hard to accept that this really happened and was a normal part of Japanese culture at the time.  (hide spoiler)] They definitely had a very hard life trying to keep everyone else happy. (view spoiler)[ I was really glad that she had a happy-ish ending after all her struggles  (hide spoiler)].

208,2745909516,07/06/2019,4.0,"One thing that people should know about Memoirs of a Geisha is that it is a work of fiction in the nature that the characters in this novel were invented by the author. One will find it very hard to believe that this statement is true upon reading this book, because it is very brilliantly written in the way that Sayuri's story sounds so true and the events and occurrences within this text were things that occurred among geisha in Japan during the early 20th century that one could easily mistake this book to be a work of nonfiction and rightfully so. Reading this book, I developed a greater understanding for geisha and their role in Japanese culture, as well as the cold, cruel, and gender-induced desires that come with their expectations and what is required of them in order to succeed.At the beginning of this novel, Sayuri is Chiyo and is living with her older sister, Satsu, and her parents. Her mother is sick and dying, while her father is a much older man that had Chiyo and Satsu later in life. Chiyo and Satsu are placed with Mr. Tanaka, owner of the Japanese Coastal Seafood Company at the end of their street, where Chiyo is sent to live with geisha with the expectations that she herself will become one, while Satsu is sent to a different residence. For Chiyo, she lives with Mrs. Nitta, known as ""Mother,"" a maid known as ""Auntie,"" a potential geisha apprentice known by the nickname of ""Pumpkin,"" an older resident named ""Granny,"" and the resident geisha, Hatsumomo, who is cruel, deceiving, and manipulative, looking to do what she can to make Chiyo's stay as miserable as possible and destroy her expectations in any which way. Throughout the text, we follow Chiyo's rise to becoming a geisha and taking on the new name of Sayuri, her encounters and interactions with ""sisters"" and male customers, like The Chairman, Nobu, Dr. Crab, and The Baron. Memoirs of a Geisha was a very entertaining, honest, and straightforward text. I developed a great deal of feelings for Chiyo and her struggles, as well as her triumphs if one can find such a thing possible. The thing I got out of this text the most is that for Chiyo's community, being a geisha may have had its opportunities, but it was such a miserable atmosphere. The fact that Chiyo was forced into this lifestyle leaves a great deal of questions about what could have been, but the time and place may have answered this for me. Still, I feel that ""servant level"" is the most that comes out of being a geisha, even if it is made a big deal throughout teahouses in Japan. I developed a great deal of feelings for how well the characters were fleshed out within this text, from how much I loathed Hatsumomo, but also how enigmatic and complicated certain characters were, but showed a great deal of concern for Chiyo/Sayuri and her growth. The fact that this is a memoir provides this text with some exemptions about details that Sayuri chooses to withhold, but there are still some that should have been included, involving the time gaps or mentions of such. The great area of concentration within this text is placed on Chiyo's entry into Mrs. Nitta's residence, her difficulty adjusting, her becoming a geisha, and her interactions were others at particular teahouses, but in particular the Gion.Memoirs of a Geisha is a great perspective piece that gave me a greater glimpse into the lives of geisha and doing so with a character such as Chiyo/Sayuri, who was very easy to connect with. The novel was very well researched and given a great deal of effort on Golden's behalf and while this was very much the story told by a geisha, it is a testament of Golden's enthusiasm for Japanese history, which can be compared to Andy Weir's enthusiasm for astronomy, physics, and his ability to give us a greater understanding of Mars.",6,0.9968,0.044,0.818,0.138,0.5551120546120546,POSITIVE,0.9905
209,3507090804,08/24/2020,5.0,"this book feels to me like a quiet masterpiece. unlike many fictional biographies that switch perspectives and time periods and voices, this book stays with Sayuri chronologically from when she is 8 years old in a fishing town of Japan throughout her life as a geisha. her voice is clear and strong and incredibly compelling as she navigates her loss of innocence, her traumas and hardships as a young geisha apprentice, and the complex relationships she has with men as a geisha. i love the descriptions that are so rooted in nature, as well as the commentary on destiny and adaptability in adversity within the backdrop of the second world war. it boggles my mind how arthur golden managed to write such a compelling, thorough novel about a girl whose identity does not overlap with his own at all. this originally made me hesitant about the book, especially within the context of the #ownvoices movement, but it is clear that the author did extensive research for this novel.as i was reading, i found myself struggling with so many concepts that were ingrained in the geisha way of life, and i wanted so badly for sayuri to break free from the absolute power that various men, from nobu to the chairman to even dr. crabs, held over her life. but i think that the author did a fantastic job of underscoring the complexity of a geisha’s life, from the incredible tragedy that sayuri undergoes to the destiny she manages to carve out for herself within her circumstances. i also loved the case studies of different geishas, from mameha (easily the most iconic character) to pumpkin to even hatsumomo. we see their flaws but we also are able to understand why they become the geishas they become.“Adversity is like a strong wind. I don’t mean just that it holds us back from places we might otherwise go. It also tears away from us all but the things that cannot be torn, so that afterward we see ourselves as we really are, and not merely as we might like to be.”",6,0.9599,0.07,0.802,0.129,0.5424342105263158,POSITIVE,0.9995

Vientiane. right next to the hungarian bakery in the center square that has a large sign on top featuring a jolly looking fat man whose smile has faded away a bit under the sun. yes? ok then.now, mind you, in this bookstore, there weren't very many books in english that weren't written by someone named ""danielle steele"". which reminds me, i must look this person up. i see her name everywhere. thousands of abandoned danielle steeles, stacked up in bookstores around the world, it's simply amazing. like a parasitic algae that thrives on dusty bookshelves and healthy, decent novels, suddenly appearing when you least expect it and obviously multiplying until it chokes out good literature. it makes me feel like a gardener every time i visit such a store, plucking shakespeares and silverstiens out of the shadows of the steeles and putting them back in their rightful place in the sun....that was a good one too. i think someone should take note of this. while you're at it, take down the recipe. it's TWO parts jack to ONE part dr. pepper. you may title it: recipe to success. under notes, please help me remember, perhaps a little notation like: ""found to bring out the ernest hemingway of book reviewing"". ah, goodreads on a saturday night. back to the review.here's what i wrote the last time. warning: it's kind of boring. you have permission to use the time you might have spent reading the next two paragraphs finding more dr. pepper.""i read this while traveling through remote parts of southeast asia, so it should speak volumes that i was not distracted from this story in the least. i even rigged my flashlight to a seat during a midnight bus so that i could finish the part with the bidding war. i studied japan a lot in high school, but parts of this world were still knew to me, the details were so many. very good read, very culturally involved.""OMG IT'S BORING ME AND I DIDN'T EVEN RE-READ IT, I JUST SKIMMED.This book was freaking awesome. Yeah, you know it was. You know why it's awesome, and you came here to sulk? Yeah, I said sulk. Stop looking at the screen all cross eyed that way. I re-read it the other day. Founda copy for fifty cents at goodwill (buried, i might add, under four multicolored danielle steeles). and after i read it, and came back to goodreads, and read other reviews, i decided it needs to be said:It's awesome because you couldn't stop thinking about it after you had read it. Yeah. A couple years after you read it, in fact. Every so often, perhaps for no reason at all, you got a glimpse of something that reminded you of the different layers of a kimono, or the pickled radish that a certain geisha liked to snack while reading her tabloids. you can't put a finger on it, but stacked in the thousands of memories that make up your soul, you count among the most satisfying the story of a geisha and a chairman. you would never, ever admit it, but you like this book because it has a happy ending. a nice ending. not perfect, like a fairy tale, but nice nonetheless. the geisha herself taught you that there are no perfect, happy endings, but that one can find happiness anyway.and you are angry that a man wrote it.oh blargh, you people. catty little comments like you are seriously pissed that golden put ""memoir"" in the title. like you didn't read ""dear america diaries"" and ""american girl stories"" when you were little and let your imagination pretend these girls like you were real.the reason people write stories is because they have a story to tell. and the best kind of writer is the person who has a story inside them that burns so brightly, and tugs at their soul nightly (OMG i am also rhyming. re-pour, please) that they toil over it, inject their passion and blood and sweat and tears, right into the pages.and golden 
has that passion.
come on. the way the book reads is pure poetry. i thank my lucky stars i had an english teacher in high school who took us through 4 weeks of japanese poetry. how beautiful golden's descriptions. how perfectly crafted his comparisons. how touching and absorbing his characters. how riveting the plot. he clearly did his research, and styled the syntax and even the thought process of his characters as closest he could to the time they existed.he so obviously wanted us to love his geisha the way he did.and you criticize, like you weren't completely wound up in who would receive suyuri's virginity? like you didn't cringe when you discovered what became of pumpkin? like you didn't feel every betrayal and victory in the fantastic little world of the okiya golden created?you are simply angry she isn't real, not a flesh and blood soul who can return your adoration. oh. and--- did i mention this before? it was written by a man. a white dude. who couldn't POSSIBLY know about geisha. here's the thing, you weird feminist people who seem to be so hung up on golden ""sashaying about, trying to pass off his novel as a memoir"". obviously, if we were out, face to face, i would buy you one of these marvelously delicious concoctions i am sipping and we would duke it out like civilized bookworms. however, we lack a proper venue, so i've gotta say it here, without the benefit of you being slightly marinated (in order to better see my point). what would you rather have? a hundred danielle steeles, pooped out so rapidly they cannot be distinguished even by titles, haunting you at the bottom of every bargain bin in the world....?or the simply marvelously written, carefully crafted (if not, in fact, true) story of a woman (not just a geisha) who happens to be created by a man?that's what i thought. i'll drink to that.",6,0.9992,0.062,0.769,0.169,0.5450823885109598,NEGATIVE,0.8769
211,1988173155,09/04/2017,4.0,"There is a very common saying that goes something like this, ""Never trust a man's feelings nor a women's expression"". It's an expression that can be said in many different ways but ultimately carries the message that plasticity of emotions is expressed in both genders. This is especially true for a Geisha. Deriving from the word to entertain/entertainment, the life of a Geisha has always been seen as a majestic portrayal of artistic entertainment for a Geisha must be skilled in music, dance, conversing, and much more. And like most elegant products, they are seen and admired but never heard nor consulted. The hard truth of being a Geisha is that your entire reason of living is to be a form of entertainment to (mostly) men. There is no concept of self nor ones own path. Every Geisha, no matter how popular, is dependent on a man to support her. Beginning at apprenticing, a young Geisha or Geisha in training, is thrown into debt from the money it cost to acquire her to the cost of her kimonos and makeup. There is no charity and nothing ever belongs to her. Yet, she remains ever so poised and dedicated to her role. Many in turn, come to enjoy the life for you remain sheltered from much of life's hardships and turmoils. However, there is always the fear that your success, regardless of how hard you work, is ultimately, in the hands of a man. He can be both your lifter and destroyer. It is in this world that we come to know the story of Sayuri. As blind as we are, it is through her eyes and experiences that we come to learn the ups and downs of being a Geisha. What amazed me as a reader was that I honestly thought this was a true story. The shocking revelation that it wasn't just goes to show Golden's talent and skill as an author. You can tell that there was a lot of time and research put into this book because of just how much detail he puts into everything. Golden manages to teach us all the intricacies from the value of a bow to the psychological behaviour a Geisha must portray, and everything is portrayed to the reader though Sayuri's unique perspective.The book does a very good job in displaying two things that are imperative. The first is the big theme is carries of having an identity. As I said before, a Geisha must not have a sense of self. Sayuri though, has a goal and does her best throughout the book to achieve all whilst being told by others and even herself that you must not. In a realistic way she attains her goal the best she can and it's really up to the reader to decide if it was worth it or not in the end. Personally, I felt the ending from the moment it gave sound of coming till the last word was rushed, especially since Golden spent a lot of time mulling over the idea of self vs. community. For such a big build up it wrapped up too neatly. Also, it seemed to come at the cost of cutting out characters. I don't mean people died but rather after having spent 400+ pages getting to know them, to have them suddenly removed made me feel a bit empty as a reader. The second topic is brings up is the psychology of women. There are many women in this book, mostly Geisha or retired Geisha. Throughout the book you receive a cumulative understanding on the emotional toll being a Geisha has on these women. Sure it has its perks and the women do value themselves but they are still nightingales trapped in gilded cages. Having your every action, expression, and emotion weighted makes for a huge burden to carry. As entertainers, they cannot confide in the men they are entertaining nor their ""mothers"" (basically the woman who owns the house they live in). No one wants to be near a sad monkey. The monkey must always be cheerful while he dances and plays the cymbals. It also goes without saying that no one wants to be near a loud and rambunctious monkey, so there is only a certain amount of emotion they must show. Why am I talking about monkeys? Simply because the monkeys are symbols of the women who entertain. They must be groomed, entertaining but of course demure for who wants to be near a women who talks too much or laughs too much or is headstrong or has her own views, right? And so these women are sent out to soothe the stress of men away without asking them head on what's wrong. The result of this and what I am trying to get to is that reading the expression, behaviour, habits, voice, etc of a man is another skill a Geisha must have. The men will never tell whats wrong straight on. Instead it falls on the Geisha to slowly tease the problem out through stories, games, music, and dance. As a result, these women become masks of their own emotions in order to take on the emotional burden of others. In it's own twisted way, it is interesting.The last thing I want to talk about is just how free men were back then. It surprised me how accepted it was for men, married or not, to go to Geisha for entertainment. Sure many just sat there and listened to stories, music, dance, etc while drinking for a Geisha is not a prostitute and does not sleep with every man who offers to pay. But of course if the money offered is high, or the man is in a powerful position, or the Geisha's mother insists, or if the man is her danna then she must accept his offer. It shocked me that a married man with his own family could go and make eyes at another women. It shocked me how the same man could be a Geisha's danna or even take her as his mistress. He could go on vacations with her over his own wife. Of course, a women Geisha or not, is not allowed to do the same. Even the way a Geisha dresses and wears her makeup is an innuendo disguised as beauty. Sure the woman wearing the makeup feels pride and worth as she rightly should but it takes on a more seductive meaning from the man's point of view.Overall, this book educated me on Geishas and showed me just how intricate and complex the whole industry was. It's a great book and I highly recommend it. ",6,0.9989,0.067,0.774,0.16,0.5268623188405795,POSITIVE,0.9997
212,2422891370,05/19/2020,1.0,"TW: slavery, pedophilia & sexual assaultDisclaimer: I am a white reader and reviewer so take this review with a grain of salt. I did some research in regards to this novel and its authenticity, which I mention here. I'm trying to find some own-voices reviews and I will tag them for you to check them out.I don't think it was Arthur Golden's place to write a novel about the geisha culture.I say this not only due to how he appropriates a Japanese tradition that does not belong to him but how he decides to write a melodramatic and Americanized romance about geishas. Yes, because I highly doubt Japanese people would be applauding Americans, such as portrayed in this book, especially after the events of WW2 and the bombings.My thoughts regarding Memoirs of a Geisha are based on two factors: (1) the storytelling and the (2) controversy.In regards to the storytelling, let me begin by saying that it's odd that you'd want to write an ""accurate"" novel about this part of the Japanese tradition whilst using the wrong term for it. Geisha is used throughout the book but, considering it focuses on the geishas in Gion, Kyoto the right term would have been geiko. Geisha is the term used in Tokyo. And yes, there are differences between them.The main plot events were written for the shock factor and to create some melodrama between characters. The characters, including Sayuri, have no depth to them. I was particularly disappointed at how fixated Sayuri became over one man for the course of 15 YEARS. It's unrealistic (and you can tell this was written by a man).Despite Sayuri's journey and hardships, this was a novel where she merely recounts her life. There's no personality to her besides her unrequited love and fixation. And the same can be said by every other character. I especially detested how Hatsumomo was written as a villain without any explanation or depth to the character. It was the common case of turning women against each other for the sake of interest and plot.Finally, I really hated the romance and the pedophilia in this. I'm sorry, it's not okay for a 40-year-old man to be interested in a 15-year-old and to keep that interest throughout the years. It's not romantic, and I don't care if this is historical fiction.Now, regarding the controversy. I think it says a lot about a person when they break the simplest of promises. This was written (and then changed for the melodrama value) based on Iwasaki Mineko's life. She trusted the author with her story and to help him understand the culture in exchange for anonymity and he couldn't even keep that to himself. Nevermind how ill he portrayed some aspects. It's ironic how he says this is a fiction work based on a real person.I honestly don't believe it was his novel to write or if it had to happen, then at least co-author it with Iwasaki. Since this was published, she has written her own autobiography to explain the inconsistencies she found in Memoirs. As, Tanaka (2006) says: ""For me at least, a much more interesting setting for the novel would have been the world of geisha as observed by a visiting American man. Golden could not handle this, probably, because that would bring the novel closer to non-fiction and call for 'real realism,' rather than Memoirs' 'imaginary realism' (which is not realism at all).""I think it's ironic how Golden starts the book by explaining the myth of geishas as prostitutes and how it's false, for then to show that same message throughout the book. There's a moment when the girl goes from maiko to geiko called mizuage, and Golden shows that it happens by selling the girl's virginity to the highest bidder. However, the mizuage is characterized by giving offerings to various tea houses and okiya in order to introduce the newly established geiko; it has nothing to do with virginity.According to Tanaka (2006), they explain how Golden failed to be accurate in the small details - when introducing a character, he wrote their first name first and then the last one when the last name always comes first. How he used the term okiya to name geisha houses (where they live) when the correct term is yakata. In their paper, Tanaka shows how a book like this can contribute to the perpetuation of racism against Japanese people. Additionally, there's a part in the novel where Sayuri gets beaten as punishment for trying to escape but according to Iwasaki, maikos (the apprentices) and geikos were forbidden from behind harmed, especially by their home as they were seen as something precious to be taken care of.My copy of this novel was given to me second-hand and I know I would have thought differently about it if I had read it as a teen. However, I do know better and I want to listen and support the voices of POC that are constantly ignored or harmed by appropriation.Every day they are fighting for their place in publishing, to get their book noticed by an agent and/or editor when it's so common to see (e.g. this novel) white authors become bestsellers for a culture that is not their own and when authors of color do it, they don't even get a third of their success. That is if authors of color are even given the chance in the first place.I want to add that if you've enjoyed this novel, that's your right and I'm happy for you. These are just my thoughts. I also know my place of privilege as a white reader, and I would rather support Iwasaki Mineko's autobiography, Geisha of Gion, which is what I should have done in the first place.",7,0.9928,0.088,0.782,0.13,0.4759956709956709,NEGATIVE,1.0

214,3925510956,04/04/2021,4.0,"Very descriptive writing. As if I was there seeing what Chiyo was looking at or feeling in a specific scene. The novel spans a period before and after World War II and that made it very interesting for me. Knowing not only how the Geishas survived during the invasion of Asia by Japan but also knowing that they suffered too from that pointless war was both a surprise and a pity.Those are the two aspects of the novel that I appreciated the most. I enjoyed the first-person narration by Arthur Golden voicing the story told to him by a popular geisha during that period in Japan. Prior to this book, I thought that Geishas were not prostitutes. This book taught me that they are prostitutes too but they are first-class and they are trained on arts (painting, sculpting, singing, classical dancing), tea ceremony and they are elaborately dressed. I thought I saw a real Geisha when I was in Tokyo (or was it in Narita?) more than a decade ago but I just did not see the delightful beauty of those that where described in this book. There have been a number of beautifully written novels told by a female protagonist through the narration of a male author. This book adds to my list of those. Simply amazing. How could Arthur Golden be able to use detailed descriptive writing considering that the story was orally narrated to him by Chiyo when that later was in her 90's and already living in the USA.If you want to know more about Geishas during the 30's through the 50's this book is for you.",6,0.9772,0.055,0.796,0.149,0.5046666666666666,POSITIVE,0.9981

The story centres around Sayuri, who we follow from the late 1920s to the post-war years of Japan. Starting out as a young peasant girl who's sold as a servant to a renowned geisha house, she slowly works her way up to become an expert in beguiling the land's most powerful men. This obviously doesn't happen without a fair share of intrigue, setbacks and exploitation. I'm personally interested in everything associated with Japanese culture and way of living. In that regard, this book took me straight back to Kyoto, which I had the pleasure of spending time in myself. The story of Sayuri was gripping and intriguing as well. I rooted for her. It was fun learning about how much business there is to becoming a geisha and how tough the education is – don't expect more than three or four hours of sleep and lots of training in literally every art form there is. The problems emerge as soon as you dig deeper than that – this, after all, isn't the account of a geisha, despite the misleading title, but a Western interpretation of one. The author Arthur Golden interviewed Mineko Iwasaki, a retired geisha, as part of his research, but upon publication of his novel got into a lawsuit, as he apparently agreed to protect her anonymity, which he didn't end up doing by explicitly thanking her in the book. She ended up penning her own book to undo the misconceptions Golden intensified on the life of Geishas, as he certainly didn't quite help with clearing up the rumour that geishas are nothing more than high-end prostitutes.I can't help but to say that this book was entertaining, though a lot voyeuristic than one might expect from the title that hints at accuracy and depth. The writing was also occasionally quite flat and visual in a strange minimalist sort of way, which made me wonder whether Golden was trying to imitate the Japanese way of communication, or if that just actually is the way he expresses himself. If I'm honest, I don't quite care enough to find out.",6,0.9365,0.048,0.857,0.095,0.4224937343358396,NEGATIVE,0.7137

That's when you start to see her change and when this happens everything seems different. The world to a geisha is beautiful a rich but to a simple person, Japan or Gion would seem cruel and unfair. I feel that this plays a big part in this book.Overall I think this book very good but not for my age. I feel I would much more appreciative of this book if I were 20 or older.

There is the heroine - vulnerable but strong in her will to survive - who endures with a grace and integrity that remain unbroken although everyone she loves and all that she holds dear is taken from her. It starts with memoir but not a memoir of any emperor or princess or a girl from tipsy house how she sold to Geisha market, then virginity bidding, then danna, the challenges she faced, the moment where she though to run, the love which she crave for, the hidden feelings, how she make her debut, rivalry, makeup description, how Geisha entertain men, Sake, tea, shamisen, dancing lesson, grief, betrayal, friendship, karma how what goes around comes around last but not least i thought it is tale of unrequited love   We lead our lives like water flowing down a hill, going more or less in one direction until we splash onto something that forces us to find a new course.  There are few instance which makes me the think this book should be read by every individual especially in the adolescence phase the reason being it touches a thing or two about like also at time it is kind of self help book - like a moment came in life where Sayuri was feeling devastated but then she realized if a nation like Japan which has been teetered into pieces can be risen we all human being can also. The book is highly descriptive and trust me once you starts you will feel like you are reading a thriller, and then in the last comes the most unexpected climax, which you might not have expected, because i didn't see it coming :) It is laden with twists, full of schemes and intrigue, and shadowy unknown benefactors that influence the course of the Sayuri's life with small actions that have tremendous impact  Destiny isn't always like a party at the end of evening, sometimes it's nothing more than struggling through life from day to day.  Highly recommended, filled with picturesque life lessons in human nature, dreams of youth colored by naivety, manipulation and bullying to jockey for position, as well as reminding of the temporary nature of all things, but especially of youth, beauty, strength and position. Very important read to see how restrictive a life shapes what men expect from the females and how they are willing to pay for their needs met.   “The heart dies a slow death, shedding each hope like leaves until one day there are none. No hopes. Nothing remains.”   I will end up with 4.5/5 because there were few instance where i felt it is quite melodramatic Last but not least   “You cannot say to the sun, 'More sun,' or to the rain, 'Less rain.' To a man, geisha can only be half a wife. We are the wives of nightfall. And yet, to learn kindness after so much unkindness, to understand that a little girl with more courage than she knew, would find her prayers were answered, can that not be called happiness?

221,622779104,05/23/2013,2.0,"I did enjoy this book, I really did. But I have a lot more complaints than praise. There's always going to be a certain degree of ""ugh"" about a white guy from Tennessee thinking they're qualified to write about being a Japanese geisha because they took some Japanese history courses in university. I'm never going to fully support stories about women, about minority races, about foreign cultures told by the ultimate majority - a white, well educated, American man. It happens far too often, and is often skewed in such a way to benefit (or gloss over the inherent privilege, or the inherent abuse inflicted by) the white-american-male. Not to mention it silences ACTUAL women, ACTUAL members of these minority groups and prohibits them from telling their own stories. Do you think an actual geisha trying to write her real memoirs would be as well received and commercially popular as Arthur Golden's fictionalized version?? No. It probably wouldn't even get a major publisher.My feelings on white men co-opting the stories of minorities for their own financial (or artistic in this case, the book received much praise) obviously affected my reading experience and was hard to look past and enjoy the book. I'm aware the narrative is first person, but anytime geishas or the Japanese were referred to as ""we"", I became hyper aware that a guy from Tennessee wrote this. When talking about WWII and it's effect on the Japanese geisha districts (and Japan in general), atrocities committed by America were so largely glossed over. America was barely mentioned as the enemy. Hiroshima was mentioned in a sentence. Yet post-American invasion, the American soldiers were described as ""nice"" (they're not) and not at all people who ""killed and raped"" the Japanese (they were). When the protagonist Sayuri attends a party with American soldiers, she's shocked by how personable and way more fun than Japanese men they were, and how they all got along so wonderfully despite their language barrier. That just reeks of bullshit to me. Of romanticized bullshit by a white, male American with no real gauge of how vile America is regarding foreign policy or all the irredeemable shit they pulled on Japan during WWII.Besides my political aversion to pretty much everything this book is, it's an ok read. A decent story. It's not actually incredibly well written. The abundant similes sprinkled generously throughout as an attempt at depth and eloquence were actually kind of dumb and heavy handed. The plot itself was scattered and met a really slapdash end. The actual exploration of geisha life was superficial at best, and character development was... not great (Sayuri was basically a Mary Sue, and even when her flaws and mistakes were pointed out to her, they were written off as more revealing of the negative character traits of those pointing them out to her). It's an ok light read, but quite clearly Arthur Golden showing off everything he knows about Japan and a conversation he had with a former geisha one time.  I've done a bit of trashing of Arthur Golden in this... am I not abiding by GR's new review policies?? Who knows?",6,-0.9617,0.125,0.762,0.113,0.3906434474616292,NEGATIVE,1.0

The fact that I was in a reading slump and obsessed with TV shows for a while before that had an impact in this, I guess. Nevertheless, I only thought about how much I would want just to see the movie and mark this book as read without actually finishing it. And I don’t think this is the right first impression a book should make.I’ve never been a big fan of Japan or Japanese culture. Surely it is beautiful in its own way, but to me it is still a strange country with customs that are difficult to understand, even if I learned a lot about this subject from this book. In a nutshell, the book describes the entire process of becoming a geisha. Starting from the moment the girls are sold by their families all the way up to finally achieving that high status of a successful geisha. (And no, it is not a spoiler, Sayuri basically notifies us about the ending of the story from the first pages.) There were a few things that bothered me. Firstly, it was veeeery slow. There were a lot of descriptions packed with tons of metaphors, which offer elegance and beauty to the story alongside with useful information, nobody denies that, but actually make it even slower up to the point they become annoying AF. Also, I started this book with the thought that I should not expect too much from the point of view of veracity, as it is written by an American author. I won’t say this expectation justified itself, as I am not an expert in Asian cultures myself, but still I had that feeling that I shouldn’t believe everything that is told in here. Speaking of the good things... The characters weren’t too bad. I liked Mameha, even though she seemed too perfect. She is the ”good guy”, the angel of the story, the one who saved Sayuri’s destiny and helped her step on the right way. I also liked Pumpkin in the first half of the story. She seemed funny, with her tongue sticking out when she was really focused on something. She also had a funny nickname, and the only one I could pronounce and actually remember. (The names were such a pain in the ass for me and they seemed to be a problem for the main character as well, as she gave nicknames to almost everybody...). The only thing I can say about the main character is that I liked her as Chiyo more. She kind of lost herself after becoming a geisha. Oh, and I also liked the painter, whose name I cannot remember (of course)... I thought he was the only character that seemed alive. And for sure I love the cover...

223,2232328451,01/08/2018,3.0,"6/10Despite author Arthur Golden's extensive research into the geisha and Japanese culture, the story is lacking a genuine voice. Told from the first-person perspective of Chiyo, the story follows a young girl as she trains to become a geisha after being sold into the business by her father. Though the language is striking and evocative of early twentieth Japan, intricacies of the geisha life are omitted, and the woman v. woman competitiveness of the geisha tradition becomes trivialized and condensed. Furthermore, Chiyo's realization of what she supposes her fate to be throws the story into a trajectory that doesn't quite satisfy the reader, if the reader is looking for a deep introspection and reflection on the Japanese geisha culture and society.--Although Golden has done extensive research prior to writing this novel, the first-person narrative voice does not feel genuine. I'm uncertain if this is because of the fact that I know it's written by a Western author or the fact that the story just did not prove to be what was advertised.(view spoiler)[The writing is beautiful, I'll give it that, but it doesn't save the novel from the other issues I have with it, the foremost being that Memoirs barely scratches the surface of what it purports to have. Instead of exploring the female world of the geisha in their okiya, the story is reduced to mainly focusing on Sayuri as she tries to secure the affections of the Chairman, who acts, by the way, as the primary motivation for Sayuri to become a full-fledged geisha.The novel even glosses over Sayuri's being sold into the business. Once Sayuri realizes that her ""destiny"" is to become a geisha and to ""be with"" the Chairman, she resumes her geisha training and never uttered is another complaint.The pacing is off as well. The middle section of the book dragged while the ending was a bit hasty.However, I learned more about geisha and the Japanese culture in general. I knew next to nothing about them before reading this, so I'm grateful for the introduction. I will give props to Golden for respecting the Japanese culture and having done as much research as he did.

The statement, 'the earth is our world but our world might not necessary be the earth' holds true due to the minds ability to craft threads of association with elements of its preference. Our world might indicate a person, a place or even a range of perspectives that is individually unique.Memoirs of a Geisha is as unique as the mind's perspective. It takes the guise of a memoir, with white face paint to hide the fact that in reality it is nothing but a work of fiction. The book follows the story of a young girl, who through deceit, is sold to an okiya to become a Geisha in the district of Gion. For a Geisha, working in the pleasure districts of Japan, 'the world' she lives in is so uniquely different that when an outsider looks into it, they can't help but be fascinated by it.The fluidity in the narrative entranced me as it flowed through the rich details of a Geisha's life, from the sacrifices, the ceremonies, their duties and finally the injustice of them all. This is a story about culture, destiny and ambition. However would not call this a love story, though many might argue. Calling it a love story would be me nodding towards the wild tides of patriarchy. This was a facet of Japanese culture I enjoyed reading about.Though the words strummed together to deliver a beautiful tune about Japanese culture and the Geisha, one thought echoed painfully through the sentences that ultimately served as a blockade from immersing myself completely into the richness of the story. Arthur Golden is neither Japanese nor a woman. Though there is an exquisite amount of research that describes Japan and the Geisha elegantly, there is also a faint lingering of Western influence, sneaking up between the words. However, encapsulating the entirety into a single summation, I deliver the verdict that the story was a work of art. I couldn't help but fall in love with Sayuri.

There was something about the way the movie approached the story or the characters that I didn't like and that completely turned me off from reading the book. I basically did something I know better than to do. I know the book is always better than the movie. The proof is right here.Golden's writing is completely hypnotic. It flows steadily and evenly through the places, people and actions with a certain musical quality that not many writers possess. What pleased me the most was that it never seemed as if he got lost or tired in his writing. Every section, every word came across to me as perfectly planned and thought out, and never rushed through, so I never felt that I was robbed of something vital.The thing that I liked most about the book was that Chiyo/Sayuri was very real. She wasn't some sort of heroine thrust into this lifestyle that decides to start breaking all the rules and becoming a rebel. She lives the life. She accepts the life (for the most part) and she follows the rules and actions. As much as I love the tough women who assert themselves as equals to men, there was something refreshing about Sayuri following the rythm and rules of geisha. Geisha are, by no means, submissive and Sayuri still comes across as a very strong character, but it's not blown to an unrealistic, Joan of Arc-type of proportion. That alone sold the book for me.Honestly, nothing about this book disappointed me. Everything came together perfectly to create a beautiful piece of literature. The ending, without giving anything away, might be disappointing for some people, with Sayuri's difficult choice and the results that come from it.

With the help of Mameha, Sayuri is able to do so successfully and to rid herself of Hatsumomo. This is a great book that should help break the stereotypes that geisha were prostitutes. Not to say that they did not have sex. This book has enough sexual content that I would not recommend this book for children or teens. It is a great story and ultimately a love story. Golden has Sayuri describe things in such a poetic manner that you cannot help falling in love with her. The reader feels her every disappointment and revels in her every victory.

While it was a 4 star read for me before, now it is a mid three (2.5?).I didn't find it romantic at all. I also got lost in the game of figuring out what was 'truth' and what was pure fiction. I guess the way it was written the reader expects a certain level of historical accuracy. When you find out that much of it is a 'lie' it loses so much of the magic.This was one of those sad re reads where you wish you would have left well enough alone and in the past. While it is still a lovely story, it holds a certain level of betrayal (for the reader). I certainly want to read Geisha, A Life next. My understanding is that this was truly written by a Geisha, Mineko Iwasaki, and I am interested to see what I can truly learn.",6,0.9862,0.079,0.73,0.191,0.4347111992945325,NEGATIVE,0.9978

As a child she was deceived by the external appearance of what she saw as beautiful with Geisha women, but behind all that 'allure' is a facade which is aimed to prey the gullible. Eventually as it turned out, it was this very man whom she admired and 'loved' who set out and 'determined' the path which was to be her life. This is a very morally questionable novel and despite the apparent differences of their roles, what it is to be a geisha and a prostitute are basically the same.

251,3171873366,05/07/2021,2.0,"⭐️⭐️✨2.5 starsThis book frustrated me beyond words. I’ll try to articulate why - bullet soapbox below. Pros:- I love Japan. - as the story was set in Japan, it made me more interested in certain topics which led to me reading for hours about the symbolism of geisha makeup and the history of Kyoto.  - it had a succinct plot and some romantic scandal which I always am down for. Cons:- Cultural & historical inaccuracy: geisha were NOT prostitutes. The word literally means “artist”. There are whole other groups of women who did sell sex but geisha were highly trained dancers, musicians, performers, and conversationalists. Selling sex might’ve been a corrupt exception but geisha were highly respected in society and it would have been insulting for someone of their status to do what the geisha did in this book. Prostitution is also outlawed in Japan. The idea of “mizuage” which is the main plot line of the book is not true. Geisha did not sell their virginity and mizuage was actually a hairstyle change that occurred as a coming of age tradition for maiko.- “Memoir” is misleading: did you know that this book is NOT a memoir? It’s fiction. We’ve all been duped into thinking it’s a historical memoir, when it was in fact just tid bits of an interview the author had with a real geisha- and later he manipulated her facts into fiction which led to a lawsuit. - Author: a white male wrote a book from the POV of a teenage girl about her losing her virginity. That’s all I need to say. - Impact: this book has perpetuated an unhealthy attitude of western idealization/fetishization and a severe misinterpretation of Japanese customs and culture overall. There is such a rich tradition of Japanese literature. It’s not hard to notice the sheer amount of much better, actually authentic Japanese books out there - why are we wasting our time reading books like this one? Why are we allowing book clubs to let their brains melt reading culturally inaccurate stories like this one? Go grab yourself some Mishima, Murakami, or Soseki. Leave this one on the shelves, people.

Even though I was disappointed to find out that she was never real, the story of Chiyo/Sayuri was as interesting in paper as it was on screen. Traditional Japanese customs are so very different than anything I knew growing up in this part of the world and so for me this book worked not only as a great story teller but also as an incredibly fun educational tool where history is concerned. As I was already familiar with the story I was reading I was able to devote my attention to the details Arthur Golden used to enrich each interaction and really learn from him. His attention to all these details is what makes this book so great for me because as you read you understand that its not just his choice of writing but very much necessary so that the reader understands the things that were taken most seriously during those years. All characters go out of their way to ensure that so many every day tasks are done in incredibly specific ways in fear of bad luck or gossip or their reputation and they each devote their entire lives to what they are doing regardless of pain or any kind of discomfort and sacrifice. Anything less than that is viewed as an unacceptable waste and was not tolerated. A very harsh way to live but apparently the only one available with the ability to produce the excellence they wanted to live in. There were several times I wanted to jump in the book and help Sayuri find her voice. I disagree with many of her decisions, especially when it came to her behavior towards Pumpkin, the Chairman and Nobu but understand that when life has been as cold to someone like it was to her opportunities must have seemed the most precious of commodities not to be given to anyone else. I actually very much liked Nobu and wanted better for him. He is probably the nicest and most ethical person in the book if you ask me and was better to her than the Chairman was. Of course I was happy at the end but couldn't help but feel the cultural gap between us as from where I'm sitting, I see all those years as a colossal waste of time.

But it is up to us to overcome the constant obstructions in order to find hope in our hearts, just like a Phoenix is reborn from its own asses.I could describe it as an alternative form of ancient Greek tragedy, as the deference between what it's true and what things appear to be is a common thing in the book, along with  a few moments of tragic irony here and there. All the characters are wonderful. They stay true to their character through out the whole book and the reader is focused on what is going to happen next.Here somewhere, I feel the need to say that the too detailed descriptions make the book tiring and unfinishable.

It is visually rich, and the protagonist's character is well developed, particular in stereotypical motifs (eyes, superstitions, accidents) and in her own peculiar sense of destiny and her use of metaphors in speaking. Though the book produced a nice film a few years ago, I did not love it on rereading it. It wasn't bad, but it didn't bring me back the way I wanted it to. I've also grown a little tired of (uncomfortable with? impatient with?) only Western readings of Japan, like the Tom Cruise movie, most of hte histories we would read in English, and those old Gaijin novels. The lovely film had a Chinese actress, as if it wouldn't matter--all Asians are the same, right?

After that I'm going to read The Tale of Genji, given to me when leaving Japan (not the entire 2500 pages, just my 300-page abridgement).

Both girls are very young and watching their mother deteriorate before their eyes. So, they were sold by their father into a sort of slavery.Chiyo is sold to an okiya, where she undergoes crucial training to become a geisha. Her virginity is auctioned off to the highest bidder, she is physically and psychologically abused by her housemates, and then she has her name changed to Sayuri. The story takes you on a path similar to that of young girls sold into prostitution all over the world. No, aside from her auctioned off virginity she's never forced to have sex, but all of her earnings go directly to the okiya and her older sister the same way a pimp would take the earnings of his girls.The book sets you up to be shocked at every page. So many things happen to Sayuri from beginning to end that you can't possibly continue to believe what she'll have to endure next. I don't think I would have survived in this situation the same way she did. But she did the best she could with what she was given. She gave a whole new meaning to perseverance.I've read other books, like The Guest Room, about young girls getting forced into trafficking, but none of them have really hit me like this one did. The emotions were so real, and every paragraph really brought you right into Japan. I love Japanese culture, and, admittedly, I don't know much about geishas in current times. But while the training is intense as much as the upkeep, it really is a beautiful tradition. Women entertain men without the happy ending, just stories and drinking games. Of course, there are times where a geisha gives in to advances, but it wasn't the top priority of any of these parties.A lot of this book made me sad. The separation of Chiyo and Stasu at the beginning, the falling out of friendships, and of course the war all brought real emotion into the story. For a group of women who do so much entertaining, the life does seem very lonely. They never build a real relationship with other geisha or men; they are merely there for entertainment and to get paid.I did love the ending of this book, however. I was happy when she finally got her true wish and eventually landed herself in New York. She took a life that was forced on her and made it into her own business when she finally made the move. Is there anything more inspiring?I think everyone should read this book, especially young girls. While some of the content isn't very happy, the ending should inspire the reader to rebuild themselves from the ashes. It's honestly such a beautiful book and so well written. If I didn't have to go to work and sleep every once in a while this would have been finished much sooner!",5,0.9953,0.059,0.798,0.144,0.5001819128048637,NEGATIVE,0.9213
266,315080811,04/19/2012,4.0,"Memoirs of a Geisha is a beautiful book, much like a Japanese water-colour painting, which will leave you admiring it for hours. As the title indicates, it talks about the life of a geisha Sayuri (Fictional), who though born to a fisherman, saw herself through the turn of fate as one of the most successful geishas of Gion, the pleasure district of Kyoto, Japan.Overall Impact: In terms of content and storyline, I think Arthur Golden has truly done a remarkable job. Yes, I have read many reviews which said that he was not really true to the facts, but (either due to my limited knowledge about Japanese lifestyle, or due to my love for the art of simple story-telling ) it did not bother me from enjoying the novel to the fullest.Characterization: Sayuri made a wonderful protagonist. Both as a little girl sold off to the geishas to begin a life of uncertainty and hardships, and later as a woman, trying to reach out to the one man whom she loved. However, the one character which i believe has added much of the dazzle in the story is Hatsumoto, Sayuri's arch nemesis. Indeed after her defeat, when she moved out of Sayuri's life, I could not help missing her presence. On the other hand, I absolutely hated most of the male characters. Maybe this was intentional on the part of the author, to show us how vulnerable and hard the life of a geisha was beneath all the glamour and laughter, but i cant empathize with even one of them. I must admit, to me even the Chairman had his set of flaws.(I rather liked him in the movie adaptation)Negetives: It stretched out for a bit too long. She really did not have to chase her man for fifteen long years before coming to a conclusion. Towards the end, (after the second world war) I really felt a little editing would've helped, which is the sole reason I give it a 4/5.Comments: I felt really sad for the Geishas. Not once in their lives are they offered a choice. Do they love the men they entertain? How do they feel being the mistresses of the very men that they despise just so that it'll help them clear the debts of their okiyas? How is it that their illegitimate children are looked at with shame, and yet they take pride on their jobs? This book kept me thinking about the position of women in the Eastern countries in general because in India too did we once have a familiar class of women called the ""dasi""s. I know they were not truly prostitutes, as they were women of art and culture, yet deep down within I do not think it made any of these unfortunate women any less vulnerable.

267,1231226936,03/18/2015,4.0,"Sensational! Sayuri's poetic lyricism,  deep feelings and innocence  (I can still feel and admire it) that you'll feel a certain exotic music in your read; and her persistent longing for her only love; her definition of a life (or a cruel life); her indestructible passionate memories; each will you carry you to a world you would hardly have ever dreamt of.I already am in love with Japanese-like culture for their (depiction of) genuine, pure and deep feelings. Apart from this, their culture of Geisha when it comes to artistic passion unlike prostitution and free-eroticism (at least as the book shows) is different from a mere Prostitution. Like a Geisha won't have an intimate relationship with just every other man she encounters or is offered for, even for a large sum. Instead they will have to pay for particular days of entertainment in which the geisha will act as entertainer or half-wife in that particular period (and not just for intimacy). So if you cut-off intimate relationship and focus just on artistic-passion and feelings, you will find that culture truly amazing.Sayuri, taken away from home and sold to an Okiya (her sister in a separate one) and given up further by cruelty of Hatsumomo sheds all hope to live a better life until she comes across Chairman by accident, whose kindness and lovely nature gives her a new leaf to turn in life; a destiny to achieve and a hope as an island surrounded by desperation.Only for him she chooses to rise up and become a successful person as Geisha.Everyday she strives hard and try live up to her dream and love. And does everything possible to get to Chairman. However with much changes taking place in her Okiya, Gion and rest of Japan during Great Depression and later WW-II; she finds herself amidst a harsh life with no hope to get Chairman to her life.And there is much more and deeper for you to read.

When we walk along, we may crush a beetle or simply cause a change in the air so that a fly ends up where it might never have gone otherwise.""At the heart of it, I will not call this a simple story. But it is beautifully written. This is the story of Chiyo aka Sayuri, whose journey has been portrayed from the very bleak beginning with an eloquent hand. What's more, it's her own personal narration. A turn of events brings her to Kyoto, only to start as a maid in an okiya and if everything goes well, to graduate into a geisha. Geisha are not to be mistaken as prostitutes. They are miles apart from them. They entertain people. They perform tea ceremonies and magnificient dances, often inspired from Japanese and other folklore and stories and mythologies, among other duties. The cultural richness penned so gracefully in the book really embosses the elegance of Japanese traditions. Sayuri defies all odds to reach her destiny. Or so she believes she will. The book being in her voice made it a very intimate and engaging read. It was as if the story is meant just for your own eyes. You can feel the blue-gray eyes staring through you as she progresses. You could almost believe it to be her real story. It is sad at times. She struggles a lot. Inspite of that, she never loses her innocence. A word must go out for the similes and metaphors in the book. Though some of them seemed very childish, some of them defined grace. And they abound in number. The problem I had was the incident where Sayuri decides to shun one of her benefactors to steer the course of her life(won't mention the names here to keep it spoiler-free). I do not know how to proceed without giving away the storyline. But that seemed very immature of such a deep, moving character. It almost made me angry. I was hoping till the very last moment that she would change her mind. Also, the book lacked pace where I expected it to be swift. Just a small part. Important, nonetheless.A good read, all in all.

269,187378649,07/22/2011,3.0,"While the book was insightful and charmingly written, I'm not as prone to gushing over with enthusiasm for it as some. There were a few impactful takeaways, to be sure. I feel far more informed of precisely what a Geisha is/was, while previously I'd been under the impression that they were purely entertainers.(Well, then again I suppose that depends on one's definition of 'entertainment.') Now I've come to the realization that, for hundreds of years, the lifestyle of a Geisha was rarely a chosen one. While beautifully depicted in its own way, this book defines it essentially as the aristocracy of slavery and prostitution. If you love metaphors and word pictures, this book may very well delight you all the way through. For me, it steadily became more of an irritant. It felt as though they'd been inserted in every page as a covert way of lengthening the book beyond all common acceptability of the genre. And while the writing style is exceptional and the imagery vivid, there were a few things that knocked down my overall rating...One issue being the main character's ongoing childhood romantic obsession with a married man who is at least 25 years her senior. This felt less authentic to me, and more like a mental illness, making the main character's growth feel a bit stunted. Also, from the reviews I was under the impression that there would be more of a grasp of sensuality throughout. Instead, there was the disturbing portrayal of molestation, objectification, and the general impression that a Geisha's sex life reduced them to little more than passive blow-up dolls. (mild spoiler alert)While possessing a certain desperate sadness from beginning to end, this was fortunately not a typical Asian tragedy. Though, don't expect a happily-ever-after. The heroine does not seem to grow out of a soul-crushing dependence on men, and settles for what feels more like a bitter-sweet mutually beneficial 'arrangement' after much bridge-burning. Accurate or not (and I know that is up for debate) the story itself didn't leave me with any real satisfaction. ",5,0.9826,0.067,0.775,0.158,0.5118342151675486,NEGATIVE,1.0

I'm guessing the only reason Arthur Golden was able to write this book is because he hijacked the story from a geisha he interviewed, Mark Twain-style.Like other reviewers have mentioned, the writing style could best be described as ""faux-Asian"" with nature metaphors sprinkled everywhere. Fish, rivers, cherry blossoms, etc. Like the author was trying very hard to sound Japanese. Also, despite all the female characters, the story had a masculine edge that watered down the protagonist's believability and voice. The male gaze was everywhere, and men were the focus of nearly everything.This was especially clear during the mizuage ceremony, when Sayori loses her virginity. Golden describes the experience as ""uncomfortable,"" but that's it. I don't know about you, but when a weird man has sex with a virgin teenage girl who's nervous, ""uncomfortable"" is not the word that comes to my mind. Maybe nauseating? Painful? Horrible in every way?I hate to put a patriarchy label on everything, but seriously. The protagonist's single goal in life was to be a certain man's lover. That, combined with her submissiveness and emotional limpness, made her feel like a puppet to male desire, rather than a strong character in her own right.",5,0.8966,0.107,0.751,0.142,0.4943838183421516,NEGATIVE,1.0

Yes. Is it well researched and largely accurate? Yes. Am I glad that it is a fictional well-written story and not an encyclopediac rendering?

""Memoirs"" filled the bill: it was sorta yucky but not as bad as a pandemic. I liked some ofthe atmospheric/cultural touches.

That may have been the authors point, but Sayuri's late-in-the-story betrayal of a love left me with a bad taste: I didn't much like her anyway so didn't much care nor believe it.

Surely there's something about the dedication and discipline in leaving their own homes, their own blood, for the pursuit of beauty. Surely there's more.And thankfully there is.

It was incredibly good. It does have sometimes disturbing and mature content, so that is something that others should keep in mind. The definition of ""geisha"" is ""a Japanese hostess trained to entertain men with conversation, dance, and song,"" and they were different from their courtesan counterparts because they were intended for intellectual company and entertainment. However, as this book reveals, there were periods of time when a geisha's duties intersected with those of courtesans and sex was purchased. Another interesting bit of information I know regarding geishas: where a wife in Japan was expected to be modest, geishas were expected and encouraged to flaunt their skills, showing everything they were capable of. The more talent, the more beauty, then the more admirers, the more fame, the more value in social status and money the geisha had.

I do think he certainly writes from a very Western perspective, but I don’t find that it really hurt the novel in anyway.His writing style is truly beautiful. The novel drags a little in the beginning because the reader is so eager to be immersed in the alluring world of the geisha, not as a geisha along with Sayuri, but instead as a man eager for a glimpse into their world. Once Sayuri’s struggled begin, the novel becomes impossible to put down. The reader is so eager to travel through time with her as she becomes one of Gion’s most famous geisha, with Golden’s beautiful prose as accompaniment.

The emotions brought out really touches you. You laugh, cry, struggle, love, fall and feel the pain with the characters.Its a story about destiny of a Geisha or an artist. Although the whole concept of geisha is alien to a lot of cultures, the author gives you a first hand view of a geisha's life through the eyes of a geisha and you can connect with the protagonist.The story is a like a beautiful ballad with its highs, lows, pathos. Its incredibly well conceived and you can watch the story play out in front of your eyes right from Mameha's beauty to Gion's grey landscape to Hatsumomo's hatred to even Chiyo's blue gray eyes.This story is one of love, resilience, beauty, poise through changing circumstances.

Overall it left a positive effect on me. Examples of the beautiful writing styles;-""the radiant smile she'd worn faded, just as darkness fades from a valley when the sun rises.""-""He was a small man, but keep in mind that a stick of dynamite is small too.""-""[I felt as though] the sun had vanished, possibly for good, and I was now condemned to stand wet and naked in the icy air.""-""she had a cough that was much a part of her as a song is part of a bird.

285,1659407498,06/05/2016,4.0,"Beautiful and heartfelt. My first encounter with Geisha was through the 80's Japanese TV series Oshin. There were little bits and pieces about them and then many years later this fell onto my lap. The characters are so diverse they have their own story represented by just the way they were created. The events are incredibly emotional. It's a historical fiction so I'm not going to say ""man I've learnt all about this culture through the book"", nonetheless, it dis gave me an insight of a fascinating time and practices. I really enjoyed the movie too. Well done and one of those movies that did justice to the book. ",5,0.9715,0.0,0.804,0.196,0.5444444444444445,POSITIVE,0.9999

The only criticism that I have is that it could have been shorter. This works less well as a gripping story of someone's life than as a picture of the backdrop, and there are long parts that, while personally important to the person, are less illuminating. Still, I would recommend this to nearly anyone who can tackle something of this length fairly casually.",5,0.5103,0.08,0.795,0.126,0.603125,POSITIVE,0.9999

Memoirs of a Geisha recounts the tale of a girl born in a fishing village who becomes a celebrated geisha and her determination to find love in her world. Overall, I enjoyed this novel's depiction of a geisha's life and the Japanese perspective of World War II, but I found Sayuri's ongoing obsession with the Chairman as her preferred lover tiresome and the conclusion felt a little too perfect to be real.",5,0.9386,0.055,0.725,0.219,0.5458333333333333,POSITIVE,0.9973

I've read some reviews criticising the Western feel to the book, but for a novice such as I in Japanese culture, I probably needed the Western feel to ease me into it all. That being said I would be very interested in reading something deemed more 'accurate'.Overall a truly lovely book, even if the ending was a little cliche.
