I liked a lot this novel!

NASA AND MY PERSONAL ADMIRATION FOR THAT INSTITUTION

In my mind, the men and women of NASA are history's modern pioneers. They attempt the impossible, accept failure, and then back to the drawing board while the rest of us stand back and criticize.
Back then in 2009, I found this novel by chance or fate.By then, I already knew who Dan Brown was (it's not like I was living in cave, hehehe) but I still have to read his way popular books with the character of Robert Langdon. (While I already watched the two film adaptations done so far)However, I found interesting to read this book since I noticed that the story involved NASA.I am a huge fan of NASA, maybe an indirect result of being a fan of Star Trek, I don´t know, maybe even it can be due to being even before fan of Lost in Space and Space: 1999. The main point is that I admire a lot to NASA.And I am still a great fan of anything related with NASA.In fact, one of my fondest memories is when finally I was able to visit the Kennedy Space Center. And even bought a jacket of those (green-like with NASA and Space Shuttle patches) the astronauts wear when they aren't using, well... space suits! :P
ALIEN LIFE BUT NOT YOUR TYPICAL GREEN MEN

There's just no substitute for the truth.
Here, you will find a very good story about the possibility of finding alien life. But maybe not in the way that you were expecting. But a more realistic scientific approach. I liked a lot the way of how Dan Brown proposed his idea of the finding of alien life, since it can be easily the way as it will happen in real life.
ANYTHING THAT NEEDS MONEY FUNDING, EXPECTS RESULTS

Anyone who said power was not addictive had never really experienced it.
I think that a proof of how good is this book (at least to me) is that it's a real dark story, full of dangers and deceptions (it's on the title!) related to NASA and since I admire the institution but the story is presented in such smart and plausible way that I could embrace the tale with open mind, understanding the intended bottom line in the book. Since after all, one thing is any organization and its inspiring goals, and other the people which manage it, that after all, they are just human beings.This book is written in way that if you are fan of Michael Crichton books, you will like this one too. It has a narrative style so engaging that I enjoyed a lot the reading experience.The writing style of Dan Brown is fantastic and I enjoyed the whole experience of reading the book, even more since in some novels you have a very good main plot but some dull secondary plot and/or scenes that you feel ""dragged"" when you have to read those chapters, but in my personal experience with the novel, I enjoyed to read the whole book with all its plots.If you like techno-thrillers, NASA-related novels and/or Dan Browns books, certainly you will enjoy to pick this novel.Highly recommended.",86,0.9986,0.04,0.756,0.204,0.5497054075867635,POSITIVE,0.9989

4,3567323274,10/23/2020,4.0,"Deception Point is one of the earlier Dan Brown novels, but I'd never read it before. I am impatient at waiting for the next one to release, so I figured I'd go back to the two I missed... and while this definitely was a bit over my head when it comes to science and space knowledge, it delivered immensely in terms of suspense, thrills, and shock. I was so angry and anxious throughout most of it, all in a positive way, because of the conflicts and constant stop/start to switch storylines.A senator's daughter is unhappy with her father; he's running for president and trying to muzzle her. She works for an agency that supports the current president. She's unwilling to quit and come work for her father to help his campaign, which is dangerously close to getting enough votes to win the upcoming election. And that's just a side plot! NASA discovers a meteor with interesting data. Someone is murdered in the Arctic wilderness in the opening scene. A young woman is sleeping with a politician and hoping to further her career. How does it all connect? Oh boy... in many ways.First, the anger... perhaps it's current election times that prompted my reaction, but it definitely hit a nerve. I needed the senator to get his comeuppance. Does he? Ah, perhaps yet not in the way I expected. The short chapters truly made this a book I couldn't put down... 530 pages, I thought I'd read 175 each day and be done over the weekend. Nope... All in one sitting. Yeah, I just kept turning and turning and turning. I admit, I skipped a few paragraphs when it got overly scientific. I won't understand it, and those are the areas I wish Brown skimmed a bit on... but then his negative reviewers would complain, so I totally get it. His storytelling ability is one of the best, and I am immediately engaged. I loved the Arctic setting, the DC connections, and the questions it makes me ponder. Characters were good, not extremely memorable, but he's always been more of a plot guy with the supervillain being the one you remember. This had a slightly different style, and you can tell he was cutting his teeth on the classic suspense thriller where it's an international drama and constant sub-plot advancement. Definitely worth a read, and I intend to grab Digital Fortress next so I can say I've read them all so far.",63,0.9888,0.092,0.741,0.166,0.486457599248297,POSITIVE,0.9901

There is not one paragraph that is close to some acceptable literary decency. In 2 pages he found it ok to mention coffee 5 times. No, not fun tidbits about the history of coffee but just as action filler: 'blah blah blah,' he said while he stirred his coffee. Multiply that by 5 (some instance of someone using, gasp, cream, or sugar) and 2 minutes have been sucked from your life. And you will feel it. Unless you're an idiot. I admit I stopped at page 140. It was a marathon of elementary torture. I started it one night and ended it the same.

This would be a huge success for NASA after years of failure.It also comes at a time of presidential election and with the current President and his challenger Senator Sexton having different stances as to what to do with NASA.The discovery of the meteorite therefore becomes part of political powerplay in Washington and Sexton's daughter who's working for the NRO gets caught up in it.She's sent to the Arctic along with oceanographer Michael Tolland and some other scientists and, suffice it to say, things do not go as planned and soon people are either running for their lives or searching for the truth or both.The themes of that story are much more appealing to me compared to the other Dan Brown novels I've read.

This book, like the others, reads too much like a Hollywood script for me (in fact I can totally see this being made into a movie). It's not necessarily a bad thing I guess, just not to my personal taste. Also, if you've read other books by him you'll know what to expect: a male and a female protagonist, a mystery, lots of conspiracy theories, dangerous situations to survive miraculously from, and a twist at the end. This time though, we are not dealing with religious sects but with the NASA, the CIA and the government.Like I said, this formula isn't necessarily a bad thing, and I'm guessing Dan Brown fans will like this book.

It was a well thought out plot with great character development, but I wanted more out of the novel. I wanted a little more suspense and thrills in this novel similar to Digital Fortress. This novel had nothing wrong with it other than me being selfish and wanting more action and thrills. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a quick read with thrills and unexpected plot twists. A great novel!I also want a sequel to this novel, since I want to see all the backlash that happens after the secret is discovered, and the continued building of relationships between some of the main characters.

I like that the plot moves around in scenery from the Arctic to Washington, DC and a few points in-between keeping the action flowing and the characters moving around instead of being static in one place. The characters are well written and believable and, in this book, Brown has written another very strong female lead character as he also did in Digital Fortress. I don't know why these two novels didn't get the press that the Robert Langdon novels did, perhaps it's because they deal with the NSA instead of having a religious based theme that stirs up controversy.

My first read of his work was The Da Vinci Code and from that point there was no stopping of reading his works. Mr. Brown is an amazing story teller. In his books he combines actual historical incidents, historical institutions, secret societies that were and are in operation, secret government institution, agencies etc., with outstanding plot lines which give the stories an air of genuineness. My first reaction to Deception Point was that it has no codes! Dan Brown, the master of codes has indeed written a book without codes! Interesting!The book is woven around NASA’s discovery of a meteorite containing fossils claiming evidence of extraterrestrial life, the effect of this finding on U.S national space policy and future of NASA, the impending U.S presidential election, a daring scientific trickery and an astonishing deception. NASA discovers a meteorite which contains fossils that produces evidence of extraterrestrial life. On President’s instructions four expert civilian scientists, including the charismatic oceanographer Michael Tolland and White House Intelligence analyst Rachel Sexton sets out to NASA finding site at Milne Ice Shelf in the Arctic to verify the authenticity of the NASA finding. The team unravels however that NASA’s claim is false and a disturbing deception has taken place. But before they can alert the relevant authorities, a mysterious team of assassins follow their trails with a fierce determination to kill. The events take place thereafter unfolds a thrilling story line and concludes with some shocking revelations. The book is quite informative with all research well done. The story line is thrilling. The female protagonist, Rachel Sexton was well portrayed to make her so believable. She is a woman with a strong mind yet she has her own fears which show that she is real, almost human. Her hatred towards her father given his history of infidelity which indirectly caused her mother’s death is almost natural. The male protagonist too has been given equal strength in the book which I found quite refreshing. I am always amazed by Mr. Brown’s ability to develop the characters so well that you feel they are so real and close to your heart. The book also subtly touches on political maneuverings to hold power/ to get in to power which is all too common anywhere in the world. However, I felt that although there were a female and a male protagonist, the other characters were also equally strong and because of that the strength attached to the main characters were quite diminished. And also the NASA finding and its deception and the political maneuvering described in the book although was meant as part of the story, I felt the political maneuvering part as a sub plot to the main story line which kind of hindered the smooth flow of the main story. But these minor blemishes did not stop me from enjoying this enthralling tale.All in all good research, good story line, fair character built and good suspense.

23,268524082,01/27/2012,1.0,"dear reader,My first Dan Brown novel. It kept me turning from page to page, thrilled by the action and fast paced plot. Lost by everything that was going on at once for more times I can care to count. Baffled at the new information the author was hurling at me all at once. Confused by the sudden and unexpected plot twists. And frustrated at the stupidity of human simpleness when reasoning possible motives for the death of their comrades or whatever.The twist and motives for the treason weren't strong enough for me, and it lacked flow and intellect. The main character is female, strong, intelligent, beautiful, and rich (I didn't expected less from Mr. Brown). Anyway, typical super heroine from an action book. I wanted more than just thoughtless and senseless action from the book. I was expecting a cunning and deliberate plot twists that I didn't see coming, but I eventually settled with it, considering it brilliant, beyond amazingness. The book fell short from it.

Mix all ingredients together and select a couple of back drops that are slightly exotic and may help the tourism industry in this particular location. Cook ingredients for 400-600 pages with short chapters that move back and forth between scenes, ensuring the low attention span reader does not get too bored.Finally serve with a 'twist' that the evil person hunting them down/causing the drama is one of the old trusted guys that the strong woman trusted and is totally shocked and devastated but leaves no lasting or significant psychological impacts or male trust issues.

I was recently sent this one as part of a bookring and decided to read it.Rachel Sexton works for the National Reconnaissance Office as an intelligence officer. She is also the daughter of a Senator currently running for President. Her father's main offensive, and a very popular one, against the incumbent President is to attack the huge amount of NASA funding. Rachel is barely on speaking terms with her father, believing him to be totally corrupt, but is still worried she is being used by the President when he asks her to verify an amazing find by NASA, a find which will settle the arguments about NASA funding for ever. Reluctantly agreeing to view the find Rachel is whisked off to the North Pole. What she finds once she gets there takes her breath away. However, she quickly learns that nothing is what it seems, and, with two civilian scientists, is soon fleeing for her life. Stranded on an ice berg they are rescued in the nick of time by a nuclear submarine, but once back in the US their attempts to expose the plot show them that they can trust absolutely no one... I ended up enjoying it but found that it lacked the fast pacing that the previous books had (especially Angels and Demons). Only the last third of the book equals them in the action department. Till then things happen but there's no sense of urgency wether in finding the clues or running away from the killers. The plot was nicely done, the find was surprising but I suppose one of the reasons I enjoyed the other books was because they dealt with historical people and monuments. Here it's meteorites and ocean life I don't find that as interesting. It's really me and not the book but sometimes a thriller is so nicely written that can sell me any subject, that was not the case here. Rachel and Tolland were really nice characters and as is usual in the Dan Brown books they give in to their attraction in the end.Grade: C+, entertaining but forgettable.",14,0.9903,0.062,0.784,0.154,0.5385714285714284,NEGATIVE,0.9346

I think this is Mr. Brown at his best and perhaps his more underrated books out of everything he's published so far. I also have no idea why it's not being made into series. Perhaps that's a good thing because too much of a good thing can make the magic disappear, but I think I could live with one or two more Michael Tolland book. I give props for the shocking twist at the end. I did not see it coming. For sheer entertainment value, this book has it all. To be quiet honest, I didn't mind so much the issues the book discusse or did I particularly care about the degree of truthfulness that the ""conspiracy theories"" this book provided. As with all Dan Brown stories, suspension of disbelief is still required to read it but, the heck with that! It was so much fun to read, what with the gripping action that ran throughout the whole story. Actually this book had me at ""NASA"". (Apparently, I'm that much of a geek.) But then Rachel Sexton and Michael Tolland are such compelling characters as well. I was rooting for the both of them since page 1 and I wanted them not only to come out of this ordeal alive, but to have a happy ending. I was even in support of the romance that sparked between them, although I usually ignore the more lovey dovey parts in this genre.

As there's no further reference to her foaming at the mouth, I can only assume he means ""aquaphobia"". The list goes on.And yet, it doesn't matter. Deception Point isn't about literary prowess, it's about plot, pacing and frantic page-turning. And it has all that in spades. Reading Deception Point is like watching a season of 24.

'Deception Point', published in 2001 is another story (no pun intended). I could only stomach 30 pages before i threw in the towel. What a load of unmitigated, illogical, wooden, cliched rubbish. But i'll waste another 20 minutes out of my life to tell you why.  In the first few pages some bloke out in the frozen wastes of (Antarctica?) is descended on by two fellows who land in a helicopter, hold him up at gunpoint, force him to send a message via radio, bundle him & his equipment (sleigh & dogs) onto the helicopter. The helicopter climbs to 4,000 feet & then they toss him , his dogs & the sleigh out of the rear of the copter. Why/ I have no idea. Nor do i care (see above). No doubt the reader discovers why this happens later in the book. I wish i cared why, but i don't. Why throw him out? If they wanted the 'powers that be' to think he had had an accident, why not just kill him & leave him for the dogs to consume when they got hungry? Illogical!  Next we are introduced to two fellows hunkering down, presumably in the same frozen waste. They are introduced as Delta One & Delta Two. Really? I mean, the reader is an invisible observer. Why call them Deltas One & Two? Why not Cyril & Bruce? One can only wonder how their conversations went:Delta Two: ""So, Delta One, your youngest boy, Delta One Jnr starts school soon doesn't he?""Delta One: ""Yeah, Delta Two. End of next week. He wants to be a cold hearted killer, just like his old man.""Delta Two: Really Dude? You must be so proud.""Delta One: ""I am Delta Two. He's a real chip off the old block.""Ye Gods. Cliche. And then we are introduced to the Senator's daughter & the Senator-who-would-be-President. The daughter is of course intelligent, ballsy, gorgeous (but negligently so), has a great job & is naturally, rich. Whilst her pater is insincere, unfaithful to her Mother (whose dead- pathos), superficial, vain & oh yes… a prick. Cliche. But let's skip ahead to my personal fave bit. Said tasty Senator's daughter turns up to the front desk at her workplace & is required by the Marine at the desk to undergo a security procedure, even though he recognizes her. What's the test, i hear you ask? Well she has to place a piece of gauze in her mouth which the Marine then extracts with his own fingers. Ew! Hope he washes his hands after every test. And you don't know whats been in her mouth. Er… she might have a cold. Not to mention the device this saliva soaked gauze is placed in for testing. How is that cleaned or does the accumulated slobber just congregate & slosh around like a primordial swamp? Ew. That's about it. If you're reading this, you may be wondering how i can decide i didn't like this book after only reading 30 pages. In fact i knew after 10 pages it was crap. I read the remaining 20 pages because i'm a Masochist. Also, when one hits a finger with a hammer, it's not necessary to repeat the process to know you don't like it. Hitting my finger with a hammer would have been preferable actually.The PlotYawn… who cares?

I have to admit that the “Robert Langdon” series started to get bored, so after a long break, it happened to me ""Deception Point"" and I decided to try again.The plot is intriguing: in the ice of the Arctic Circle, in a meteorite traces of fossil life are found, proof that we are not alone in the universe. Unfortunately, the scientific discovery falls in a delicate moment, the presidential election campaign, the interests at stake are great and unscrupulous characters seem ready to do everything to influence the events. This is why the President involves independent civilian scientists and Rachel Sexton, an intelligence analyst, to validate the discovery.Once I finished the book, I was rather in doubt about the feelings it left me, some positive and other negative.As in other novels of this writer, there is always a mystery and two characters, a man and a woman, who join their respective knowledge and skills to solve it. The thriller is well built, is based on topics that hit the public: government secret organizations, national security, corruption in political circles and in the end, the NASA, an institution that over the years has won the hearts of all the Americans and not only them.I like the style, Dan Brown skillfully builds the scenarios where the action takes place, between Washington and the Arctic, passing from sudden scientific discoveries to daring pursuits with shootings by mysterious men. Unfortunately, there are many and short chapters (about 134) and since the action moves on different characters or groups of characters, often you remain pending for at least a couple of chapters before resuming, with the risk of losing the effect or read others superficially (as happened to me).Then, the many scientific explanations often appear at points where they break the pace, with the results described above. An example: the protagonist is summoned in chapter 10, but the reader discovers what is involved only in chapter 22. In the end, the sense of waiting is excessive: we pass through dialogues, flashbacks, characters whose sole purpose is to guide and that postpone the explanations to others and so on.In short, I can’t say that it is the best book I have read, but it is well constructed, great for keeping the reader glued to the pages, with a ‘clean end’, which doesn’t dislike anyone, (view spoiler)[it doesn't dig up dirt on two sacred figures like the President and the NASA, which in the end are unrelated to the fraud  (hide spoiler)].

Full brief review will be written later :)17:50, 5/8/2011 SOOOOOOOO Here is my full review :) ENJOY!! “Everybody lies” is a phrase that keeps being repeated over and over again in every episode of the famous American TV series House. Most people believe in the truth of this phrase, however I am not one of them; or at least I am not, except when I am reading any of Dan Brown’s novels. So far I have read all his novels except for “The Lost Symbol;” hence, I could say that I am considerably aware of his style of writing and the general framework of his novels. But still I have to admit that every time I was taken aback when the moment of truth came in any of his novels. Personally, the concept of truth in any of Brown’s novel exceed the general meaning of “not lying,” it goes on to represent the opposite of illusion, namely it is more attached to the concept of reality; it is concerned with such question as: is what you are seeing, experiencing, being told is indeed the truth or are you being played by like a toy in a marionette show? So although all Brown’s novels kind of agree on the same framework and style of storytelling, each one of them is an enjoyment in itself and a masterpiece in one, or several, particular field of knowledge. Talking about “Deception Point,” I have to admit that although it is represented as a novel, a thrilling, amazing, rich and interesting one to be fair, it is also a brief textbook about the ocean world, the meteorites, the space battle, NASA, new weapons, the political battle during presidential elections in the USA, the human psychology, etc… quite a lot of stuff if you asked me, and that is what I like the most about Brown. He is not only a novelist but a transmitter of knowledge, enjoyment and an enhancer for open-mindedness and for thinking outside the box. The two main lessons that I learnt from this novel are simple but deep. First, never blindly trust what you are told regardless how much you trust the person you tells you, but always question and seek the truth of things by yourself. Second, don’t rush about judging people, especially those with high responsibility in the community, because around everyone of them there are a bunch of hidden players who work on arranging the game as they like, but if the people responsible are indeed up to their responsibility, they will eventually overcome the hidden players and be worth of the respect and the duty that people attach to them.",8,0.9901,0.032,0.831,0.137,0.4842771379563831,POSITIVE,0.9999

First, it was 736 pages long and I really hate to start big reads and give up on them. I feel like I would disappoint myself. Second, it had a mix of reviews and quite a few of them gave it one star and flagged it as boring and cliche as hell (some even said Brown's characters are all the same which makes it quite boring). And third, Brown's stories never really appealed to me so this was one of those random finds that I was debating on whether to chuck it in trash or give it a go. I gave it a go and found it quite interesting. From all the technologies and small facts (not sure if they are 100% true but they seem plausible) about our government and NASA, it kept up my attention. The characters were a bit on the stale side but I forced myself not to mind it too much ( a lot of the times dull characters are one of the biggest reasons I give up on books). I felt a bit disappointed by the big finish at the end concerning the _______ since I thought it will be a historic find but whatever. The whole political side was at times boring but I was hoping Brown will end it just as I hoped he will and for the most part, he did. Nothing much more for me to say except that these 700+ pages went by pretty fast as a lot of the chapters were few pages long. I probably won't read anything else by Brown for now but I will give Dan Simmons a try.

And if I wanted a profound book I would have read Dostoevsky instead. I knew what I would get and got it.(Note: I got the book from a sale for 25 rupees viz equal to 30 US cents!!

53,3784266911,07/24/2021,4.0," A bold deception that threatens to plunge the world into controversy.  “Sooner or later we've all got to let go of our past.” Deception Point is a stand-alone book by Dan Brown published in 2001. This novel was vastly different from the Robert Langdon series and Digital Fortress in many ways. In the previous books, the main character goes around with another person to find an answer. However, this book was a thrilling and fast-paced science-fiction story that was enjoyable and full of suspense. The plot is pretty simple and logical. A world-changing discovery has been made by NASA, and that provides a much-needed victory for the President in the elections. However, he doesn’t even have an idea that he is being deceived. Rachael Sexton, daughter of Senator Sexton who is running for President, is called to investigate that discovery. She too doesn’t know that she is being deceived. The Delta team, who had killed a person in the prologue, somehow has a connection to the mastermind plot their leader is building. All these events are somehow related to the Elections, and that’s what makes the plot more interesting.Even though the plot and the storyline were awesome, there were just some parts that made me keep the book down. For one thing, the cliffhangers at the end of the chapters were really boring and never seemed like cliffhangers. If there is one thing that I really like about Dan Brown’s books, it’s the cliffhanger in every chapter that just keep me interested. This book lacked many cliffhangers, which made me lose interest. Also, the start was pretty boring. I wasn’t even intrigued by the chapters. It was only from the revelation of the mysterious scientific discovery that made me gain interest. If the discovery wasn’t as good enough I knew I would’ve really hated the book.But I can say that this was a nice book by Dan Brown. My rating - 4 stars. But it was actually above my expectations. A thrilling, scientific, and nicely plotted book - I recommend it to all. ",5,0.9081,0.093,0.782,0.126,0.575373482726424,NEGATIVE,0.9754

""Sooner or later we've all got to let go of our past.""
 I am a fan of Dan Brown. I am not gonna say that all his books are 5 stars books, because they are not. I am not gonna say that the plots of his stories are all really original and different from each others, because they are not. They all obey to a formula that does not really change from one book to another. But Brown does know how to write a book, give it a really good pace and make it an enjoyable reading.  Most of the times, at least. This one failed to impress me. Which is a shame because it had a lot of potential. The plot was interesting, the political intrigue contributing to make it even better ( I am a sucker for political intrigue). And of course, the fact that the background is such an untypical place made me even more curious to read it. I mean, name more than 2 books whose background is the Arctic. I bet you can't! (but I would be happy if you did, I would love to read them) But the pace is so, so slow, for God's sake! Even now I still can't believe I could read the first part of the book without falling asleep. And that brings a second problem that makes the book even difficult to read. A slow pace makes it hard for me to connect with the characters. I simply can't be trying to do not fall asleep and at the same time connect with the characters. It just doesn't work for me! Of course it ends up speeding up just like happens with most of the books that have a slow start. And it even speeds up soon enough for me to still be able to enjoy most of the story. But enjoying most of the story is just not the same thing as enjoying the whole story. There's a part of it that you will always miss. I must say that after speeding up, this story is Dan Brown at his best, though. An action-packed plot, an unpredictable plot twist (even if expected, because of the formula), and a story interesting enough to keep you hooked and entertained for a while. And that makes me even sadder. Because it could have been that good since the beginning; Brown already proved to me many times that he does know how to catch the reader's attention since page one. And yet it simply doesn't happen with this book. The very book that thanks to the political intrigue would have probably become my favourite Dan Brown's book if only it was like the others. Overall, this book is not Brown's best one. If you have never read one of his books, do not start with this one. If you still have more books written by him that you haven't read yet, read them first. You won't miss this book if you don't read it. But if you choose to start it and find it in yourself to keep reading the first part despite its dullness, then you are definitely in for a really amusing story, action-packed and interesting.

No matter how hard you try not to think about it you know it nonetheless right from the beginning of the story. But even this PATTERN didn’t make the story any less interesting! It was just FANTASTIC and if not for the spoiler in the synopsis the first half will just take you to another level and you will enjoy it through and through!

While the book may not appeal to a certain section of the masses, there would be an audience to whom it would come across as nothing short of a classic. As far as I'm concerned, it falls somewhere right in between.The storyline is ambitious and good! The characters and the climax give you the feel like they're straight out of a major Hollywood biggie (with definite and predictable clichés).The book has mounds of facts and information to offer. At times, you MAY (or may not) feel that science, with all its might, is brushing right past your brain. The well researched and incredibly nuanced scientific data is in abundance and ceases to halt till the plot reaches its grand finale, which in turn, could pile up to be a whole lot of thing to retain for the reader.Having said that, barring a plot twist or two, the storyline did not really deceive or ""thrill"" me. A lot though would depend on how you define the two words personally. With all its science, and politics, and drama, Deception Point might just be something you'd like to go through (at least once) purely for its distinctiveness...!",4,0.9437,0.035,0.844,0.122,0.4909297052154195,NEGATIVE,0.986

The Plot
When NASA discovered a new rare object which was buried under the Arctic ice. This discovery was a victory for the white house and the NASA also. because this victory has profound implications for U.S and the presidential elections. So The president dispatches his intelligent analyst Rachel Sexton to the Milne Ice Shelf to verify the accuracy of this find. When Rachel Arrived that place, she met a group of experts including Michael Toland. Rachel and Michael uncovered a huge mistake, a trick which was made by scientists. When Rachel and Michael tried to contact the president to tell him about this trick, a deadly team of assassins stopped them. Rachel and Michael ran with their lives but The assassins still following them. So how could they survive and show this deception to the world?? 
My Opinion:
I don't know where to begin!! This Book was a piece of art!! After reading Angels & Demons last year, this year, I decided to pick another Dan Brown's book and this choice didn't disappoint me at all.I don't know how to describe it. Everything in this story was perfect, the plot, the facts, the humor, the characters, all these things were amazing. Starting with the plot. Aghhh is about NASA and presidential elections, okay I'm definitely in it!!The events were narrated in an amazing way which made them so real, so vivid, they were sequent, each event enchained the next one. and that makes you want to read more!!!Oh, and what I love the most in Dan Brown's books is the facts written in them. I love learning something new, and this book has pieces of information about NASA, The Delta Force, and even National Reconnaissance Office. I devoured each information written in this book. Without forgetting the plot twists, There were a lot of them which made me always shocked, this book made me laugh, get frustrated, and shocked. it played with my heart so well.And the characters, Huh what can I say!! they were all scientists, educated and most of that funny. I don't why all the scientists have humor. I bet this is in their blood.Overall, I enjoyed eating this book, I loved it, which made this story in my top ten readings.

71,2551072909,10/12/2018,5.0,"Yes, I'm rating it a 5.
“Skepticism has become a virtue. Cynicism and demand for proof has become enlightened thought. Is it any wonder that humans now feel more depressed and defeated than they have at any point in human history?”
To me the rating system is really not about being a critic but about how much I personally enjoyed something. I believe and rate books just like any other ordinary book lover. And as a book lover, I seldom come across something that I do not like. Honestly, most of the times I come across things that I absolutely love. This being one of those abundant times. I also believe that this feeling, to love almost anything, is a really awesome blessing. I love this feeling and pray long may it continue, especially in today's socio-critical times.
Besides, nobody has the right to tell you what you can and cannot love.
And yes, I absolutely know that this is a formula book:Take attractive, strong, honest lead characters + add conspiracy theories and grand scale cons + also add big, powerful, invulnerable antagonists + mix with almost impossible and impregnable odds = a new best-selling Dan Brown novel.I also know that this book is an unputdownable page turner. Everyone who criticizes Brown would agree to this, his books do not let go once they have a hold on you. You feel compelled to read further, to know what happens on the next page. I cannot imagine that after reading such a book anyone can honestly say at the end, sounding like a critic, that, ""Oh, this was not that good"". At least I cannot. If a book captures me and makes me feel like a part of the story, I honestly believe I am being dishonest if I say otherwise just to slate a book because that is convention, to say I did not like it.That's what is what strikes me as odd about Brown critics. But hey, anyone and everyone has a right to form their own opinion. Again the only thing being that people should rate not as if they are critics, but as book lovers. After all,
“Sometimes all it takes is a tiny shift of perspective to see something familiar in a totally new light.”
Deception Point is an intelligent thriller. It requires a somewhat intelligent and versed audience. I've always been fascinated by the research Brown does on his books. So much hard work, so many hours would go into building his work, I find it really amazing. Like Brown's others, Deception Point pulls and pulls and pulls till it has your imagination tightly in its grasp and you then turn page after page caught in the mystery.I loved this book, and I hope anyone reading this does into this having an open mind to enjoy it will a full heart.",4,0.9989,0.089,0.64,0.271,0.6248281130634069,POSITIVE,0.9984
72,513582687,01/21/2013,1.0,"Before I read this book I didn't used to understand why people hate Dan Brown so much? Why they call him the most over rated writer? After reading this book I have the answer.Dan just doesn't want to keep it straight forward and simple. He wants to go extreme with everything. The plot is extreme - A NASA discovery about a meteorite suggesting extraterrestrial life.The characters are extreme - The Senator who is a candidate for Presidency and his daughter Rachel Sexton, Michael Tolland – an oceanographer and television celebrity-scientist, Corky Marlinson – A world renowned astrophysist, William Pickering – Director of the NRO, Lawrence Erkstorm- Administrator of NASA, Marjorie Tench- Senior Adviser to the President etc... and most importantly The President himself is a important part of the story.The science is extreme. Dan Brown introduces you with equipments, tools, vehicles, planes, ships you have never even heard of.And this extremeness goes on and on in everything he writes in the book.The thing I hated the most in the book was the science. I can take the plot into consideration once, the characters could be taken into consideration as well but speaking honestly I didn't understood a single science in this book and I am pretty sure that anybody who is not a part of NASA won't be able to understand this. I even doubt that some science he has mentioned in the book even exists, that might also be a fiction along with the story. Wherever there was science mentioned I just went through the parts of the book without getting anything into my head.I don't know what to write, I just hated this book. I have not liked any of the two Dan Brown book's ever since I read Digital Fortress. And this book surely has to bring an end to my Dan Brown reading. I loath myself for having buying this book.All I would suggest to Dan is just keep it simple.

Rachel Sexton, a data analyst/gister for the National Reconnaissance Office, is asked by the President of the United States to go on a rather unusual (and very secret) mission. She finds this odd, as her estranged father is currently running against the current President. This mission takes her to Antarctica, where she is asked to evaluate the veracity of a meteorite that contains fossils. Other experts, including the dashing oceanographer Michael Tolland (who oh-so-conveniently is recently widowed) are onsite as well, providing their input. However, as confusing evidence starts coming to light, people associated with the project start disappearing. Who has something to hide, and how far are they willing to go to save it? This book reads like a combination of Michael Crichton & Tom Clancy; whether that's a good thing or not depends on your tastes. It starts out a bit slow, but the action is soon non-stop, with the intrigue, heavy-handed foreshadowing and hairs'-breadth escapes from certain death fitting the stereotypical thriller mold. There's a couple of interesting notions in the book; but nothing nearly as intellectual-appearing as the DVC. I'd classify it as a beach read - the equivalent of summer blockbuster movies. IMHO, it was written with an eye to becoming a Major Motion Picture; so if you go in expecting to roll your eyes occasionally at the coincidences, and are willing to expend some literary adrenaline, you'll probably be mildly entertained.",4,0.9454,0.036,0.855,0.109,0.5261224489795918,NEGATIVE,0.9944

The premise is good but the execution is poor.(view spoiler)[On the Milne Ice Shelf in the far north, a meteorite has been discovered under the ice that contains fossils of large bugs; proof of life on other planets. NASA is there, along with four civilian scientists to verify that the meteorite and its fossils are authentic. Rachel Sexton, a highly-competent, intelligence analyst with the National Reconnaissance Office, is sent there by the President of the United States to also confirm what has been found. Rachel is the daughter of Presidential candidate Senator Sedgewick Sexton, who is running against the current President and is ahead in the polls.The President goes live with a press conference to announce to the world NASA's discovery of proof of extra-terrestrial life. Rachel, after first verifying that the meteorite is real, begins to see some strange contradictions, and along with Michael Tolland, an oceanographer, and some others, embarks on a terrifying quest to find out the truth behind the meteorite. Along the way, they are attacked by assassins and barely escape with their lives from some terrifying situations. Meanwhile, the race for the presidential election hangs in the balance, as a NASA victory will cement the current President's place in the White House, but evidence of a NASA conspiracy will ensure that Sexton wins the election. The book climaxes with Rachel and Michael finding all the evidence they need to prove that the meteorite is fake, while simultaneously escaping from a team of deadly assassins, and the mastermind of the conspiracy, William Pickering, Rachel's boss and the director of her intelligence agency. The White House tells the world that the meteorite was planted; Sexton is betrayed by his closest adviser, disgraced by a sex scandal, and threatened with blackmail regarding illegal campaign practices. Michael and Rachel get together in the end, and the media speculates that the current President will keep his office for another term.  (hide spoiler)]the climax is stretched.

You read them for the sugar content and comparison. Then, when you start something by, lets say, Cormac McCarthy, you remember ‘Deception Point’ and congratulate yourself ‘ah—the English language will survive and your brain just may not have turned to pudding.’But here’s the caveat: before it was popular to hate Dan Brown and that whole DaVinci pile of crap—he wrote a couple good books (three to be exact). If you took ‘Deception Point’ and put James Rollings name on it you would probably go ‘oh, this is pretty good.’ There’s the rub.I am a sucker for anything buried. From pyramids, ancient scrolls, alien spaceships, to big mysterious chunks of rock. (Jack McDevitt comes up with lots of buried items in his books—that’s just an aside). You’ve found Atlantis? I’m there. So anyway, in ‘Deception’ NASA has pinpointed a meteor containing proof life exists beyond our neighborhood. The author throws in a lovely female protagonist (woo-hoo) and a hunky male protagonist (of course), a villain (hiss) and a government embroiled in deception and cover up (what? you’re kidding?).Some of the ideas are actually interesting. The strength of a thriller for me is the ‘descriptive aject-action-tive.’ If a writer can sustain a series of thrilling (albeit preposterous) sequences for more than a few pages then I am ready for the ride. Dan Brown can do it—and quite well. If DaVinci hadn’t come along Brown would be producing a nice shelf of thrillers. There are a few sequences that have a high ‘wow’ factor. The plot is a little ponderous—but no more so than a typical Cussler. There’s some descriptive imagery (particularly in the Arctic) that stick in your brain for a while.

""Deception Point"" is EXACTLY the same book as all of his others, for better or worse. I had to try and be fair to this book. I want to judge a book based on what it is going for and against other books in the particular genre. After all, ""Deception Point"" came before ""The DaVinci Code"", ""The Lost Symbol"", and ""Inferno"". If anything, I should be made at those books for copying this one. Plus, this one didn't include all the hero worship of Professor Langdon which has gotten pretty ridiculous in the last several outings. Although, the protagonists in it were worshipped aplenty.I don't regrudge Dan Brown for writing using this formula over and over. It has obviously worked well for him and he's good at it. But Dan please, please, please, for me...next time just write a book that takes place in more than 24 hours. You can do it! That small change would be so interesting to see from him. So Joe, when are you going to actually talk about ""Deception Point""? Okay, okay, stop being pushy. A meteorite is found at the North Pole with something very interesting inside.

It was a great story - albeit predictable, but most thrillers are – but that’s all it was: a great story with some pretty mediocre writing.I don’t like to be told every single little detail about a character, I like to find out by their interactions with others or their actions in certain situations. His character introductions were abysmal. For example, “[her hair was:] long enough to be sexy, but short enough to remind you she was probably smarter than you.” Really, Dan? Too many chapters ended with some variation of “Little did he know that things were about to get a lot worse.” I don’t like this kind of foreshadowing, I actually find it to be foreshadowing for the lazy. It honestly makes me laugh.I always find that authors who write thrillers all have a very similar writing style: simple. Short simple sentences seem to be prominent, and any attempt at a compound complex sentence is clumsy and usually ends up as a fragment. Robert Ludlum is the same. Good stories, not so good writing.I did like this book and his Robert Langdon books, don’t get me wrong.

I go into the similarities between the Robert Langdon books here, but this book, although starring a completely different protagonist with a different plot, read basically the same.

Oh, and their crippling phobias- their single downfall, might I add- are due to an accident as a child. How creative. Eye roll.The plot relies too heavily on coincidence instead of actions, and it's predictable as a fucking calender.Also, small gripe, but he kills off all the interesting characters.

But when I discovered who the author is, it made me instantly hesitate because Dan Brown, author of ""Inferno"" and ""The Davinci Code"", both of which I had read and equally loved, does NOT bring to mind sci-fi/horror at all! It took a while for my mind to wrap around that fact. So I mentally prepared myself going into the book and sure enough, Dan Brown did not disappoint. Although it did give me a little of a sci-fi mystery, Dan's enigmatic touch for the action/thriller shined through and my earlier hesitations were forgotten. I love this author's writing and the effortlessness as to how he wields the power to pull his reader's into the story and just when you think that everything and everyone is obvious, Dan flips you around and around until you don't know what is going on anymore and the ending will leave you shocked, rocking your world and making you suspect EVERYONE!

I would literally expect a better story and better writing from a 12 year old child - at least they would keep it brief; this 150,000 word behemoth takes ideas that could hypothetically be interesting due to their sheer preposterousness and somehow manages to make it the most boring book I've ever read. Although it's far from the only issue, Brown should stay far far far far far far far away from politics in his books - this book makes The Phantom Menace look as sophisticated as freaking West Wing. This is a Dan Brown ""thriller"" that literally takes 150 pages before it even gets to the mcguffin! Wtf is that!! At least Digital Fortress, Brown's 1st book and only other book outside the Langdon series, got straight to the point and was fast paced.Unfortunately the only charm of Digital Fortress - some of the most unintentionally hilarious lines ever printed (including beauties like ""Jabba resembled a giant tadpole. Like the cinematic creature for whom he was nicknamed, the man was a hairless spheroid"") - are disappointingly lacking in this one. Replacing those lines are dozens and dozens of similes that make zero sense - but not in an ironically hilarious way, just in a way that if your 8 year old came up with them you'd be disappointed in them and seriously concerned with their mental development. Present in both books are the same bizarre literary crutches, like having characters ""chuckle"" literally hundreds of times. LITERALLY though. Oh and don't worry, the same idolized casual sexual harassment and creepy male gaze/male power fantasy is here.Ya know, one of the worst problems with Brown's writing is that it expects the reader to be 20 iq. At no point does it ever allow the reader to even think. Here's a quote that illustrates this point...""You at all worried about finding your way back?"" Tolland yelled. ""The habisphere is almost invis--"" his words were cut short by the loud hiss of a flare igniting in Norah's hand. The sudden red-whtie glow illuminated the ice shelf in a ten-yard radius all around them. Norah used her heel to dig a small impression in the surface snow, piling up a protective ridge on the upwind side of the hole. Then she rammed the flare into the indentation. ""High-tech bread crumbs,"" Norah shouted. ""Bread crumbs?"" Rachel asked, shielding her eyes from the sudden light. ""Hansel and Gretel,"" Norah shouted.That is just insulting. Ladies and gentlemen, if you read this passage and find this acceptable, then I guess Dan Brown's for you. If your iq is higher than 20 though, stay far far away.One more note, I've never taken too seriously the criticisms for books following a ""formula"", but that's when it comes to general plot. This book literally follows Digital Fortress beat for freaking beat scene after scene. That's just plain unacceptable.I hated Digital Fortress, but this book is even worse somehow.

132,224454401,10/17/2011,3.0,"I'm actually giving this book three and a half stars.I went into it pretty skeptical. There are two things I could say about Dan Brown, based on his other books: 1, he can come up with amazingly interesting, page-turner plots and 2, somewhere along the way he manages to lose you in the writing. The Davinci Code certainly had its ""Ummm... WHERE was that set up?!"" moments. Angels and Demons and Digital Fortress almost sounded like the same book to me, right down to the long-lost family members. So, skeptical. Nevertheless, this book was used and cheap, and I was curious. Not to mention, I needed a good Bad Novel to immerse myself in to forget about the world for a while.I was pleasantly surprised. It is certainly a page-turner, with cliffhanger chapter endings of the ""little did they know"" variety. Granted, some of the subsequent events were a disappointment after the cliffhanger, like when the heroine, Rachel Sexton, gets in a helicopter to go meet the president and, heading towards the White House, the chapter ends with, ""little did she know it would never reach the White House."" (loosely quoted) So, of course, the reader is left wondering what will happen. Are they shot out of the sky? Does she sense danger and jump out before they take off? WHAT? I don't want to reveal any spoilers, but the answer, though the plot still remains interesting, is kinda mundane, considering the setup.Still, it's a page-turner. Dan Brown has a knack for drawing us in. I sometimes thought I would NEVER find out what NASA had found in the ice. At other times, I wished I could crane my neck and look inside the book to the extraction hole. WHAT was everyone staring at in all these (thankfully short) chapters? WHAT was the water doing that it shouldn't have been? Obviously something important, if suddenly someone wants to kill whoever knows about it.Besides the main plot, there are many interesting sub-plots and I like the fact that the book is told from different angles, depending on which character is being talked about. There is Rachel's father, Senator Sexton, who is in the running in the presidential campaign, and running dirty. A despicable man who doesn't disappoint right up to the end. There is the president himself Zachary Herney, who prides himself on honesty, and his senior advisor Marjorie Tench, who is very disagreeable but is very efficient at getting whatever job is at hand done. There is a covert op unit of three men, Deltas One, Two and Three, respectively, along with their boss, the controller. I have to admit, I had the controller figured out pretty nicely and was waiting smugly for the person to be revealed - only to find out I was wrong! Well done, Brown!I must say I liked the writing as a whole. I like the joking among the scientists and the way Corky talks about Dr. Mangor because of her less-than-charming personality. (When Ming mentions that she once got lost in a snowstorm and survived on seal blubber for over a month, Corky slyly comments that it was that long because ""I heard no one was looking"" (for her)). The inevitable scientific explanations were thankfully short instead of drawn out, and the at first seemingly amazing plot begins to sound possible and believable. I also love how Brown injects more humor by letting the reader know what people are thinking in using italics in dialogue.*spoiler alert, despite my best intentions*My only gripe is near the end when the underwater volcano erupts, creating a geyser of steam that shoots up out of the sea, which in turn created a void that water rushes into, pulling everything down with it. Of course Rachel's hero Michael Tolland is in the water at this point, but swims toward the surface and excapes. (Not much mention was made of the poisonous gasses that must have also escaped the volcano.) But that's my only gripe. Really. I don't even mind the submarine picking up the THUMP...THUMP...THUMP, but that miraculous escape was worthy of Jack and Rose's miraculous swim to the surface in the Titanic movie, and in my opinion totally unbelievable. (Okay there is also the part where Rachel actually makes it out of the sinking sub, despite the power of all the water rushing in which really should have her trapped. But that's it.) Other than that, I like the book. Read it if you're a Dan Brown skeptic.",2,0.9966,0.066,0.782,0.152,0.4969994719994721,NEGATIVE,0.9998

135,201163045,08/22/2011,4.0,"My four stars may have something to do with the fact that I am moving from Texas. And as such, I am leaving behind family. I'm an emotional wreck...feeling sort of gutted, actually. And so I say thank you Dan Brown. Thank you for writing an entirely unbelievable but completely entertaining piece of stock thriller fiction. I'm glad I can count on you to come through with such an engrossing distraction. I might have to go out and find myself a copy of Digital Fortress now. Because I might still be in need of more distractions.The basics? Rachel Sexton is a really smart intel expert working for the NRO. Her father is the hot shot senator du jour, Sedgewick Sexton, a man who is all set to take the White House from the current president, Zach Herney. And then NASA, standing on the brink of totally catastrophe, makes an incredible discovery. Senator Sexton's outspoken criticism of the agency may now jeopardize his run for the White House and catapult President Herney back into the White House for another four years. But when Rachel makes a shocking discovery and her life is put in danger, Senator Sexton's play for the White House might be saved.So let us be entirely honest and call a spade a spade. This book is pure nonsense. It goes beyond the bounds of all plausibility. But Brown uses real technology and scientific discovery to advance the plot. Certainly his use of said technology and discoveries stretch my limits of suspending disbelief, but that is what makes Brown's books so fun. He takes something real and pushes the limits of what could happen...if. That is the first thing I like about the book. It's obvious that Brown spends time doing his research. So even if the antics are far fetched, at least he uses real and interesting developments in science.Second, it's fast...really fast. Everything happens in a matter of about thirty-six hours. Again, really far fetched, but it moves the story along. There is no time for a lull in the plot when everything comes together so quickly. Brown is the master of cramming the action into short windows. It sort of leaves you feeling exhausted when you come to the climax. I like that.What's more, he stays focused on the conflict and doesn't weigh down the plot with needless sexual exploits. It's suggested, of course. And Senator Sexton is, well, let's just say he's the typical prototype of the power hungry politician, so of course there is that scandal. But it fits in with modern politics and, more importantly, the plot of the story. And there is no graphic depiction, in any case. Again, it's something I appreciate because personally I want the story to focus on the development of the conflict, and in this case, it does. And I have to admit, I was surprised at the end. I thought Brown was leading me down one road, but I ended up somewhere else entirely. Now I suppose that there may have been some sort of clues that would suggest the ending I got, but I didn't see them coming. I was so caught up in the action that I didn't really pay attention. That's the mark of a good thriller, and I thought Brown did a great job disguising any trace of who does what. Like I said, it is stock...entirely and completely unbelievable. But it is pure escapism. And for that reason alone, I highly recommend. ",2,0.9863,0.081,0.777,0.142,0.5170621693121693,POSITIVE,0.675
136,549482313,03/01/2013,2.0,"This is a prime example of why I’m not a fan of Dan Brown. He uses a singular literary technique to keep the reader interested. One that will change the face of book publishing! And it will never be the same! FOREVER!The characters in this novel are a prime example of this. The reader is given either too little information about the character or too much background noise to make their actions seem ‘plausible’. Pasts are created out of the necessity for plot advancement which is adequate at the best of times, and unbelievable at the worst. But this only touches lightly on the bigger issue: That of the most important part of the book! One which changes EVERYTHING! !The author sets it everything up to be changed. He points you in one direction and gets you thinking in one way only to be tricked. As a joke you’d play on a younger sibling so you can laugh and say “Made you look!” So instead of twists and turns, you get tricked and fooled. Things are never as they appear and WILL NEVER BE THE SAME!!! This would have been cute and interesting if it appeared in one of his books. But it’s becoming a M. Night Shyamalan formula when you expect it. This is my second Brown novel, and more enjoyable of the two. But it followed the same formula. When you expect the change…FOREVER!...it loses all impact. The reader rolls their eyes and says “Yeah, ok, so that’s what it was. That would have been great to know 500 pages ago.”It’s all bait and switch; smoke and mirrors. This would be an added bonus if it didn’t get in the way of the plot, characterization, and atmosphere. It seems these quintessential parts of the novel take the back seat for the bait and switch technique. Characters are flat, the plot becomes uninteresting, and everything falls apart to become a big ‘catch the bad-guy’ chase scene. Taking my personal opinion of Mr. Brown aside, the three main point of this book only has one going for it. The narrative was very easy to get through. The bait and switch technique does serve to keep the reader going. In this face, I couldn’t put the book down against my better judgement. But the other two points: Plot and Characterization fell so far off the table that I won’t look back fondly on this novel. In sum: This book is akin to a juicy fruit stick of gum. For the first five seconds it’s fun, light, and very easy to chew through. But the flavour disappears too quickly after that, and you are left with a flavourless wad which is very hard to chew. I’d recommend this book to those who would rather watch a movie than read a book. That seems to be Brown’s target audience. The only problem is: The audience are watching movies and not reading books.",2,0.9938,0.039,0.827,0.134,0.4871031746031745,NEGATIVE,0.9998

A conspiracy of staggering brilliance. A thriller unlike any you’ve ever read…. When a NASA satellite discovers an astonishingly rare object buried deep in the Arctic ice, the floundering space agency proclaims a much-needed victory — a victory with profound implications for NASA policy and the impending presidential election. To verify the authenticity of the find, the White House calls upon the skills of intelligence analyst Rachel Sexton. Accompanied by a team of experts, including the charismatic scholar Michael Tolland, Rachel travels to the Arctic and uncovers the unthinkable: evidence of scientific trickery — a bold deception that threatens to plunge the world into controversy. But before she can warn the president, Rachel and Michael are ambushed by a team of assassins. Fleeing for their lives across a desolate and lethal landscape, their only hope for survival is to discover who is behind this masterful plot. The truth, they will learn, is the most shocking deception of all. My thoughts: Before his famous Angels & Demons and The Da Vinci Code, Dan Brown had a number of other novels including Digital Fortress and this one, Deception Point. In a couple of words, this book was – AMAZING! FABULOUS! FANTASTIC! My book club chose this book for our May meeting and to be honest I was immediately a bit overwhelmed simply by the sheer size of this novel, it’s over 700 pages. I soon found out, it was 700 pages of pure excitement, a thrill ride from beginning to the very end. This book is a must read in my opinion for anyone looking for an exciting ride including political scandal, scientific discoveries, lies, cheating. Page-turner doesn’t even cover this book . . .

139,977144583,01/05/2017,4.0,"Thriller is one of my absolute favorite genres. There is something mind blowing about reading a good, well researched thriller and for me, Dan Brown is always on the forefront. I've read three of his Robert Langdon books and I've ended up being awestruck on each occasion.The plot of this particular book is extremely well executed. It is a sensible mixture of science and technology and casts an honest light on human psychology. It shows the limits to which a person can go to save something in which he/she believes vehemently in and an analysis of the level of deceit portrayed in this book is quite scary. Like all other books of Dan Brown, this book too shows the story unraveling in a parallel method : different incidents happening at the same time in different places. It has an extremely fast paced storyline leaving your mind reeling at the most unseeming places, gripping you from the very first page and making it difficult to put the book down.In terms of characters, all of them are all multi-layered. Rachel Sexton has turned out to be my least favorite out of all the Dan Brown books that I've read. She is the protagonist but unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be so. She is helpless in most cases and there are only a handful of situations in which she acts as the lead that she, in fact, is. She wouldn't have been able to do anything if it weren't for Michael Tolland and Corky Marlinson. They are the real brains. It is all the non-protagonists who actually take all the thunder in this story. I'd say Deception Point was a fulfilling read. I went into it expecting a page turner and that's what I got. I'm always in awe of the amount of research that Dan Brown does for a novel and this one also falls into the category. For me, his Robert Langdon novels have set the bar really high and this one falls just a little short of reaching that level. I'd strongly recommend picking up any of his books if you are looking for a mind blowing thriller (preferably, The Da Vinci Code).",2,0.527,0.046,0.877,0.077,0.6053225806451613,POSITIVE,1.0
140,1053912778,09/13/2014,4.0,"Although I find Dan Brown’s books, and the films of the books, quite formulaic I always wind up reading them because the first few pages grip my attention and the plot is cleverly intriguing. I do think that the books are much better than the films – but that’s a different conversation. His ability to combine science, history, myth and politics into a fast-moving dramatic tale that has twists and turns, and cunning chicanery leaves the reader breathless right up to the last chapter. Unfortunately, the pages of the last chapter often include an inevitable piece of corny romance like the script of a Hollywood film, and this is the case with Deception Point. There are two main protagonists in the book, Rachel and Danielle, each fighting their corner in very different parts of the globe: Rachel in the frozen wastes of the Arctic and Danielle in Washington. Dan Brown skilfully allows them to emerge into the centre of their unchosen arena and I wound up rooting for them both. There is a male character, Michael, who is equally good-looking, professional and intelligent but who seemed to me to be less central to the plot – until the chips were down! And when the baddies get their just desserts what a way to serve them up! No spoilers here but Wow! and Yuk! seem to reflect the justification I felt.Despite the general disapproval, I often see in reviews, about too much technical information – info-dumping? – in his books I have to say that I enjoy it.

141,559929517,03/13/2013,4.0,"Ah Dan Brown... here's the thing I've realized after being on GoodReads for some years now. Don't trust the number ratings. There are many ratings on here that are low for a number of reasons. My view on Brown? People are still pissed about the Da Vinci Code. 99% of people I know loved that book. So that means it's more controversial and more people will read your reviews if you hate it. There's also a bunch of pissed off zealots who will rate down any book of his. Now, that doesn't mean people didn't honestly hate it (or Deception Point) - I just think here on Goodreads, it causes a ruccus, and people get attention for bad reviews with all their little pictures and quotes. I ain't got time for that. With that said, I picked this one up and loved it. Yes, it's intellectual - there's a lot of scientific terminology and some people lose interest, bogged down with the science. It also deals with a lot of government/politics, but THAT was the part I loved about this. Anyone who knows Washington knows this book was RIGHT. ON. Many many times I believe there are presidents with best intentions surrounded by barracudas (or the opposite), government agencies dancing to the ""Washington Two-Step"" and I felt Brown gave this great justice. I particularly enjoyed the setting, the different characters (though I could do without the love interest.. it felt unnecessary as most Brown books), and the many twists and turns. I've enjoyed many a Brown book and am anxious to read more in the future.",2,0.968,0.112,0.744,0.145,0.5615487861811391,POSITIVE,0.8652

This book is about a NASA satellite finding a 30decade year old meteorite buried in Arctic ice, which is essentially NASA's retaliation to Senator Sedgewick Sexton(a presidential candidate) criticizing their non-functional programs in his campaign. Then the story speeds up when senator Sexton send his daughter Rachael and a group of explorers/scientist to go and check out the newly discovered meteor.What Rachael, Micheal, Corcky, Norah, and Ming find is astonishing to say the least, just put it this way NASA does't always tell the truth(apparently) and the lives of Rachael and her friends are put on the line.....(for you to find out READ THE BOOK!)Its pretty simple, you cant always trust what you hear doesn't matter who tells you it. This book is definitely a ""good read"" and i would recommend it to people that like thriller books but CAUTION!

President Zachary Herney, the incumbent in a hotly contested presidential race, is a strong supporter of a publicly funded NASA, open to the scientific community at large. His opponent, Senator Sedgewick Sexton, has made overspending and mismanagement at NASA his campaign hot button issue and clearly favours privatization of space research. NASA's timely discovery of a meteorite buried deep within an arctic glacier that provides positive long sought for proof of the existence of extra-terrestrial life seems to be the needed success that will put a lock on their reputation with the US taxpayer and a stranglehold on Herney's successful re-election. But when Herney's hand-picked team of civilian experts and intelligence analysts begin to sniff out the possibility of scientific fraud, Dan Brown treats us to a magnificent display of high intensity action and fireworks; the best and the worst of Washington political posturing, cover ups and power plays; and a deadly team of Delta Force assassins assigned to ensure the fraud is kept under wraps.But, as exciting and as imaginative as it was, it wasn't actually the plot or the fast-paced action that put Deception Point into the category of one of the finest thrillers I've ever had the pleasure of reading.Unlike so many other thrillers, Dan Brown has not sacrificed characterization for plot. In fact, he has treated us to a marvelously broad cast of realistic, well-developed, human, credible characters that fairly leaped off the page - Marjorie Tench, a bone deep ugly spinster bitch with an incredible set of finely, honed killer political instincts; Michael Tolland, a charismatic scholar who like David Suzuki, David Attenborough or Jacques Cousteau, seemed to be able to translate real scientific knowledge unerringly into a well understood and widely appealing television format; Rachel Sexton, the daughter of the self-centered presidential hopeful senator, struggling to distance herself from politics and retain her credibility as a skilled intelligence analyst with the NRO; and Gabrielle Ashe, the starry-eyed aide who succumbed to Sexton's political reputation and got trapped in a career-killing sex scandal.The second feature that separated Deception Point from other lesser lights in the thriller genre was his exhilarating use of technology! In hindsight, Brown's one sentence author's note prefacing the story provided that little extra ""wow"" factor that left me awestruck -""All technologies described in this novel exist.""As I was reading the story, I flagged no less than a dozen examples of astonishing gadgetry that I was completely unaware of. One example to whet your appetite:"" ... new experimental `IM' weaponry - Improvised Munitions - snow rifles that compacted snow into ice pellets, desert rifles that melted sand into glass projectiles, water-based firearms that shot pulses of liquid water with such force that they could break bones.""What do you think?

Seeking the next thrill I decided to pick up one of his books this time. Deception Point was my choice seeing how interesting the summary sounded. The first half of the book is filled with irrelevant information and explains the journey of our protagonist to the artic pole where the majority of the story takes place. While reading this I regularly thought about whether there was any story to the book in the first place. Yes, it does go into great detail to talk about the personality of our main characters but I was left disappointed when making the obvious comparisons to the movie ( Yes, I know comparing a two hour long movie and a 600-page book is not the brightest choice ) which took off very quickly and I was at the edge of my seat from minute one. Talking about our main characters, the protagonist Rachel Sexton is a likable character sounding strong, clever, and relatable at the same time. The other characters are interesting, but they felt all too ( for the lack of a better term ) Hollywood-ish. This should've been my first red flag because the rest of the book feels exactly like that, of a Hollywood movie. With the initial plot setup and the introduction of our characters finished the story does pick up in the second half and I would have much rather started with this with only minor deviations to explain the characters rather than the sloth of a chapter the first ones were. The main plot of the book is great and it felt the same way I felt when watching the other series. The pace from then onwards was reasonable with several butt-clenching moments separated by time of peace for recuperation and plot. The ending of the book was satisfying but just like I stated in the beginning it felt a lot like a Hollywood action movie rather than a thriller book. I wish the book did not have to employ cheap plot twists for the sake of a story. This took away from the authenticity and the relatability I felt initially because the plot was indeed really interesting. The main protagonist which felt strong and clever at first by the end of the book had turned into a character from a horny 18-year old's fan fiction. The ending is a happily ever after kind of ending but I think it would have made it much more interesting and bold if it were not so because the repercussions of the mistakes the characters made in the story were huge if it were not for the luck the characters had for the sake of a plot. I would not recommend this book if you expect a good thriller.

I have always loved and feared ice bergs (thanks Titanic), so the location was most interesting for me. And when it became clear that the plot was moving away from the space and ice theme - which I thought was a pity for a while - it moved on to the deepest parts of the ocean, and I couldn't have been happier. Another place I like to read about, but would never ever visit if it was possible. So the book took the most thrilling and scary places for me and put them all together in one clever plot - priceless.My only problems with this book were unfortunately the same ones with Robert Langdom books. Firstly, Dan Brown likes to underline the villain. Like with coal and soot. Like so much, that it becomes very obvious the sorted-out villain is not the one we are looking for. The real villain is the one we think is our greatest friend and supporter and tragically killed somewhere in the book. Plot twist: he isn't. Secondly, the unneeded romances. The men who cannot stahp thinking about the beautiful ladies beside them when all is about to explode and the whole world as we now it is going to end. Sorry, that was Langdom books. But still.And the strong and witty female characters who cannot stop from falling for ""secure"" or ""calm"" or ""comforting"", absent-minded professor -kinda men (yes there is a discount Robert Langdom in this book). Women do not look for a feeling of security from men. Women do not look for a feeling of security from men. WOMEN DO NOT LOOK FOR FEELING OF SECURITY FROM MEN. The characters are great.

In short, it centres around a political standoff between the President of the United States and a Senator who’s gearing up to become the next President. Both of their campaigns involve NASA in some way: where the Senator believes NASA is wasting taxpayer money, the President is ready to tell the world about a new scientific discovery that will change everyone’s minds about the competency of NASA. Of course, something goes wrong with the discovery and a whole mess of scandals and secrets are uncovered in the process.Although I’m still not a huge fan of Dan Brown’s writing style, what he writes about is actually decent. For once he provided a plot I could easily follow, something that wasn’t convoluted or tenuous. I felt as though the protagonists were clearly marked out and the storyline was, for the most part, obvious. There were moments of obscurity in the plot, particularly in terms of the glaringly obvious science fiction scenes. Otherwise, it was a solid attempt at a science-fiction novel that seems to have worked well in Brown’s favour. It was strange to me to read a novel so heavily focused on science after reading so many religiously inclined novels from his repertoire.This is a short review, but there isn’t much to say about Deception Point other than that I enjoyed it a deal more than I expected to. It contained just the right amount of action and plot, even if the multiple plots were slightly disorienting at times. Perhaps one day Dan Brown will end a novel without having our two main characters strip off and sleep together. One day, but not just yet.",0,0.8492,0.053,0.862,0.085,0.4484766714766715,NEGATIVE,0.5235
175,1941536547,03/22/2017,5.0,"During the last 200 plus pages, I could barely put the book, Deception Point by Dan Brown, down! It was exciting, suspenseful and thrilling. I bet it caused my blood pressure to rise. After reading the first couple of pages, I realized I had probably read this book in 2006 or 2007 after I read Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons. I'm not sure. In any case, I forgot about it and the story, so it was like reading it for the first time. My memory said I loved the book when I read it the first time, but I think I got more out of it this time. I think I understand the technology better.So far, I've enjoyed reading all of Dan Brown's books. He writes like the stories can be real to readers like me who are not knowledgeable about the details in science and politics. I have a distrusting nature and am cynical in regards to huge organizations to which power means everything and ethics and morals mean very little.This story touches all the basics of an exciting political thriller. Original lies begin to unravel, and evil choices are made to cover them. The author did a good job leaving readers in suspense; who the actual bad guys are is not revealed until the near end.P.S. I read some of the reviews after I've written mine so that I'm not influenced. Sometimes my reviews match other reviewers and sometimes they don't. I stand by my review. Many reviewers wrote how Dan Brown uses a formula to write his stories. I suppose it's true, but after reading a few of his books, I know how he writes and I personally like his style. It doesn't matter to me whether each book has the same type of heroes and villains. Many authors have their style and the more they write in a particular genre, the more the books become similar; as in, they have their formula and it's successful for them. It is their signature. I love a lot of authors for the types of books they write. I couldn't read them back to back for any length of time before I tire of them. I've tried, but I still love the books and I know what I'm getting when I pick up their book to read. I enjoy the book, formula and all.After writing this, I will be reading another of Dan Brown's book shortly.",0,0.9889,0.076,0.77,0.154,0.5107098765432099,POSITIVE,0.9928

This book reads like a fancier version of a YouTube conspiracy video, and even if we ignores the holes in the conspiracy, there are still several problems with the book itself. (i) Plot tease. Like a politician, Dan Brown can spend a few paragraphs talk about one thing without revealing the actual points. It can work to build up expectation and suspense, but why do you need to spend time for a plot point that everybody already knows? Or it can easily backfire when after having built up for too long, it can no longer surprise readers (that's the problem when the main villain reveals).(ii) Even if a satellite is malfunctioning, the data it sends back can still be analyzed by local machines, and its coordinates & directions are meticulously recorded. There is no way such a claim of a discovery hidden meteorite can go without unnoticed or scrutenized internally. Or maybe the power brokers bought the whole data analysis team, all the people who program the trajectories, and the data archivists as well? Given that Brown spent so much time explaining other factors, missing this detail is really critical. (iii) Hollywood actions. After the major plot point have been resolved, it is quite tedious to follow the characters to clean up the consequences.

Maybe it's just me, but I think it was filled with a little too much technical, unwieldy description that I had little to no patience for. This could also be because I've been reading books with more rich, elegant and sophisticated literary devices than what I saw in this book so perhaps I may be being unfair. While the plot was definitely dense and hurtled along at a breakneck speed, I felt at some points it was a little too sensational and dramatic for the sake of being dramatic/sensational. It's not a bad book, but it's not that great either. I did like the tension, thrill and suspense, and it did make me stay up in bed to finish it, but I think that was a little more to do with frustration with how long winded the story could get rather than truly enjoying the book. I felt like this book was a little bit of a race for me to just get to the end and figure out what was going on. I definitely feel like many parts of it could have been shortened or simplified and it would have still retained its drama and tension, perhaps in a more interesting and intriguing way.

267,133232905,09/07/2020,2.0,"I read this for the first time around 2009 maybe? I decided to revisit Dan Brown because the amazing podcast 372 Pages We'll Never Get Back recently covered the abysmal Digital Fortress. I wanted to reread these now that I know exactly what the twists are so I can focus on the writing.Right off the bat, we meet Rachel Sexton, another unbelievably attractive female ""protagonist"" with very little agency who will stumble from one reveal to the next with her mouth agape and constantly find herself in need to rescue by the men around her. Her name is even Sexton, for fuck's sake.Her father, the even worse-named ""Senator Sedgewick Sexton"" (and acknowledging how ludicrous that name is in a parenthetical in the text is not clever, it only compounds that literary crime), is basically Trump. He is skin-crawlingly creepy and asks his daughter ""How's that guy at the State Department I set you up with?""In a conversation between two waiters we get the gem that makes it impossible to imagine these two characters as anything but Ivanka and Donald: ""Knowing Sexton, he'd probably screw her anyway.""Obviously real people are like this (Trump), but it's so unbelievably lazy and cliched to go to such lengths to set up this mustache-twirling politician who definitely needs to be #MeToo-ed. There is never any nuance added to his character later, he just continues to get worse (culminating with literally sacrificing his daughter's life for his career).The actual villain behind the whole conspiracy later at least gets a few more shades of grey added to him, but that character is such a minor character, in the grand scheme of things, whereas Sexton is present in almost every other ""chapter"" (I refuse to call these 2 page clips actual chapters). Again, it's lazy writing. The senator's story-line has absolutely no influence on the actual plot, you could delete his entire character and every action taken that is related to his existence, and the plot continues unaltered. It is an absolutely pointless B-Story that goes nowhere and is nothing but a weird revenge fantasy that you expect to end with, ""....and that student's name? Albert Einstein! And then the entire class lifted him on their shoulders and cheered!""Early in the book, during the Senator's intro, I noted a few horrific pieces of evidence that no editor ever did anything but rubber-stamp this book. Here's one:Worse case scenario, the White House snubs me by sending some low-level campaign intern.It should be ""worst case scenario"", please send my editing fee to the following address.... The text is littered with these little ""it's just slightly off"" errors that any editor worth their salt should have caught easily.Let's get to the plot. In essence, the head of the NRO's daughter died, and he thinks the root cause of this was that NASA had a rocket fail so one of their satellites was destroyed. This directly follows from Digital Fortress in underscoring how Dan Brown seems to believe that the government should have carte blanche to eavesdrop on everyone's communications anywhere in the world at any time, and anything short of that is un-American.He somehow arranges to extract a large boulder from the Mariana Trench (why the NRO was down there doing things is....I don't even know....and why their discoveries down there that the rock is similar to meteorites never got out is also a mystery), and this is kept completely secret somehow.Then that very large thing is transported thousands of miles to stick is under an experimental NASA engine to burn a fusion crust onto the outside. Sure....but how did no one transporting this know? How did NASA, who are being tricked here, not notice someone commandeering their engine to burn a huge rock? Once properly crusty, it was transported AGAIN another few thousand miles to a very remote arctic location, put on a submarine, and then a hole was somehow melted from underneath to insert the rock at precisely the right depth to coincide with a known meteorite event.Once NASA discovers the rock, things proceed fairly logically, at least until the civilians start noticing things and investigating further. That's where the wheels really start to come off.After extracting the rock, this book's Asian stereotype notices bio-luminescence in the hole. Rather than alert anyone else immediately, as any actual scientist (or functional human being) would, he decides to dangerously lean himself into the hole to try to take a sample. No thought was given to, I don't know, maybe taking a picture of the phenomenon? Getting others to come see it, or to at least help more safely extract a sample?Even more inexplicable is that this Delta Force team, so laughably exaggerated to the point of being comical, decides to murder this man with a (nonexistent) mosquito bot thing by flying it into his eye and making him slip.What was the endgame here? Did they think the body wouldn't float and would never be discovered? No one would notice this man just disappearing? They wouldn't think of the giant, dangerous, open pit when trying to figure out where he went? I don't understand how they thought this would keep anything a secret.Inevitably, someone else notices the glowing algae (again, did you think you killed the only human being who might wander into this room ever?), and they (painfully and laboriously) come to the conclusion that there is seawater from under the glacier, compromising their core assumption that this object has been perfectly preserved in the ice for centuries.For some reason, it's our main cast that goes out to take what seems to be a relatively simple measurement. They are completely left to their own devices and no one else is supporting this mission, they are left to drink and celebrate? It's absolutely unrealistic that there would be a revelation this huge and they would take steps to conceal this rather than sound the alarm and do everything possible to cover their asses; no scientist is worried about ""ruining the party"", they would want to make sure they catch the error before it gets released if they have it in their power to prevent something this catastrophic from making them look incompetent. They would have shut down the party and called all hands to figure this out before the press conference.Two weird things happen as a result: Again, our special forces team decides just straight up murdering people would help. At the same time, everyone else inside the dome instantly forgets about the team sent out to investigate this new issue.Here's where I need to address the author's note at the beginning of the book:All technologies described in this novel exist.These operatives use fantasy guns to try to kill our crew which supposedly just ingest snow and manufacture ice bullets. As someone with miltary clearance, Rachel was well acquainted with the new experimental ‘IM’ weaponry – Improvised Munitions – snow rifles that compacted snow into ice pelletsFirst off, this was tested by Mythbusters and thoroughly debunked (Season 1, Episode 4). To be fair, that aired in 2003, and this was published in 2001, but I expect someone explicitly going out of their way to claim ""these things all exist"" to have done enough research to find this out anyway.Here we have an amazing deus ex machina escape: They untether a tarp cover foreshadowed all of 2 pages earlier and are flung down the glacier in the gale force wind. Somehow, they not only survive this but also riding a calving iceberg down into the ocean, being totally submerged int he arctic (handwaved away by their special suits, but wouldn't it still get in through their wrist, ankle, and face holes?), and being stranded on an iceberg.....by a goddamn nuclear sub?Somehow just tapping on a huge iceberg with an axe is picked up and noticed by a nuclear sub that is conveniently within range to swing by and rescue them. Sure, whatever.Here's where we just completely come off the rails. Rachel makes contact and arrangements are made to transport her back home with her findings......by the man who turns out to be behind the team trying to kill them? Why would he not just arrange to have them stay at that base where they get on a jet and let the Delta team catch up with them there where he can control the timing and environment?On the plane they further discuss the evidence to no real result....until they get a second deus ex machina in the form of a voicemail Mike gets from one of his crew conveniently casting doubt on the one piece of evidence they couldn't get around. This leads them to redirect to New Jersey and, again, the man behind the conspiracy facilitates transportation to this new location. WHY?!It's obviously just a way to shoehorn in the final climactic action set-piece on the Goya with whirlpools and explosions and sharks.The only thing of note in our B-Plot is that they literally shoot a missile at the FDR Memorial to kill a white house aide. Just....what.Back on the ship, they inevitably discover that the rock is from the bottom of the ocean, not a meteorite, but then we have the literal black helicopters show up and try to kill everyone. These civilians somehow outsmart the deadliest special ops force and escape.The plan at the core of this plot is just baffling. I don't understand what the endgame was here, for the long-term success of this bizarre plan. Even if nothing had gone wrong, it would only have been a matter of time before this would be the most studied object in the history of humanity and someone would have discovered things weren't quite right. Beyond the nonsensical plot, the writing itself is just atrocious. Let me go through some highlights I made in chronological order. These range from grammatical fuck-ups to nonsensical minor plot points.Sexton saw the white Ford Windstar minivan parked in exactly the same spot as it had been for every one of their meetings – in the eastern corner of the garage, behind a row of trash bins. Sexton would have preferred to meet this man in a suite upstairs, but he certainly understood the precautions. This man’s friends had not gotten to where they were by being careless.This entire B-Plot seems to hinge on Sexton's ability to move about secretly like this, but don't presidential candidates (especially so close to election time, which is emphasized several times as the reason for such drastic action) have Secret Service details assigned to them? It seems impossible he could do this, or at the very least he's incredibly recognizable.As Rachel Sexton followed Lawrence Ekstrom into the habisphereThis use of full names is so odd to me and it happens repeatedly.The CNN production facility outside of Washington, D.C., is one of 212 studios worldwide that link via satellite to the global headquarters of Turner Broadcasting System in Atlanta.This is one of many, many ""establishing shots"" that follow an incredibly static formula. It reads like a he copy/pasted it from a Wikipedia article (which he probably did...).When the President had told Rachel he had recruited top-notch civilian scientists to authenticate NASA’s discovery, Rachel had imagined a group of wizened nerds with monogrammed calculators.Monogrammed calculators? Ok boomer.Marlinson’s ideas on gravitational fields were legendary among NRO satellite engineers.This is just bizarre. There are layers here. How does Rachel know ""NRO satellite engineers"" so intimately she knows they worship this guy? Who the fuck has ""ideas"" that are ""legendary"" in science? Knowing gravitational theory very intimately, I just want to know what Brown is imagining these ""ideas"" are that would have this cult following but not actually be published and accepted into our framework of understanding the universe. This just isn't how the scientific community works.Even now, the scientific and philosophical implications of the meteorite astounded him, forcing him to rethink everything he had ever believed about nature.Really? EVERYTHING? I don't think this really has much bearing on those ""ideas"" about gravity.‘Panspermia.’ Corky smiled broadly. ‘I beg your pardon?’ ‘Panspermia is the theory that life was seeded here from another planet.’ Rachel stood up. ‘You’re losing me’[...]‘Panspermia,’ Rachel said, now understanding what they were talking about. She had heard the panspermia theory before but didn’t know its name. ‘The theory that a meteorite splashed into the primordial soup, bringing the first seeds of microbial life to earth.’This...really doesn't seem that complicated? And she had heard it before but was confused here?Soon I will be the most famous paleontologist in the world. He hoped Michael Tolland had been generous and featured Ming’s comments in the documentary.What a bizarre shift of first- and third-person narration.The hell with that!It's ""To hell with that."" Again, editors are useful people if they exist.The charring looked relatively freshI'd love to hear how one detects ""fresh"" charring on rock.any time in the past half centuryThis was discussing how dating is inaccurate if it's less than 500 years...not a half century.‘Mr President? I wasn’t going to wake you, but you should be aware that there was a car bombing at the FDR Memorial tonight.’ ‘What?’ Herney almost dropped his drink. ‘When?’ ‘An hour ago.’ His face was grim. ‘And the FBI just identified the victim .This is at the heart of the problem with Brown's writing: He sets up this fake tension as a substitute for competent writing. This is at the end of almost every chapter. Even just a few pages after this:‘Controller,’ Delta-One stammered, his tone one of stunned disgrace as he looked at the situation on the deck of the Goya.‘I cannot imagine . . .’ Nor can I, the controller thought. Their quarry had obviously been grossly underestimated.He maintains this deliberate concealing of an identity to stretch out the artificial tension.This is why Brown is a hack writer. He cannot write competent plots or believable characters. These are page-turners in that you must keep turning the pages to eventually get the next reveal after 14 pages of stalling. This quote from near the end perfectly sums up anything this man has written:Zach Herney sat at his desk in the Oval Office, his head throbbing. The newest piece of the puzzle had just been revealed.There's more to writing a book than dosing out information, something Dan Brown (or his inexplicable fanbase) has never learned.",0,-0.9978,0.098,0.829,0.073,0.4866499438832771,NEGATIVE,1.0

276,1919716676,02/24/2017,3.0,"Maybe like 2.5 stars but I figured I'd cut Dan Brown a break because there were a few things that I did like about the book. The good:-I like in Dan Brown's books how there are tidbits of real facts (historical context, scientific data, etc.) that are not always necessary for the story but add a little spice just to increase your trivia knowledge.-I actually thought the premise of the book was intriguing and was interested in seeing how the mystery unfolded and how it was slowly solved.The bad (SPOILERS):-The standard Dan Brown formula is present: Same type of hero/heroine combo, a big conspiracy and a villain twist at the end (you can get a more detailed explanation of this formula from other reviews).-I found it hard to believe that highly-trained Delta Force operators would be tasked with babysitting a fake meteorite site and then be so inept at taking out some civilians who did not have any training that should have made them a challenge at all. Coupled with the extremes that they were using to neutralized targets. Hellfire missiles!! I thought they were trying to avoid a big investigation but they are blowing up a helicopter, a car, strafing a boat with a high public profile.-I served in the Army and then later in the Air Force so I am not familiar with U.S. Navy submarine protocols, but if all the Russians had to do to get U.S. subs to break their cover and surface was to have some stranded fishermen tap an emergency SOS signal on an iceberg I don't know why this tactic is not implemented more. I'm assuming that there are rules for providing emergency assistance in the open water of oceans, but maybe the secret sub would have called in to a nearby base (like the habisphere or the nearby Thule AFB) to check out the signal. I just thought this was a leap.-I love a good conspiracy theory (one of the reasons I used to watch Jessie's Ventura's Conspiracy Theory TV show and listen to the radio show Coast to Coast at night), and while I don't believe all of them it seems that the big flaw of these theories that they are just too many people to keep quiet (I'm sure someone that supports some of these theories would argue this is precisely how these theories are brought to light but unfortunately are still officially disavowed or ridiculed and the whistleblowers end up not being taken seriously). So in this book, the NRO gets people to deep dive in a sub to extract a huge rock that looks like a meteorite, takes it to an experimental engine-testing facility to be flash burned, transported to under the Arctic Circle ice where they use a submarine to drill a hole in a glacier and implant the fake meteorite. Sounds like a lot of bodies and moving parts.Overall, I gave the book the rating that I did because I understand that in books like this you have to have a level of suspension of belief for the story to unfold.

296,3747209658,01/04/2021,3.0,The scientific aspects of the book seems accurate and was the only thing that pushed me to read the whole book. The politics aspects are the typical ones and didn't bring much. The history itself wasn't bad but easy to anticipate the plot. Overall it's a good book to read but not over the top.,0,0.1969,0.082,0.823,0.095,0.5333333333333334,NEGATIVE,0.9768
