0,3230228193,03/24/2020,2.0,"I'm a big fan of Billy Connolly, as a comedian, a storyteller and just generally as an all round interesting good bloke who is great to listen to. But this book did not do a lot for me, except make me reflect what a great performer he is. The book made me think of scientific reductionism - that tendency of some scientists to break a problem into tiny parts and see the solution in terms of those tiny parts instead of retaining some holistic vision. For Billy Connolly is more than the sum of his parts. If you read these stories without any idea who Billy Connolly was, I suspect you would find them neither terribly interesting nor amusing. In fact, I was surprised how comically thin many of these tall tales and wee stories were. And yet some of them I think I can actually remember him telling and laughing at.I think this comes down to the fact that he is overall a brilliant performer. And to understand this brilliance you need to hear his voice, see his face, sense his energy levels when he was performing, - and so on. The words written down on paper just don't do it for me on their own - but if you add him back into them, they will. There were a few bits which were either slightly amusing or interesting, but slim pickings from a 320 or so pages long book. My advice, give this a miss. He has written other stuff - I'd say go for that.",33,0.9533,0.038,0.836,0.127,0.5149176954732511,NEGATIVE,1.0

Unnecessary background, side tracks, lost threads, missed points, picked up threads, another side story, completely unrelated facts about characters in the story, oh and look - there’s the punchline! I was wondering a little if there could be something in what some reviewers said that these would work less well in written form, but that went out the window at the end of the second sentence and by the end of the second paragraph I was huffing snd puffing and laughing out loud. Can honestly not remember when a book made me do that last time. The missing star is mainly because I felt the book lost pace towards the end and the last few chapters would actually have been better to leave out. Billy (as I expected) also veers a tad close to slapstick and/or toilet humour at times.

I have seen many of his recorded performances though and I think all of his travelogues as he has been around various parts of the world.This book is a collection of some of his best-known stories that he tells as part of his sets.

You would rightly be confused by the move. Beyond the cash generating aspect, what would be the point?...Well that is basically what Connolly has done here.The main problem with this book is that almost all of it has appeared in at least one, sometimes two previous books and a lot of his stand up. It really feels a bit cheeky and lazy when we are getting the exact same stories dragged out for two books in a row?...Surely the readership deserves some quality control?...instead of recycling the same old stories again and again.Of course this has its funny moments now and then, but the truth is that too many of these stories do not translate well onto the page at all. I’ve heard many of them on his stand up stuff and it is delivered a lot better, so much of it is lost when committed to the page, all the drama, nuance and volume stripped away it can feel incredibly dull and disappointing. On the positive side, this is a quick read and it’s an easy read, but overall there is a good reason why Connolly has not published too many books in his half century involved in the creative and performing arts.

13,3847035699,02/19/2021,4.0,"I’ve been a massive Billy Connolly fan for many years. I’ve got lots of DVDs featuring his standup and travelogues, and I was lucky enough to see him live twice. He never fails to make me laugh, even just on a chat show. So it was with great sadness I heard about his retirement, although entirely understandable in his circumstances.I was looking forward to reading this book in which he has gathered many of his most famous stories for posterity. Billy never really told ‘jokes,’ they were always funny anecdotes and tales, often poking fun at himself or other absurdities he saw in every day life. He often talked about sex and bodily functions, and was very sweary and he makes no apology for that, so the book would not be for anyone who did not like this in his live shows because Billy is exactly the same in the book as when performing. If you did love his humour though, you will find many of your favourite stories within these pages.The book is split in to chapters on different, loosely connected topics, but otherwise it is fairly randomly organised with just little anecdotes and longer ones interspersed with comments, thoughts and musings on his life and career. Some people won’t like it because it isn’t a particular linear format, but then Billy’s comedy was never like that. He would start on a topic and then wander off at a tangent when other things occurred to him before looping back round to the original story (or sometimes not!), so the book is a good reflection of his style and really brought him to life for me.I could hear his voice telling these familiar, and some unfamiliar, stories very clearly. Parts of it made me laugh out loud and I had to keep stopping to read bits aloud to The Irishman who kept asking me what I was laughing at. It was a book that really cheered me up during this lockdown. However, it is not the same as watching Billy perform, and you realise how much his expressions and gestures and movements added to the comedy of his story-telling. The ‘Wildebeest’ example illustrates this best. It is many people’s favourite story of Billy’s, but it just isn’t as funny when you can’t see him doing the vacant expression of the wildebeest and the actions of the lions as they plan their attack.Overall, I really enjoyed reading this but it can’t replace Billy’s performances, and I for one will miss him terribly. I wish I could have met him in real life just once before Parkinson’s started to take effect. I’m sure it would have been great craic.",3,0.9961,0.037,0.805,0.157,0.4826146869004012,NEGATIVE,0.9598

And not being surrounded by a laughing audience means that when one of these tales doesn't elicit a chuckle, you just sit there in the awkward silence this book invoked into the atmosphere and question where it's worth trying for another. A few chuckles did arise, but they were few and far between, to the point where i decided to just cut my losses and accept that as a young straight sober not Scottish guy, I'm probably not the target audience for this comedy or this book.",3,0.8991,0.053,0.801,0.146,0.4622222222222222,NEGATIVE,0.9975

He actually addressed me a couple of times cos he told some jokes that Glaswegians (or near enough) would REALLY get, so I was in hysterics and pretty obvious.Last time was in 2016 on his High Horse tour where the effects of Parkinson's was obvious, mostly because he pointed them out and made jokes about them!

There are a few great stories but most of them are anything but; the fact that I knew most of them wasn't the problem as I can listen to him on YouTube indefinitely (in fact, I would take an audio recordings of his comedy onto my desert island).If only the publisher's had had the courage to be honest it could have made for a much better book; they could have had a preface by the editor who transcribed the material with a related commentary; or, if Billy actually did this mundane task himself, surely he'd say something about it in the intro. I've transcribed audio material before and it's really hard work, as is the editing that has to then follow.There's no clue on the cover or front matter about who did the dirty work but in the acknowledgements the first name to get a thank you (and his own sentence) is Nick Davies. Who is Nick Davies? I will ask Google right now ... it turns out he's a bigshot editor who's worked for some of the main London publishing houses. I assume he's too high and mighty to have done this transcribing task himself (maybe Billy actually did it?. Maybe one of his household minions?) What I do know is that publishers will sell their own mother to get their hands on a book by a celebrity of Billy's stature, as it's like making a sequel of a popular film -- there's a ready-made audience ready to buy it however indifferent its quality may be.This is what Nick Davies said in The Bookseller's puff piece about the book:“As his many millions of fans will know, Billy’s stories can be rude, warm-hearted, anarchic, joyful, angry, far-fetched, down-to-earth and everything in between. They are also beautifully constructed, brilliantly paced and deeply funny. I’ve written to Billy at various points over the last 15 years to ask if he would bring these stories to the printed page and I’m thrilled that he has finally agreed. Tall Tales is an absolute treat of a book that will delight readers everywhere.”In conclusion, it's important to get Billy's jokes in book form -- particularly for people like me of a Scottish persuasion.

Of course the stories are the same ones he’s told many times before, but as some comic used to say, it’s the way he tells them. Having been brought up on the west coast of Ireland in a small terrace house with outside toilet, three brothers and four sisters, I can relate to Connolly’s stories of his childhood in Glasgow. The story of the kid in bed shouting down that Eamon has his foot stuck in the sleeve of the overcoat, and the mortified mother shouting back in front of the visiting priest that it isn’t an overcoat, it’s an eiderdown had done the rounds in our town long before Connolly made us howl with laughter at it.

He was never a ""political"" comedian... he usually found humour in the ridiculous, and especially the ridiculous that we accept as normal. However, some of his later material, perhaps in the light of the PC/woke climate and the reaction against that by some, comes across as lazily reactionary. He sees the PC/woke agenda as ""beige"" but instead of taking on substantial examples of this he focusses on reversing beepers on bin-lorries and ambulance being printed back to front on the front of said vehicles.

As he reveals in his introduction, sometimes he doesn't know exactly what he will talk about during his stand up sessions, but has perhaps a list of what might occur. The stories frequently ramble with many asides and digressions, as well as sound effects that the readers have to put in for themselves, but they are a true reflection of his stage performances, and for those who have seen those performances, the imagination will kick in and you can envisage him gesticulating and generally enjoying himself with his audience. Many of the stories involve rants that become increasingly amusing, and every story ends with some sort of punch line, but, as Billy himself says, he dose not actually tell jokes, he makes his stories amusing.For those not familiar with Billy Connolly, a word of warning. Billy believes that Keith Tynan did the English language, and television, a great service by being the first person to ever use the F word on television. According to Billy this was a liberating event, so much so, that he enjoys using that word quite liberally in both his stage appearances and this book.
