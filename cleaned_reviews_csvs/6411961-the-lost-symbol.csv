1,71832547,09/19/2009,2.0,"I have such issues rating Dan Brown books... I want 1.5 stars, I think. Snark ahead.Here's the deal: the man can't write. He's a name-brand & url spewing, Wikipedia-like fountain of knowledge, who CAN'T HANDLE VERB TENSES. He also likes really short sentences. That aren't sentences at all. Really. Expect iPhone, Twitter, and Google shout-outs, too. I'm almost surprised he didn't mention the inevitable hash #thelostsymbol and tell us to use it when we tweet about what we just learned.On the flip side, who doesn't love a good romp around a famous city solving mysteries with art and science and religion? You know the drill, and the formula hasn't changed here in the slightest.As a former DC resident of 7 years, I have to admit, I was expecting slightly more from the location, but Langdon and his companion du jour keep getting trapped in random places, so it's a bit disappointing on that front. He does get 10 points for a hilarious caper including the Blue Line out to the King Street station though and the Red Line to Tenleytown (yeah, Tenleytown shout-out, what up!)This book's wacky science theme is Noetics, and the quasi-religious thing at hand is the Masons. Since the first thing that comes to mind re: Noetics is Fringe, I sort of expected a Pacey Witter guest appearance, but alas, it was not meant to be. I know absolutely zip about the Masons, but who wants to bet their membership applications go through the roof this month?So my final verdict: did I hate it as much as Catcher in the Rye? No. (Will I ever hate any book as much as I hate Catcher in the Rye? Unlikely. BUT THERE'S TIME.) Is it the best Robert Langdon book? Not by a long shot. Angels & Demons still is the best of the trilogy. Is it still vaguely enjoyable in the way only a Dan Brown book can be? Yes. Does Dan Brown's copy editor need to be publicly humiliated? YES AND HIS NAME IS APPARENTLY JASON KAUFMAN (according to the Acknowledgements, so I'm not like, stalking anyone here) AND GOOD LORD MAN, ONLY YOU CAN PREVENT FOREST FIRES CAUSED BY PEOPLE BURNING THIS BOOK EDIT THIS INTO SOMETHING ENJOYABLE. EVERY TIME DAN BROWN DOESN'T KNOW HOW A VERB WORKS, KITTENS DIE.Also, if I ever have to read the words ""neutered sex organ"" again, I will be forced to remove my eyeballs and then pour bleach directly onto my brain.One more P.S., since I tweeted this and then forgot to include this here: Most unbelievable part of the plot?

2,74306646,10/12/2009,2.0,"I liked Angels and Demons and I really liked The DaVinci Code but this latest of Dan Browns thrillers was barely worth the time, and definitely not worth the money. The Lost Symbol follows the familiar Dan Brown formula - an ominous conspiracy, a threat to end the world as we know it, a relentless villain, and a search for hidden secrets which require the decoding of obscure clues. This formula has given us a couple of fine thrillers, and has taken advantage of the authors familiarity with arcane history, philology, symbolism, art and architecture. But even this intriguing texture would not be terribly interesting without the intrepid symbologist Robert Langdon to lead us through the perilous labyrinth at high speed. This time, Langdon must find the Freemason’s grand secret hidden in Washington, D.C. and evade both the CIA and a brilliant but scary villain, while rescuing a kidnapped friend and his sister. The DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons were both intriguing and thrilling enough to overcome Mr. Brown's weak writing. But because The Lost Symbol’s plot is so much weaker, Brown’s sophomoric writing becomes much more obvious and ever more bothersome as the work progresses. For example, the formulaic mini-cliffhangers at the end of nearly every chapter became trite and annoying manipulations. Brown also employed several set-pieces of lecture and discovery that annoyingly repeat themselves. This book is full of Brownian cliches. I think that the credibility of this work is further undermined by using characters who are simultaneously brilliant and clueless. For instance, the intrepid and brilliant professor Langdon, who by now should be rather wary of mysterious invitations, flies to Washington D.C. at a moment's notice supposedly at a friend's request but without actually speaking to his friend. And even less credible, is that without direct confirmation, he brings with him a top-secret package that he swore to keep hidden at all costs.Similarly, the brilliant scientist Katherine doesn’t think to back up her life’s work of scientific research, and she allows a man she's met only once into her ""top secret"" laboratory because she receives a TEXT message purportedly from her brother who she admits doesn’t even know how to text. And these are not the only naive, and clueless people who should know better. The police and security guards are all hapless,and even the CIA director fails to question whether a suspect is lying when he says ""I'll be there in 20 minutes."" More disappointing still is that the main character of Robert Langdon seems to have been dumbed down in this book. He repeatedly is adamant about thus and such only to be subsequently shocked when the true meaning is revealed. He always requires two attempts to decipher the true meaning of clues - the first one which is obvious and turns out to be wrong, followed by the shocking epiphany. One would think that a Harvard professor would eventually learn that things are not always what they seem. In this work Robert Langdon spends more time being lectured than he does solving mysteries or puzzles. My recollection is that he figured out absolutely nothing critical in the last third of the book. Even more troubling than Brown’s weak and cliched characterization is that as the thriller reaches its climax, it becomes clear that the pieces do not fit together well. For instance, for most of the story, both the villain, and the CIA insist the stakes couldn't be higher, but in the end we learn that the potential danger is merely some bad public relations for a few powerful Masons. Why then is the CIA involved in this extortion plot - especially since it is legally barred from domestic law enforcement? The author simply fails to provide justification for all the black opps of the CIA counter- conspiracy despite their central role in the story. There are lots of problems with this book, but perhaps the its greatest flaw is Dan Brown’s failure to ever explain the main premise for the book, something he calls the Ancient Mysteries. The primary force that propels the plot is the implicit promise that in the end, a tangible secret will be uncovered. While the protagonist keeps asking if this grand secret is merely metaphorical, he is assured by friends, enemies and even the CIA that the secret is literal and potentially dangerous. But, in the end we learn that the grand secret for which people are willing to sacrifice their lives and fortunes doesn’t really exist. What exactly is the point of the pyramid and the secret codes and symbols if the grand mystery is already found in every church, in nearly every home, and in even in all the hotel rooms in the country? Doesn't that make the entire plot pointless to begin with?OK, if it’s not clear yet, HERE IS THE BIG SPOILER: The great Masonic secret is the most widely published and read book in history - it is the Bible. Brown’s thesis is that the Bible is loaded with hidden wisdom, and once these biblical secrets are pointed out, people are going to be shocked that they didn't see them before. And then they are going to be transformed because they now know that they're one with God, or they're the same as God, or they are made of God, or some such new age mumbo-jumbo. So in the end the whole purpose of all the elaborate secrecy is that a few people think mankind may not be ready for a new age when human potential will be finally unleashed. So for centuries the inner circle of Masons have concocted elaborate means to hide this enlightenment from a world not ready for apotheosis. And so despite all the symbols and codes, the grand secret is really kept hidden in plain sight. So pay no attention to the coded mysteries behind the curtain. The ending of this story is an embarrassment. It may be the most anti-climactic, unsatisfying ending I have ever read. While the story kept claiming that earth shattering secrets were soon to be revealed, in the end all the paintings, pyramids, talismans, and other clues turned out to lead to nothing. They resolved nothing, they didn’t even leave us with a mystery yet unsolved. The mystery was solved, and it was an inconsequential whimper instead of a revelatory bang. It is my opinion that the author could not pull together the novel in the last chapters simply because there was nothing to pull together. There was no sweeping statement to be made and no grand secret to be revealed. This left me very unsatisfied at the story’s end. Theological addendum: Many Christians are offended by the idea of apotheosis which seems to be a core premise of Brown’s Masonic heroes. Though the idea of human deification has a long and ancient history in Christian thought, these critics have disowned the notion that Man can become like God, and consequently are offended when Brown places this mystery at the apex of his new-age amalgam of Masonry, religion and pseudo-science. As a Latter-day Saint (Mormon), I believe that having been literally created in God’s image, we each have the innate potential to become glorified and exalted through obedience to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. My belief that man can become like god, is akin to the belief of Christian writers through the ages from Irenaus to C.S. Lewis. So deification doesn’t offend me at all. Ironically, however, I find myself in strong agreement with Christian critics who accuse Brown of idolatry for claiming that this apotheosis can occur merely through our own mystical consciousness raising efforts. The central message of the Bible, and most especially the New Testament is that such a dramatic transformation can only occur on God’s terms and by means of his power and grace. In contrast, Brown attempts to “spiritualize” or metaphorize all particularity and literal meaning out of the biblical text. To Brown’s heroes, the real meaning of the text is whatever the true mystic wants to find hidden within. His new-age hodge podge of religion is very convenient,non-demanding, self-asserting and self-serving. It is the opposite of God’s revealed truth which requires self-less obedience and devotion to God and our fellow men. The Bible’s central message of obedience and faith is not found in Brown’s mystical amalgam, nor in any other brand of humanism. Brown ironically attempts to bolster his view of an impersonal God and a godless salvation by selectively quoting the Bible, a book which persistently and powerfully testifies of a personal God - a Father in Heaven who knows us individually, and cares about helping us overcome our sins more than developing our mental, or psycho-kinetic capacities. I agree with those critics who claim that the God described, or implied by Brown is an idolatrous invention of man as surely as that of Odin, Zeus, Baal, or the God of the Greek philosophers whose center is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere. In my view, Brown’s mishmash of new age nonsense intending to avoid dogma and doctrine, has very little point except to highlight that humans have enormous untapped potential. I don’t see anything revealing or revolutionary about this truism. I cannot conceive of such a benign observation creating any paradigm shift, nor can I imagine it unleashing pent-up human capacity. On the contrary, I think it is mankind’s persistent attempts to ignore the substantive teachings of the Bible that have bound us to telestial mediocrity. Even so, I suspect this theological critique is probably a bit over-the-top when you consider that this book is just a work of adventure fantasy. The Lost Symbol ought not to be taken too seriously. I don’t imagine that it will shape many people’s views of God, the Bible, or even religion in general. I don’t see The Lost symbol as much of a threat to my sacred beliefs, even though I thought I might as well throw in my two bits on the matter.",248,0.9843,0.118,0.746,0.135,0.5295225814374751,NEGATIVE,1.0

For goodness sake it is a book for entertainment, not a non-fiction story. Though I have read some non-fiction stories that are more fiction then Dan Brown's book. Brown's books are entertaining and make you look at thing in different ways which is good. Everytime I pick up Brown's book, I am totally immersed in the story and at the edge of my seat wanting to know what happens next. I can't wait until the next book. It took me a bit longer to finish this book then I expected, but I am so glad that I read it. Again, Dan Brown delivers a thought provoking story in his unique style.

4,133816820,12/06/2010,5.0,"The Lost Symbol (Robert Langdon, #3), Dan BrownThe Lost Symbol is a 2009 novel written by American writer Dan Brown. It is a thriller set in Washington, D.C., after the events of The Da Vinci Code, and relies on Freemasonry for both its recurring theme and its major characters. It is the third Brown novel to involve the character of Harvard University symbologist Robert Langdon, following 2000's Angels & Demons and 2003's The Da Vinci Code. Renowned Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is invited to give a lecture at the United States Capitol, at the invitation apparently from his mentor, a 33rd degree Mason named Peter Solomon, who is the head of the Smithsonian Institution. Solomon has also asked him to bring a small, sealed package which he had entrusted to Langdon years earlier. When Langdon arrives at the Capitol, however, he learns that the invitation he received was not from Solomon, but from Solomon's kidnapper, Mal'akh posing as Solomon's assistant, who has left Solomon's severed right hand in the middle of the Capitol Rotunda in a recreation of the Hand of Mysteries. Mal'akh then contacts Langdon, charging him with finding both the Mason's Pyramid, which Masons believe is hidden somewhere in Washington, D.C., and the Lost Word, lest Solomon be murdered. Langdon meets Trent Anderson, head of the Capitol police, and Inoue Sato, the head of the CIA's Office of Security. Sato claims that Mal'akh poses a threat to the national security of the U.S. and that his capture is more important than Peter's rescue, although she refuses to elaborate. Examining Solomon's hand, they discover a clue leading them to Solomon's Masonic altar in a room in the Capitol's sub-basement, where they find a small pyramid lacking a capstone, with an inscription carved into it. ...عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «نماد گمشده»؛ «طلسم گمشده»؛ «نشان گم شده»؛ «نشانه ی گمشده»؛ »هزارتوی اسرار»؛ «رمز گمشده»؛ نویسنده: دن براون؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز بیست و پنجم ماه دسامبر سال 2009میلادیعنوان: نماد گمشده؛ نویسنده: دن براون؛ مترجم: نوشین ریشهری؛تهران، نگارینه، 1388؛ در 672ص؛ شابک 9789642300068؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده 21معنوان: نماد گمشده؛ نویسنده: دن براون؛ مترجم: شبنم سعادت؛تهران، افراز، 1388؛ در 718ص؛ شابک 9789642431632؛ چاپ سوم 1389؛عنوان: نماد گمشده؛ نویسنده: دن براون؛ مترجم: کیان رضوی نعمت اللهی؛ تهران؛ نوح نبی (ع)؛ 1388؛ در 800ص؛ شابک 9786009143702؛ عنوان: نماد گمشده؛ نویسنده: دن براون؛ مترجم: مهراوه فیروز؛تهران، البرز، 1388؛ در 585ص؛ شابک 9789644426810؛ عنوان: نشانه ی گمشده؛ نویسنده: دن براون؛ مترجم: لیلا فراهانی؛ تهران، مضمون، 1388، در 512ص؛ شابک 9786009057399؛عنوان: نشان گمشده؛ نویسنده: دن براون؛ مترجم: بهمن رحیمیان؛ تهران، بهنام، 1388، در 775ص؛ شابک 9789645668592؛عنوان: نشان گمشده؛ نویسنده: دن براون؛ مترجم: یاسمن بهمن آبادی؛ آرمین عمادی؛ تهران، بازتاب اندیشه، 1388، در 571ص؛ شابک9789649980324؛عنوان: طلسم گمشده؛ نویسنده: دن براون؛ مترجم: مهرداد وثوقی؛ تهران، گل آذین، 1389، در 588ص؛ شابک 9789647703673؛عنوان: نماد گمشده؛ نویسنده: دن براون؛ مترجم: حسین شهرابی؛ تهران، افق، 1389؛ در 925ص؛ شابک 9789643696498؛عنوان: رمز گمشده؛ نویسنده: دن براون؛ مترجم: اسماعیل قهرمانی پور؛ تهران، روزگار، 1389، در 726ص؛ شابک 9789643742270؛عنوان: هزارتوی اسرار؛ نویسنده: دن براون؛ مترجم: امیرعباس حدادمنش؛ تهران، تمدن علمی، 1394؛ در 700ص؛ شابک 9786009517756؛زیستن بدون درک راستین هستی، همان گام زدن در کتابخانه ای بزرگ، بدون لمس گنجینه ی کتابهای آن؛ که آموزه های پنهان همگی دورانها هستند؛ زمان همچون رود؛ و کتابها همانند قایقها هستند؛ بسیاری از کتابهایی که در این مسیر روان میشوند؛ درهم میشکنند، در شنهای کف رود فرورفته، و به دست فراموشی سپرده میشوند؛ تنها اندکی، تعداد بسیار اندکی، در گذر زمان، ارزش خود را پایدار میکنند، و میمانند؛ تا نسلهای روزگاران آینده را نیز، از موهبت وجود خویش، بهره مند سازند؛ این داستان یکی از ماندگاران خواهد بود؛ داستان در یک بازه ی زمانی دوازده ساعته در «واشینگتن دی سی» رخ می‌دهد؛ داستان درباره ی «فراماسونری» است؛ «رابرت لانگدون»، ظاهراً به دعوت یکی از دوستان «فراماسون» خود، به نام «پیتر سولومون»، برای یک سخنرانی، در ساختمان «کنگره ایالات متحده (که به آن ساختمان کاپیتول نیز گفته می‌شود)» وارد «واشینگتن دی سی» می‌شود؛ «سولومون» همچنین از وی درخواست کرده، که بسته ی کوچکی را، که سال‌ها پیش به او امانت داده بود، با خود به همراه بیاورد؛ پس از ورود به ساختمان کنگره، «رابرت لانگدون» با دست راست قطع شده ی «پیتر سولومون» مواجه می‌شود، که در وسط سالن، به سویی اشاره می‌کند؛ دست «سولومون»، با خالکوبی‌های ویژه‌ ای تزئین شده است، که نمادی موسوم به «دست رازها» است؛ با توجه به شواهد، «رابرت لانگدون» درمی‌یابد، که «پیتر سولومون» ربوده شده، و رباینده، بدینوسیله از وی می‌خواهد، که برای او، هرم مخفی «فراماسونها» را، که گفته می‌شود، در جایی در شهر «واشینگتن دی سی»، پنهان است، و همچنین واژه ی گمشده، که گفته می‌شود کلید دستیابی به قدرت و دانش مخفی گذشتگان است را، پیدا کنددر ادامه ی داستان، مسئول نگهداری از ساختمان «کاپیتول»، و رئیس دفتر امنیت سازمان سیا «اینو ساتو» وارد داستان می‌شوند؛ با پیگیری مسیر اشاره شده، توسط دست «پیتر سولومون»، این سه نفر به محراب «ماسونی» «پیتر سولومون» واقع در اتاقی کوچک، در زیر زمین ساختمان «کاپیتول»، هدایت می‌شوند؛ «فراماسونها» معمولاً چنین محرابی را، به جهت یادآوری فلسفه ی زندگی، در خانه ی خود می‌سازند؛ یک جمجمه ی انسان، و برخی اشیاء نمادین دیگر، تزئین کننده ی محراب بودند؛ اعضای گروه، متوجه لرزش یکی از دیواره‌ های اتاق، در نور شمع میشوند؛ دیواره‌ ای که در حقیقت یک پرده بود، کنار میرود، و هرمی ناقص پدیدار میشود، که بر روی آن کلمه‌ ای حک شده، که «رابرت لانگدون» را، به سوی گام بعدی برای نجات دوست ربوده شده‌ اش، هدایت میکندهمزمان «ساتو»، که از مأمورین حراست ساختمان «کاپیتول» خواسته بود، تصویر اشعه ی ایکس گرفته شده از «رابرت لانگدون» را، در هنگام ورود به ساختمان «کاپیتول»، بازنگری کنند، متوجه وجود یک هرم کوچک، در کیف همراه «رابرت لنگدان» می‌شود...؛ او از «رابرت لانگدون» در رابطه با هرم پرسش می‌کند، و «رابرت لانگدون» که از محتویات بسته ی امانی، «پیتر سولومون» بی اطلاع بود، متوجه منظور «ساتو» نمی‌شود؛ «ساتو» تصمیم می‌گیرد، که «رابرت لانگدون» و هرم‌ها را برای پژوهش بیشتر، و بازجویی، به مقر سازمان «سیا» انتقال دهد؛ در همین زمان «وارن بلامی»، سرمعمار ساختمان «کاپیتول»، و یکی از دوستان «فراماسونِ» «پیتر سولومون»، وارد اتاق زیرزمینی می‌شود، و با مضروب کردن «ساتو»، و رئیس حراست ساختمان، «رابرت لانگدون» را آزاد کرده، و به همراه خود به طبقه همکف ساختمان «کاپیتول» می‌برد، و ادامه ی داستانتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 16/07/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 04/06/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی",226,0.8988,0.019,0.947,0.034,0.3746031746031746,POSITIVE,0.9723

Once again, it's the same set of complements and criticisms here. Pace, suspense, mystery, humor and characters all good but everything feels just too repetitive. At this point, I'm starting to think that the problem partly lies with me since I'm reading the entire series in one go, as opposed to the average reader having at least a year between consecutive releases. So, I'm going to keep this one short without making the review a rant. If you're looking for sheer entertainment, this could work quite well for most, but that's pretty much all the good I could say. I'm convinced more and more that reading RL books back to back is a bad idea as this series unfolds.

6,74236887,10/11/2009,3.0,"Dan Brown - image from AARP - photo by Drew GurionWhen one picks up a Dan Brown book there are certain expectations. First one can look forward to a fast-based adventure pitting the intellect of Robert Langdon against dark forces intent on creating mayhem of one sort or another. One expects that religion or religious institutions will play a central role in the story. One can expect that there will be puzzles to be solved and mysteries within mysteries. One can expect murderous sociopaths and police of questionable loyalty. One can expect that there will be a considerable quantity of payload in the form of interesting, arcane information. One can expect that once begun it will be a difficult book to put down. And Brown delivers on all of the above. If you are looking for great literature, look elsewhere. That is not Brown’s beat. Be prepared for some eye-rolling, as hyper-intelligent people make glaringly stupid decisions, all in the service of moving the plot along.

A reason might be that it´s hard to write series in the genre of epic, eyeopening, world shattering blockbuster epiphany hybrid thrillers, but at least the editors could truly have tried to make this better, it was disappointing to be left with such a facepalmy ending and a general meh feeling.The worst thing about such literary fails is that one is waiting for the action, the logic, the conclusion towards the end and then nothing, just lol rofl facepalm. Believe me, if you read (don´t do it) it, you will feel this immense disappointment when realizing that this is the explanation, the reason why you invested hours of time to be Brown pranked, browned, whatever. The reason might be that there is not just the stupid premise, but the missing good, well written and credible metaplot, the action, and the sheer freshness of the mentioned works and that it seems to me like a failed approach of producing the next mind penetrating revolution in the thriller market without using the working recipe for whatever reason. There would be so many conspiracy theories in different cultures that could be used to write series about, but this is a no go. I don´t understand why neither Brown nor the proofreaders saw this coming, so it remains the only interesting mystery surrounding this concoction.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...",174,-0.9079,0.15,0.73,0.12,0.4907142857142856,NEGATIVE,1.0

I was very interested in The Masons, as they were so much a part of the early patriotic/revolutionary era of the US. As usual there is a gruesome evil person, with superhuman like skills and power. The whole story covers just 24 hours...wow, what a day! Interesting insight from Brown on the Masons or Noetic Science?: ""a temple of God"" refers to the ""temple"" of the brain; how ""the created,...becomes the Creator""; when the eye is single, your body fills with light"". For me the last part of the book added to my personal confirmation of what faith is, and that ""our minds can generate energy capable of transforming physical matter."" I believe as Katherine stated, ""As soon as we humans begin to harness our true power, we will have enormous control over our world..and be able to design reality, rather than merely react to it.""  How about this idea: God created us in his image, but not just our physical bodies resemble him, but our minds! Now that's a a great idea, and correlates with my LDS belief that we were all intelligences first, even before our spirits were created. Because of this, we have God-like potential power, and indeed can become like him. We just haven't learned all that is necessary ...yet. Interestingly, he refers to the Hebrew meaning of God, Elohim, which is plural. Hmmm, gives lots to think about, especially if you don't believe in God, or if your belief in God is limited.

I know there are several of my online and in-person (sounds so weird!) friends who disagree, but ultimately... you have to acknowledge the amount of time and dedication he puts into his story, the vast eccentric cast of characters, the intrigue and suspense, the unexpected connections and the fast-paced thrill of turning the pages more quickly than you can actually read each one. People love books for different reasons. It's not always the ""beautiful and lyrical prose"" or the ""emotional gut punch you feel from its reality."" These books are meant to keep your heart racing, your mind guessing and your eyes unable to blink for a few minutes at a time. At the time I'm writing this review, it's been about five years since I read the book, and I still haven't seen the movie... but I am excited to watch it, though I haven't heard great things from those who have.Of the four Robert Langdon books in the series, this was my least favorite. Angels & Demons and The Da Vinci Code had such complex and shocking story lines, I couldn't help but be amazed. Inferno was so intense and ripe with ""what if"" scenarios, my mind was non-stop going. With this book, it's still a huge and complex puzzle, but it felt a little weaker than the other ones. There was a different type of emotional connection given Langdon's friendship with the kidnapped mentor. I liked the puzzle, but were pictures necessary?It was a little too easy to solve this time.It felt a bit repetitive at times.But you still flip the pages faster than a normal read.I'd push you to read his other books. I'd be OK if you skipped this one. But I am still super excited about Origin, the fifth in the series, which will debut later this year.

10,71616347,09/17/2009,5.0,"Now boarding on track 33, the Symbolism Express departing for the Freemasons, the Invisible College, the Office of Security, the SMSC, the Institute of Noetic Sciences and multiple points around the cryptic compass.Your temporal destination, not Paris and London, but Washington, D.C.Your conductor, Harvard symbiologist Robert Langdon, the Indiana Jones of the new age.Tied to the tracks in the gathering darkness ahead and facing certain death, if not embarrassment, another keeper of the ancient mysteries including the wisdom of Solomon, not a man of the Louvre, but a man of the Smithsonian.Traveling alone, an attractive female relative of the man lashed to the tracks, not agent and cryptologist Sophie Neveu, but Noetic scientist Dr Katherine Solomon.Sitting in the engineer's seat with a small stone pyramid rather than a chalice holding down the deadman's pedal, a rogue and tattooed Mason in search of apotheosis replaces Silas, ""The Da Vinci Code's"" rogue and scourged monk as our antagonist for the evening.Hold on. It's going to be another bumpy ride.Dreams of déjà vu remind you what the journey will be like: short chapters, multiple points of view, conflicting agendas with something very large (yet unknown) at stake, the thrill of the chase, the almost-sexual tension of near-satisfaction again and again as answers appear and disappear, multiple station stops for arcane wisdom instruction, and a desperate-save-humanity-hunt for secrets you've stared at your entire life without comprehending.By the end of the novel, you won't be a 33rd Degree Mason and you won't be like unto a god in any way you can quite wrap your mind around, but you will have experienced a high-adrenaline ride. This thrill is what the journey is all about. Perhaps reality lurks around the edge of the plot and theme and perhaps sacred messages lurk within the vast white spaces between the lines of black type, but that's not why we're turning the pages from 1 to 509.Dan Brown has done it again, and upon reflection at the dawn's first light, you'll see that he knows how to pull the right strings and push the right buttons and sprinkle the right esoteric seasonings across his smorgasbord of mysteries from around the world to keep readers addicted for the trip. On the last page, you may well hope, along with Robert Langdon and Katherine Solomon that men and women will follow the ancient maps toward their true potential; but seriously, the novel's destination really doesn't matter, does it, because the ride was the peak experience you were seeking when you picked up ""The Lost Symbol.""All aboard.",120,0.9471,0.076,0.817,0.107,0.4524419067522516,POSITIVE,0.9435

12,71735539,09/18/2009,4.0,"I'm a fan of Dan Brown. I've read all his books - not just The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons, but also Deception Point and Digital Fortress. I like his writing style, how his books are layered with codes and mysteries, and how they're so fast-paced they make my heart beat faster because I feel pulled into the stories and into the lives of his characters.The Lost Symbol is the third book in the Robert Langdon series, and I was glad to see that Brown brought this dynamic and entertaining character back to the United States from Europe and the UK in his previous books. The book starts with a bang, pulling me in within the first few paragraphs, though I didn't feel quite as captivated by this story as I had with his previous two. As with numbers 1 and 2 in the series, there's a format to the story: Robert Langdon, Harvard professor and expert on symbology and religious iconography find himself embroiled in the middle of a high-stakes religious mystery, where a long-debated and highly protected secret is on the verge of being exposed to the masses and ruined for those who have long stood to protect it. There is, of course, the supporting female character, a smart and capable woman who helps fill in the gaps where Langdon's knowledge leaves off. As was true to the past two books, there is physical and emotional danger, as well as a deranged villain who is at once brilliant, physically superior, and acting in what he believes to be the best interest of the world. Despite the true-to-form shape of this book, though, it stands well on its own as a book. Although I enjoyed the reading of this book from beginning to end, it wasn't until the final chapters that I felt a strong connection with it, and that is because the view of religion that Brown describes here - as in both of his previous books in the series - falls directly in line with my own personal beliefs of religion and the concept of God. Readers who criticized his previous explanations of such topics will likely find much to refute and criticize here as well, but for me it's like a breath of fresh air, to know that I'm not the only one who sees the universe in greater terms than just a church and its congregants. This was an entertaining read, as always, and I'm glad to add it to my collections with his other works. I'm sure I'll enjoy reading this particular book more in the future.",73,0.9981,0.055,0.72,0.224,0.4649922191098662,POSITIVE,0.9999
13,75392612,10/22/2009,2.0,"I think I finally figured out why I hate Dan Brown. He writes very average thriller/ mystery books, just like many others do, and the thing is that I don't have a problem with the other writers. Sometimes their books are entertaining, sometimes they are not, sometimes they are poorly written, sometimes they are not so bad, and I'm perfectly fine with it. The thing I can't stand about Dan Brown is his attitude. He truly believes he has been invested with the power of 'omniscience', and he looks down at the reader as if he were talking to a bunch of retarded individuals (which we actually probably are just by virtue of the fact that we are reading his books). But this is still ok, it doesn't upset me all that much. What I think is unacceptable is the fact that in his 'all encompassing knowledge', all we find is an endless bunch of lies, lies about the most obvious evidence anybody can prove. Angels and Demons, which takes place in Rome, is filled with sentences in Italian, except that Mr. Brown didn't even bother looking up the spelling of the words and, as if that were not enough, he invented words to look cool in the eyes of his readers which, come on, wouldn't be able to pick all the bull I'm trying to sell them in a million years!In the Italian version of The Lost Symbol, I noticed that the translators skipped more than one passage because what DB had written not only wasn't accurate, it was blatantly WRONG! So, I don't know if they didn't want to look stupid themselves or did it to try and give Mr. Brown a better image abroad. Just one tiny detail out of many: Classical Greek 101 - Apo is a preposition, with different meanings but still and only a preposition, for sure not a verb. No!!! not in the Lost Key. Dan Brown has to show us he knows the ethimology of the word apotheosis, and so Apo, for him, turns into a verb, and he lectures us as if he were revealing this great truth. I read on a review that his books are an insult to human intelligence. I agree, and not because they are necessarily awful books, but because taking reality and twisting it so that it can fit the story line and, on top of that, selling it as if it were some kind or revelation we can only obtain through Dan Brown's grace, to me is unacceptable.",71,0.9775,0.072,0.793,0.135,0.5851767676767677,NEGATIVE,1.0

So I guess I'll start with my point.This book F*CKING BLOWS. F*ck you, Dan Brown, you smug bastard, for insulting my intelligence like nobody's business. I really liked Angels and Demons, was entertained by The Da Vinci Code, and this book had half the content (not to mention a sixteenth of the climax) of the latter in almost twice the number of pages.Do you get paid by the modifier?

Watch the f*cking Boondock Saints, Dan Brown.), a handful of them are completely obvious, and I swear he recycled at least one from Angels and Demons.And only one revelation in the whole book is remotely shocking.

When I hear, ""issue of national security,"" I think nukes-- not the pussy shit this guy is threatening.Deep breath.Moral of the story, please don't feed the author.

This third novel in the Robert Langdon series also contains many great and insightful lines, perhaps none more so than, “Wide acceptance of an idea is not proof of its validity.” What Dan Brown’s writing really brought home to me as an author is the importance of making your story compelling. This is essential, whether you are writing about veiled histories, arcane symbols, and enigmatic codes, or violent gangsters, unexpected betrayals and a secret underworld.

The writing style is kind of similar to that of the two preceding books. This one definitely was not up to that level of Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code because of many reasons like weaker writing, repetitiveness of dialogues, poor ending etc.However The Lost Symbol is still full of interesting historic facts linked to secrets and mysteries. Dan Brown's vast knowledge about history and arts helps him create a wonderful plot. This time all the action took place in the city of Washington DC and it was wonderful to learn how many secrets this city holds. I also enjoy trying solving the puzzles and mysteries in my mind along the story but I mostly failed.The book is also a great learning experience about the Freemasons and their believes, rituals and their society. Also Noetic Science was something new for me despite it being around for a long time.The villain  Mal'akh  was much better then the previous two villains. He outsmarted all of his enemies and even the CIA. At one point I was rooting for him to win. But the final revelation was kind of disappointing.

24,227824555,10/26/2011,2.0,"2017 Update...Meenakshi, a Goodreads friend for a while now, found this review and it reminded me that I'd actually read this book 5-plus years ago. I had completely forgotten it existed, both the book and the review actually...and then I got to the ""how to die"" thing and was instantly transported into annoyed, irked, ticked-off memoryland.I think it's unsurprising I didn't hold onto the memory of reading the book since I review over 120 a year and read almost three times that many. But I also think it's really sad that a book's one memorable feature is how extremely annoying one of its catchphrases is. Cudgel my brain though I will, I can't recall anything I'd actually enjoyed in this reading process. It was a long popcorn book, cocktail-peanut book, an unchallenging unmemorable uninspiring this-is-my-version-of-TV book.**************************************************************I read The DaVinci Code and, while I didn't find the writing to be high caliber stuff, I was mesmerized by the story and fascinated by the evident command Brown showed of the background material. Its factuality is of no interest to me either way. I wanted a rollicking good ride, and I got one, and I walked away a satisfied customer.Less so here. We have the elements of the DaVinci tome's megasellerdom deployed in a less intriguing plot. One of the Big Reveals is simply uninteresting to me, and the repetition of the catchphrase ""the secret is how to die"" (no spoiler this, it starts extremely early in the book) made me as irritated as any mosquito's buzzing ever has. I am fairly sure it's intended to convey malice and menace, and build suspense, but I found it jarred on me by somewhere in the 40s (chapters come and go at a dizzying rate, there being 133 of them, plus an epilogue that bid fair to make me urp in its treacly upbeatness, packed into 509pp of text).So why did I read this book? A chance to poke at a hugely successful and wealthy novelist who has never heard of me and will never read this review? Nuh-uh. I think Dan Brown has his storytelling antennae tuned to a fine pitch. I think every bit of his fame and wealth is richly deserved and earned by his honest, sincere, and successful desire to tell a good story to the best of his ability. I wanted to be gobsmacked the way I was by that DaVinci madness, that's why I read the darn book!And I wasn't.No one could be sorrier than I am to say this. Maybe it's a case of once is enough for this reader. Maybe it's just a mood. I tend to think that, had this book appeared just exactly as it is today in 2005, I'd be yodeling its masterful reprise of the preceding volume instead of emitting a small bleat of disappointment.And sales figures, while the subject of messy fantasies for other writers, aren't in the DaVinci league. Others agree with me, and the chorus of ""oh, well"" reviews is loud.When Brown comes to write his next thriller, even if it features Robert Langdon, I hope it treads new territory. Too many other footprints on this piece of land for Langdon to stand out. Such is the penalty of leadership: You get to blaze, but not possess, the trail.Recommended? Mildly. But only if you're a conspiracy-thriller fan. *damn* I hate like hell to write that.",32,0.9936,0.067,0.788,0.145,0.5762444318966057,NEGATIVE,1.0

26,71957798,09/20/2009,1.0,"Though technically better written than Digital Fortress, this is Dan Brown's worst novel. Brown creates false suspense by hiding revelations from readers even after major characters learn them. In most cases this is unnecessary, as the twists would have more impact if made in a timely manner. Too often, however, the revelations are obvious or anticlimactic, weaknesses that are amplified by Brown's hide-the-ball technique.Brown's penchant for dubious subject matter is well-known, but he previously managed to pull out decent stories from hokum like the Illuminati and the holy blood/holy grail theory. Here he sidesteps the expected Masonic conspiracy theories, instead casting Robert Langdon as Mason apologist. No, Brown's meat here is Noetic Science, a field that in real life has the credibility of a cable TV huckster/mystic. Even after the plot wraps, Brown drones on for several more chapters about mysticism and religion, with no apparent purpose but to lecture you, dear reader, for having the gall to trust science and technology.As for Brown's style, phrases like ""soggy marsh"" make it clear he still hasn't picked up a copy of The Elements of Style.Much like Brown's villain, I need a cleansing ritual of my own after reading this book.",31,0.5346,0.101,0.778,0.121,0.4789473684210526,NEGATIVE,1.0
27,71272333,09/15/2009,1.0,"My Spoiler-Heavy and Sympathy-Free Review of ""The Lost Symbol"" by Dan Brown This review is going to be riddled with spoilers, to the point where I'm actually going to tell you everything that happens (in summary), because that's the only way I can express my complete and utter contempt for this book. However, due to the nature of search engines, etc., I don't want to spoil things off the back. So I'll start off with a few non-spoilery things just for padding.Everything I say is based on the fact that there are two books in The Lost Symbol; the first book is the DaVinci Code with find/replace done. The second book is a philosophy book, and that's the real source of my vitriol. You'll understand why when I start spewing, well, vitriol at it.Before I begin, I would like to point out that Dan Brown believes in the Myth of the Flat Earth (see Wiki). There's a quote from one of the main characters that ""Peter once compared Noetic Scientists to the early explorers who were mocked for embracing the heretical notion of a spherical earth. Almost overnight, these explorers went from fools to heroes, discovering uncharted worlds and expanding the horizons of everyone on the planet."" (Keep in mind who's being cited in the paragraph) The fact that Brown believes this myth seriously undermines his credibility. How can we trust someone on esoteric matters when they're wrong on mundane matters?I also want to state for the record that I sorta enjoyed DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons. I felt the latter was better (although the ending was ridiculous), but overall they weren't bad reads. To put it a different way: neither of them resulted in a review like this.Ok, one last thing before I start spoiling things completely. If you're interested in an alternative Mason experience, I recommend either reading Umberto Eco's Foucault's Pendulum -- which, to be honest, is a tough book to read. The secret seems to be not trying to figure out everything that's going on; if it's important he'll come back to it -- or watching the delightful Nicolas Cage history/conspiracy romp National Treasure if you only have a couple hours.Ok, enough prattle. Spoilers ahead....There's a Bible buried in the cornerstone of the Washington Monument, and Robert Langdon needs to stop a madman from tattooing it to his head and uploading a video to YouTube!I'm not kidding. That's the first part of the book. And there was actually a moment where I was seriously contemplating giving the book 4 stars. Yes, it was almost an exact replica of the DaVinci Code. But it's better written and less didactic (until the the second part). You still have the same contrivances of style that make it deliberately confusing who is doing something because of course there has to be a ""mole"" character (although not as obnoxious this time). And frankly the factual information is interesting and not anti-Catholic like the other two books in the series. You can still foresee plot points relatively easily (I'll get to the important one in a second), and you're going to get the same group of individuals who think some of the fake stuff (essentially everything the female character has done as a ""noetic scientist"") is true because of the real stuff the book contains just like they thought the DaVinci Code was true. But I believe I would've given the book 3 stars if it had ended at the top floor of the masonic temple.Sadly, it didn't, and that's also where the wheels fall off.So I take you to the climax of the story, and the spoilers are really going to fly fast here. The madman has taken Peter Solomon (the head of the Masons, essentially) to the top of the temple -- and has revealed himself to be the son long thought dead! Of course, everyone probably figured this out about 200 pages earlier (sometimes the ambiguous writing of Brown is a giant flashing sign saying ""Things aren't what they seem!""), but that's not a problem. And he wants to tattoo the ""word"" to his head, but his father gives him the wrong word (of course, since it's not a literal word, it's the aforementioned bible in the Washington Monument). And then his father refuses to kill his son (with the knife Abraham was going to use to kill Isaac!) to complete his mad dream of ascension into divinity, although we're not told if an angel tells him not to. But he gets killed anyway when the glass above the altar is shattered by a helicopter, a perfect symbol of the novel completely falling apart, because now things get weird.The son he thought dead is now dying on an altar, so what does the father say to him as he lies there? ""I lied to you about the tattoo on your head. Oh and uh, yeah, I never stopped loving you."" Seriously. It's like his body was possessed by Nelson (the bully, not the admiral) for a moment and he said ""Ha Ha!"".And then his son goes to hell. Seriously. There's a paragraph where we're in the mind of his son as he dies and I'm pretty damn certain what Brown was hinting at was Hell. (But hey, that's ok, the science of noetics has already ""proven"" in the book that the soul has weight. Seriously).Even though I was starting to cringe, I probably would've still given it a 3rd star (there's precedence: Angels and Demons got 3 stars from me even though I cringed through most of the end).But then Peter Solomon -- who, I might add, was just tortured, had his hand cut off, and watched his son who he thought was dead die -- decides that now is the perfect time to have an ""argument"" (from the Greek meaning ""I meant you to say Arrgghh"") with Robert Langdon as they go to the Washington Monument (the pyramid! the spiral staircase!). And Peter's argument is this: God is in us, we're all primed for enlightenment, the secret is in the bible (and other religious texts), we just can't read it correctly yet (look for sales of the Bible Code to spike).And here is where Dan Brown did what made me so angry. He made Langdon the unrepentant skeptic. This is a few hundred pages after Langdon (in a flashback) told his students to open their minds. Now this is typical Brown anyway: Langdon has been forced to hold the idiot stick many, many times in the three books simply for plot contrivances. At first I thought that's what he was doing here, and if he had let well enough alone I'd probably wouldn't be writing this.But the ""argument"" goes on for over 50 pages. In other words, Langdon isn't holding the idiot stick; Brown is putting the idiot stick in our hands and is beating us with it. It's not Langdon that Solomon is trying to convince. It's the reader that Brown is trying to convince. Why either Langdon or the reader should trust someone who believes that people thought the earth was flat in the middle ages is not answered.And here's the fun part: I actually agree with some of the philosophy that Brown is espousing here. But I strongly disagree with is manipulation. And there is no other word for what Brown is trying to do here. Langdon's skepticism takes a long time to be overcome, but in the end, it is overcome. Brown makes sure of that. By proxy, our own skepticism should be overcome -- we've been beaten with the idiot stick long enough we're screaming ""Yes! Yes! I believe! Just end the book already!""It's crass, it's underhanded, and it's pathetic. It's not that I expected better from Dan Brown, it's that I didn't expect it at all. He knew he'd never have an opportunity to reach a larger audience, and unwilling or incapable of subtletly he wrote a book designed to hit you with made-up facts to support a made-up philosophy.I can not in good conscience recommend this book to anyone.

28,76703666,11/04/2009,1.0,"Normally I wait until I’ve finished a book before passing judgment on it, but sixty pages into The Lost Symbol I decided that life was too short to read really terrible books.One of the things I liked best about The Da Vinci Code was that its plot unfolded in real-time: it takes place during a few very busy hours of Robert Langdon’s improbable life, in about the amount of time it takes to read the novel. This technique keeps the pace of the book exciting (there are no natural breaks in which to put the book down, because you are right there with Langdon for each plot development and puzzle solution), but also demonstrates the kind of discipline on the part of the author also shown in a really well-rhymed sonnet that commands the respect of the (or, at least, this) reader. This is the novelistic equivalent of Scribe’s well-made play (a cinematic example would be the film Arsenic and Old Lace with Cary Grant, one of my favorites).The Lost Symbol, however, is anything but disciplined. The point of view, time, and place bounce around every one or two minutes, evincing not the well-put-together thriller of The Da Vinci Code, but rather the attention span of a three-year-old. Each scene lasts about as long as a television commercial, and juxtaposed scenes have about as much connecting them as two adjacent television commercials.Another piece of sloppiness: during my brief encounter with the novel, I encountered the phrase “exact same” five times. A good friend of mine used to be in the habit of correcting anyone who dared to let that phrase pass his or her lips (because, after all, if two things really are the same, then the word “exact” is superfluous, not to mention grammatically suspect), so while I will tolerate the phrase as a spoken colloquialism, my feeling is now that only the most careless of writers would ever commit such a phrase to print.With all the doors that must be open for Dan Brown after the phenomenal success of The Da Vinci Code, how difficult could it have been for him to sit in on a lecture of a popular course at a prestigious liberal arts college? I only wonder because no college course I have ever attended proceeded anything like the one shown in one of the many (many, many) flashbacks early in the book (although, admittedly, I did not go to Harvard, but I suspect the students there would not be so easily impressed by something as shocking as (gasp!) pointing out that the Church has rituals of its own. I mean, come on, these kids are taking a course called “Occult Symbols”: what did they expect?)So I have no doubt that, if I had read the book in its entirety, everything would turn out to be not as it seemed in a shocking plot twist near the end, but, really, there are too many good books out there for me to waste my time on this one.",27,0.9852,0.079,0.794,0.128,0.4987087301587302,NEGATIVE,1.0
29,3154735842,01/23/2020,2.0,"My issue with Dan Brown’s books is that, while they create suspense and mystery and blah, blah, they don’t leave you feel satisfied with anything, other than the fact that the books features a lot of random information to show how smart the author is despite that it is a complete waste of time.This is not exactly a proper review, but more a collection of short points.The villain was the most ridiculous thing ever, and his backstory that we get makes it even more outrageous, I mean, basically it’s a guy who has had too much drugs and that’s about it.The entire plot and characters just feel ridiculous and the stuff they manage to pull out of their head is just like stop, we get you are have 200 IQ, you can stop reminding us and get on with it since it’s going to have little relevance 3 pages from now.Essentially, this book is full useless crap with unbelievable characters and equally unbelievable events. I know it’s fiction, but honestly, a big floating red eye makes more sense than this, why, because things are explained properly, not just giving out random facts, as oh yes, of course, that’s why.I actually thought this would be more thrilling, I mean, it is meant to be a thriller, right? Instead we are given loads of backstories to explain some unimportant stuff just to further emphasise how smart everyone is, or how ridiculous they are, and that’s about it. It did not flow or feel nearly as quick I has hoped it would be.I think in the end was that I really didn’t care about any of the characters or anything that was going on anyone, even the ending fell really short for me. The actual end when the villain gets defeated is some 50 pages before the books ends and the rest of the book is literally just two guys trying to over nerd each other in how much of the bible that they have memorised. I skimmed large bits of that since I wasn’t interested.I mean, ultimately, these books are not works of art, the writing is pretty standard, the characters are and plot are there, but Dan Brown does manage to keep the reader engaged in what is going on by creating enough suspense to keep them reading, whether the reader likes the content of the book or not.

The ending felt extremely anticlimactic, and overall the book dragged ass and there were whole sections where I'm pretty sure I either spaced out or could have spaced out and not noticed a thing. I figured out the BIG REVEAL before the halfway mark-- does that mean I'm getting better at guessing or is this just a shitty book? Likely both. The whole Freemasons storyline was done so much better in National Treasure (which I'm now watching in an effort to cleanse myself of this book). Okay, fine. We'll go slightly in-depth with our characters for a moment. WHY DID NO ONE CARE ABOUT TRISH?? That pissed me off. Katherine asked about her a few times and then there was no mention of her ever again, poor thing. Nice of you to pretend to care, Katherine. And speaking of pretending to care, I was astounded that Peter could give Langdon a tour of DC and be so coherent after the rediscovery and second loss of his son. Prior that... I dunno, I always think that parents have a sixth sense about their kids. That in mind, I found it extremely implausible that Peter wouldn't recognize his own son in SOME capacity until the very end. And Langdon... Langdon just comes off as pretentious and two-dimensional. Yes, he has a Mickey Mouse watch. Yes, he's extremely claustrophobic because of an incident that happened when he was a kid. Other than that, he doesn't have many defining characteristics (or else the rest get blotted out because those two things are rammed down the reader's throat CONSTANTLY).

In this latest edition to the Robert Langdon books, our favorite Mickey Mouse watch carrying college professor is invited to give a talk in DC by an old friend. When the friend goes missing (or rather, is kidnapped in a rather gruesome way), and old masonic symbols provide a path leading to his whereabouts, Langdon is forced to go on the hunt. Robert Langdon may be the king of mansplaining, but I find it so darn interesting every time he does it. This book had lots of cool stuff on masonic lore, Washington DC symbolism, the Founding Fathers, and more. At first, the level of detail slowed the storytelling and things took a little while to get going (unlike some of Brown’s other books that I thought started with a bang), however by about 30% in, things were rocking right along and the backstories once explained, made sense and really added to things.

I enjoyed DaVinci Code as well as Angels and Demons so it's not that I don't like this style of book, but it seems almost as if this particular book has no real defined style.

34,2797423794,04/26/2019,2.0,"At some point early on while reading The Lost Symbol by Dan Brown I committed myself to finishing the book no matter what. Sometimes I find myself abandoning a couple of books in a row and it feels like that calls for actually dedicating myself to reading all the way to the end of the next one. That was probably a mistake here as I didn't enjoy The Lost Symbol at all.Dan Brown gets a lot of flack for his writing, with many people dismissing his prose and characters. Having finally read The Da Vinci Code a while back I really didn't think this was fair. Not every protagonist needs to have tremendous richness and depth for a story to work; sometimes it's nice just to have a character you generally like and follow them through a complex plot. However with The Lost Symbol, the characterization wasn't so much flat as non-existent. Each one reads as if they exist only to funnel exposition through their mouths – often almost identical exposition. I couldn't really tell you the difference between Robert Langdon's knowledge in this book and that of his friend Solomon, the antagonist, the CIA leader, or just about anyone else. They spout a lot of ""As you know, Robert . . ."" followed by whatever piece of lore about some building in Washington DC that the author wants you to know. Motivations are assigned to characters, but never really seem to motivate them in genuine ways. Their personalities are so transient as to feel like afterthoughts in their lines of dialogue.Speaking of dialogue, there's a ton of it in this book, which would be fine if anyone ever said anything. Again, the never-ending exposition is like watching people take turns reading out Wikipedia entries. This is distinctly different to me than in The Da Vinci Code, which is a story in which tons of interesting semi-historical factoids help move the plot along. In The Lost Symbol, the plot seems to exist solely to provide a vehicle for a long series of semi-historical factoids, and in that difference lies the experience of reading a thriller novel versus listening to the world's longest book report.I hear a lot of thriller authors and fans dismiss traditional forms of literary critique on the grounds that reviewers ""don't get it"" – that what ""real"" people want is exciting, fast-paced stories. I'm on board with fast-paced, fun stories, regardless of whether they resonate with me as being deep and meaningful by the end. But The Lost Symbol isn't fast-paced at all. It's actually exceedingly slow, relying on two cheap devices to create the illusion of pace.First, incredibly long scenes are simply broken up into five or ten segments with other chapters stuck in between. This is a film editor's trick, and it just doesn't work here. You can only keep coming back to the exact same conversation with Langdon in the foyer of whatever building it was, staring at the same chopped-off hand and plodding out even more details of Washington masonic sites before you feel like you're stuck at the airport carousels waiting endlessly for your luggage to finally tumble down the conveyor so you can get the hell out of there.The second device – and this one really drove me nuts by the end – was finishing dull, incomplete scenes with: ""And then Robert saw what she was pointing at, and it changed everything."" or ""And then she told him the phrase, and he knew he'd been wrong about everything,"" or ""And then he looked at the picture, and realized they'd been wrong all along."" In a better book these might have been cliffhangers, but cliffhangers depend on a sense of meaningful jeopardy, and there just wasn't any in The Lost Symbol for me.Of course, a reader has to take responsibility for their own experience and enjoyment of reading a book, and there's really no excuse for me to have forced my way through this tome just so I could come out the other side and complain about it. However much I felt personally like I needed to stop abandoning books that weren't resonating for me, that stops making sense when the end result is turning what should be an illuminating – or at least mildly pleasant – experience into self-inflicted torture. However I've noticed something lately, and it's really confounding me: famous, mega-selling authors whose earlier novels were genuinely good, putting out books that seem to me to be so objectively bad that I can't imagine it's just a personal opinion. I honestly can't envision Dan Brown looking at this book and saying it represents his talents as a writer. I've found this with James Patterson and John Grisham as well – both authors who, while it's common practice these days to dismiss them as formulaic – nonetheless have really strong work in their pasts that makes me not understand why their recent books are so bad.Even if you accept the notion of pushing a formulaic, tried-and-true plot, that doesn't explain to me why elements of the craft which these writers have shown tremendous skill at in the past are suddenly absent. And before someone tells me its because they secretly use ghostwriters, I don't believe that for two reasons: first, Patterson credits those authors who work on his books, and second, if you're a multi-million selling author who's going to hire a ghost writer, you'd at least hire someone who could write to your standard.So, given how abysmal I found this book, why two stars instead of one or zero? Simply because I try to review books by taking the higher score of either how I personally enjoyed it or how I think someone for whom the book is targeted might enjoy it. Those who love the interesting details that connect famous Washington sites with masonic lore will have an interesting travel itinerary thoroughly researched and laid out for them. Had there also been even a spark of decent characterization and storytelling to go along with it, I've no doubt I would've enjoyed The Lost Symbol much more.",22,0.9759,0.094,0.788,0.118,0.468147294760198,NEGATIVE,0.9999

36,72041629,09/21/2009,3.0,"Ah yes, the new Dan Brown book, the most anticipated title in the publishing world this year. The one that everyone is loving to hate, because there's no better way to prove your superiority to your peers by talking about how you're just too intelligent to enjoy this crap because you're so much better than the unwashed masses. For the record, I have dated two guys who have rattled off that bit of idiocy. Two! It's almost cruel (and for the record, they were really not all that).But more importantly, the book. If I lived on a desert island and someone handed this to me and told me that it had single-handedly saved the publishing industry during this current economic downturn, would I have believed them? Probably not. It's like The DaVinci Code set in DC, and therein lies the problem. Brown is a bit like M. Night Shyamalan, where his popularity was established by That One Thing He Did Well, except until he seemingly felt obligated to repeat it several times even when, creatively speaking, he'd probably write something more interesting if he allowed himself to do something different.Or, maybe he's more comparable to my beloved Preston/Child writing duo, who have locked themselves into only writing books about a fan-favorite character even though, again, some variety might rejuvenate them.Angels & Demons, the first Robert Langdon book, remains the high point in the series. At that point in time, Brown understood pacing. He understood how to move the story forward with exciting action while at the same time educating us about everything he had found in his research. It felt like a story. The DaVinci code lost a little of that and became more about the research and information, which led to my puzzlement over it being turned into a movie before A&D. And now, The Lost Symbol has completed the journey to the ""all information, no story"" side of the spectrum. It took me a week out of the 2 weeks the library is permitting me to have this book to get more than 150 pages in. The whole time I was reading, I kept thinking one word: ""INFODUMP.""It's like Brown felt a bit of pressure to make sure he told us as much information as he could vomit up. Sure, the Freemasons are a pretty good choice for a secret-filled topic, and the National Treasure movies certainly showed us that DC is full of the symbols that Brown and Langdon specialize in. But it's not balanced, and to back up this opinion, I present the fact that it takes nearly 150 pages to move the action forward from the initial, ""Oh my god, there is a severed hand in the middle of the Capitol's rotunda."" Trust me, if I found a severed hand, I would not be standing still for 150 pages.It was still interesting and a little fun, and the latter half of the book went a lot faster than the first half, and even though the plot twist at the end was predictable, I give Brown props for finally having a villain who ISN'T the mentor/person of authority. I also liked the throwback to A&D's discussion about science vs. religion and how they're entwined rather than opposing schools of thought.My advice to Brown now that he's done his duty and saved the publishing industry from the poorhouse - write something different. I know, your publisher would throw a total shitfit if you said you were retiring Mr. Langdon. You stopped being a person whose creativity is important back when The DaVinci Code hit the top of the best seller's list. You're a moneymaker, plain and simple, and they're gonna milk you until you're dry. I hope you get to write what you want next, and that it's not about symbols. It was fun learning about the NSA in Digital Fortress (you know, back before 9/11 and the Patriot Act made the agency a household name).

40,74266983,10/12/2009,1.0,"I changed my rating. Originally I gave it an ""Ok"" with 2 stars because I sort of thought that it served its purpose as a page-turner. Though even within the credit for that, I thought it also should have been about 200 pages shorter. Perhaps Robert Langdon's overly long explanations could have been about 50% reduced to help out with that aspect. But now I think, I remember having to force myself to get back into the book. And feeling like I was getting bored and skimming pages. And the ending is so bad it almost cancels out everything else that was even mildly enjoyable.But anyway, here are my issues with the book. When I was about 100 pages in, I thought to myself, I cannot believe the similarities to DaVinci Code. Obviously we have Langdon again, but that's not an issue to reuse the same character. What is an issue is that there is again one single, male, psychotically evil and gruesome villain. There is also an authority figure with questionable motives. There is also a beloved old friend in trouble (DaVinci it was the murdered guy at the beginning, here it's Peter Solomon). There is also the very intelligent female companion. I was surprised Bellamy didn't turn out to be a bad guy since he is the older expert helping them along for a time. These character similarities urked me from the beginning, but I will admit I did get into the story eventually.However, once I was into it, I did find myself a good few times being taken out of the story due to the unbelievability of things, especially towards the end. And I'm not talking about problems with the science or the action of the plot, but believability of emotion. After all the madness of the big climax of the story (which I do admit I did not see coming - the big reveal), which is obviously a crazily emotional and draining experience for the Solomons, I could not believe that they immediately snapped back into their previous selves. It felt to me like Brown wrote the big climax, then took a two week break and came back to writing, so that all of the emotion of the climax/finale was forgotten. Suddenly Katharine is skipping off to go check out something interesting Peter wants her to see. And Peter is beckoning Robert to his office to have an intellectual, winking, story-telling moment and trip around DC. What? Didn't you just spend about 2 days getting tortured? Didn't you just almost have to murder a very important person? Didn't you, about an hour ago, believe you were about to be murdered?? Oh, but now you want to talk about how interesting history is again? I mean, I thought it was ludicrous. And that Katharine is willing to hop off and indulge Peter's suggestion instead of saying, ""ummm...how about we check that out in a couple of days? For now we should possibly both take a trip to the hospital."" I felt like the end was weak enough to cancel out the fun of a lot of the rest of the story. And the amount of background characters give when they're supposed to be in a stressful, 'let's get a move on!' situation was really frustrating throughout. Like when they're with the priest and he's sitting there all amused with their ponderings, like absolutely every single intellectual character is written by Brown. Every one of them is given a moment where they smile as they wait and see if their companion, who they are having a teaching moment with, can figure out what they're thinking. The priest does it, Peter Solomon does it, and lord knows Langdon does it. I get it. They are intellectuals and love this stuff. But they're not sitting in a classroom. They are on the run from the CIA and have less than a few hours to save the life of a friend. Just unbelievable. ",20,0.9484,0.107,0.754,0.14,0.4828679653679653,NEGATIVE,1.0
41,79626688,12/02/2009,1.0,"Ugh this was literally one of the worst books I have ever read. Or, well, listened to, as Chris and I used it to get through 2 legs of a drive from NYC to St. Louis.Just to be clear, though I'm a stickler for good writing, I recognize that previous Dan Brown books like the Davinci Code are what they are. That is, they are good stories, badly written. And that's fine - there is a place for that - like 19 hour car rides. Unfortunately, the Lost Symbol was a terrible story, terribly written. Brown's prose has sunk deep into the depths of cliche and tired literary tropes - deeper than I thought he or his editors would dare go. What's worse, his dialogue is so hackneyed, grammatically flawed, and frankly stupid that you come to hate - literally hate - all of his characters. When one major character is presumed dead about 2/3 of the way through the book, I cheered. ""Drown, [name:], Drown,"" because I had come to despise that idiotic buffoon of a protagonist so much. The book was barely edited, with repetitive passages everywhere. If there is any one thing worse than suffering through Dan Brown's crap exposition once - it's suffering through it three times in a book because Brown's editors are too smug and lazy to edit this hack's writing. Storywise, too, the Lost Symbol bordered on pathetic. First of all, TLS is just a watered down retread of the Davinci Code reset in Washington DC. I was actually insulted by how thinly veiled this was. Do we have an American Sophie? Yes. A Sauniere? Yes. A police inspector who is somehow connected to the unfolding events? Yes. A psychotic killer? Um, hell yes. And it was this last character - the psycho, here named Mala'kh - that really ruined the book for me. Because unlike in Angels and Demons and in the Davinci Code, this villain was just a serial killer. Just a psycho. Not motivated by anything particularly meaningful except his bloodlust and desire for power. After sitting through HOURS of listening to this guy torture people, I wondered whether I was reading a Dan Brown thriller or a crappy knock-off of Silence of the Lambs. The fact that Brown had to resort to hours and hours of sadistic serial killer content shows just how flimsy his storyline is.And flimsy it was. Brown's whole plotline was filled with holes and deus ex machinas. To make his implausible, illogical storyline work, he had to make his characters into idiots who failed to see the most obvious facts in front of their faces. The ending is not a thoughtful surprise, but rather a massive, laughable letdown. Consider your worst case scenario of how you will feel at the end of the Lost series: that will be your reaction to the end of this book. Most of this book read like a badly written lecture from a cocky, second-rate professor from the University of Phoenix. Actually, I think that's more of an insult to the University of Phoenix.

43,1649226797,05/25/2016,1.0,"I like Dan Brown and his books. Now that's out of the way, I can go on and explain why this book is terrible!Plot in brief: Robert Langdon is called away to Washington and once he reaches there, realises his friend, Peter Solomon, is in trouble. Peter's sister, Katherine, is in danger as well. The CIA aka Inoue Sato quickly takes over the investigations. There is a super villain too. And it all ends in lots of rambling and blathering. The plot is incoherent. Well, actually, there is no plot. I finished reading the book and if you ask me what it was about, I can only give a vague answer. It's about some vague Masonic secret knowledge that must be protected but apparently everyone already knows it though they don't know they know it. Well, doh! This secret knowledge is something that must not be shared with the common masses, because we don't know how to handle it. Sounds familiar? This is what every religion has done, limiting knowledge and power to a few men. What's so special about the Masonic bullshit? It's the same as every other bullshit out there. I am all for all knowledge being accessible to everyone, so this did not resonate with me. Pseudoscience is given full reign in here, and treated as pushing all frontiers of knowledge. Stuff like how human soul can be weighed and that humans can do things with their mere thoughts, and so on. Katherine Solomon has actually wasted several years of her life in researching this nonsense and now she has 'scientifically' proved this. This aspect was enraging me on every page.The 'national security threat' was one of the most stupid things I have ever encountered. Sato acts like the entire US of A is going to be blown up by some madman, but in the end it is just much ado about nothing. The only threat is the madman sending off a video of a few powerful men in the government practising scary Masonic rituals. OMG! What if the leaders of Russia and the Islamic world were to see the video? Who the fuck cares? So these men might have to resign because of PUBLIC pressure, you know, the people they are there to represent in the first place? It's hardly a 'national security threat'. There is so much repetition of the same things over and over again that my eyes glazed over and I began to just skim. Langdon just goes on and on and on about symbols and symbolisms and codes and ciphers. He just doesn't solve the puzzle; he gives an entire lecture each time he solves something. It got old fast. I am still not sure what the Ancient Mysteries are. He keeps blathering that ancient Egyptians, ancient Indians, original Christians, Muslims, and so on, all were on to the same 'Ancient Mysteries'. Well, no. First, because you have not defined what this thing actually is, and second, all these cultures had their own traditions and knowledge they have gathered over years. Some knowledge was shared, some were kept secret. Some knowledge helped in progress, while some stagnated the culture. It was not the 'same'.And then, there is the villain. He wants to gather the knowledge for himself and attain nirvana, or whatever he calls it. What's so wrong with that, you ask? Maybe the small fact that he is trying to kill several people for this. But of course, no one seems to give a shit about this. Including the CIA Director, who seems more worried about preventing a scandal than people actually being murdered! The ultimate lesson seems to be that the Bible can teach us more than we thought. I doubt it. I have no problem with a plot that claims that religion can help you with certain things, if these things have been specified and discussed. But I am not buying some vague bullshit about how knowledgeable religion is and new age nonsense, all covered with ritualistic crap of Masonry. If you want me to believe some aspects of religion are beneficial, then please specify what these benefits are. Don't give me some vague crap like The Bible, like many ancient texts, is a detailed exposition of the most sophisticated machine ever created . . . the human mind. Incredibly, science has yet to scratch the surface of the mind’s full promise. Ummm, no? So in summary, what does the book say? The Bible already has all the knowledge we would ever need. Science is bullshit because it is only proving what the priests have already determined. This knowledge must also be kept away from the masses because they cannot be trusted with it. Right, folks.

48,2925837784,08/08/2019,4.0,"The Lost Symbol is the third book in the Robert Langdon series written by Dan Brown and centered on Robert Langdon, a professor of art history and symbology at Harvard.Robert Langdon comes to Washington D.C. to give a lecture at the behest of his old mentor, Peter Solomon. When he arrives at the U.S. Capitol for his lecture, he finds, instead of an audience, Peter's severed hand mounted on a wooden base, fingers pointing skyward to the Rotunda ceiling fresco of George Washington dressed in white robes, ascending to heaven.Langdon teases out a plethora of clues from the tattooed hand that point toward a secret portal through which an intrepid seeker will find the wisdom known as the Ancient Mysteries, or the lost wisdom of the ages.A villain known as Mal'akh, a steroid-swollen, fantastically tattooed, muscle-bodied madman, wants to locate the wisdom so he can rule the world. Mal'akh has captured Peter and promises to kill him if Langdon doesn't agree to help find the portal. Joining Langdon in his search is Peter's younger sister, Kathleen Solomon, who has been conducting experiments in a secret museum.This is just the kickoff for a deadly chase that careens back and forth, across, above and below the nation's capital, darting from revelation to revelation, pausing only to explain some piece of wondrous, historical esoterica.The Lost Symbol is written rather well. Brown sets an explosive pace as Langdon and Solomon race through Washington D.C. to solve a mystery and outwit a villain, who is after the secrets of the Freemasonry. The narrative is an exhaustively researched page-turner about secret societies and the history of the creation of the most powerful nation.All in all, The Lost Symbol is written rather well and is a wonderful continuation to what would hopefully be a wonderful series, which I plan to continue in the very near future.",16,0.8728,0.093,0.785,0.122,0.4307142857142857,POSITIVE,0.9998

52,77846447,11/15/2009,3.0,"My review from http://grahamchops.blogspot.com/2009/...You've been hearing a lot about this book. I know this because, as we've established, you have an Internet connection, which means you live near civilization, or at least somewhere that people are saying things. If not, well...ugh, I don't have anything witty to say.I liked this book. I'm kind of pissed at the critics who had their reviews written before it even came out (or before they even read it), jumping on the ""I Hate Dan Brown"" bandwagon. Then there are the people who call him a bigot or an anti-Christ or whatever they want to make up. Usually these are people who read The Da Vinci Code and had their Christian belief system challenged for the first time in their lives, and somehow thought that complaining about it would do damage to Mr. Brown.Well, it didn't, and those people are kind of foolish. The best way to give notoriety to something is to make it controversial. If you don't believe me, check out the sales of all the books that people have tried to ban from public schools, starting with obscure titles like The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.Anyway, to the actual book: it was well-done. It was still a signature Dan Brown novel in the sense that some of the writing was outright crap, meaning either Brown still hasn't proofed his own writing, or his editors are just thinking ""Why should I try? It's got Brown's name on it. It'll sell."" I got kind of tired of him saying his own characters' names over and over again--first and last together.""Kathleen Solomon did this, and then Kathleen Solomon thought about something else. Like Robert Langdon. Meanwhile, Robert Langdon was walking down the hallway. Robert Langdon looked down at Robert Langdon's watch.""Seriously Dan, it's okay to use words like ""he"" and ""she"" once in a while. Also, we know there's only one Robert you'll ever be referring to. It's cool, man.In comparing this book to the other two Langdon novels, I'd say it's better than Da Vinci Code and tied with Angels & Demons. A&D remains his smartest book, whereas The Lost Symbol is going to make the best movie. I think the villain in this one was extremely well-motivated. He probably won't have the ""shock value"" of the A&D villain, at least not when you find out who he is, but his actions throughout the book made you really hate him. Like, you want a bus to just completely run him over. That's the mark of a well-done villain.The plot centers on the society called the Freemasons and a secret they carry. Supposedly it's the key to ""apotheosis"", or becoming a god. The villain wants to know the secret, and he tricks Robert Langdon into figuring it out for him--or at least, he tries to force Langdon to find what he needs. From the big shocking intro, you have a few things that are trademark Dan Brown: long intros of important characters with backstories, a brutally long and drawn-out drowning scene, a few chases, and lots of flashbacks into previous lectures Langdon has given as a Harvard professor.Still, in this story, Langdon has to get his hands dirty, and he goes through a lot more physically than he did in the other books. It takes place in Washington DC, making this the second Dan Brown book to do so (the other being Deception Point--still my favorite). It shouldn't surprise me that his two best books take place in America :-)All patriotism aside, I am pleased with the outcome of this book, and for one major reason: it actually has meaning. Da Vinci had some controversial application, but was ultimately fiction; A&D supposedly stoked the coals of the science-versus-religion argument, but most (if not all) of the religious people I know have no problem with science and its pursuit.Lost Symbol, on the other hand, has a really great message about religious tolerance, and opening one's mind up to exploring the existence of God. It's not in the form of heavy-handed lecturing from the all-knowing Langdon, either; Langdon himself finally has to confront his own atheism, which is nice to see. Brown pulls him out of the role of a static character, and Langdon does some nice self-evaluation.When he does argue, he does it in defense of the Freemasons--a society whose purpose and practices are grossly misunderstood by the masses. When characters in the book refer to the Masons as a cult, or as satists, Langdon forces them to back up their claims and not be so judgmental--after all, the practices and tenets of nearly all religions can be made to sound cultish and sinister if told with the right slant or bias (a point which the Langdon character handily illustrates in a flashback scene).I could go on and on about that, but the point is, this book (despite its technical flaws) was better than I expected, and I'm glad Brown's main character had to learn something for once. It helped the reader to really learn something as well.If you liked his other books, you'll be more than satisfied with this one I think.Oh! And funny side note: he takes a pot shot at his own book Digital Fortress in Lost Symbol. It was rather comical. If you've read DF, you'll know it when you see it.

I base these thriller/historical fiction/religious suspense books on the experience of reading them. In high school, history WAS my favorite subject. In college, my favorite class of all was my World Religions course. The history of belief systems and symbology and religion is and has always been fascinating to me. So it stands to reason that this book would interest and entertain me. I like Robert Langdon as a character. Not a typical, macho superhero type, but someone who uses his intellect and quick thinking to save the world over and over. Some people complain about the leading lady always changing, but it's fiction people, just enjoy the ride. As far as female characters go, I liked Katherine Solomon. The ""twist"" at the end of the story wasn't super shocking because I had already guessed that, but it was nice to know we were on the same page. Haha. Are the characters' abilities to save the world every time realistic? Nah. Are there historical facts and ideas that are manipulated to fit in with the plot of this story? Quite probably. I'm sure Brown researches a lot of stuff and tries to keep it as accurate as possible, but its gotta all fit together somehow. But is it entertaining, does it make you question your beliefs (and by questioning, I mean, just consider them and therefore experience spiritual growth)? For me, yes. I always like reading things about other people's beliefs, religious history, etc. AND...I think that this movie will be better than ANGELS & DEMONS. :) It's a fiction book people.

Buy it, read it, like it – you know you will. And I did.Good old Professor Robert Langdon, a renowned symbologist, is at home in Boston, looking forward to doing what he likes doing: teaching, reading, writing etc., and then bango! He gets a call from an old friend to fly down to Washington DC to deliver a lecture; he also receives a mysterious small box, closed with a wax seal, and is told NOT to open it. Well he doesn’t, as Langdon is one of those kinds of people you can trust, but once in Washington, he becomes rapidly – very rapidly! – involved in a complex mystery involving the Masons and the secrets that only they know. Did I say rapidly? The events in Mr. Brown’s books all take place at breakneck speed. Langdon’s on a plane, then in a cab, then he’s running across a plaza, or into and then out of a museum, library, historic monument, Masonic temple – you name it, it’s there. (I do think Mr. Brown has a sort of fascination for conveyances, both the ordinary normal kind like a truck or taxi – as well as the strange, like a conveyor belt used for transporting materials from one huge library building to the next.) But first stop for Langdon is the US Capital building where all seems normal – except for the severed hand pointing up at the ceiling in the massive rotunda! Yikes! You know you’re in for a fascinating, complex, symbol-laden story ahead. With a creepy villain, and even-creepier higher up officials who are supposed to be on OUR side. Yes, this book has it all…And with Langdon pausing – often in the midst of death-defying encounters – to explain to other characters, or to us, what this symbol or that statue or that painting means or signifies or its all-so-important historical context. (And by the way all the buildings, locations, paintings, statues, plazas and so on, interminably, are real buildings, locations, paintings, statues, etc. etc.)As for the huge Masonic secret at the heart of this book? I don’t know if that’s real or not, but as the granddaughter of a Mason (and Shriner), I know a little about the Masons. (I was also, briefly, a Rainbow girl but dropped out when meetings conflicted with my favorite show at the time, the original Star Trek series.

76,104640457,05/28/2010,1.0,"Sitting on a tropical island in the middle of the Pacific, I found this book on a communal shelf in the resort and thought, ""Books like this are made for beach reading. In spite of the fact that Dan Brown is a no-talent, amateur hack, whose previous novels were seemingly typed out by a crew of rabid monkeys working in shifts, I've been to D.C. frequently enough that this novel might even be remotely interesting enough to pass the time away while improving my Vitamin D count.""I couldn't have been more wrong. I could go on at length about the dreadfulness that was this novel, but let me try to keep this somewhat succinct through the careful use of bullet points:
Things I learned while reading Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol
1. Dan Brown continues to be a no-talent, amateur hack. Only somehow, he's managed to become more of one. Seriously, making your chapters three pages in length (max--I was literally up to Chapter 151 by the end of the book) and ending each chapter with a ""stunning"" cliffhanger does not an enjoyable thriller make. And let's take a second to remind ourselves that sentence structure and design is key. It's OK to use big words or write a sentence that's longer than 10 words. If you ran this through the Word Count function in MS Word, it would give you a reading level of somewhere close to the 3rd Grade. I think I'm being generous with that estimation...Also, adverbs ceased being a useful literary device when I was reading things like Superfudge. Having your bad guy say something ""icily"" makes him a) a moody jerk, b) a cliché, c) not frightening at all, and d) like every other bad guy in every Dan Brown novel ever.While we're talking about Dan Brown villains, let's go to...2. Why are Dan Brown villains always naked all the time? Every single villain from his last three novels (the only ones I've read) love to get naked. By themselves. And they all have supremely sculpted bodies they stare at in the mirror and think things like, ""I am perfection. Never before has something as awesome as me been created. If I could, I'd sleep with myself."" There's really no point to any of this. The only thing I can think of is that Dan Brown thinks that making his villains superficially creepy somehow makes them more evil. What it actually makes them, though, is hackneyed. (See number 1)3. Robert Langdon is the lamest hero of all time. I mean, he's a Harvard professor who wears tweed and a turtleneck. He whines his way through the novel. Brown tries to make him the reluctant hero, but mostly he's just a figure in place who occasionally offers information to the plot. In fact, in this novel, he literally does nothing. He just happens to be along for the ride. No heroics, no great revelations. He simply pieces together trivia piece after trivia piece and others do all the work. And Brown conveniently adds little things to Langdon's profile. He is always conveniently intimately connected to whomever is involved in the plot. (This man has more best friends in high places than I have acquaintances on Facebook.) He also is conveniently blessed with an incredible knowledge of things he admits are not his field of study. For example, The Lost Symbol is about Freemasonry. Langdon is a symbologist. So I'll willingly believe that he has a knowledge of the symbols involved with Masonic rites, but Langdon knows enough to give a clinic on this topic. Architecture? Check. Art History? Check. Numerology? Check. Hell, you could probably show him a star chart or the schematics for the Large Hadron Collider and he'd know what to do with it.And then there are some things that are downright silly. At one point, a de facto sidekick for Langdon (also a close personal friend) turns to him and asks, ""You have an eidetic memory, right?"" Of course he does. He remembers every number he's ever seen. So what does he use it for? He recalls a phone number. A FREAKING PHONE NUMBER! 4. Dan Brown thinks you're an idiot. No, he really does. This novel's supposed to be a mystery/thriller, right? Well guess what? There's no mystery! (The thriller part's debatable, too.) Every tiny little detail is spelled out for you as though you're new to planet earth and have only the equivalent of a First Grade education. Didn't know there was a pyramid on the back of the $1 bill? Well sit down for a second and let me tell you all about it. Racing against the clock in an effort to save the life of your mentor? (Who hasn't been there?) Let's take a breather, so we can talk about common misconceptions attributed to Freemasonry and how they loosely apply to the plot. (What's a plot?) Had a cliffhanger at the end of the last chapter that showed the villain doing something vaguely sinister? Don't worry, the very next chapter will start with an exhaustive explanation of what, exactly, that sinister action was, leaving no doubt as to how it will impact other actions in the storyline. In short, if you don't know what's going on in the book, and you can't anticipate how everything's going to wrap up, you're a moron.5. The big reveal is there's no big reveal. I guess I'll take a moment to point out that I'm technically going to discuss 
spoilers
. So the whole novel is this roundabout search for the great Masonic secret. The great truth that will grant ultimate knowledge. No one can be trusted with the awesome and mighty power of this knowledge because it is simply too dangerous. The world's going to end. Cats and dogs will live together. Blah, blah, blah. You know what the big secret is? That God is love. I'm not kidding. Let that sink in for a bit. I'm a little surprised that Brown even felt comfortable enough to put that in to novel because it's so dangerous. We'll probably have riots in the streets! So, the whole novel is spent trying to keep the bad guy away from obtaining this secret (people literally die and lose limbs in protecting this), when it's something we've all heard in any respectable Sunday School class. This isn't a secret. This is an axiom.So what was the point? There is no point. The point is, Dan Brown gots to get paid, son! Blah, blah, blah Masonry. Yadda yadda creepy ritual. And badda bing badda boom, lame ending designed to make us say, ""Ooooooh, I get it!"" The long and short of it? Re-read point 4 and apply it to the real world, not just the novel's plot line. Dan Brown was counting on billions of dollars to come streaming in from his readers no matter what he wrote, and he got it.In the end, when I was done with this book (It only took a day to race through it.), I was contemplating hurling this wretched thing into the ocean, so it wouldn't get inflicted on anyone else. Ultimately, I did what was only right and placed it back on the communal shelf, hiding it behind some dog-eared paperbacks and hoping against hope that no one would ever notice it.",9,0.9254,0.131,0.728,0.141,0.5199098361277847,NEGATIVE,0.9986
77,424815855,09/30/2012,2.0,"Review as in Aura of Sleepless DreamsSo then let's start at the beginning. The fact that I got hold of this book on the very day it released worldwide and yet managed to finish reading it only about 2 weeks after, is nothing short of an odd event. That's because if a book manages to capture my interest I usually devour it within a single day(at the most 2 days) no matter how lengthy it might be. But unfortunately I read The Lost Symbol over a span of 2 weeks. This probably speaks volumes of how unimpressed I'm with Dan Brown this time.Anyway without digressing any further let's come to the plot-To tell you the truth this novel has no actual plot because it had no aim from the very beginning.So what does this book have then?The answer consists of - Robert Langdon, his long time friend and mentor Peter Solomon who's in mortal danger, a deluded lunatic as the bad guy (just like always), Peter Solomon's beautiful sister as Langdon's companion for the night who's conducting some highly important research work on Noetic Sciences (just another replacement for Vittoria Vetra or Sophie Neveu), Freemasons, the CIA and of course an all-too-familiar routine of figuring out hidden codes, symbols, puzzles so as to thwart the villain's plans and save the world from disaster before it's too late.Okay that's all good. But what is Robert Langdon doing here? - Half the time he is arguing quite uselessly with the other characters saying he doesn't believe in an ancient Masonic legend, around which the entire plot revolves.I think a man who had discovered Mary Magdalene's tomb in his earlier adventure should have a more broad-minded perspective than that. The time he spends deciphering few codes spans only 15-20 pages of the 339 page book(e-book). The rest of it is filled with too much information about the Masons, Solomon family stories and the warped thoughts of the psychopath villain.Even though Angels and Demons had quite a far-fetched plot it never failed to make the reader gasp. At least it had some edge-of-the-seat suspense to offer. Also the age-old animosity between the Illuminati and the Church provided quite an intriguing backdrop.Same with The Da Vinci Code. The controversy surrounding the Holy Grail, Mary Magdalene and the Merovingians was spicy enough to keep the reader enthralled till the very end.But the Masons are not that interesting.On one hand they are an ancient brotherhood dedicated to searching for light (symbolizing supreme knowledge) amidst darkness and on the other hand they're protecting an ancient wisdom for centuries which supposedly has the power to bring about man's ultimate enlightenment.Contradictory isn't it?And why keep something secret that is supposed to benefit mankind?Uh yea right 'cause it might fall into the wrong hands and result in disasters of unimaginable proportions.As if the world isn't already in chaos and on the verge of destruction. We could sure do with some ultimate knowledge (or whatever) in these troubled times.Unlike his previous adventures Langdon does not make a startling discovery at the very end. Nobody gets to know what the Ancient Mysteries actually are. Brown only provides us with a brief overview which is not enough. And this is where the readers are bound to feel disappointed.I think maybe it's time to put Robert Langdon to rest. We've had enough of religious symbology, secret societies and historical controversies unless Dan Brown has the courage to shun his formulaic-plot-weaving habit and offer us a new concoction but with the same ingredients.",9,0.6093,0.063,0.866,0.071,0.5056382001836547,NEGATIVE,0.9998
78,998265671,07/16/2014,4.0,"Most readers I know hated this book and I felt the need to give it the justice it deserved with a short review. Noted problems with this book:The prize at the bottom of the cereal box wasn't awesome. The bad guy wasn't really a bad guy. Noetics isn't really a science. The Masons don't own secret biblical knife sets. With that said, this book, from an historical point of view, brought a lot of important information to the general public Masonic lore & life and took us on an incredibly tour or District of Columbian art and architecture. The Solomon family is one of the more interesting archetypal rich families I've seen in modern literature and Peter's transparency is his most favorable trait. His introductory lecture was not only inspiring but brilliantly written. His relationship with his son was tragic and, yet, his love for his family was second to none. After nearly dying at the end of the book, he wants nothing more than a happy embrace with his sister, and Robert, before sending both of them on a revealing sunrise serenade. Robert is his usual self in this novel, wearing his tweed jacket and dropping (sometimes awkward) historical/symbolic facts all over the place. A lot of people have been critical of some of Robert's quirky monologues, but I find them refreshing. He's an interesting character, let it roll. The Pod, a storage space for surplus museum artifacts, was an interesting space for a secret science lab, but I do agree that it's kinda weird they didn't go into it with flashlights. I really wish the field of noetics was more grounded in scientific fact because, as Brown narrates it, it's an awesome discourse. The bad guy in the story, a fanatic obsessed with the concept of the Ancient Mysteries, is an interesting antagonist but his plight was predictable throughout most of the story. Despite that, I was still surprised how Brown reunited him with his destined protagonist and I found myself turning back hundreds of pages to put little bits of information back together to form the conclusion for myself. All in all, this book can't touch DVC or Inferno, but it's still a good novel. It's been apparently voted ""the worst novel ever written"" on some online poll, but I can't even begin to believe that.

At first, it is a rather fascinating and intriguing experience; after a while, though, you realize you’re just looking at a dirty bird with a big tail showing off. For years now, I’ve always said that Dan Brown is a horrible writer, but a great storyteller. His newest book proves me wrong. “The Lost Symbol” is not only horribly written, but also horribly told. Sure, there are some wonderfully captivating moments of suspense and some incredibly interesting tidbits about freemasonry, symbology, art, and architecture. However, those moments are few and far between, virtually lost in long-winded diatribes, predictable plot reversals, and ridiculous cliffhangers at the end of EVERY two-page chapter. I’m sorry to come down so hard on this book because slamming Dan Brown is not only en vogue, but also too easy. I have to be honest in my reviews, though. And, in all honesty, this is a mediocre book with a terrible denouement, written by a man who doesn’t story tell so much as he story cheats.

He has also been accused of plagiarism and of having a very bland and formulaic writing style.His new book, The Lost Symbol, uses the same main character as The Da Vinci Code, and has a similar claim on the inside front cover. ""All rituals, science, artwork and monuments in this novel are real"". How my heart sank when a friend asked me to read it; surely, it was bound to be another ponderous, badly-written piece of airport fiction larded with misconceptions and sloppy research worthy of a child?Well, yes and no. Brown has visibly put a lot of work into developing his writing style, and it shows. Characterization, while basic, has moved beyond non-existent here. The plot is well-thought-out and makes this a page-turner, far more than any of his other works. There are some genuinely clever twists. I loved the tiny Japanese CIA internal security operative, and the trick with drowning someone in oxygenated fluorocarbons was effective and sounded plausible, though I admit I haven't researched it.This book shows real growth from his really low points like Deception Point, hence my three stars.Unfortunately, we still have the same problems which have dogged Brown's artistic development from the beginning, and for which there is little hope of a cure. The prose is clunky; although better than before, there are long stretches that read like Wikipedia articles - dry and ponderous. (Wikipedia is mentioned several times in the book and I kept wondering if Brown has ever read the article there called Inaccuracies in The Da Vinci Code?) While the plot is genuinely clever, it relies too heavily on tricks and code-breaking. The motivation of several key characters is tricky to fathom, and the ending seems highly implausible, although strangely satisfying. This is the closest we get to art in this book.Worst of all, Brown fails to even try to live up to the commitment he voluntarily makes at the start of the book. Far from being ""real"", key plot devices like the one-dimensional lady scientist's ""holographic disk drives"", ""enriched plutonium"", and her field of research (""noetic science"") are fictional. Bunsen burner fuel is normally a gas like natural gas, not a liquid. Pulling back on the stick (actually called the ""cyclic"") of a helicopter won't arrest a descent but instead make it fly backwards. And so on, and so on.There's nothing wrong with speculative fiction, of course - but I question why he would make such a statement and then not live up to it. And these inaccuracies in areas I know about, call into question my suspension of disbelief in the other areas of the novel. Brown said in one of his plagiarism cases (which, to be fair, he won) that his wife does all his research for him. Maybe he should consider doing some himself or hiring someone to do a better job. Of course, other than personal integrity (clearly not a priority for Brown), why should he, when his books are such a commercial success under the current formula?",8,0.9978,0.055,0.773,0.172,0.4848054070112893,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Once there, in the Rotunda of the Capitol, is found his friend’s dismembered hand. The chase is on; Robert Langdon and his friend’s sister, against an unknown villain and members of the CIA. I could go on and on about how bad I thought this book was. The bad guy was way over the top, Langdon seemed flat, and the women were too stupid to live. The geography of Washington had errors. Yes, some of the information on the Freemasons is interesting, as is some of the arcane historical information, but nothing really gels together. There’s a federal agency involved without any explanation as to why they are there. There’s nothing to grab onto. With DaVinci Code, there was the whole Mary Magdalene theory; with Angels and Demons it was the race against the clock and would the Pope get elected. Here’s it’s about rescuing a friend of Langdon’s whom we’ve not met and to whom we have no real attachment, and about the great secret protected by the Freemasons. The book is an example of bad dialogue, bloated writing, and repetitive scenes. However, the greatest sin was that I never felt engaged or cared what happened. Nearly every chapter ended with a mini-cliff hanger and didn’t add to the plot or the suspense. One or two wouldn’t have bothered me but every chapter became absurd and amateurish.

While it was interesting to read about the Masons and fun to read about locations in DC (nice pick of Tenleytown and Kalorama Heights), I found it to be very preachy, way out there, had lots of holes in the story, and not very realistic. While Mal'akh's twist at the end was entertaining, the holes in his own story didn't make it terribly surprising (he happened to get every detail from Zachary in that one night that he ""died"" - come on). I also was waiting for Brown to explain what on earth were the ""dark arts"" that he was practicing, and his failure to explain made Mal'akh's story even more bizarre. In fact, it ruined the story for me because I could never understand what he was trying to do and why all the fanfare was necessary (except for sending the video). Like some others, I also didn't follow why this video was such an issue of national security that someone with Sato's job title in the CIA would get SO involved and be so sloppy (there ARE people in DC on Sunday nights who would manage to see a helicopter dropping people off on the tops of buildings). While I understand that Brown likes to put in a ton of information about the topics he is writing about, I doubt in reality, people would take SO much time in that type of situation talking about it and making others trying to guess at what the answer is (I got tired of Katherine and Peter trying to lecture Langdon). On top of everything else, I think Brown's point that our ""minds are God"" was hammered home so many times that I nearly put the book down. I get it, Brown, I'm not stupid.

Personal empowerment and the power of thought are tenets that are very popular these days. Brown took these philosophies and wrote an interesting novel about them. Is it plausible? No. Is it educational? Sure. Is it inspirational? Perhaps. But couldn't Brown take his writing talent and break the mold of these characters? Couldn't he find a new plot line? Do we need 27 chapters with Robert Langdon protesting his involvement? Does every chapter have to end with a cliff hanger? I found the suspense contrived and exhausting. I also have a slight problem with the underlying assumption that the general public is not ready for the full expression of enlightenment but I won't go into detail because I don't want to be a spoiler.

95,456567469,11/15/2012,4.0,"After an extended absence, Dan Brown is back with a new adventure, filled with mystery and intrigue. Coaxed to Washington, D.C., Robert Langdon finds himself the pawn of a crazed lunatic who has kidnapped his mentor, Peter Solomon and seeks the secrets of the Masons. When a severed hand appears in the Capitol Rotunda, complete with Masonic markings, the CIA’s Office of Security arrives to investigate, having been given Langdon’s name as a key to the mystery. While tracing the tattooed clues on the hand, Langdon teams up with Solomon’s sister, Katherine, Langdon seeks to uncover the masonic secrets his mentor held dear, while trying to steer clear of both the CIA and the lunatic kidnapper. Langdon and Katherine’s investigation soon decodes a symbol that put them in the crosshairs of all who seek to reveal the ultimate masonic secret; but could cost them the ultimate price.After two ground-breaking novels that led Brown into the courtroom and put him on the Catholic fatwa list, he’s back with a new thriller, much closer to home. Brown reveals the significance of Washington in masonic history, while presenting a detailed history about this secret-yet-public organisation. The secondary theme that emerges throughout is the realm of noetic science, which combines mysticism with theoretical science; a sort of science of the mind. Brown does well to educate the reader on the topic and posits some highly interesting possibilities in the field, with loose connection to the larger storyline. Drawing strong parallels between masonic teachings and those of any faith, Brown returns to his recurring theme that faith is more than literal interpretation of the sacred book. Use of symbols and metaphor opens the mind, much as noetic science can, to a better understanding the greater story.While highly educational and thoroughly researched, the plotline is less intense than the past two novels. The narrative drags and the excitement level seems to wane at times. The use of Washington as a city full of mystery opens the reader’s mind and fits well with the plot. Perhaps less historical than either Paris or Rome, the story is also less controversial and perhaps this lack of pizzazz dampens the overall story.Kudos, Mr. Brown.

96,1866255895,07/16/2017,3.0,"I wasn't as blown away by the third book in this series as I was by the first two. Dan Brown took my favorite professor on a wild goose chase once again, this time in Washington DC. What I didn't' appreciate about this one was the slow build up and the dragged out ending. I'm not sure if he was getting paid by the word or the page for this one, but it could have been a more succinct story.In the Lost Symbol, we are chasing the clues on the Masonic Pyramid. This is all based on American History, so it should have been more interesting, but it wasn't. I found the promises of knowledge and wisdom to be far fetched, and Brown didn't deliver on those promises like he did in Angels and Demons and the Da Vinci Code. The action in this one isn't as non-stop, but there were parts that definitely made it very hard to put down.I actually found Katherine Solomon's research to be the most interesting part of this whole book. Quantitatively measuring things like thoughts and souls is something so cool to me. Even if you're not religious per say, it is still interesting to think that something like a soul could be measured. While I don't know where you would find willing participants in that study, it would be interesting to see what kind of results would be found. I heard a rumor of a similar experiment, but I don't think it was as precise as Katherine set hers up to be.When I looked at the movies made from this series, I was so heartbroken that Ron Howard decided to skip this one, but after reading it I can understand why. It is so far fetched. And I know, if I believed the Holy Grail was a body then why couldn't I believe in a gold mine of knowledge and wisdom? Simple: Dan Brown did not build up the story to make me believe it this time around, nor did he end it in a way that made it still seem plausible. I feel like the true believers of the Bible got up his ass because of the last book, and this was his way of apologizing.Despite my true disappointment in this book, I'm still going to carry on with the series.

97,64312343,07/20/2009,2.0,"Ok, I decided to give it a third chance on audio, and finally finished the thing. Here are some notes to Dan Brown:1) A person does not chuckle often, and when she does, she doesn't do it three times in one conversation.2) Similarly, a person does not ""sense"" what is happening very often. If you can't find a way to transfer info from one person to another without them ""sensing"" something fourteen times, then maybe you should develop your story better.3) Also similarly, having a character read from a wiki page or lecture a classroom does not further the plot. It convinces the reader that you don't know how to further the plot. Just write a damned non-fiction book about the Masons, already.4) Retire Robert Langdon. He can't keep being surprised by the same lone-character-driven-mad-by-something-having-to-do-with-the-big-reveal unless he's dumb. According to note number 2, he tends to lecture a lot, so I don't think he's dumb.5) 133 chapters plus epilogues? Edit already.So why two instead of just one star?

I'd recommend someone watch National Treasure and re-read Da Vinci Code before I'd recommend that they read this.-------------------Previous notes:After two months of trying to get the story while avoiding the TERRIBLE writing, I finally put it down.

98,2080829038,07/19/2018,4.0," Robert Langdon is get pulled into twisted schemes once again in this third installment! This time we find ourselves in America's capitol, racing through the secrets of the Freemasons! C'mon, this is a Dan Brown novel, if I tell you anything else, I'd spoil things for you.  It's odd, most reviews seem to say that this is the least favorite out of the first three novels. I was losing faith in Dan Brown's writing after The DaVinvci code, which is arguably his most popular. I think that The Lost Symbol leaves it in the dust and may just be my favorite in this series so far. Angels and Demons set the bar rather high. The DaVinci code followed as a watered-down carbon copy of the first. The Lost symbol is similar enough to be familiar as a Dan Brown work, but certainly has it's own unique flair which sets it apart and, in my opinion, above the previous books.  The danger Robert Langdon faced was far more real in this novel. He no longer seemed to float just beyond reach of his pursuer. He also lost his ""too smart for his own good"" vibe a bit. He was more dependent on the help of others. It was nice to see the damsel of the story shine so brightly. Robert is a far better character with some human flaws. This increased the tension throughout this thriller.  Again, can we just appreciate Katherine Soloman? Instead of getting a girl half of Robert's age for him to take care of and educate through the novel, we get a wizened scientist! Katherine was an incredible character, and I'm so glad she broke the president set in the other books for the heroine.  The plot twists in this novel may be somewhat easy to guess, but I think the suspense and the obvious research put into the story make it well worthwhile anyway.

It gave me a whole new appreciation for the artistic and architectural wonders of our nation's capital. It taught me some vocabulary I hadn't known before. And it also gave me a different perspective on the 2012/Apocalypse prediction. As a story, however, it had its flaws. Right from the beginning my biggest problem with the story was how did Mal'akh keep Peter from bleeding to death, and conscious, no less? The guy should have been either dead from shock and blood loss or comatose. Granted, the entire story took place in the span of 10 hours, but in that space of time, without hospital treatment, the guy should have been dead. But worse, after the climax of all that intense action came and went, there were still 50 pages of story left that seemed plodding and dreary by comparison.

REASONS ROSA, REALLY NEITHER LIKES NOR APPRECIATES THE LITERARY STYLINGS OF MR. DAN BROWN
1. Robert Langdon is occasionally referred to as Robert or Langdon, but he's mostly referred to as ""Robert Langdon."" Like readers are so dim they can't remember his FUCKING NAME. Or like the guy is a super star, George Clooney or HOWARD ZINN, in the mind of his own creator. And why not? When I click on a link to history books on Goodreads, what do I find? A quote from The MOTHERFUCKING Da Vinci Code [not the exact title]. ABOVE a quote by George Orwell, I might add. Jesus. Christ.  2. The bad guy. First of all, I totally guessed who he really was way too early to be enjoyable. Second of all, when we're learning more about his past, he divulges that he slept with tons of chicks and even the ""occasional young man."" Mmm hmmm. So the only non-hetero in the book is a psycho killer bad guy who preferred young dudes. Lovely.3. Robert Langdon is recognized by a fan who remarks on his ""uniform"": a Harris tweed blazer, dark turtleneck and khakis. Here's a pic of Dan Brown from his book jacket:NOTICE ANYTHING?!I don't know why I find that so offensive. I mean, lots of authors must create a character that they wish they could be or represents their fantasy self. All of them, probably, at one time or another. Readers, too, right? We like reading about the, um, pudgy girl with purple hair who finds love with a billionaire rock star who's also the third son of a duke and has a castle in Scotland. So why am I bitching if Dan Brown wants to dress up like his own character? Or gives his hero his own sartorial preferences? BECAUSE HE BOTHERS ME, THAT'S WHY.4. I guess it's the patronizing tone of the book. The it's Dan Brown's job to educate the masses with his great knowledge. And why do I hate that? Because Dan Brown doesn't know shit -- any info in the book could be found on fucking Wikipedia. Gimme 2 hours and I could write about an outline for all the ""secrets"" contained here. But why do I find that offensive? Not everyone knows this stuff and it's a fun way for them to learn about it. What's wrong with that? NOTHING. Nothing is wrong with that.I guess what really offends me is that after The Da Vinci Code Dan Brown is seen by many as this rebel who revealed the SECRETS of the Catholic Church. Maybe he did to many, though, again there's nothing in that book, or this one, that wasn't previously known, but his books aren't anti-religion. If anything, they reaffirm a belief in Christianity. Again, there's nothing wrong with that. But for me, a 96.4% atheist, it's like flipping through radio channels and stopping on what sounds like a good rock song only to discover that they're singing about how Jesus is love. Ugh. I mean, at the end of this book what do we find? What's the huge powerful thing that leads to greatness that only Robert Langdon has the knowledge to discover? Major spoiler: (view spoiler)[The Bible. THE BIIIIIIBLLLLE. Okay? And yeah, in Dan Brown's world the Bible is really a coded self-help book on finding your inner greatness or some bullshit, but still! IT'S THE BLOODY BIBLE. (hide spoiler)]. It's really good I didn't finish the book--that ending would've caused a brain hemorrhage.For me, the only ""secrets"" divulged in Dan Brown's books is his own belief in the Jesus. (Or maybe his belief in his reader's belief in the Jesus.) Yeah, if you ignore that, don't see it and/or don't know a lot of history, it's just a good story. But for me it's just patronizing bullshit.5. Oh yeah, the characters are morons. They are the most credulous collection of geniuses ever. One chick is a super smart scientist who has a brother whose never sent a text in his life and yet she never questions for a second that the texts she's receiving are from him. And if I had to listen to Robert fucking Langdon say ""but it doesn't exist!"" one more time I was gonna slap a bitch -- seriously do book characters NEVER read genre books or watch movies?

109,1777315165,03/31/2017,2.0,"The Lost Time That Could Have Been Spent Listening to the Hamilton Soundtrack or Some Other Better BookChapter 1Jenny started reading “The Lost Symbol”. Not because she wanted to, but because she had to, as if she were a person on a quest to read all of the Most Famous Books From Each State (and District), and this book was one of them, representing Washington, D.C., the nation’s capital.The first unexpected thing that struck her unexpectedly was the gratuitous use of adverbs and adjectives. She read “unexpected” several times, each time more unexpectedly unexpected than the last. She was sure he would find some other word to use. Maybe an actually useful adjective. But then it happened.Chapter 2“Unexpected,” Dan Brown wrote. Jenny put her black-haired head on her keyboard, lifted it, and then dropped it again, and repeated the motion like someone frustrated with something.Jenny kept reading, and in an instant, immediately realized at once that it was true. All of Dan Brown’s characters were tropes: the brilliant but beautiful, yet somehow altogether useless smart lady-person. The brilliant, deep-voiced, undoubtedly attractive, yet somehow unexpectedly thick Robert Langdon who always happens to have the right tools turn up at exactly the right times. The super-secret, super-dangerous Asian dragonlady who brooks no bullshit. The casually mentioned minor character that Jenny right away pegged as the Big Baddy. Jenny stopped reading in horror, wondering how long the pain could continue.Chapter 3The pain continued. His characters were assigned traits without them ever being demonstrated. They were brilliant. They were spiritual. They were feminine. Dan Brown said so.Jenny, well-liked by everyone including Jake Gyllenhaal and most members of the royal family, thought about everything she was supposed to believe. She felt burdened, like a donkey descending into the Grand Canyon bearing a flabby, pale tourist. That if thoughts had mass, they could physically affect things, but not send the brain crashing down the spinal column. That doctors worshipped in a closet full of sulfur and random crap before surgery. That Catherine and Robert Langdon had ever established any kind of rapport that would explain their affection for each other. That the Redskins were capable of making it to the postseason. Soon, she was covering her mouth in horrifying horror.Chapter 4She noticed that characters were narrating to themselves. “He’s having characters narrate to themselves,” Jenny whispered deafeningly. “They’re saying things that Dan Brown just wrote outside of the quotation marks.”Chapter 5Jenny scratched her head, wondering if everybody in this Solomon family was supposed to be as unexpectedly and potently stupid as it appeared. Perhaps handing the generations-old secret of a priceless artifact to a headstrong, irresponsible 18-year old and then hollering after him, “But don’t tell anybodyyyyyyyyyyyyy!” was meant to be an ironic statement about the Masons. Jenny dismissed the idea. “Dan Brown wouldn’t do that.” Jenny smiled to herself. It pleased her that she’d worked “unexpected” in again, and doubled it up with “potent”, Dan Brown’s other favorite descriptor. “I feel a great sarcasmic power coursing through me. The end is near.” Chapter 6Jenny pondered the ancient wisdom of Stephen King, and hated Dan Brown. “Why, Dan Brown?” she asked in a way that seemed seething. “Why do you refuse to ask yourself if that ‘instantly’ or ‘immediately’ was redundant?” Every time he used “visibly” or “audibly” or “palpably”, she instantly wanted to fling something at him, like a sack smellably full of manure. But then, beyond Jenny’s comprehension, it immediately got worse.Chapter 7Jenny predicted Dan Brown’s plot correctly, because it was predictable. Except for the plot devices introduced exactly when they happened because Dan Brown had to get his hooks in somehow, and couldn’t figure out how to unhook. She had to find a way to get through the last 57 pages.Chapter 8The book ended. It was over. Jenny didn’t even care that none of the characters showed any signs of stress or trauma. All she knew was that the ending left her deflated, like a man receiving a pre-coital call from his mother. She looked up towards the DC sky, the rainy clouds raining rain on the ground. She felt a feeling and knew instantly what it was: resentment, with a faint trace of admiration that Dan Brown managed to carve out a successful career on the steamy pile of word-vomit she’d just consumed. But mostly resentment.",6,0.9857,0.1,0.768,0.132,0.5724037698412697,NEGATIVE,0.9959

The story itself was very much interesting at first but then I got bored and couldn't get into the story. It starts with noetics and Katherine Solomon but never really gets to the point what is that exactly until I've already lost interest and the book was a goner for me. Somewhere in between that we meet Malakh, all engrossed in tattooes, crazed with Freemasonry and that kept me going but after finding out why he is doing all this, my interest deflated like a balloon. He just doesn't seem motivated enough. Still, I kept going. Then Robert does his thing as usual, teaches us about Washington's architecture and hidden history, solves the mystery.Until that point it was kind of interesting but until the end, I flipped the pages.

112,71347797,09/15/2009,2.0,"I bought this book on the first day of its release. This is my second book read this year with 2009 as first published year. Most of what I have been reading are old used books from Booksale because I do not see the reason why splurge on a hardbound if you can get the read used softbound at 90% less of its original price.However, it is sometimes nice to be the first one to read something. Besides, I am a fan of Dan Brown since I read his The Da Vinci Code in 2005 followed by the two others - Angels and Demons and Deception Point. I have copy of his Digital Fortress but I am keeping it for a later date.This book, THE LOST SYMBOL is not a big departure from his earlier works. It follows the same formula so I am giving it a star less than amaxing. I liked the energy though but it is a bit of an overkill. Everything happening in 11 hours? (Tata J, yes you can say it: ""ow, come on!"") However, with all the twists, complexities, revelations, myths, betrayals, etc that are the usual stuffs in this early works, what makes this more appealing to me is the incorporation of father-son and brother-sister relationships that put more heart into the plot. Brown, however, failed to put a cap on this as I thought that Zachary would be revealed to have survived his death from the glass pieces that fell onto him from the rooftop.Among the things that I will remember from this book for sometime will be the following:1) Freemason is not a cult2) St. Jerome's wrong translation of horned Moses (so, the artists he commissioned actual put horns on Moses!)3) That there is LAUDS DEO written atop the Washington Monument but it is invisible to all because it is 1 inch high only4) There is a possibility that we are misled into thinking that we are God's createes only and we cannot be creators by ourselvesAnd I got struck by this quote:TIME IS A RIVER... AND BOOKS ARE BOATS. MANY VOLUMES START DOWN THAT STEAM, ONLY TO BE WRECKED AND LOST BEYOND RECALL IN ITS SANDS. ONLY A FEW, A VERY FEW, ENDURE THE TESTINGS OF TIME AND LIVE TO BLESS THE AGES FOLLOWING.I just hope that this book will not be lost in few years to come. Brown's writing formula is not totally different from the ealier mystery-thriller big names like Leon Uris (that Tata J liked when he was young) and the now popular John Grisham or Dean Koontz (that Bespren currently enjoys). The more I think about this, the more I am convinced to heed the suggestions of the 501 MUST READ BOOKS to make sure that the time I spent reading lots and lots of books will be worthwhile: the the books I read will not be forgotten and will be declared as passe by my daughter, her kids and the future generations. Anyways, I think the US20+ I spent for this book is worth the thrill and excitement I had in the last 5 days of my life. I will be sharing this to two of my interested friends (not yet in Goodreads) so it will be something we can talk about later.My reading of Dan Brown's other book THE DIGITAL FORTRESS will have to wait though.",6,0.9933,0.044,0.827,0.128,0.3956303418803419,NEGATIVE,0.998

My Review: Dan Brown teaches the reader another interesting History Lesson and as you finish page 509, the reader is left alone with his thoughts.

Many opine that he has rehashed his own previous book plot / isn't he having any other story line? Didn't anybody notice that there are controversies within his own books and in this book, within this book he has contradicted himself ...? In Da Vinci and in Angels & Demons he brings out the shortcomings of the Bible and the way the Word has been distorted through the ages. In The Lost Symbol, in one place his character Peter Solomon shows the Bible as the Word which contains guidelines for man to unlock his true potential and become God-like. In another place another one of his characters - Dean thinks of a quote which says how in time the written words in books are distorted and the original messages lost only few stand the test of time. Question is - does he mean the Bible has stood the test of time!? Have any of the other Holy Books stood the test of time? One more point, there is one place where Robert asks Peter, as teachers aren't we supposed to give clear instructions?

114,79609949,12/01/2009,4.0,"I generally enjoy Dan Brown's books and from the start, The Lost Symbol was shaping up to be his best yet. Much like his early work, The Lost Symbol is an adventure novel devoid of religion, but with the addition of Robert Landon and his uncanny knack for solving historical puzzles. Taking everything good from Brown's previous novels and leaving out the rest, The Lost Symbol should have been perfect.I say should have been perfect because it had two glaring problems. First was its length. I don't mind a long novel, as long as there is a reason for the length. The Lost Symbol reiterated plot points over and over again, as if it was attempting to drill the facts into your head. Much of this could have been remedied by a strong editor, but as is the case with many super-bestsellers, I don't think anyone wanted to tell Brown his novel had some issues.Secondly, and much more important than the length, was the ending of The Lost Symbol. The story was chugging along, taking me on a wonderful adventure through Washington DC while teaching me about Masonic history. As we raced towards solving the mystery, disaster struck. The entire book culminated in religious philosophy. It was like Brown couldn't help himself. He became popular only after he began writing about religion, so while 96% of The Lost Symbol was something completely other, he still had to throw in a little God. I wouldn't have cared if the entire book has been religious in nature, as I liked Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code. The problem for me was because it was so completely unnecessary for the story to end up there. Hundreds upon hundreds of pages of build up about the mysteries of the universe should have revealed something more shocking.I'm torn in my feelings for The Lost Symbol. I loved the story, but hated the ending. I loved the setting, the characters, the mystery, but really, just hated the resolution. If only I would have stopped reading before the final secret was revealed, I could have loved The Lost Symbol completely.",6,0.9497,0.136,0.692,0.172,0.5681623931623933,NEGATIVE,0.9996
115,1533577664,02/01/2016,2.0,"Dan Brown can come up with a decent storyline, but he is an absolutely horrid writer! An example of his awfulness (I could have chosen many) is a scene where a blind minister lectures someone about how now that he is blind he truly sees. Ugh. The book is full of this and many other hackneyed stock high school writing devices. But, I would be lying if I said that the book was not a page turner. It certainly is that.One strength of ""The Lost Symbol"" is that for most of the novel it does not try to take itself as seriously as the stupid ""DaVinci Code"", although the last 100 pages get way too didactic for my tastes. This text is also less antagonistic to the church and Christianity than Mr. Brown's previous two Robert Langdon novels.The villain of the piece leaves a lot to be desired, and his storyline is pure comic book, but if you put that aspect of it aside you can enjoy the ridiculousness of his villainy. Plus, there is a nice plot twist concerning the villain that I did not see coming, but yet if you go back and read a little closer Brown does a nice job of dropping subtle hints all along.Another quibble I have is that the book is about 100 pages too long because Brown gets very preachy and heavy handed with his Masonic lessons, and because he allows almost every character in the text to pontificate at some point or another about ancient wisdom, great secrets, etc. This leads me to my biggest issue with this, and other Dan Brown, novels. It is scary that some readers, and maybe even Mr. Brown himself, forget that this is fiction. Reading some of these reviews and various other materials on the text, there are many people out there who believe this crap about ancient hidden Masonic secrets, noetic science, hidden codes in the Bible, etc. Okay folks, it's cute, it's fun, it makes for good thriller reading, but it is not more than that.

""Wealth is commonplace, but wisdom is rare. I beg you to remember that wealth without wisdom can often end in disaster.""
These books were clearly not written for me. The Lost Symbol is Robert Langdon's third adventure, which takes us to Washington D.C. and circles around the secrets of Freemasonry. When his friend and mentor Peter Solomon is kidnapped, Langdon has to accept a mystical invitation and uncover a world of Masonic secrets, hidden stories and never-before-seen locations.I only read the blurb of this book now and it literally made me raise my eyebrows. It speaks of Dan Brown as world's most popular thriller writer and this novel as including his most terrifying villain to date, accelerating through a startling landscape toward an unthinkable finale. I would have loved to read this novel, but it definitely wasn't this one! I'm still annoyed the series is more a succession of stand-alones. It's smart from a business side of things, as it means new readers don't have to catch up but can simply purchase the most recent novel. From a reader's perspective, this means we get no character development at all. Robert Langdon is still exactly the same person he was on Page One and I still feel like he's a rather flat character. I don't feel like I know him very well, which makes it so much more difficult to actually care about what happens. Maybe my expectations were too high, but the plot is a lot less compelling than its predecessors', too. The storyline itself is less complex, there is a lot of going over the same clues and ideas, a lot of keeping information from the reader to force him to keep reading and some absurd developments that made it hard for me to take this seriously. (view spoiler)[I'm struggling to believe that neither Katherine nor Peter would have recognised Zachary. And to think of Zachary as the classic druggy teenage partier who then suddenly becomes this monster crazy for wisdom, ready to slaughter both family and strangers? Not sure at all. (hide spoiler)] The last big problem I had was the science fiction in this. Dan Brown has previously played with ideas of history before and developed them into something fictional (not always accurately), but I found it more tolerable when he didn't mess with science. In this novel, one of the major characters is a scientist active in the field of Noetic science and does research on the weight of thoughts and the human soul. I felt like in previous novels you knew certain things were simply not true, but I was willing to imagine them true for the duration of the novel, whereas I felt the ideas here were too far-fetched. The Institute of Noetic Sciences does indeed exist and there even has been an experiment that seemed to prove that thoughts could transform water crystals, yet it has never been replicated in over a hundred years, which makes the results rather questionable. I will keep on reading this series, having already come so far, but this is a novel I personally wouldn't even recommend to fans of the genre.",5,0.9962,0.085,0.727,0.188,0.4830032171835452,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Also, visit this humorous little page that will generate Dan Brown's next sequel http://www.slate.com/id/2228327/) I realized that the story in the Da Vinci Code had been engrossing enough that, as I had sped through, I had pushed past the didactic and poorly-fact-checked sections and choked back my grimaces at his cliched 8th grade prose. Unfortunately, his other books have the same plots and so can't keep up the same anticipation, leaving the reader dwelling on the passages that start as vague and annoying, then become absurdly incredulous and poorly expressed. This book pretty much caters to the uneducated, TV-hooked couch potato, who can somehow believe that the CIA runs around like poorly trained police officers in black helicopters and, like Sato in the book, threaten to intimidate and torture everyone. The CIA ,as past years have shown us, certainly may be poorly trained and make mistakes, but their visibility and intelligence is, I pray to God, different from this portrayal. A simple switch from CIA to FBI might have made more sense, but thrilled less the feeble mind of the all-too believing reader. On the other hand, I wish that Washington were filled with such wisdom-seeking people, as the elite heroes of this book, but the descriptions in this book of even basic federal building staff reeks of some notion of elegance and aristocracy that has been long long gone from our nation's government. Langdon's supposed extreme intelligence has also long been a thorn in my side. Take for instance The 33rd degree. Is it really feasible that it took two world renowned researchers and scholars hours and hours to figure out that ""degrees"" could refer to temperature as well as physical/geometric measurement? That they ""forgot"" about Newton, Or that the CIA is running around D.C. pretty much acting as damage control because of a ""threat"" that a video of high-ranking officials in a mason ceremony MIGHT be leaked? That sounds like low priority for even the FBI. Even more irritating is the elitist themes that are now a constant in Brown's books. The Victims and Saviors are always rich, educated, from aristocratic families, and usually white, with the exception of a few token minorities such as Bellamy, a flat character to be sure.The violent villains on the other hand are archetypal outcasts-an albino, a rebellious teen-turned-man-tattoo-d beyond recognition, or even Sato, with her cliched Asian agression. Granted, these characters have some complexity and are not alone in their villainy in their stories, but they certainly play on the sad societal tendency to demonize the ""other,"" what is foreign and unknown to us. For books that narrate tales of redefining what is actually true and challenging archaic belief systems simply because of their age and acceptance, Brown uses biased archetypes without thought. What angered me is Brown's obvious exploitation of public prejudices and fears in the current news. Sato, with her short stature and fierce aggression surely was not meant to conjure up any connotations of North Korea, right? The CIA's aggression and ""knowledge"" of torture tactics surely had nothing to do with the public's disapproval of their acts under the Bush admin. (I mean honestly-Langdon is even Waterboarded for crying out loud!)But finally, and perhaps most frustrating of all is what I suppose Brown thought was an innovative idea-his first twist, his first deviation from his formula: To not have a real secret at all, or at least not one revealable. Instead Brown exceeds his ending by 30 pages, preaching about a lost Masonic bible-yes that is the lost word- a bible placed in a bag and buried under the Washington monument. Instead, Brown tried to distract us from this poorly executed ""AHA!"" with an ending that reads more like a chapter from a dime-store novel as our Hero's lady leans her head against him and they watch the sun rise and feel... Hope? In the words of a fellow reviewer...the only word likely to be left on the mind at the end of this read is ""Refund.""",5,0.9708,0.136,0.707,0.156,0.5427758881330309,NEGATIVE,0.9999

130,71660268,09/18/2009,2.0,"Wow, only 1/2 way through and Dan Brown has gotten so much wrong that its hard to let myself get lost in the plot. And the things that he got wrong are not even secrets but things that he could have simply asked. For instance, I am a Freemason and have no problems with conspiracy theories on Freemasons because they are indeed entertaining, but, its no secret that the highest level in Freemasonry is the 3rd degree, that of the Master Mason, and conferred by the Blue Lodge (or Prince Hall Lodge which is primarily composed of African American, even though I AM Black, I am a ""Regular"" member of the Blue Lodge which accepts ALL RACES), not the 33rd Degree. The 4th through 32rd degree are conferred by the Scottish Rite and the 33rd degree is conferred by invitation only. I am a 32nd degree Mason (Sublime Prince of the Royal Secret), but my station as a 32nd degree Mason is not higher than that of a 3rd Degree Mason! The higher degrees are NOT conferred in a Lodge as Brown alludes. It is accurate however that if you have proven yourself worthy through extraordinary deeds and have gone out of your way to contribute to your fellow man that you may be bestowed with the 33rd degree. None of this is secret...ask any Mason and he will tell you.Next, a ""trace route"" is a basic tool of any IT Professional, or anyone having problems with their cable modem who calls tech support. As a matter of fact, its a basic troubleshooting tool that everyone should be familiar with if connected to a network or the Internet (allow with ping). Furthermore, Trace route is a command that anyone can do from any home computer! (in Windows the command is ""tracert"" and can be run from your command prompt: i.e. tracert www.google.com . Brown, makes it a mystery why Trish or her hacker friend cannot complete a Trace route in the novel and any 1st level tech support rep knows that not all trace routes complete because they are often times blocked by a firewall...any firewall such as the home router that you can buy in Best Buy that blocks attempts to tracert or ping your IP Address. It happens every day and is a simple tool to verify that a site is up or responding. If a site does not respond... try a tracert to sip.varphonex.com and it will fail...its because the site is down or has a firewall, in this case varphonex.com has a firewall. No secret.Oh, and the lax law enforcement techniques where Langdon and everyone else touches the severed hand and Langdon is even given the ring as a keep sake. No need to test it for DNA evidence, no need to brush it for finger prints, lets all play with the severed hand and violate every fundamental rule of evidence preservation known to law enforcement! But wait, what is the CIA doing conducting a crime scene investigation? The reality is that the CIA has no powers of arrest unless a felony has been committed in their presence (e.g. the CIA cannot arrest you for J-walking, speeding, or even petty larceny even if the witness it directly). Every other law enforcement officer at the crime scene would have told the crabby Asian CIA Director where to go since the Capitol Police has jurisdiction for the Capitol Building. Coordination with DC Police, Federal Protective Service or even the FBI would be plausible...but CIA? Seriously? Ever see a CIA police car rushing to the scene of a murder? Even if a CIA agent were murdered in their bed in Washington D.C., they would not have jurisdiction over the crime scene! And I could go on and on. It is hard to take any of the other ""facts"" seriously if he got the basic stuff wrong when he could have simply Googled the freely available information. And yeah, I know, its a work of fiction, but what if you were a pilot and I started my fictional novel on off with: ""...And the mighty Boeing 747 took to the skies, its mighty feathered wings flapping in the cold winter air as it strained to pull the full load of passengers airborne. Suddenly it let out a loud screech as the the big shiny bird took to the skies, only a perfectly round egg and a few feathers remained to mark its departure.""--Get my drift?I loved Angels and Demons and I loved the Da Vinci Code.

131,348779760,06/14/2012,1.0,"Normally, I'm able to enjoy Dan Brown's works, to a reasonable degree. I was initially disappointed after reading his earlier works to find out to what extent he outright made stuff up, but, once I put that aside, I managed to enjoy them as adventure stories with pretensions to academic thought wedged in; I learned to not take them seriously and to just have fun with it. With that firmly in mind, I sat down to The Lost Symbol, expecting more of the same.It's not quite what I got.Have you ever had someone with a really horrific stutter tell you a knock knock joke? And then the joke is stupid and doesn't make any sense? Probably not, but I'm making a point here, so roll with me. Dan Brown: Kn-Kno-kn-kn-kn-kn-kno-knock.... Kn-kn-Me: Yeah, I know, knock knock, right?DB: NO LET ME TELL IT!!

This book was kind of like that; every time the author started to introduce something, I was well aware of his formula, and had figured out where he was going. Instead of getting on with it, he sat there sputtering for pages and pages, thinking he was keeping me on the edge of my seat when I just wanted him to stop dancing around and spit it out so we could get on to the next thing. This book really needed to be half the length, it felt like a large chunk of it was paragraphs of people saying ""Oh, it was so simple, why didn't I figure it out before?"" and then it cuts to someone else's perspective before telling you what 'it' was. This was meant to leave you in suspense, I suppose, but it just got really tiresome and obvious. The other problem was that I not only figured out the major twist somewhere in the first third of the book, but I was bracing for a second twist when the first twist popped, because he had made it too obvious, and I was expecting another major shakeup before the end. Nope. There were some ""supporting"" twists, but no game changers, and I'd barely call them twists. This book was far, far too tame compared to his other stuff. Also, some of the things that got introduced and seemed really promising had really lame resolutions. ""Hey, remember that thing that seemed really important, and we made a big deal about? It was actually nothing, so just forget about it."" I kept feeling like DB had some other plot element planned, but then it got cut out or something, to make room for more hemming and hawing.Aside from all that, though, the thing that really killed it for me, was the entire denouement. The climax happens, the baddie is taken care of, and then the book keeps going on, for a painfully long time (Something like 100 pages in my e-book copy, but it was probably shorter than that in hard print. Doesn't matter, it felt like an eternity). As I said I was waiting for a second big twist, and sat through this boring, poorly researched new age hooey waiting for something else to happen, one more big fight, a betrayal, a revelation, Freaking something, anything. Instead, I got a long winded, rambling exposition of a bunch of dubious assertions about the reality of Noetic science, until the book just kind of sputtered out. With all the wild ideas being thrown around about mind influencing matter, at the very least we could have gotten Langdon doing some telekinesis at the end, or using mind over matter to defeat the villain, or something cool like that. But no, the book tries to have it both ways; it wants to be set in a realistic world, but it wants to pretend things like the weight of the soul experiment was done under perfect lab conditions and totally panned out. This is the Last Dan Brown book I will ever read, unless I hear some really compelling recommendations for his next book from people I really respect, or I loop back around to his older stuff.

132,73256179,10/02/2009,2.0,"WARNING: I would say that this review contains *spoilers*,if it weren't for the fact that revealing major plot points spoils ""The Lost Symbol"" in the same way that an infestation of crabs (not the ones that live in the ocean) spoils a case of gonorrhea.Periodically entertaining fluff. There's no denying that Brown knows how to keep up a good rhythm and draw you along, but... Robert Langdon (and, consequently, Dan Brown) has become -- if possible -- even MORE smugly pedantic than in either of his previous two novels. Honestly, I was hoping for Langdon (and, consequently, Brown) to sustain a shotgun blast to the groin after only 20 pages. So many of the scenes are structured like the worst kind of Ronco infomercial: all-knowing miracle-worker academic patiently (but sighing with mounting pity for the unenlightened troglodytes he has to deal with) explains page after page of (frequently obvious) symbolic information. ""Wait, Ron! You mean if they call right now, not only will they get the 'Egg Juggler,' but you'll throw in the 'Do-It-Yourself Home Vasectomy Kit' for FREE?!?!"" Harvard better be glad there is actually no ""Department of Symbology"" because if there were, I swear I'd send them a letterbomb.A major plot point deals with some kind of Masonic information being a major US security risk. And what, you might ask, is that information? (Not a joke!) It's a video-recording that reveals that some major government figures are actually Masons, and that the Masons perform somewhat strange rituals. That's it. Yeah, it would bring the country to its knees.I could go on, but suffice it to say, my favorite part is the scene in which it seems like Robert Langdon has drowned. (A real disappointment when we discover that the liquid filling the box he was held in was not actually water. It was a super-oxygenated fluid à la The Abyss.) The only real mystery for me is how it was possible that Langdon (and, consequently, Brown) had not already drowned... in an ocean of his own arrogance.Nevertheless, as someone who likes cryptography/clues/etc., it was periodically fun. So if you also like that kind of thing, feel free to read this latest festering turd of a novel, (I love you, Bill Nighy). ",5,0.9861,0.071,0.79,0.14,0.5636640211640214,NEGATIVE,1.0
133,73096315,10/01/2009,,"I'm not planning to read The Lost Symbol. But I got to the ""Literary Review"" page in the latest issue of Private Eye, and thought I would share a couple of passages with my GR friends:Whole corporations could rise or fall on the success of this book. Printers, publishers and booksellers will be flinging themselves from tenth-floor windows if, as is widely rumored, the book turns out to be rubbish.But how rubbish is rubbish? Let us not forget the words of Richard Eyre, who described The Da Vinci Code as ""quite astonishingly badly written... It's as bad as a bad novel by Jeffrey Archer. It's so bad that even Erich von Däniken would scorn its prose."" Could The Lost Symbol be any worse than that? And if so, how?(...)At one point, while the lunatic is escaping across town, cackling evilly, Langdon and other characters stand around talking for several chapters. The professor is supposed to wear his learning lightly; Brown wears his like a suit of armor, carrying an anvil.But is the writing really so bad? Brown's sentences rarely sing, but only a few actually scream in pain. ""The wooden steps descending to the Capitol's sub-basement were as steep and shallow as any steps Langdon had ever traversed."" Another character ""had never married. Science had become her life partner"".

If it is, my tastes have changed. Look, ""The Last Symbol"" is likeable in it's own way, and it's certainly easy to read, but it is just a bit too obvious for my taste. The bad guy is covered in scary tattoos. The antagonist is covered in scars and is constantly lighting cigarettes. The good guys are all 100% good, all the time. The conversations read more like lectures (surely Mr. Brown could find better ways of filling the reader in than by having a conversation that goes soemthing like: ""You know how significant the number 33 is, don't you?"" ""Why yes I do, the number 33 appears...."".) But what bugged me most about this book is that through the majority of it, one of the good guys (father figure, rich, philanthropist, noble, pure, with a great head of thick grey hair,...) is being held captive by a sicko who chopped off the good guy's hand and has given the hero, Langdon, something like 5 hours to solve a mystery or the good guy is history. Does this stop Langdon and the plethora of other good guys who pop in and out of the story from waxing philosophic on science versus religion versus mysticism? No it does not.

Okay, the book is 600+ pages long, but that's still a third of it... and I think it's enough to develop a pretty decent plot.Another issue with the book: lots of useless cliffhangers. I'm not against those, but in a book clearly written for people with no time for reading (I'll get to it), you can't place a cliffhanger at the end of a chapter and then star the new one explaining what happend in the last ones like you're assuming the reader forgot about them - they're not an endless season of a tv show.

150,1759153831,04/27/2017,4.0,"Holy cow. This was such a ride. I feel exhausted but exhilarated finishing this book. Let's dive right in shall we?This book starts a few years after the events in the da Vinci code. Robert Langdon has been called to give a speech about the Masons by his mentor, Peter Solomon. He quickly realizes that he was called to do something much more dangerous and deadly. If he wants to save his mentor, Robert has to quickly figure out the secret that the Freemasons have held onto for centuries. I really am at a loss of words. This book was a thrill ride. There were some parts that I couldn't breathe because of how intense it got. There was so much jammed into this book that at times it almost felt overwhelming. We have the mystery of the Freemasons. They were protecting the Lost Word which would reveal all sorts of wisdom know as the Ancient Mysteries, that was lost to man long ago.There was also the concept of Noetic science. Basically, Noetic science is the science of thought. That our thoughts can actually interact with the physical world, effecting change all the way down to the subatomic realm. This is according to the book. It has been around for centuries but was often suppressed because it terrified people. I'll give an example because I know that sounds like a mess. Take a healer. The ones that ""pray"" and you are healed by whatever ailment you have. Like that Supernatural episode, where Dean gets shocked and has only a few months to live. Sam find a faith healer. The healer touches Dean and prays, along with the congregation, and Dean is ""healed"". That is clearly not what really happens in that episode but it shows an example. Katherine Solomon, Peter's sister, was able to capture the actual energy flowing from the hands of a healer. I had a lot more written down but I think those few paragraphs really sums up what the book is about without giving a lot away. The reason why I docked this book a star was because the beginning was kind of slow for me. I wasn't super into the Noetic science right away so it was kind of boring reading Katherine's POV. However, once I realized just how cool the science was, I was on board. But I couldn't justify giving this book another star because of those beginning pages. Really though, this entire series has been a treasure so far. I am anxious to begin the next installment and then it's off to do research about when the next book is released.

Upon his arrival, he receives an ancient invitation meant to beckon him towards a wisdom that has been lost to the world. His friend, Peter Solomon, has been kidnapped and the kidnapper demands of Langdon to solve the puzzle that will lead him to the treasure long buried somewhere in the most historic city of America, Washington DC. The search for the answer of this mysterious object leads Langdon from the streets of Washington to the dark tunnels and temples that have been hiding in the plain sight all along.The Lost Symbol by Dan Brown is the third book in Robert Langdon series. After reading the previous two books and this one, I think I have found a pattern to his stories. It goes this way. He arrives or summoned to a location where chaos is erupted, someone is missing or better someone is dead, the professor is caught up in the mess and there is a lone elusive villain that is a pain in the ass. Also, most often Langdon does have a beautiful lady with him to assist him in his missions. Convenient, right? With the basic plot in motion, these books have so much history embedded into them. Reading about Ancient Mysteries, Secret Societies and influential people who are connected to the history in ways we never knew gives you chills and creates kind of an eerie atmosphere. In almost all his books, Dan Brown has connected scientists like Newton and Einstein to history in unimaginable ways which is fascinating for me as a Science student.I think the strength of Dan Brown lies in his vast knowledge of Symbology and world history that allows him to create a web of interconnected little details that he takes from history and compile them into a single big mystery. Though his books can be monotonous at times as they follow the same pattern but they still own a different place in the genre based on their uniqueness and depth.The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons were definitely better than The Lost Symbol because the ending of this book was so stupid in my opinion.",5,0.0646,0.081,0.835,0.084,0.4932936507936507,POSITIVE,0.9994

When he arrives, all he finds is his friend's decapitated hand, tattooed, and in a gesture that is an invitation. He is to open a Portal in DC and find the Masonic Pyramid. The only good thing about this book is that I'm into the random Art, Symbology, and Numerology trivia.... That's about it..The thing I noticed about Dan's writing, is that -he never reveals more than the bare minimum. It makes sense with the bigger picture, and yeah it keeps suspense for a few pages, but He doesn't build anything up for a long period of time. Every question is answered within the next few pages. And that's probably what makes it a page-turner. -There was a lack of foreshadowing that kept me from being immersed in the book. I felt like I am observing from a distance, without really being engaged with the characters. It was basically like ""This happens, and This happens... and then That happens"", and that was honestly a chore for me to read.My next... err.. complain... is that I don't really understand these characters. For some, the motivation was really simple, but for others... not so much. What bothers me is how their minds work. One second they have no clue and the next ""it was all so simple"". Cool? and really convenient. They all just happen to have all the information they need at their disposal, why am I even here? I was honestly shocked by some leaps of faith we had to take. Source? Dude trust me. It's safe to assume that you didn't like the book if you neither like the characters nor the plot.

The writer kept telling how brilliant and elite were the characters, which really weakened the story, since the intelligence is something that must be dedicated from the acts of the character by the readers [not to mention how annoyingly dumb were these so-called elites. I mean, how many times you must get into trouble to learn not to trust every bloody phonecall?]Admittedly, some of the concepts and related info were intriguing (could've been provided less like Wikipedia but ok). and there were some shocking and surprising moments in the story, but unfortunately they really didn't help much to compensate the obvious flaws of the narration.I believe there is a reason why the story wasn't absorbing after a while. TLS is categorized as a 'mystery novel', but repeatedly adressing the items as 'this' and 'that' is not making riddles. It's when you provide all the necessary materials to the reader and their mind stays busy with the puzzle nonetheless.

And sure, you have to suspend all kinds of disbelief in most of his books, but ultimately, he writes page-turning, action driven, suspense novels. It's a genre, and he falls somewhere towards the high-middle level of his colleagues.This book takes us through the Masonic roots of Washington DC as a crazed maniac tries to reach the ultimate level of human enlightenment, and he intends to take the entire US government/Masonic Brotherhood down to get what he wants.

They are just fast paced books, with an interesting plot that keep us entertained for a few hours.In that sense, this book has delivered just that. Good entertainment for a few hours. However, it was not as well written as the previous 2 books in the Robert Langdon series. Mainly because Robert seems to lack wit and knowledge throughout the whole story. Secondly, because there are plot twists within the plot twists, and some are pretty dumb for people portrayed as very intelligent.So, if you are looking for something that does not require many brain cells, just to pass some time, this is the right book.

But worst. “Man in power are always interested in greater power”The story is kind of interesting, but dialogues and descriptions are simply ridiculous. They are unbelievable, even more unbelievable than the story itself. There are just too many situations that doesn’t make any sense, too many “casualties” that proves that the author was not sure about how to develop the story when he started writing it, so he just simply started playing some tricky cards to keep going. If you have read Angels&Demons or The DaVinci Code lol you know that what said before happens in those books too. Then how is this worse? Let me explain. There’s a lot of talk and not enough adventures. On Robert’s adventure #1 and #2 there is a lot of action, a lot of persecution, a lot of “we have to rush”. On this one most of that is gone and replaced with lots of unnecessary conversations that keep pointing the fact that the main character has to act quickly. But he just never does. And talking about the main character… there’s also a lot of focus on second term characters and situations that prevent us to be interested on Langdon’s search. He is never on focus which is both cause and consequence of what I just explained. The book has some predictable parts, so we don’t even have a wow ending which, in a Dan Brown book, is very negative. The ending is insipid as well, so is gives us that “this wasn’t worth my time” feeling. However, as a Dan Brown book, this is a very easy reading so it isn’t hard to pick up the book and read some chapters while we wait for the bus. The Best: About the last part the book has some horrifying pages, and it really catch our attention and force us to keep reading. These probably the most intense pages on any Langdon’s book so far.

Mankind’s interpretation of the holy books have become flawed in that modern humans see their minds as being created in God’s likeness, rather than being creators themselves.

160,204232826,09/01/2011,4.0,"5 stars. Why? Because I’m mindblown.I was usually setting on giving it 4 stars (since goodreads, for some stupid reason, doesn’t have half-stars), it wasn’t really life-changing, but it was mind-boggling, enlightening, and certainly changed a lot of what I thought, in a way a thriller novel shouldn’t. This means this is no ordinary thriller novel. Dan Brown, could be my favorite thriller/suspense writer, he manages to entangle religion with history with politics with science in a way that doesn’t seem so out of the place or unconvincing. The plot never really downs on you, because it keeps changing and more sub-plots are introduced, and more mysteries are waiting to be solved, for it all to be revealed within the final chapters after a lot of mental breakdowns.Brown managed to write characters that are so … alive. I mean by now, Robert Langdon is a real person to me, so real, I could visualize him while reading, pacing around, but that could be attributed to Tom Hanks. But with new characters specific to this novel like Peter, Katherine, and Mala’kh, they felt so real. I was indulged in his world so much, that it felt like coming out of water, gasping for air, when I was done. This time he once again uses his glorious combination of history/religion/politics/science to introduce a mystery revolving around Masons. He does introduce a lot of information about their rituals and ideas; I’m going to assume that most of them, if not all, are true. I realized that I really don’t know much about Masons, and I should at least read a Wikipedia page! Brown, on the other hand, seemed to be emitting his pro-mason views through Langdon’s skepticism and realizing how Masons are so-misunderstood along their history and how people should realize that Masons really encourage each and every person to explore his own potential and his own religion. The science part was a nice touch, while adding numerous names of prominent scientists, writers, artists, leaders, and so many others who were masons. The whole plot revolves around finding that one “lost symbol”. On the other hand, I never realized that history had so many masons! A lot of revelations are introduced and I can honestly say, despite me trying to anticipate Brown’s little tricks, there are a lot of things that I did not see coming. I don’t want to spoil anything, but wow, that man knows how to build up situations, give you a little heartache, and surprise you when you think that it’s all resolved. Mala’kh is your typical villain, with his hunger for power and his twisted ways, and his surprising past. I was on the edge every time he appears, because more and more is revealed with time. And to be honest, I thought Sato was something else, other than what she claimed she was. I think reading too much Brown made me paranoid with everything I read for him, but apparently not paranoid enough to anticipate EVERYTHING. My only complaint though is that this book could’ve been 50 pages or something shorter. The last 15 pages were completely unnecessary. But I’m so glad I read this, I was so immersed in his world that I can’t wait to read Inferno. Robert Langdon is becoming one of my favorite fictional characters, with his character that is a mix of a detective, a scientist and a lecturer.

So I started reading without many expectations - but I'm still a bit disappointed. I couldn't help feel that I've read this all before. It seems as Brown has developed a formula for writing Robert Langdon books and he sticks with it, no matter what. Now, I actually enjoyed both Angels & Demons and The Da Vinci Code - they were both fast-paced exciting reads. I expected at least that much from this one. But I must admit that I didn't even get that. While reading it I kept trying to figure out what exactly went wrong this time - and I'm still not quite sure. Maybe it's 'just' that he uses the same way of writing, the same basic story line - and even to some extent the same plot twists ...The Lost Symbol follow Robert Langdon and female sidekick Katherine Solomon for about 10 hours. In these ten hours they manage to save the Masonic brotherhood and prevent a major breakdown of the US government and country. All in a days work, I guess.Langdon is lured to Washington on the pretence that he is to give a lecture. When he arrives, he finds out that he has been brought there to help solve an age-old puzzle and figure out the location of the Ancient Mysteries - and the Lost Word.So far so good - but there are too many flaws in both the writing and the story. It really annoyed me how many people were chuckling in this book! Besides this minor problem there were some problems in the storyline - things that were too easy like when a character conveniently overhears something important through the ventilation system or a CIA director conveniently hands over evidence that turns out to be very useful later on. But my biggest problem is that the characters don't act like normal people. Towards the end, after the big show-down, of course they still have time and energy to discuss some more and take on 'sightseeing' etc. - and after what has happened to them, both mentally and physically, this is simply not possible. It makes no sense!And then the way every character takes every chance to deliver a lecture - no matter what the circumstances are, they always explain everything with a lot of details from the very early in time and upwards.I did enjoy the book.

162,83573354,01/05/2010,2.0,"Dan Brown and Stephanie Meyer have something in common. They both write best sellers that are poorly written and loved by Mormons! I'm not quite sure why Mormons love Vampire vs. Werewolf teen romances, but I don't think it's a fascination unique to them. Mormons love to support celebrity Mormons (there is a buzz whenever one of ""us"" is on any reality TV show) and I'm sure Meyers enjoys some extra numbers in her fan club merely due to the fact that she has that Mormon pedigree: a degree from Brigham Young University and living in Mesa, Arizona. Dan Brown, however, is not LDS, so the reasons why his books get passed around and talked about within our religion community must come from a different place. Again, his fan club is vast and certainly not limited to Mormons, but because his books are centered on religious conspiracy and lost ""truth"", there is a definite angle of understanding we mormons get because our faith began on the notion that truth had been lost, and a lot of the things that know-it-all Robert Langdon discovers jive with what we think. A lost truth supported by Masons that mankind has the potential through knowledge and ritual to become Gods? Umm...yeah. We got that. Of course we want to know why Dan Brown and Masons might think that too. So we read. I love his ideas but I hate his execution. I did not read Angels and Demons but The Lost Symbol is set up exactly like his popular DaVinci Code: each chapter ends with a da-da-da-dum cliffhanger sentence. Chapter after chapter, it started to feel juvenile, as if the only way the author believed his reader would turn the page was if he enticed them with a carrot on a string. Write a good story, Dan, and most readers will eagerly finish a book, no raised eyebrow necessary. As great as his idea for this book was, the conclusion was beyond disappointing. The big reveal was nothing at all. Hundreds of pages, torture, man-hunts, murder and ticking-clock code breaking all for nothing. Or nothing much. Just like The DaVinci Code, the things people are willing to die for are just not worthy of such fellowships and masquerade. It's like Brown spends the entire novel shouting, ""Guess what! Guess what! You're not going to believe this!"" and then whispers, ""I might know something. Maybe."" So dissatisfying.Throw in the fact that he repeats himself much too often (I started to roll my eyes every time he described Noetic Science....again) and used the words ""shaft"" and ""sex organ"" multiple times (don't worry, it isn't a smutty novel although Brown's unnecessary use of a thesaurus makes it seem like it is (""penis"" Dan.

It’s definitely a page turner but it’s more thriller than piecing together puzzles like the Da Vinci Code was. The Da Vinci Code had me running to the computer or books on art history to check things out while this one only had that the odd time and that was too bad because I think that’s what sets his books apart. Brown certainly knows how to keep those pages turning. His chapters are sometimes only a brief page and rarely longer than five so the action is go-go-go from the start with hardly any filler. This pace is kept up for the full 500+ pages too which is quite a feat for any author.There are the standard weird characters, strange occurrences throughout history that maybe aren’t that strange after all, and quite a bit of thought provoking facts as well as unusual similarities that are highlighted between world religions. He also talks about the science of Noetics which certainly makes you ask yourself a lot questions. Some parts about that read like Rhonda Byrne’s The Secret. It’s apparent that he’s done extensive research to make this story come together so seamlessly. You get a lot of information about the Masons and Brown debunks a lot of misconceptions about them too. There are some very creepy and disturbing scenes throughout story all vividly told. He does leave many questions (not about the story but about history) unanswered and just something for the reader to consider or at least send some tingles down your spine.

We'll get some high-paced chase scenes, a sense of danger and threat to Langdon and his latest female companion and we'll get a few twists and turns along the way to keep things interesting and possibly spark some conversation about the book.And so it is with ""The Lost Symbol.""It's not a great book, it's not a terrible book. As a popcorn thriller of a book it works fairly well, though there are times when I began to wonder if the reputation of Dan Brown wasn't bigger than the book itself. When the book is on, it's on, clicking well and having Langdon solve puzzles and avoid threats with page-turning aplomb. But there are some moments in the story where things screech to a halt in order for Langdon or someone else to infodump information to readers in a way that completely pulls you out of the story. To be fair, this book could have used another edit or two to really reign in some of the excesses. But I wonder if Brown is such a name in the publishing world that his editors are afraid of editing him too much for fear of pushing him elsewhere and not making a zillion dollars off the book.The biggest culprits are the beginning and the end of the book. It takes a long time to get the novel going forward (about 100 pages) and the last 50 or so pages are almost like an extended coda after all the revelations in the climax of the story. Surely there had to be a better and more organic way to introduce the characters and situation and then to tie it all up at the end. Again, it's not a great book, it's not a terrible book. It will outsell a lot of other better books, but I don't think it will be quite as remembered as Brown's first two installments in the series were.

Aiding Professor Langdon is a brilliant, dark-haired beauty (the French chick, the Italian chick), whose male relative/close associate has been killed/abducted/whatever (The physicist priest, the dude at the Louvre).

But I really can't consider it as a novel because it bears so much facts rather than telling a story. The facts doesn't really end with completing the book, the Lost Symbol only points out the way and it's up to the reader to continue from where the book ended. For that reason I hardly considered ""The Da Vinci Code"" and ""Angels & Demons"" as eye opening, for me they were simply remarkable thrillers. If any of Dan's books is eye opening then I'm glad to shout out loud that ""The Lost Symbol"" is the one.However from a different point of view one can actually consider ""The Da Vinci Code"" and ""Angels & Demons"" as appetizers. Dan little by little prepared readers for the main course. ""The Lost Symbol"" is actually his biggest revelation and he delivered quite well. In The Lost Symbol Dan isn't trying to tell a story, he's rather wants to hand out a message.I loved how he laid bare everything. I was chasing page after page trying to know what the Lost Symbol is, yet the book really doesn't hold any answers or tells what the Lost Symbol is. It's really up to you to know what it is.

It's truly mindfucking, and I doubt I'd be reading any of Dan's books anytime soon. Dan's desire to convey a message simply subtracted much from the whole equation.

Unfortunately for Langdon, Philip, Philip's sister Katherine, and the CIA Philip is not actually the one putting on the show. A man has infiltrated the Masons and is about to expose everyone's secrets, resulting in a catastrophe that the CIA desperately is trying to avoid. Brown's writing is fantastic once again. The story is fascinating by its research and attention to detail. Its fast-paced and gripping as Langdon races to face a deadline that seems impossible, yet must be accomplished. Its entertaining in its originality, its ability to cause the reader to wonder, and its thinking outside the box. Brown suggests an idea that there doesn't have to be one or the other in religion. That possibly there is room in the world for acceptance. Words such as Creator or Architect over words like God, Allah, or Buddah might just be a path towards peace in the world.

Maybe next time, Robert Langdon could discover Atlantis. And you know, tweed jackets make anything possible. What really bothers me about his writing style is that even when his characters are in mortal danger that can only be resolved by figuring out some ancient riddle (who hasn't had those moments?), instead of just giving a straightforward answer and getting to safety with time to spare, he makes them rant about occult rituals and ancient symbology.

Overall, the book was kind of fun and engaging, with some parts being real page turners, but there were some things in this that just really bothered me. The story itself was fine, thought more circular and not as engaging as the previous two (It seems like a third of the book was just spent looking at a pyramid). Coupled with a CIA that seems to have been trained by the Three Stooges and the super selfish act of chooseing to save one individual over the purported 'Ancient Wisdom of the Ages'My real issue with the book however lies in the Noetic Science nonsense that suggests that the physical world can be manipulated with your mind. Look, I know the book a work of fiction, but when you preface the book with saying 'Everything in this book besides the story itself is all true,' you're just opening yourself up to criticism, especially to this supposed 'Science' which I use very loosely.

This isn't the Dan Brown I came to know and love through his books. And this isn't Angels and Demons or even The Da Vinci Code. Far from it, in fact.The many (too many) flashbacks slow, at times even completely stall, the pace, the constant jumping from one scene to another is distracting, reminding of choppy film editing, and Robert Langdon has apparently lost his charm and appeal. Because the man riding at the lead of this book was a mere copy - and a rather bad one at that - of the well-developped, three-dimensional Harvard symbologist from the two previous books.Also, the constant reminders of his past exploits grew tedious fast, but I did love the ""sincere"" quip on one of Brown's other (mediocre, in the words of Mr. Langdon) thrillers. That was actually the best part of the book, which is extremely disappointing.What I loved about Mr. Brown's writing was his ability to combine historical data, trivia, mythos, and science in a good, fast-paced, edge-of-the-seat thriller.I don't know what the heck happened in between TDVC and TLS, but this books simply read as a lecture. A boring one. Luckily the big climax broke the tedium for a while (rejoice, rejoice), but it returned with a bang in the very last chapter with absolutely not showing, but telling, and telling, and telling...Ad infinitum. If you succeeded in forgetting the lecture-like feel of the book, that last chapter brings it all back full force.And the grand twist in the finale, with the true identity of the cuckoo, rogue Mason...Please, like we didn't see that one coming. I don't think the Dan Brown from the Langdon era of Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code would've made things that obvious.Disillusioned (a rather strong word, I know) and disappointed.

203,1547209743,02/13/2016,3.0,"Combining mysterious symbols with hidden meanings, the cult-like Freemasons, and the US Founding Fathers, Dan Brown's latest book, The Lost Symbol takes his readers deep into the secrets of Washington, DC. Following after the huge success of Brown's writing in The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons (both books having been made into feature films as well), much was expected of Brown in this latest novel. Those books of his that were breakout sensations center on secrets brought to light, and The Lost Symbol follows this same trend.Brown is also an author who knows how to use place (be it the Vatican or the US Capitol) to good effect in telling a story. In the case of The Lost Symbol, Brown takes readers on a tour of Washington, DC, and its government-dominated landscape, including places both familiar (such as the Washington Monument), as well as those less known spots (such the Masonic Temple in Alexandria, Virginia, just a few subway stops away from the capital). Those who are familiar with Washington will enjoy seeing how he uses the landmarks of the city to good effect; those who haven't spent much time in Washington will want to visit.Brown also continues his trend of including clues in his stories that any reader can relate to, but which few readers pay attention (for example, the pyramid that appears on the dollar bill). He joins these ""obvious"" mysteries with more esoteric material (such as exposing readers to Noetic science) to create a spell-binding effect. New innovations are interwoven with ancient mysteries to spur the story on.Finally, Brown adds in plot, and here The Lost Symbol (unlike his more successful books) begins to falter somewhat. This novel, like The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons features as its hero Robert Langdon, a Harvard professor whose expertise is the study of symbols. Called to Washington by an old friend who is also head of the Smithsonian, he soon finds himself embroiled in a kidnapping case that will depend on Langdon's knowledge of the Masons and their associated mysteries to help save his friend from the equally brilliant villain.There is plenty of murder and mayhem along the way, and this book is a thriller in the truest sense of the word. There are lots of dicey situations spurring the story on, plenty of intellectual tangents to create intrigue, and one killer to stop (with help from the CIA). Just what does the killer want? Access to the ancient mysteries via a Masonic pyramid and a portal, which he believes lies somewhere under the city of Washington, DC. He wants Langdon to help him retrieve the pyramid (the link to the answer of where the portal lies) and help decipher the code contained on it.Where the story falters is, unfortunately, at the end. While Brown takes his readers on a great chase throughout the city, the ending is ultimately less satisfying than The Da Vinci Code. Brown even gets a bit preachy at the end. He may be right about the argument he is laying out, but the end of the story is not the place for such a discussion, if it belongs in a novel at all. As a result, the book is a letdown because of its uninteresting, anticlimactic ending. Where Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code held readers' attention to the last page, in The Lost Symbol, it seems what is lost is a good ending.",3,0.9917,0.077,0.779,0.144,0.4601952971271152,POSITIVE,0.892

And I didn't even have high expectations to begin with to be honest. I think Dan Brown put so much heart and soul into The Da Vinci Code there wasn't a lot left to put into this one.The main problem I had with the book was unlike The Da Vinci Code and even Angels & Demons where information and clues were doled out while on the run and in the middle of action, The Lost Symbol paused to feed us what we needed to know, which dragged the book down severly. At the end of one short chapter you have something exploding and the next you're casually sitting in an office without a care in the world hearing a dry explanation on an order of symbols. I felt like it wasn't until I was almost halfway through the novel that things started picking up and it became a page turner.The ending (without giving anything away) was also a bit disappointing for me. You get your answer, but it's a bit of a letdown and you still kind of feel like there should be something more. And I'm talking the ending ending (because there are a couple), the ones before it were actually exciting and worthwhile.There are many interesting situations and nail-biting moments scattered throughout the slow beginning of the book that keep you reading. And Langdon remains entertaining, along with his partners in crime, so don't think I'm saying the novel's a total bust. Neccessary character background is put in during appropriate times and doesn't come across as an awkward nuisance or glaringly obvious hints to what's coming that can so easily happen in other mystery novels. Plus, our main bad guy in the book... creepy and evil as hell. Especially because this time we know who it is which makes it even scarier when we see our good guys continuously walk into his traps.In the end it's a mediocre, bordering on good, pop-fiction mystery, with enough scientific, philosophical, historical and religious jargon thrown in there to make you feel kinda smart.

210,73915679,10/08/2009,3.0,"The Lost Symbol by Dan Brown (pp. 528)Dan Brown’s much anticipated follow up to The DaVinci Code is an acceptable sequel but unspectacular in so many ways. Expectations for this novel were probably not likely to be reached, but Brown littered this effort with many obvious and correctable irritations. In the early pages, Brown veers off path using his main character to justify and defend criticism of The DaVinci Code through a fan/Langdon interaction while also feigning humble in the presence of private jets and the rich. Clearly, Brown has clouded the line between himself and his main character too much and fails to remember the character’s history in order to maintain continuity between novels. At this point, I almost put down the book vowing not to waste my time on 500+ pages of Brown’s convoluted ego trip, but the subject of Free Masons and our nation’s capitol as a back drop overruled and curiosity won out. The story line itself is not bad, not great. It begins to move faster about page 300. There is much more academic material to weave in the freemason lore than the romantic vistas of Europe hillsides and churches, which I am sure poses a bigger challenge; however six years should be ample time to research and rise to that challenge. The venues that Brown chooses are also larger so instead of jumping from place to place in high speed chase, the pace of the story tends to hang in locations longer than his previous books. This tends to slow down the story and make some of the narrative feel redundant and clunky. Brown also chooses to use the creepy, crazy, physically altered foil to his hero – again. This tends to feel cartoonish though he justifies why the character looks and behaves this way. It still feels over-engineered, flat and uninspired. His previous books were more interesting and better written, or at least better edited. As fun, fast paced, historic thrillers go, the National Treasure movies were more fun, less annoying and this effort.

Why? Exact same reason why so many people are having troubles with it, Dan Brown doesn't mention long accounts to the previous events to confuse the reader who is probably having the first chance to encounter Langdon's journey. And that's what make it easy for people like me who can't possibly trail along the series.Next is the thing about poor writing style. There might be things lacking that I can't actually grasp cause English is not my first language so yeah it's reasonable why I didn't had problems with short sentences or long explanations. But what makes me appraise Dan Brown's work to such an extent is his thorough and profound research and all the efforts he put to gather information and then place it all on their precise location. I always get awestruck by his writing accounts and all the historical allegories and metaphors. And I have a deep respect in my heart for the writers who actually put Work, and do research for their writings.Then comes the mind blowing revelation, preceding by the unveiling of the ancient mysteries which certainly disappointed me a little. Well, after reading the previous accounts I had the usual hint of stereotypic end following Langdon's series but surely I was a little more expectant this time, which left me on my lowkey. Just like Langdon I was expecting a little more for real answer. But I think the key to read his novels is... Just read fiction for fiction. So the only other book that's been left to read is Origin, I hope I may get a chance to read it soon so as to complete my first ever series...

Usually Brown's writings goes deep into the thin line between science and religion. Neither ignore or praise any of them. With the great achievements of science our life became simple. More convenient, more flat. But there are still many things which cannot be explained by science yet. We believe what we see, we're afraid what we don't know. There are still many things laying there for thousands of years waiting humankind to unveil them. We were wise once, not the blind as we know it at the moment. Somewhere along the long way humankind lost their wisdom. Some powerful masons brotherhood took that secret and buried it somewhere in Washington DC.If anyone could find that lost symbol the world as we know it going to be changed instantly.

I've never been to Washington D.C. and had NO idea some of those buildings existed, or all of the thought and symbology that went into some of those structures.

I find the story's basic premise, that there is knowledge that only certain people should have and it falling into the wrong hands could doom the world, to be preposterous and dangerous nonsense. I believe the whole idea of secret knowledge is right up there with the concept of book-burning, and I don't believe it is done for any purpose so noble as to keep it from falling into evil hands. There may have been a time when admitting to certain knowledge or beliefs was a dangerous business, but I believe in this 21st Century that secret knowledge more represents the need of insecure people to feel they have one-up on their fellow man, an inferiority-driven need to feel superior in any way possible.

Please don't waste your time. Not even much in the way of cool unknown DC facts. Really just more stuff about the same symbology that Brown likes to yack on about - just like in the other books (do you see a theme here?)

I like the pop theology and references to cultural icons which Brown does well. I'm not even all that concerned if he gets it right or wrong. Anyone who uses Dan Brown as a source for facts probably thinks Wikipedia is the foremost source for universal truth. The fact is Brown tells a good story. Even when his prose gets clunky, which happens all too often, he can hold the reader in suspense quite well and he can write good action sequences. There is a scene in The Lost Symbol involving the heroine and her would-be-killer in a large dark room that I would pit against any suspense novel for the ability to produce goosebumps. On the minus side, I got a little tired of all of Robert Langdon's last second escapes and an author really needs to describe things like hideous tattoos and castrated sex organ only once for the reader to get the picture. Dan Brown does tend to shout his descriptions rather than whisper. Also, compared to The Davinci Code, the conclusion to the mystery of The Last Symbol was a bit underwhelming.Still, I enjoyed it a little more than its predecessor. I gave Da Vinci Code Three stars.

The science of Noetics (a combination of partical physics and mystical philosophy) is an interesting science until it gets too religious. I'm an atheist and all this religious babble really started getting on my nerves. I found the cab ride to be the most ridiculous thing ever. Who in their right might speaks freely in a cab? Robert Langdon and Katherine Solomon finally escaped from the CIA and are running to sanctuary and yet here they are discussing every single thing they have discovered about the masonic pyramid. I understand that in order for the book to progress, the CIA had to have these details but Mr. Brown should have found a more believable way to get the information to them. This was beyond ridiculous. Robert Langdon is an incredibly brilliant symbolist and Katherine Solomon is a Noetic scientist whose entire purpose for being is a secret.

The average-to-above-average ranging plot line is only the icing on the cake somehow does its job to urge you to reach the finish line.The writing style is exactly the same as Brown's previous books - short sentences (not bothersome), similar pattern of unfolding of events - the same template or stencil, if you will. Its alright at the beginning of the book, but as you near the end, you begin to wish the style of writing was a bit richer and more mature. On the plus side, since the plot involves quite a bit of descriptions of ancient-mysticism, it helps the reader understand the setting more organically. Overall, like any other in the Langdon series, its hard to put the book down until you finish it.I would definitely recommend it to someone who enjoys a mild blend of mystery, thriller, mystic, slightly intellectual, historical story line intriguingly buttressed by the brilliance and aptitude of the intrepid symbologist, the man of the hour, Prof. Langdon. * If you are used to reading from this genre, and if you really liked The Angels and Demons, and The Da Vinci Code (undoubtedly the best in the Langdon series), I opine you don't expect much from this work, or even better, you could skip it.What follows is a critique of the book, which I divide into 2 distinct blocks : one with slight (first-degree) spoilers, and the one with big spoilers. If spoilers disappoint you, DO NOT READ BLOCK 2 of this section.** BLOCK 1: May contain a few first-degree spoilersThe freemasonry and the ancient-mysticism infused foundation of the story is full of roughly factual information that creates a strong affinity and intrigue about the mythical (or is it?) prowess of the lost symbol. The readers start off with a skepticism towards apotheosis in the beginning, but as the plot progresses, they eventually begin to rationalize it and support it with metaphorical and scientific nudges. That great minds like Sir Isaac Newton and Ben Franklin were believers of this phenomenon, and that you can find so much evidence of their beliefs on the internet is only much more convincing and exciting to the reader. But this is also where the author puts the story on a pedestal. The storyline has a lot of gaps and assumptions which kind of makes the readers question some characters and its only adds to their disappointment when it turns out they were not wrong at all, that it was all predictable. That basically assassinates the mystery, leaving the reader exhausted! And thats how the author gives its story a slight nudge from the pedestal. When the reader finds out what the Lost Symbol really is, instead of shock and amazement, the feeling is that of bewilderment and anguish. So its a smooth take off but a rough landing.** You can scroll to end of the review directly from here**** BLOCK 2: Definitely contains spoilers - Mostly negativeThe intention of CIA's involvement remains unsettling and unconvincing, without a sizeable reason. The ""end of the world as you know it"" intrigue wasn't fed well at all, and as a matter of fact, turns out the author didn't hesitate to take the readers for fools as the world finding out a few wrongly depicted rituals, apparently, does qualify under the quoted label. Huge injustice to the concept of 'threat to national security'! Mal'akh begins off as an impressive, erudite, scary villain but is, eventually, shown to succumb to his greed and his yearning towards attaining apotheosis failing to understand that Peter just played him. This doesn't agree much with the character the author developes until then. Its almost as if the author didn't put in a good enough fight to preserve the villain's character. Obviously, by the time you finish the book, the reader forgets about Mal'akh altogether. What a waste!The genius and intrepid Professor Langdon, the main protagonist, was surprisingly pinned down by the author in his own plot. Apart from not being of sizeable contribution after roughly the first half of the book, not only does he constantly refuse to believe in the theories and hypothesis of the Masons - which seems very important at the hour, he consistently fails to see the real meaning of the crypts at every point. Seemed unnecessary!The final and the MOST important cause of the disappointment, The Lost Symbol - the symbol .. is a word. And the word is not specific at all - although mentioned to be The Bible, it is clearly said that 'the word' could be different for people from different religions. Really? That is counter-intuitive, unsettling and, above all, anti-climactic. The scientific evidence provided throughout the backdrop of the story is to be appreciated though. If not completely, its mostly factual. After I finished reading the book, I definitely found myself intrigued about the ancient-wisdom and ancient-mysticism and its evidence in modern science. I am in fact looking at a ton of other books laid around similar backdrop - Freemasonry, symbology, mysticism, ancient-wisdom etc - and I really thank the author for that.********************** Final Verdict :Writing: 3/5Background: 5/5Plot : 2.5/5Characters: 3/5After-effect: 5/5Overall : 4/5 - a good read if you consider the story in totality of its premise and not just the fiction part of it.",2,0.9967,0.086,0.764,0.151,0.4719148629148629,POSITIVE,0.9929

247,4296383527,10/19/2021,5.0,"Dan Brown never misses.His books are always engaging and there's never single point where I willingly want to put the book down. It's probably the combination of giving me real information that i can look up and see as true for example in this book all the GW related art, it makes me feel so connected to the book - maybe even to a worrying extent, I always have to remind myself after reading a Dan Brown book that the books overall are fiction. Although I do love that in a book a lot - that connection to real life just makes me that much more invested in a book and so far I haven't come across that from any other author, maybe that's just due to my limited book scope at the moment, hopefully I find more of the same kind of book. Luckily, I do have Da Vinci Code, Origin and Inferno to read next so I'm super excited for those.I completely recommend this book or honestly any Dan Brown book to anyone who likes a mystery that includes religious historical themes but also provides real information on topics you often see associated with myth, legend and conspiracy. I think his books definitely encourage the reader to look up certain aspects of history and delve deeper into the mystery which I thoroughly enjoy as well as the fact that they definitely make me feel super smart and well-versed. The books make me look into things that either i may have already been interested in so i have previously looked up information on it, but they always reignite my interest. This book was fun for so many reasons, firstly I feel like i must disclose the fact that i did start this book after the tv show adaption began to air so that i could compare what happened in the book to what happened in the show and see what was changed. Obviously, like most adaptation, a lot was changed - but i find that i enjoy both for different reasons, of course i'm only going to talk about the book in this review but i would definitely recommend the show for anyone who enjoys Dan Brown books or content with similar themes (don't be thrown off by the fact that robert isn't played by tom, i promise that ashley does a really good job!)So the book revolves around Masons - their high leader person?? i apologise, i've forgotten what the official name is for Peter's role is within the Masons, but essentially he gets kidnapped by a tattooed man who is looking for the great ancient secret that is hidden by the masons. He threatens/recruits Robert to solve the mystery revealing its power to him in exchange for Peter's life and so Robert runs around Washington DC for I think an evening? timeframes in Dan Brown books are always on the backburner but the events of the book definitely take place within the same day i believe, to uncover the mystery for the tattooed man. This is of course very typical of a Dan Brown book, something happens which leads to Robert having to uncover some major historical/religious mystery. I think my interest in general and religious history definitely makes the series very appealing to me. BUT this book did also delve into an area of science (I haven't actually had a chance to look into noetic science myself, I'd never heard of it myself but again I do sometimes accidentally take Dan Brown books too seriously and forget that they are from the fiction section so Noetic science may not be what the book presents) that I think the concept of sounds super interesting. Again, it all lends to the fact that the series continues to be chalk full of everything I have ever found interesting as well as introducing me to areas I had never heard of before. I would talk more about what I found interesting about the whole noetic science thing and its relation to the main plot of the book BUT i want this to be a spoiler-free review and the things i would talk (write) about are discussed right at the end of the book.Okay, I dont really see this as a spoiler but its funny to me because I'm reading another books that also hints at this but nowhere near to the same amount of detail - manifestation. There's a whole spiel at the end which of course none of this is going to make sense unless you read the book or just search up noetic science but obviously at the time of reading i hadn't searched up noetics and so it caught me off guard but i find it super funny cosidering this is like the fourth time i've heard about 'manifestation' in the past few days but not in the tiktok sense - more in the actually related to scientific study so yeh just thought i'd mention it but it entertained me.I do find it quite hard to give proper reviews for Dan Brown books because I think they're just the type of books that need you to read them for you to understand why they are so highly rated. You need to actively immerse yourself in the story he is trying to tell, the danger, the history and the mystery. I can promise you though, that you will never be left disappointed by a Dan Brown book if you do decided to read one - which I highly encourage!I would like to apologise for my inconsistent use of regular capitalisation, I am typing on my laptop and i have to press the caps button for even a capital I and sometimes when i press it, it ends up making the next few letters capitalised which i don't know if thats just because of the way i'm typing or whatever but yeh, sorry if that bugs you!",2,0.9993,0.028,0.807,0.165,0.4600314342867534,POSITIVE,0.9985

266,72172129,09/22/2009,1.0,"Here we go again. I had no intention of reading Dan Brown's new Robert Langdon novel; torturing myself twice was enough. However, my mom gave it to me for my birthday last year—and my birthday is in a week, so I have delayed long enough. I'm not going to apologize for this review, and if you like Dan Brown's novels in any way, you might well be offended.When considering how I would review this, the question that I had to conquer was: why so much vitriol? What makes other factually-inaccurate thrillers excusable while I crucify Dan Brown thrillers? There must be some reason that The Lost Symbol is exceedingly bad, even by the standards of people who believe a book can just be a ""beach read."" If no such reason exists, then I'm just hating on Dan Brown to be cool, and that's . . . not cool. Fortunately, there are plenty of reasons for my vituperation of The Lost Symbol.Let's start with those so-called ""facts"" and ""research"" that are supposed to elevate this thriller into some sort of work possessing ""culture"" (whatever that is). No matter how you weigh this book, even if it's to ten decimal points, most of it is exposition. And dull exposition at that. Yes, some of Langdon's explanations about Masonic history are relevant to the plot. But most of these ""facts"" are just Dan Brown trying to show off how much research he did. For example, when a woman recognizes Langdon by his trademark turtleneck-sans-tie, Dan Brown mentions for our edification:Neckties had been required six days a week when Langdon attended Phillips Exeter Academy, and despite the headmaster's romantic claim that the origin of the cravat went back to the silk fascalia worn by Roman orators to warm their vocal cords, Langdon knew that, etymologically, cravat actually derived from a ruthless band of ""Croat"" mercenaries who donned knotted neckerchiefs before they stormed into battle. To this day, this ancient battle garb was donned by modern office warriors hoping to intimidate their enemies in daily boardroom battles.This paragraph might be defensible as character development, but Dan Brown is still showing off. There's really no reason to include it. At least he gets the etymology correct here—later, Langdon will ruminate on how we sign our letters ""sincerely"" because sincere comes from the Latin sine cera, ""without wax."" The OED tells me: ""there is no probability in [this] old explanation.""I won't try to list all the factual errors in The Lost Symbol. That would bore both of us. The necktie is my paradigm case. Suffice it to say, Dan Brown's claims about factual accuracy annoy me, because they are so obviously false. The denouement of The Lost Symbol, once the thriller part of the plot is over, exists only so that Dan Brown can go on for another fifty pages about the Masonic secrets of Washington and how they promulgate a New Age syncretic philosophy. As a result, people who read this book looking for didactic fiction will come away with a wildly-skewed view of history and philosophy. People who want a thriller, on the other hand, should stop after chapter 125. People who want a good thriller should just stop, period, because they won't find one in this book.Let's talk about philosophy now, as well as facts. The Lost Symbol focuses on Noetics. Dan Brown's lamentable and laughable author's note, titled ""Fact,"" claims that ""All rituals, science, artwork, and monuments in this novel are real."" This is technically correct, in the sense that Noetics does exist . . . but it's not really a science. This is apparent at the end of chapter 7: ""The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembled science."" If your science no longer resembles science, then you aren't doing science any more. (Also, if your science lasts longer than four hours, please call a doctor.)No, contrary to his lip service to factual accuracy, Dan Brown is content to repeat misconceptions and misrepresentations of science and philosophy if it fits his purposes. Now, if this were a work of science fiction, and Noetics was presented as some future development of human science, then I could go with it. However, Dan Brown is claiming Noetics is credibly a science in the present day. It's pseudoscience, or more appropriately, philosophy.The distinction between science and philosophy is, admittedly, somewhat vague, especially the further back in time we go. However, this does not support the tiresome myth that The Lost Symbol repeats. As Peter puts it, ""The scientific wisdom of the ancients was staggering . . . modern physics is only now beginning to comprehend it all."" Two paragraphs later, we get a horrendously inaccurate explanation of quantum entanglement followed by a claim that this phenomenon is equivalent to the universal sense of ""one-ness,"" that all things are interconnected, espoused by innumerable ancient philosophies. Even if such an equivalence were evident, it does not follow that ""the ancients"" (a laughably broad label) understood quantum entanglement theory in the sense that we do today.Dan Brown is being very sneaky here in his support for this argument. Just prior to the entanglement theory discussion, Katherine says, ""you already told me that the Egyptians understood levers and pulleys long before Newton."" This sentence makes an implicit connection between the Egyptian use of levers and pulleys and Newton's explanation of how levers and pulleys function according to his laws of force and motion. Yet applying technology is very different from explaining why that technology functions. The Greeks also knew how to use pulleys and levers, but Aristotle's explanation for gravity was that all things want to return whence they come, hence everything falling back to Earth. This explanation is wrong, but it didn't preclude the continued use of pulley-and-lever technology. (For that matter, Newton's theories are also ""wrong"" in the sense that they have been superseded by Einstein's theory of general relativity. But Newton's formulas are much simpler and usually accurate enough for anything being done at a local level.)If I sound didactic, it's because I'm trying to undo some of the damage done by The Lost Symbol. You might not think its portrayal of science matters, but when millions of people read a book that claims ""all science presented here is real,"" perpetuating a mistaken view of how science functions is irresponsible. It's also lazy, because then it leads to remarks like this:Katherine's work here had begun using modern science to answer ancient philosophical questions. Does anyone hear our prayers? Is there life after death? Do humans have souls? Incredibly, Katherine had answered all of these questions, and more. Scientifically. Conclusively. The methods she used were irrefutable. Even the most skeptical of people would be persuaded by the results of her experiments. If this information were published and made known, a fundamental shift would begin in the consciousness of man.This is a classic example of Dan Brown's personal style of hyperbole, which dates back to the anti-science conspiracy at the core of Angels & Demons. There are three problems with the above passage. Firstly, the claim that science can ever be ""conclusive"" or that a scientist's methods result in ""irrefutable"" evidence. That's not how science is, at least right now, is wired. Scientists love to design hypothesis and then try to falsify those hypotheses, because proving something wrong means you can cross it off the list (and learn a lot during the investigation). Moreover, we are constantly tinkering with and tweaking scientific theories. No theory emerges spontaneously from the (nonexistent) ether, and no theory remains unchanging. Secondly, scientific discoveries do not change the world overnight. New results have to be confirmed, reproduced, reviewed . . . it takes time. Fundamental changes happen, but they take time. Finally, it's not the ""most skeptical of people"" Katherine has to worry about convincing. It's the irrational people. Aristotle might have opined that human beings have a rational principle, but I'm tempted to say he was wrong about that too (Aristotle was wrong about a lot of things!). It doesn't matter how ""irrefutable"" her evidence is; there will still be certain people who reject science in favour of . . . yeah.It's just bad, OK? Dan Brown has no respect for science and no respect for research, since he lazily puts in whatever exposition he wants, accurate or not, and then claims it's all real anyway. In attempting to be sensational, Dan Brown succumbs to laziness, both in his research and his presentation of that research. And that's really all The Lost Symbol is: a tedious, lazy presentation of research about Masonic symbolism. I'm not certain how I can properly convey how much of this book is exposition and how little is actually plot.If you have read my reviews of Angels & Demons and The Da Vinci Code, then you'll know that my primary complaint is that the two books are the same book, with some names and places changed. The Lost Symbol almost succumbs to this problem, although there are some notable differences. For instance, the erudite character with a physical disability is not the evil mastermind this time. Also, Dan Brown decided to skip any kind of intelligent puzzle in this book, opting instead of cheap tricks with boring reveals (""Oh, I was looking at the tattoo upside down. D'oh!""). Somehow, The Lost Symbol manages to be even worse than the preceding Robert Langdon books. Langdon continues to be a transparent author avatar—if you have any doubt of this, just compare Langdon's turtleneck-tweed ensemble from any of this three books with the author photo. Katherine Solomon is a transparent hot female scientist—sorry, pseudoscientist. The Lost Symbol is perhaps the worst book I have read, worse by far than 
The Art Thief
 and perhaps worse than 
The Expected One
.I don't know what Dan Brown's next novel is, but I don't want to read it. It disappoints me that The Lost Symbol is so successful, but I don't want to be one of those literature snobs who shakes his fist, saying, ""Why can't the public see they're reading crap?!"" But there is a big difference between popularity and literary quality.I'll conclude with a shout-out to Umberto Eco. Eco is a semiotician and author of 
Foucault's Pendulum
. If you're interested in conspiracies, that's the book you should be reading. Intelligent and sublime, it is not merely a conspiracy thriller. Unlike Dan Brown, Eco does not display contempt for his readers by including lazily-researched ""facts."" Instead, he creates a fable that is part conspiracy, part literary criticism, part philosophy, and wholly entertaining and enchanting. It is everything Dan Brown's novels are not, and if you have read this review prior to reading The Lost Symbol, I sincerely urge you to put down the Dan Bron novel and pick up an Umberto Eco one instead.My Reviews of the Robert Langdon series:← The Da Vinci Code

267,72379458,09/24/2009,1.0,"Oh dear. Where to even begin with this book? I'm the sort of person who likes their books well-written. In the past, however, I've made an exception for Dan Brown because, though he writes like the love child of a hackneyed romance novelist and an encyclopedia author because he has a talent for writing engrossing page-turners and for clever puzzles and plot twists. What happened to the Dan Brown I loved to hate? This book just gives me a Dan Brown I hate. Now, I know that Dan Brown is a publishing phenomenon and that, even if he had written a novel about the secret, dark history of Sesame Street, people would be running out in droves to buy it, but even the most gifted of writers have editors for a reason. Dan Brown needs one desperately, and not just to smooth over the more awkward dialogue. The plot in The Lost Symbol is an absolute travesty. Long digressions, shaky character motivations, and a denouement that dragged on... and on... and on... all hurt this book a lot. Did Brown's editor just not have the nerve to tell him what doesn't work? Speaking of what doesn't work, I'll expound on what I thought the biggest problems were. 1) The Katherine Solomon character. Whatever happened to Sophie Neveu? Granted, Sophie had some moments of utter stupidity in DVC, mostly so that Langdon/Teabing could explain things to the reader, but at least she was an integral part of the plot. Katherine seems like a tag-on, added in because Brown needed his token smart AND sexy how-could-god-be-this-good female character. She's not needed, the book would work perfectly fine without her. 1b) Katherine's field of Noetic science. Why was this included? It did nothing to further the plot. Langdon doesn't even really find out about it -- it's all given to us in narrative while we're following Katherine Solomon around. Secondly, having read up on antimatter after Angels and Demons and finding out that it's not exactly what Brown portrays it as, I was highly skeptical of the whole thing, and wasn't sure if I could trust it or not. Sure enough, looking it up just on Wikipedia, I find that they refer to Noetics as metaphysical philosophy, and that the page on the Institute of Noetic Science is under the pseudoscience category. Further research showed me that this science isn't really ""science"" at all, and if you think about what we're shown in the book, that makes sense. A few anecdotes (such as those about people with cancer being able to turn their cancer cells into healthy ones through good thoughts) do not make proof, especially when, if these cancer patients are receiving standard treatment, how is one to determine that their recovery is from a healer or prayer rather than medical treatment? One body losing weight at the moment of death is not, scientifically, proof of anything. A sample size that small shows a real scientist absolutely nothing. My point? Brown is misleading people for his own gain, and that, unlike in Angels and Demons, the misinformation doesn't even further the plot. 2) Robert Langdon. I've always been a fan of Langdon. The professor character is one I find appealing, and even though Brown has always gone well out of his way to tell us how smart and sexy Langdon is to the point of annoyance, he was, in the last two books, at least a likeable character. What happened to him here? Am I really supposed to believe that the man who, in the Da Vinci Code, unabashedly proclaimed that there were secret messages hidden in Leonardo's art, that the Priory of Sion was real, and that Jesus was married and had a baby, all ideas which are difficult to swallow, won't believe that what's going on in this book is literal and not metaphorical? When did Langdon become such a skeptic? And when did he become such an idiot? Who in their right mind would flee from the CIA in Washington DC? I've lived in DC for two years, and it's well-known that there's an absurd amount of law enforcement in this city. Something like 13 different organizations just in the District alone. When I cam here to college, they warned us against so much as using a fake ID because there's so much surveillance, let alone running from the CIA. Then there's the fact that Langdon seems to have lost his superhuman ability to solve supposedly-unsolvable puzzles. In A&D and DVC, Langdon comes across a puzzle, hypothesises something, finds out it's wrong, then starts over and figures it out. Here, Langdon is either utterly clueless and requires someone else to tell him what's going on, or figures things out immediately, which is indescribably frustrating. Furthermore, if Langdon has an eidetic memory, why can't he recall the symbols on the bottom of the pyramid when he had been staring at it? The obvious answer is that he was drowning (or thought he was) at the time, but Brown never so much as acknowledges that Langdon isn't up to snuff here. 3) Stakes. In a thriller, stakes are everything. You have to raise them so that things will be interesting. In the vast majority of the book, the main concern is whether or not Malakh (or Mal'akh, as Brown chooses to spell it, unnecessarily, as, as far as I'm aware, this is the transliteration of the Hebrew, and not how one would spell an actual name) is going to kill Peter Solomon. Now, call me cold, but killing Langdon's friend, who hasn't made an actual appearance in the book save a few flashbacks, is not stakes equal to bombing Vatican City or radically changing Christian doctrine. Sucks for Langdon, not so much for the reader, who has no emotional attachment to Solomon. There's also talk of a national security threat, but since no one in the text, save a chainsmoking CIA officer, seems to take this seriously, it's hard to get invested in that. Then we find out at the end, no, Malakh hasn't planted a bomb in the White House, he hasn't sold yellow cake uranium to the Iranians, no, he has a bunch of Washington officials on video tape performing a Masonic ritual. Not even a Satanic ritual. A Masonic ritual! Even if all these men were forced to resign, there would be initial attention for a few days, blistering CNN and MSNBC coverage for about a month, and then they would be replaced and that would be that. Secondly, I think focusing on the Freemasons was a mistake. Does anyone really believe old ""Masons rule the world"" conspiracy theories? I mean, they're so old and so bogus that I was half-expecting there to be mentions of the Masons colluding with the Jews to establish an evil, anti-Christian New World Order or something. (Puh-lease.) I'm not anti-Mason, I think they're a fine group, and they focus on philanthropy and good character, so who can argue with that? They have some esoteric secrets and initiation rituals, but so does about every college fraternity in America. No big deal. We're really supposed to believe that they hold the key to understanding the universe because George Washington was a member? It's like saying that George Washington was Episcopalian, so obviously Epsicopalians are special. Or that George Washington was born in Virginia, so obviously Virginia is the cradle of the universe. 4) Lack of detail. One of the things I loved about DVC and A&D was all of the art and architecture featured. Even though sometimes, the information Brown gave us was a load of crock, I still became aware of things like the Church of the Saint-Sulpice and Rosslyn chapel and could go, look it up, and find out what was correct. Here, we have what, all of one engraving and one fresco. Little attention is given to the buildings that Langdon goes into, including the Capitol and the Library of Congress (speaking of, the complete lack of reverence with which the CIA tramps through the Library of Congress is disgusting). We actually see very few buildings, and often, explanations of these important things are left out in favor of explaining things like Noetic Science. (Little is said about what it means to be in the Adams Building vs the Jefferson Building, or that the Cathedral College at the National Cathedral is not actually a college in the sense most people understand it, for instance.) As a DC resident, I was looking forward to the city getting the same attention as Rome and Paris do in his other books, but despite his insistence that DC has everything European cities do, Brown seems bored with his location. 5) Misinformation. I'm sure there's plenty of things I don't know that he got wrong, but Brown spews plenty of historical inaccuracies and just glosses over certain facts. It's rather dubious that the Masons would hinge so much on the Washington Monument when the thing very well might have never been finished (it took almost 40 years). From Freedom Plaza, Langdon and Katherine run to Metro Center, which is convenient for the plot, but makes almost no sense whatsoever from a logistical standpoint when Federal Triangle is half the distance from there. Then, it only takes them ten minutes to get from Metro Center to Alexandria. That must have been one damned fast train. Why is the CIA's Office of Security which, the book claims is the CIA's inside watchdog office, working this case? This would fall under the jurisdiction of Metro Police or the FBI -- though I guess ""Metro Police Police Chief"" doesn't have the same sinister, omnipotent aura as a CIA agent. 6) Theme. Okay, so I don't really expect the deepest, most literary themes from Dan Brown. But he always has a message, and this one was particularly troubling to me. Brown seems to be convinced that people can and will believe that science can explain what it means, most fundamentally, to be human. I am not a religious person, but I feel that science cannot, and will not ever be able to encapsulate the feeling of betrayal, of a first kiss, of what it feels like to hold your newborn in your arms. These things aren't just brain waves and chemicals and processes, they're built on from a whole lifetime of experience, and to pretend that ""a body lost weight after death"" or ""you can see energy coming from this religious teacher's fingers"" explain the mysteries of the human experience in any meaningful way. Science does a lot of things for us. It enables me to send this message via my computer, to contact people anywhere in the world, to move from place to place with superhuman speed, makes our food and water safe, cures and prevents diseases, and countless other things. But what's the point of trying to take the mystery out of life? Dan Brown seems to in the same breath, say that you have to find the answers for yourself and give them to you. Just when he's onto something -- like the fact that the Bible is still around today because it touches people -- Brown turns around and says that the Bible's filled with codes and you have to try and decrypt them. Whatever happened to people reading the Bible and just interpreting what is there? It's like Brown wants to respect religion, but what's there isn't good enough for him, so he has to make it something it's not. That's what's most troubling to me. As for other issues -- like how obvious Malakh's identity was, I don't see how Brown could have avoided it, because the stakes simply were not high enough for him to be doing these things without some sort of reason beyond ""I want to find knowledge! And perform this awesome satanic ritual!"" The secret was predictable and a big let down. (I had guessed that 'the Word' would be 'god,' but a Bible is really close enough.) The characterization was weak. Brown is often condescending to the reader, assuming he knows nothing and then treats us to encyclopedia-esque descriptions of useless concepts. Not to mention that end that never ends. Was that really necessary? ",2,-0.9964,0.111,0.801,0.089,0.4756797939714606,NEGATIVE,1.0

It's good for first timer because they don't have to read the previous book but, you don't have to read every Detective Conan books to solve a mystery and yet, Conan was always with Ran.

(hide spoiler)]SPOILER ALERT(view spoiler)[Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is invited to give a lecture at the United States Capitol, at the invitation apparently from his mentor, a 33rd degree Mason named Peter Solomon, who is the head of the Smithsonian Institution. Solomon has also asked him to bring a small, sealed package which he had entrusted to Langdon years earlier. When Langdon arrives at the Capitol, however, he learns that the invitation he received was not from Solomon, but from Solomon's kidnapper, Mal'akh posing as Solomon's assistant, who has left Solomon's severed right hand in the middle of the Capitol Rotunda in a recreation of the Hand of Mysteries. Mal'akh then contacts Langdon, charging him with finding both the Mason's Pyramid, which Masons believe is hidden somewhere in Washington, D.C., and the Lost Word, lest Solomon be murdered.Langdon met Trent Anderson, head of the Capitol police, and Inoue Sato, the head of the CIA's Office of Security. Sato claims that Mal'akh poses a threat to the national security of the U.S. and that his capture is more important than Peter's rescue, although she refuses to elaborate. Examining Solomon's hand, they discover a clue leading them to Solomon's Masonic altar in a room in the Capitol's sub-basement, where they find a small pyramid lacking a capstone, with an inscription carved into it.Sato then confronts Langdon with the security x-ray taken of his bag when he entered the Capitol which reveals a smaller pyramid in the package Langdon brought in response to the request by the kidnapper posing as Solomon. Langdon explains that he was unaware of its contents, but Sato, refusing to believe it, attempts to take Langdon into custody. Before she can arrest him, however, she and Anderson are assaulted by Warren Bellamy, the Architect of the Capitol and a Freemason, who then flees with Langdon in the confusion. He later explains to Langdon that he too has been in contact with Mal'akh and wants Langdon's assistance in rescuing Peter.Mal'akh is revealed to be a Freemason with tattoos covering almost his entire body. He infiltrated the organization in order to obtain an ancient source of power,[9] which he believes Langdon can unlock for him in return for Peter Solomon's life. Several chapters also delve into Mal'akh's history with Peter Solomon: many years earlier, Peter bequeathed a large sum of inheritance money to his rebellious son, Zachary, who then fled the Solomon household and led a reckless life in Europe until he was arrested and imprisoned in Turkey for smuggling drugs. Peter flew to Turkey but decided to have Zachary extradited in a week's time instead of getting him released immediately in order to teach him a lesson. Zachary was apparently murdered by his cellmate who got his hands on Zachary's fortune and fled to Greece to lead a luxurious life under the name Andros Dareios. Dareios, however, soon grew tired of his life. Apparently having spoken with Zachary about Solomon's life as a Mason, Dareios broke into Solomon's home to find the pyramid, but accidentally killed Peter's mother Isabel and was in turn shot and left to fall into a frozen river by a vengeful Solomon. Surviving the fall, Dareios nursed himself back to health, covered his scars and eventually his entire body with tattoos and set off on a mission to infiltrate the Freemasons and gain access to their secrets, adopting the name Mal'akh.As Langdon deals with the events into which he has been thrust, Mal'akh destroys the Smithonsonian-sponsored laboratory of Dr. Katherine Solomon, Peter's younger sister, where she has conducted experiments in Noetic Science, in the process ambushing and almost killing Katherine in a cat-and-mouse chase, but Katherine manages to escape and meet up with Langdon and Bellamy. Eventually, when cornered by the authorities, Bellamy is forced to give himself up while Langdon and Katherine escape. Both are later apprehended by Sato's team. Following clues regarding Mal'akh's previous identity as Peter Solomon's psychiatrist, Dr. Christopher Abaddon, Sato allows Langdon and Katherine to rush to his mansion to confront him, but Mal'akh ambushes them and murders their CIA escort. Meanwhile, as he is being interrogated by Sato, Bellamy expresses belief that Sato is working with Mal'akh but Sato assures Bellamy that she is also pursuing Mal'akh in the interest of national security and displays evidence that visibly shocks Bellamy.Mal'akh places Langdon into an airtight sensory deprivation tank, where he interrogates Langdon by slowly filling the tank with liquid. He is able to convince Langdon to decipher the code at the pyramid's base, but continues to fill the tank until Langdon drowns and apparently dies. Mal'akh then ties Katherine to a chair and inserts an open-ended transfusion needle into her arm and leaves her to bleed to death then flees with a weakened and wheelchair-bound Peter Solomon to the Temple Room of the Scottish Rite's House of the Temple. He uses the threat of not calling an ambulance for Katherine as further coercion for Peter's cooperation. Sato leads a team of agents to the mansion after Langdon and Katherine's escort fails to check in and are able to save Katherine's life. After a near-death experience, Langdon is revealed to have survived due to the ""water"" in the tank actually being breathable oxygenated liquid and the tank being a device for meditation. Sato, Langdon and Simkins race to the House of the Temple where Mal'akh threatens to release a heavily edited video showing government officials performing secret Masonic rituals (the same video that Sato showed to Bellamy), which without context, appears highly disturbing. Mal'akh forces the Word—the unpronounceable circumpunct—out of Peter and tattoos it on his head on the last portion of unmarked skin on his body. Mal'akh then orders Peter to sacrifice him, as he believes that it is his destiny to become a demonic spirit and lead the forces of evil. When Peter claims that he will do so without hesitation to avenge his son and mother, Mal'akh shocks Peter by revealing that he is actually Zachary Solomon himself, having conspired with the prison warden to fake his death by disfiguring the body of another inmate beyond recognition (at the same time, Katherine and Bellamy discover several photos of Zachary in Greece after his supposed death that show his gradual transformation into Mal'akh). With tears in his eyes, Peter prepares to stab Zachary but ultimately cannot bring himself to do so and drops the knife just as Langdon arrives and tackles him. Director Sato arrives at the Temple in a helicopter, which smashes the Temple's skylight, the shards of which fatally impale Zachary. The CIA then thwart Zachary's plan to transmit the video to several leading media channels using an EMP blast, disabling a cell tower in the network path leading from Zachary's laptop computer. Katherine arrives and she and Langdon then share a tearful reunion with Peter and mourn Zachary's death. Zachary is only briefly able to lament his body's mutilation before dying and presumably dragged to Hell.Later, Peter informs Langdon that the circumpunct Zachary tattooed on his head is not the Word. He also informs Katherine that he made back-ups of all of her noetic research data on his own computer, meaning her research can continue. Deciding to take Langdon to the true secret behind the Word, Peter leads him to the room atop the Washington Monument and tells him that the Word—a common Christian Bible, the Word of God—lies in the monument's cornerstone, buried in the ground beneath the monument's staircase. Langdon realizes that the symbols on the pyramid's base spelled out the words Laus Deo which translate to Praise God. These words are inscribed on the small aluminum capstone atop the Monument, which is the true Masonic Pyramid.Peter tells Langdon that the Masons believe that the Bible is an esoteric allegory written by humanity, and that, like most religious texts around the globe, it contains veiled instructions for harnessing humanity's natural God-like qualities—similar to Katherine's Noetic research—and is not meant to be interpreted as the commands of an all-powerful deity. This interpretation has been lost amid centuries of scientific skepticism and fundamentalist zealotry. The Masons have (metaphorically) buried it, believing that, when the time is right, its rediscovery will usher in a new era of human enlightenment.

Although, in this case, halfway through or close to it actually, I kept wondering why in the world didn't my library have an abridged version of Origin and yet, by the revealing of  THE LOST SYMBOLS  I was thinking, ""That's it? That's the lost symbol of what exactly?"" and then of course it had to be mixed with religion and science after that *eye roll* and this book was definitely Origin all over again or to some Origin was Lost Symbol all over again so I can totally see as to why many didn't like Origin. I'm super glad now my county library had a copy of an abridged version of this book because I would've lost hope and DNF'd it and yet would keep going out of curiosity, although the scientific stuff at the end made me question at the ridiculousness of the story and made me laugh at how dumb it was. This whole book fell flat and it was also totally and major predictable as to who the villain was *eye roll and rubbing eyes in embarrassment/boredom) and yet ugh. Not the best writing. Though I do have to say looking back when I read Inferno I did enjoy it and it seemed to redeem after this one, but Origin was the same as this: both total flops.But, I AM hoping I'll admit to see this book and Origin both become movies since I'd rather watch on the screen and since Ron Howard did an amazing job with the movies, I think I liked the films better without the details and so much description and visually they were exciting. Anyway, overall, this book sucked, Dan Brown again needs to retire Robert Langdon now that I can say I've read all of these and Origin however was definitely all his books rolled into one.

270,3784233988,07/11/2021,4.0," Awesome! Intriguing! A true masterpiece of thrill and suspenseAfter finishing Angels and Demons  and The Da Vinci Code, The Lost Symbol was the next book in the series. It wasn’t bad enough to be given 1 star but was also not that good to be given 5 stars. There were many good things about the book. For example, the plot was really good and gripping, the characters were nicely chosen, and the villain was scary and merciless. But there were pretty bad characteristics too. The start was a bit too slow, the police were interfering with the plot for absolutely no reason, and the story was a bit extended. My rating is 4 stars, probably because the plot was the best, and also because it helped me gather new information. Robert Langdon has to do it again. He had come to the Capitol Building for giving a lecture. However, he soon finds out that his mentor – Peter Solomon, is kidnapped by a man named Mal’akh. Mal’akh, the villain, wants Langdon to solve a difficult puzzle to complete his transformation from man to God. The story was pretty good up to this point, but then the police had interfered, and that made the story less interesting. This made the start a bit too long, I was starting to lose interest. Luckily, I didn’t lose interest and I continued reading, and the story became as gripping as ever after some more pages. 
“Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand”
The main reason why this book was boring in the first half was because of the writing style. Whenever some monuments or artefacts were mentioned, there was always one paragraph describing it. It was fun getting new Masonic and American history information, but sometimes, I found it too unnecessary. I also think that this book was too extended, only to reveal the suspense in the middle of the book. The ending was mainly philosophical, and there were some parts that a sceptic might not believe. Overall – 3.5 stars rounded to 4. I never knew about Masonic history and architecture, and this book gave me a detailed look at it along with a thrilling story. This wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be, but was better than my expectations.Impossible to put down…Another mind-blowing Robert Langdon story-New York Times",2,0.6618,0.136,0.719,0.145,0.5620902906617191,POSITIVE,0.9
271,2332945361,03/19/2018,4.0,"In honor of the ‘recent’ release of the latest Dan Brown book Origin, we thought it prudent to revisit the classics. Having already read Angels and Demons, The Davinci Code, and Inferno it was only fitting to complete the series with The Lost Symbol. Usually forgotten since there was no movie deal tied to the book, The Lost Symbol tends to get, well, lost. Having never really heard much about it, I assumed it was kinda shitty. I couldn’t have been more wrong.This 500 page thriller took me less than a week to read, and succeeded in keeping me on the edge of my seat, so to speak. Usually here at Better Read than Dead our reviews have spoilers, especially on books we didn’t enjoy. But this one’s going to be different. The twist at the end was just too good to give away, so this is going to be a spoiler free review. The first appeal to any Dan Brown book, I’m talking the Robert Langdon series here, is the short chapters. This really helps with the flow of the story and he balances it in a way where you don’t feel like you’re jumping around from POV to POV too quickly. When you set out to read a 500 page book, it can seem a little daunting. Brown helps alleviate some of that anxiety. Now let's dive in. As an avid fan of conspiracy theories, I love how Dan Brown turns something ordinary into something extraordinary. Not only does his subject matter come from real life, he presents it in a way that’s entirely believable. Every place visited is real, every organization mentioned actually exists, and every ritual is researched. If you know nothing about this series, here’s a short summary. Basically Robert Langdon (portrayed in the movies by Tom Hanks <3) is a Harvard professor whose specialty is Symbology. This intellectual gets dragged into some truly wild situations. From searching for the Holy Grail, to dissuading an Illuminati plot, this man has seen it all. There’s usually some backlash from the uber religious people who are triggered by his subject matter. It’s all based on real information and historical documents, which probably makes religious people hate it more. The second book, but first movie (The DaVinci Code) was based on the premise that Jesus had a wife (Mary Magdalene) and therefore possibly a bloodline. So you can see where that might upset some people. Anyway, back to The Lost Symbol. The Lost Symbol delves into the world of the Freemasons and their influence in Washington, D.C. It’s got a National Treasure vibe so if you dig that then you’ll really enjoy this book. The version of the book that I have is the ‘Special Illustrated Edition’. Basically it just includes a lot of nice pictures and graphics. Whenever a new historical destination is mentioned, there’s a picture of the building. All the paintings mentioned are shown, so it really helps draw you into the story. It also helps you visualize what’s going on and helps you follow Langdon’s mental process. (Rumor has it this book didn’t get a movie because National Treasure 2 had just came out and they thought it was too similar and wouldn’t do well. Another rumor was that they were working on the screenplay for a while, and by that point Inferno had already been written, and the studio said ‘Nevermind, we’re gonna do Inferno instead’. We all know how that turned out *Insert the biggest eye roll you can imagine*. I have a lot of opinions on the movie Inferno, maybe we’ll do a post about it sometime. Anyway long story short they changed the ending from the book and it pissed me off.) It’s hard to talk about this book without giving anything away. The biggest take away should be that if you know Dan Brown’s work, then you know what to expect from this book. A decently written, action packed, conspiracy based journey through the world of hidden symbols and a tweed wearing Harvard professor. While this might not be my favorite in the series, it was still a thrilling read worth your time. *Immediately plans a trip to DC*Better Read than Dead,Geneva & Addie ",2,0.9183,0.063,0.849,0.088,0.4601157680703135,POSITIVE,0.553

I find myself so drawn in by the puzzles, the mysteries, the discussions of philosophy – those are the plot points which keep bringing me back to this series. I have so much that I want to say about this book and a lot of it is going to be very spoiler filled – so please, if you have an interest in reading this book in the future and don’t want to be spoiled be mindful of the spoiler tag!(view spoiler)[Character DevelopmentI have written before about Brown’s use of characters and character development, his most notable trope being the building up of characters in a positive light only to later discover that they were the antagonist all along. I feel that Brown improved his character development skills in this novel because it didn't utilize the exact same trope, though what he did with his characters does remain somewhat close.Let's start with the character Inoue Sato, she is built up in such a way that the reader is immediately put off by her. The reader is made to feel as if she is hiding information which ultimately makes her seem untrustworthy. We are then sympathetic and understanding when Langdon chooses to escape from the company of Sato and her CIA unit with Katherine Solomon, but we are ultimately left to wonder this - If Sato had shown the tape of the Masonic rituals to Langdon upon first meeting him, how different would the progression of events have been? Running from the CIA certainly adds a layer of anticipation and suspense, but at the same time Langdon and Sato were both working towards the same goal although their motivations differed. Oddly, I found myself really liking Sato - she is everything I would have expected of a high ranking official of the CIA, her entire demeanor was that of a person who demands respect and is deserving of it. She managed her team well and had excellent instincts when it came to decision making, overall she was just a very interesting character and I think it would have been incredibly interesting to actually witness Langdon and Sato truly working together towards a goal as partners.My next bit of character discussion is in regards to the Solomon family, specifically Peter and Zachary, and the character Mal'akh. The fact that it turned out Mal'akh was actually Zachary the whole time seriously threw me for a loop, I found myself reading it over and over because I just wasn't expecting that twist while I was reading. Now that I have taken some time to actually reflect on it, I feel like I should have made the connection much sooner because truthfully I doubt that a stranger from a prison who just so happened to overhear the conversation Peter had with the warden about the release of his son would go to such lengths to destroy an entire family unless there were strong emotional ties to such a feat especially after acquiring the wealth that Zachary had for yourself - it just isn't likely. The anger and hatred that Mal'akh carried around in him towards Peter and his family was incredibly frightening because there is a potential for such strong feelings of anger, hatred, and hurt inside all of us towards those who wrong us - it is an incredibly scary thought. Yet, through all of this Peter couldn't bring himself to further hurt his son...he couldn't bring himself to kill his son even after all of the wrong that Mal'akh did to him including the removal of his right hand! I doubt that I would have had the strength that Peter had to just walk away. (hide spoiler)]Matters of Philosophy and ReligionI think this novel in The Robert Langdon Series, so far, has had the most resonating impact on me on a personal level. I've spoken before about how I was raised Mormon and left the church at the age of 19 for various reasons. One of the things I have always had a difficult time accepting when it has come to organized religion is the idea of heaven being exclusionary towards those who faith differs from your own. I have always been of the thought that if there is a god and a heaven that all who lived their lives in a positive manner would be welcomed, regardless of what faith or religion you practice. I found myself agreeing with a lot of the ideas and practices of the Freemasons, specifically their celebrations of their being one universally accepting god and the idea of at-one-ment (not atonement). The very thought of at-one-ment is incredibly interesting because it truly embraces the idea of apotheosis. Apotheosis on an individual level is fascinating, true there is its literal meaning which is ""make a god of"" but it also can be described as ""the highest point in the development of something; culmination or climax."" What if the idea of apotheosis is an individual reaching their highest point of development, or their highest point of understanding? One of the quotes which is mentioned multiple times is ""Know ye not that ye are gods?"" from Hermes Trismegistus, and it poses a very interesting question. There have been debates that one of the faculties which most differentiates humans from animals is that humans have the ability to create - the power to create has also long been thought to be a power of the gods, so it stands to reason that perhaps humans are a type of god. I won't go so far to suggest that we are the gods of the entirety of the universe, but there is a little bit of god in each of us - it is in our ability to create as much as it is in our ability to destroy.TL;DR Review: I keep bouncing back and forth between rating this book at 4 stars, but I just can't do it because while I enjoyed the book overall it just didn't feel like a 4 star read to me. There were just too many points where I found myself struggling to read the book which was frustrating because I really wanted to enjoy it and like it. It is likely to be one of those books I'll read once and probably not read again for a very long time. I'll be moving on to Inferno very soon and I am hoping that I will be impressed or at least less negative, otherwise I don't know whether or not I will continue the series should Dan Brown choose to release another Robert Langdon novel in the future.",2,0.9988,0.064,0.78,0.156,0.4823860750360749,NEGATIVE,0.9892
273,3820496507,02/07/2021,4.0,"Robert Langdon is one of my favourite characters - whether it's his adorable Mickey Mouse watch, the way he dresses, his exquisite brain, or his ability to find an adventure even when he's not looking for it.In a quick summary, this - like many of Dan Brown's other novels - is a romp around a famous city, where Robert Langdon and co solve mysteries with art and science and religion. With the back-drop of Washington DC, I was hooked from the offset because I am a HUGE sucker for American history, and any American themed conspiracy theories (hence why I've watched the National Treasure movies countless times). As always in this series of books, there's some kind of conspiracy, a threat to prevent something major from happening, a relentless villain, and a search for hidden secrets. Using a mixture of arcane history, symbolism, art and architecture, Langdon navigates around DC to prevent the reveal of a huge secret and the exposure of Freemason’s practices, whilst evading the CIA, a villain trying to locate The Lost Symbol and he is also trying to track down a kidnapped friend and his sister. It's a fast-paced entertaining read, and I was immersed completely in the high-stakes operations that take place across one evening. It has classic Dan Brown-style mayhem with CIA chases, and religious connotations aplenty, and I personally found the focus on Freemasonry to be fascinating. Whilst it's not as complex as others in the series, it still provides that escapism and still had my brain working to try and solve the puzzle alongside Langdon. My one major shortcoming is the phrase 'neutered sex organ' which quite frankly was used far too many times than is necessary, but this, alongside Dan Brown's inability to use certain verbs, is, unfortunately, part and parcel of his work - so I will take it with a pinch of salt.

As I started I did not think I would find this as good as the previous two, but as I got deeper, the ride got just as wild.

To what degree is any part of the science or history accurate I cannot attest to, but I don’t think anyone is reading this for that reason.If you want real accounts of history, science or religion this wouldn’t be the book to read, in my opinion.The story was a tad drawn out, again, as usual and we don’t get to learn all that is to know about the main bad guy until the very end. The reveal of who and what that person was was a real shocker and I didn’t see it coming. I like surprises like that.Overall great setting, interesting characters, good pacing.

(other than the fact hes a terrible writer) i liked the da vinci code better but maybe it’s bc i read it first and this plot line became predictable bc it was pretty similar. loved how it was set in dc but i was like- i’ve been there yay. okay that is a lot maybe i should stop writing these right after i finish. this is my 50th book for the year. merry Christmas ",2,0.9841,0.092,0.663,0.245,0.5791486291486293,NEGATIVE,1.0
