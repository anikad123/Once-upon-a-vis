It's a thriller. Cynthia's 14 when her mom, dad, and older brother disappear one night. Their cars are missing. Their beds aren't slept in. There's no trace of them.Were they murdered? Kidnapped? Did they leave and abandon their daughter? It's three decades later and no one has any idea. But Cynthia is permanently scarred by what happened and she's living with the damage, which is affecting her marriage and her 8-year-old daughter, who is overprotected by Cynthia.But now strange things are happening. Cynthia is getting strange e-mails, letters, and calls. An old hat of her father's shows up on the kitchen table one day. And people are getting murdered......This book had a solid, interesting story - but Linwood Barclay is no Jeff Abbott, in my opinion. For a thriller, you could do a lot worse than this. The mystery is fast-paced, exciting, mysterious, and makes relative sense.However, I didn't feel very connected to the characters or their stories. Barclay could have done a better job on making me care for his MCs. The book is narrated by Terry - Cynthia's husband. I thought I liked him for a long time, but eventually he started grating on me with his distrust of his own wife and his occasional stupidity....Tl;dr - Not a bad book, or a bad thriller. I just think Jeff Abbott's work is better. Or Zoë Sharp's The Blood Whisperer. They specialize in this kind of fast-paced thriller novel. Eric Plume and Robert B. Parker might also be good choices if you want a more ""hard-boiled P.I."" flavor.Overall, an okay book.

I was constantly checking and unchecking boxes, second guessing my ideas as to ‘who dunnit’. My assumptions were partly correct, and I enjoyed trying to work it out. Cynthia finds herself abandoned by her family one day, she’s woken up one day and they’ve simply vanished. The story continues on the 25th anniversary of Cynthia’s disappearance, when she has a family of her own and is desperate to find out exactly what happened. Are they dead or alive? How could they have left her alone? Many red herrings later, and a lot of enjoyable characters were introduced along the way. I liked this book, not loved, I can actually see this review is a little flat! Looks like I should review by books straight after reading, I don’t have a lot to say about this one.

9,226300982,10/22/2011,2.0,"I only recently discovered this author's books when I read THE ACCIDENT. since I loved that, I then read TOO CLOSE TO HOME and loved it too. I then started reading this clunker and was surprised to find that Barclay had written such a dud. The book begins with look back 25 years into the past when then 14 year old wild child Cynthia wakes up the morning after she had been found making out and drinking in a car with an older boy by her dad Clayton. Once home, she runs upstairs yelling back to dad Clayton and mom Patricia that she hates them and wishes they were dead. She is surprised to find her parents' and even her older brother Todd's beds made up, no one home, no note saying where her mom has gone ( Mom always leaves one.) and no breakfast fixings. At school, the guy she was caught with asks where Todd is. Cynthia had presumed he had been driven to school by their mom and that their mom went shopping afterwards and that her dad is off to one of his trips (he travels a lot in his work.) but now she realizes something is wrong. She rushes home and her neighbor calls the police. One cop suspects she had done something to the family. Fast forward 25 years and Cynthia is married to high school English teacher Terry and is the mom of 8 year old Grace. They live a short distance from the home everyone disappeared from (she had gone to live with her mother's sister Aunt Tess after that happened)and she works part time in the dress shop of her old friend from high school Pamela. The crime-stopper program DEADLINE is filming a segment of what happened to her 25 years ago in hopes of breaking the cold case and finding out what happened. Unfortunately it does not bring in any calls but it does disturb something from the past. What don't I like about this book by an author I do enjoy reading? Here are a few reasons:(1) I did not like or even empathize with any of the characters. I love children but 8-year-old Grace does nothing but whine about the fact that her mother walks her to school instead of letting her walk alone. She is a pip. It is constant through the book and terribly annoying. I didn't like the young or the grown up Cynthia who has a personality that alternates from a nutcase to a zombie. Who would date this woman, marry her, want to father kids with her? Well, obviously Terry who is so boring who would want him anyway? Mr. Perfect has his hands full with these two females. It is never good when you kind of what somebody bad to get hold of the whole lot of them and shake them up some.(2) For a high school English teacher, Terry is woefully lacking in grammar, usage, and language skills. Wouldn't he know that it should be ""Grace and I went to the store."" rather than ""Me and Grace went to the store.""? He also uses, and has Grace saying, ""fox pass"" for ""faux pas"". I would think that a teacher would want to speak properly in front of his own kids and teach her to do the same. In class also, he both uses profanity and allows his students to write it in their assignments which schools do not allow.(3) The back story of Cynthia's dad defies belief. It turns out that when he was young, he had been tricked into marriage by a truly evil woman named Enid who had pretended to be pregnant. She then faked a miscarriage (the doctor told him there was no pregnancy nor miscarriage). He stayed with her though he had grounds (in those days you needed grounds) for an annulment because of fraud but he stayed and they had a son Jeremy. Enid was obsessed with the child, kept Clayton from having a relationship with him, and turned him against his dad. Unhappy Clayton met Patricia on a business trip, fell in love, and married her (yes, still married to Enid). The problem here is that he got fake ID but we are to believe that the marriage license bureau for the state would not check the ID with the driver's license office (they DO check). We are also to believe that while he lived in New York with Enid and Jeremy, he also maintained a household in Connecticut with Patricia and their 2 kids Todd and Cynthia using fake ID. In 26 years he never got stopped by cops on the road. Though the last names were different- how did he pay taxes? How did he get insurance in two names? There are many little practical things the author did not think through. (4) What happened on the day Cynthia's family disappeared is also a flight of fancy. Enid has found a phone bill from the home Clayton shared with Patricia and their kids.She checked things out and found out he was a bigamist and saw Patricia and Todd (but not Cynthia). Todd looks just like Clayton and also Enid's own son Jeremy. We are to believe that this forty-something woman followed Patricia and Todd to the store in broad daylight and cut their throats with no struggle and no one seeing her do it, called Clayton to come help her dispose of the bodies, then forced him to come with her, never travel anymore, and never follow up on Cynthia. Honestly! If I had gotten a call like that, I would have gone where she was with the bodies, police in tow!! Surely no guy is that stupid! (5) The school principal Rolly is near retirement age and we find that he, Terry's boss, has also killed several people which of course Terry uncovers and is almost killed by him too. (6) Clayton's will leaves everything to Cynthia. Enid somehow felt suspicious (why?) and gets the lawyer's secretary to show it to her. She and Jeremy then set out to kill Cynthia and Grace and then Clayton and Terry as well. You would think all of this would be very exciting but frankly I couldn't care less about any of the characters and was distracted by the little details and lack of reality too much to buy it as real.

14,872557058,03/05/2014,1.0,"No Time For Goodbye opens with teenaged and hung-over Cynthia Bigge waking up to an empty home. Her family - father, mother and brother - having disappeared without so much as a note. Fast forward 25 years, Cynthia is now married with a daughter of her own and the story takes off from there. Well, actually it creeps along from there - never a good thing for a ""thriller"" - one of the major problems with this book.No Time For Goodbye is reminiscent of books by Chris Mooney and Harlan Coben, i.e. taking an ""ordinary"" person and putting them in very extraordinary circumstances. Terry Archer - Cynthia's husband - narrates the tale of the ups and downs of living with his wife who is still haunted by her family's disappearance. Cynthia believes her family is still alive and ""out there"", and thus possibly having abandoned her, she doesn't have closure. After appearing on a pseudo Cold Cases TV show strange things begin to pop up which suggest that Cynthia may be correct.To give credit where credit is due the central hook or plot twist which drives this story is fairly ingenious, unfortunately the narrative around it is doled out piecemeal and at times excruciatingly slow, drip by drip as if from an eye-dropper. I also found Terry and Cynthia unrealistic - for instance Cynthia, an understandably over-protective mother, abandons her daughter without a second thought in the middle of a crowded shopping mall to chase a man who looks like her long lost brother. When Terry follows her lead, she blows up at him for leaving their daughter alone in the Food Court. The book is full of such incongruities concerning our protagonists. Because of this I found it difficult to work up any empathy for these two and at times found them downright aggravating.The supporting cast of relatives, friends, co-workers and even a therapist, pop in and out of the story and are one-dimensional, supplying the requisite sympathy or asking the obvious questions. All the law enforcement characters are brusque, unsympathetic and incompetent.The anti-climactic conclusion, much like the book, drags on for much too long. Although entertaining at times I found No Time For Goodbye a sub-par thriller.A quick note on the book’s “language"", something I usually don't notice let alone get offended by.

20,478045323,12/15/2012,4.0,"No Time For Goodbye is one of those books that grab your attention from the very first page. Not having read any of the author’s books I had no idea what to expect from the story but it was definitely a pleasant surprise and I’m really glad I picked this up. I had a few minor issues with it – which I’m going to get to in a minute – and it wasn’t as fast paced as I anticipated but all in all, it was a gripping novel full of twists and turns and with a touching ending.Before I go even further, I have to warn you that this book is not for those people who get easily put off by the constant use of swear words. If you can stand it, go ahead – if you can’t, this one is not for you. Thankfully, I belong to the first category so it didn’t really bother me but I know it might be a big no-no for some people.The book has a great premise and, as unlikely as the disappearance of Cynthia’s family might seem at first, Barclay managed to keep me on the edge of my seat all the way till the end. The story is told by Cynthia’s husband, a high school English teacher, who was by far my favourite character. He has this dry sense of humour and this slightly sarcastic attitude which, I think, was a brilliant touch and was one of the reasons why I enjoyed this book as much as I did. I wasn’t that keen on Cynthia’s character but given that she lost her entire family for (seemingly) no reason whatsoever and has lived her entire life not knowing what happened, I could understand why she behaved the way she did.Generally, I’m pretty good at solving mysteries and putting all those little puzzle pieces together but in the case of No Time For Goodbye I was at a loss. I had absolutely no idea what was going on until quite late in the story, which made it a lot more interesting than some whodunnits I’ve read in the past. On top of that, Barclay did a brilliant job at making me feel just as insecure as the characters must have felt in their own home.What I didn’t particularly like, however, is the fact that the story was a lot slower than I expected it to be – it wasn’t as slow as to put me off but I would have liked it to be a bit more fast-paced at times. My other issue was with the last third of the book. Throughout the story I had a feeling that it was like watching a film – I could almost see the fear in their eyes and hear the creepy background music – which I really enjoyed at first. But then the whole thing seemed to turn into an extremely long (and quite implausible) car chase scene from an action movie, which did put me off a little bit. Just a little. It was still an enjoyable story and it didn’t make me want to put the book down, but it was still enough for me to say ‘it could have been much better’.All in all, I have to say I really liked Barclay’s style and will definitely pick up some of his other books. If you enjoy suspenseful books with big twists and you’re not offended by the constant use of the ‘f word’ then I would say this one was made for you. And believe me, just when you think you’ve figured it all out, there comes another twist and you’ll be just as clueless as you were before.",11,0.997,0.06,0.787,0.154,0.5351326699834161,POSITIVE,0.9983
21,41957859,01/05/2009,3.0,"Because this book had rave reviews, I feel justified in launching into a few criticisms.1.The first person narrator is a high school English teacher yet he insists on colloquialisms (or just plain bad grammar) such as, ""Me and Grace went to the store."" (Not an actual quote but close.) 2. The tone slips. When Vince comes on stage, we move from Stephen King creepiness to slapstick comedy. 3. Clearly the book was written for the movie version which means there's a lot of fast action with little attention to subtlety. Why,you might ask, am I reading a thriller if I want subtlety? Because there are lots of excellent authors who manage to do both (try James Lee Burke).4. On many occasions, the narrator mistrusts his wife. Rather than raising the tension, I felt I was being manipulated.5. Although interesting, the premise and the end don't work logically. [If you don't want the mystery to be given away . . .

24,33975322,09/27/2008,2.0,"After having a fight with her parents, fourteen year old Cynthia Bigge wakes up to find her entire family has mysterious vanished without a trace. Twenty-five years later, the mystery of just what happened to them remains unsolved, leading Cynthia to agree to a segment on a popular reality show in the hopes of finding a few answers about the past that haunts her.Following the show's airing, a series of mysterious events begins to occur including a mysterious car following her daughter, a fedora just like her father's showing up in the house and the suspicious death of a family member after talking to a private eye Cynthia hired to give her some closure. ""No Time For Goodbye"" has all the pieces that should make for a fun and entertaining thriller but is ultimately let down by its execution. For one thing, the story is told from her husband's point of view, allowing us little or not access into what Cynthia thinks or feels beyond the prologue establishing the events. There are also a variety of red-herrings and poorly explored side avenues in the story that rob the momentum Lindwood Barclay is trying to create at critical points.And that's even before we get to the ending. It's a Hollywood thriller type of ending, with random bits coming together in unconvincing ways that strain crediblity and will leave you with a sour taste in your mouth once the last page is turned. Yes, Cynthia gets some closure, but as a reader I was left wanting something more than what I got. ",9,-0.0387,0.074,0.849,0.077,0.4698067632850241,NEGATIVE,0.9996

26,979113373,06/27/2014,5.0,"Six stars! If you read No Time for Goodbye by Linwood Barclay before you go to bed, your mind will keep you awake trying to solve this intriguing mystery. Even though I was able to piece together some of the bits of this puzzle about why the family of a 14-year-old girl, Cynthia Bigge, vanished in the middle of the night without a trace, the whole picture did not come together for me until the very end.Most of the book focuses on that girl 25 years later, married to Terry Archer. They have an 8-year-old daughter, Grace, and everything is normal. Not. Beleaguered by unanswered questions of what happened that night after she passed out in a drunken stupor, Cynthia becomes obsessed with finding out what happened to her parents and older brother. Husband Terry, trying to find a balance between being a supportive partner and being a calm, rational role model for Grace, wishes that Cynthia would just accept that there may never be closure and that, for the sake of their daughter and their marriage, Cynthia needs to move on. Grace, for her part, takes solace in looking through her “piece of junk” telescope each night to make sure that no asteroids are going to crash into the earth and destroy them all. The couple is in counseling, but no amount of therapy can help once the strange phone calls and other events begin to occur. Terry begins to question his wife’s sanity and even wonders whether she has instigated these odd incidents. Mistrust and doubt between them grows. The freaky, unexplained happenings escalate, turning violent and sinister. You’ll find no spoilers here – I prefer to let Barclay’s work speak for itself.Some of the plot developments do seem questionable, but within the setting of the novel, not impossible. The characters, on the whole, felt real to me. The cussing, which may be off-putting to some, adds authenticity to the dialogue, I felt, and to me it was not any more offensive than, say, murder or child abandonment. Other readers have criticized that it moves too slowly. I found that the interplay between the Archers, the walking-on-eggshells dance that Terry had to do to keep Cynthia’s psyche from shattering, added depth and tension to the storyline. That is not to say that No Time for Goodbye is perfect or that it will appeal to all readers. But in my modest opinion, it is one of the very best thrillers I have read in a very long time. 5/5 stars",8,-0.9772,0.127,0.793,0.081,0.5111631944444446,POSITIVE,0.7396
27,704448789,08/26/2013,4.0,"Well, this was very entertaining.For some reason I had never heard of Linwood Barclay, until some of my Goodreads friends started raving about his latest.So I grabbed this one, his earliest, and he certainly lived up to the hype. This is a classic page-turner. There is no time to smell the roses along the way: the plot plows through, but not with as much expense to character development as you would find with many thrillers. Even though the development comes mainly through dialogue, it is sufficient enough to care enough about them to see the story through.The premise is excellent: a 14 year old girl wakes one morning to find her family has disappeared. Fast forward 25 years...Barclay did some fine things in this novel. Even when you reach points where you roll your eyes over what a character had done, this is actually justified or explained. And I really had no idea where this story was going to go. Neither did my girlfriend, and she can always figure these things out.From what I can gather, most of his books are of the ""domestic thriller"" variety, where things happen to ordinary people. This is a smart way to sell books! Also, I can gather that I have not read the best of him yet. It seems there are at least three more of his that are just as good or better than this one.

Dry, drab and monotone in his dialogue where any hint of feeling is executed in a cliche and considered fashion. There were points where I felt truly exasperated in the terrible writing, it felt like a story being typed out but someone who is not a writer.Writing aside, the storyline did I suppose have some merit as I finished the book despite the painful narrative. However nothing about it was actually believable. I understand thrillers often are not of the truthful nature, but I feel that no character was developed enough for the reader to understand motive or action.The same storyline could perhaps prosper in the hands of another.

Based on that alone, it sounded intriguing.And it was...for the most part.Here's the premise: a 14-year-old girl wakes up one morning to find her entire family missing without a trace. She grows up not knowing what happened to them and is, of course, mentally scarred for life.Fast forward twenty-five years. She's married, has an 8-year-old daughter that she won't let out of her sight and who has acquired her mother's neuroses. She's also agreed to go on one of those cheeseball 30-minute news shows in the hopes of gaining more clues to her family's disappearance.Then the weird stuff really starts to happen. Strange phone calls. Anonymous letters. A scene with a 'mysterious' fedora. [insert creepy music here]That's when the story starts to break down a little. The payoff, as it turns out, is disappointing and not to mention a little far-fetched. Especially the tie-in with the husband's boss that is eye roll-inducing.And, as happens all too often, the ending is too neat. Why does there always have to be a happy ending? I mean, sometimes the bad guys really do win out.The thing that irritated me the most was the fact that the book is told primarily in first person from the husband's point of view.

He assumed his father had waited for him to come home to kill him, too. Mortal Memory was a very good book. No Time for Goodbye was published in 2007, and the premise is a fourteen year old girl goes to bed drunk, wakes up to find her entire family missing. Nothing is out of place, they are simply gone. In spite of lack of blood or corpses, the premises are very similar. What Thomas H. Cook made into a great novel, Linwood Barclay makes into something of a circus routine. The first part goes well enough, with all the proper foreshadowing mystery readers expect, and live for in our books. Then once we make it to what lies at the heart of the mystery, it is totally ridiculous!

A fast read, not a lot of subplots but enough to keep book moving along. Some of today's writers seem to rely on gore and nasty details, but Barclay is not of that type.

It open 25 years later with Cynthia Biggs, the long abandoned daughter still looking to solve the mystery in her life.The book’s raison d’être is to disclose the mystery behind the disappearance and eventually solving the case. Mr. Barclay makes time for meticulous plotting, chapters are overflowing with details and no clue is left behind explanations. The narrator is Cynthia’s husband, Terry, who tries his best to cope with Cynthia’s tension went she is pushed over the edge after appearing on a TV show. She keeps on seeing things such as a recurring automobile, a stranger that looks like her brother, her father’s hat suddenly placed on the kitchen table. It may be a cliché to say that this novel is hard to put down, so true for me. This story has a great premise and a cast of people trapped in a terrifying situation. “No Time for Goodbye” has a large cast of characters, both past and present who plays parts in Cynthia’s life. I will spare you the details. Revealing too much will spoil both the journey of Terry has endured as well as the story’s conclusion.This is one of those stories that kept me hooked from the beginning till the end. The development of the characters is so well-done I really felt for them. I love the way the plot sawed back and forth: Terry wracked with doubt questioning his wife sanity then rallying to her side. The language is relevant and reflects what the characters are not afraid to say. Some would say this novel has an adult theme for that reason.This contemporary novel is fast paced and has the right amount of tension to deliver a neat and unexpected twist that makes this novel all worthwhile.",4,0.9608,0.072,0.802,0.126,0.4356325863678805,POSITIVE,0.9999

The plot is fairly unique and unusual (I'll only quote from the book cover to avoid spoilers: ""You wake up, your house is empty, your family has disappeared..."") Barclay is a good storyteller, so that's a 4.5, he held my interest throughout even in the early stages where there was a lot of background history to reveal. He's not Hemingway (""The pain shot through me like a bolt of lightning"" - gee, never read that one before! So that's only a 3.) The characters are for the most part well-developed. And, like Coben, he does add touches of humor (my fav was the three thugs who work for a crime boss, one loads a cassette tape playing ""Close To You"" by The Carpenters into the car stereo.) While you will guess some developments or potential evil-doers, I think you'll find a few twists that wil surprise you. I've read other reviewers who felt this wasn't Barclay's best. That's good news because I enjoyed this thriller and will look forward to reading some more by this author. ",4,0.9745,0.05,0.776,0.174,0.611574074074074,POSITIVE,0.9996

I think I've read about all the possible ways to kill, maim, torture and otherwise visit horror on other human beings by everything from psycho killers to sick parents to atrocious kids. I am getting tired of all the violence and the depravity.Now lately, thank heavens I read a good story. No Time for Goodbye was a good thriller. There was no obvious horror mayhem, despite there being two murders, but the descriptions were not detailed and you know, that was fine. I got the point. Murder is awful. And nobody was tortured, no animals mutilated, and the plot zipped along and the story was intriguing. I think I need more recommendations for books like that rather than the ones where the author is compelled to detail every cut of the knife or every despicable act committed by someone who is the spawn of Satan.Does anyone else feel that way or is it just me? I `m tired of wallowing in the gore and just want a good story with the details left a little to the imagination. This is for you!! I also listened to the audio of this book and it was well done!

Without a doubt I will be reading more as I have yet to be disappointed by his work. Whilst this was not my favourite of my three Barclay reads it was another great read.One thing I found out in reading this book is that I probably should have read the books in order. One of the characters is referenced in another book meaning I was aware of what happened to them – a very big oops moment – yet that did not stop me from enjoying the read. Admittedly it ruined the shock factor with events, but even then it was great to know how things really happened, to finally know the actual story. I will not, however, be telling you who or what I’m on about, as it would ruin the surprise. I’m just saying, if you plan to jump on the Linwood Barclay wagon I suggest doing so in published order – whilst the stories aren’t interconnected in the way that series are you do find characters appearing in more than one book.Compared to the other two books I have read, this one was a bit slower to start. However, once the ball was rolling it was a truly great read.

I was hooked from page one and particularly loved the author's use of two narratives.

What a maze of possibilities... and the twists and turns :o in true Barclay fashion, things aren't always what they seem... but sometimes they are. First off, let me say if profanity offends you, this is not for you. There's plenty of it, used as an expression of frustration for the main characters, husband and wife. I just let it go over my head and concentrate on the plot line. The husband, Terry, is a teacher and should know better. They have an impressionable 8 year old daughter who's around most of the time. Cynthia is his wife, in present day. When the novel opens, Cynthia is a freshman in high school who often pushed the limits with her loving parents. After a night of drinking too much with a guy of questionable character, and fighting with her parents about it afterwards she is sent to bed, passes out, and when she wakes up the next morning she finds her family vanished into thin air, including her only brother and both her parents vehicles. It was an overwhelming experience she never got over. Did they abandon her?... did they get abducted? killed?... what happened to them? No one knows, nor can she ever apologize or find any answers. She loved her parents and her brother dearly, but in the course of arguing with her dad, her last teenage-typical words to him were ""I hate you, I wish you were dead."" Fast forward 25 years to the anniversary of the event, and new ""things"" relating to that experience start happening to her. She is now married to Terry, the teacher, who knows about her troubled past. He is beginning to wonder if his wife is imagining things, the stress of always wondering getting to her. She is paranoid about leaving their young daughter alone or unsupervised because ""anything can happen."" Well ominous things start happening, all right, and it's driving them all crazy, and in the process has the reader riveted. I thought it was well executed. The characters and supporting characters well developed and believable. One thing bothered me. Throughout the novel, there were short italicized inserts of two people speaking to each other, and the reader not knowing who they are, or how it relates to the plot line. Just to get you the reader, thinking. Eventually Barclay brings it all together, quite skillfully, I might add. If you are a Harlan Coben fan, this will appeal to you. The writing styles are very similar. I've read both these authors over the years and they continue to entertain and beguile me. Highly recommended to suspense/thriller fans.PS: for those that may not know, there is a sequel ""No Safe House""",2,-0.71,0.115,0.775,0.11,0.5136391386391387,NEGATIVE,0.8676

""What if..""...scary, huh?Fourteen years old, Cynthia, causes her parents much trouble staying out late at night, disobeying and fighting.

I needed a little time to think about what I wanted to say.First, I think it was well written, there were times when I got sucked in and ending up reading longer than I meant to, and that's always a good sign.I liked the way the story unfolded even though there were times when I had no idea what to think and in general I don't really care for that feeling, but it was definitely a mystery.For those of you who have read my reviews before, you have probably noticed my trust issues, they came out full force in this book for sure, in fact, if Grace hadn't been an 8 year old, I would have been side-eyeing her. I trusted no one. Well, I did trust Terry, I liked him a lot, and well, honestly Vince was probably my favorite side character.My main problem with this book is Cynthia. Now, I understand we are supposed to be sympathetic towards her, feel for her, be scared for her, hell wonder about her mental state, but I...well, I hated her. I felt sorry for her for about ten minutes (view spoiler)[ somewhere between family disappearance and the fake psychic (hide spoiler)] and then...no. I just fucking hated her. I hated what she was doing to her family and I hated how she treated her husband and I hated that she couldn't see what she was doing to her daughter and that she had some strange sense of entitlement to her crazy behavior. So yeah...she probably knocked a star off this book.I will say as far as endings go, this was a good one, nothing was too easy to figure out, I saw where part of it was going and while I may have been suspicious of a few people due to the aforementioned trust issues, I didn't know the why of it.

The night before she had a fight with her parents and the unpleasant thought that perhaps this was some cruel punishment creeps to her mind. The police investigate this strange disappearance but don’t find a single clue.The trauma envelopes Cynthia’s life like a blanket of darkness, even when she becomes a wife and a mother to a family of her own. The plot quickly receives a sharp twist that kickstart the entire story: after airing a TV special about the old family tragedy, unexplainable things begin to occur. Her father’s old fedora hat appears at her house, but there is no sign for forced entry. A threatening phone call Cynthia claims to have gotten, but with no record of it on her phone. A mysterious email sent to Cynthia from what appears to be a fake email address… Terry, her husband, who is narrating the story from his point of view, can’t help but wonder if Cynthia is really the victim or perhaps…?The story is well told, in a fluent and witty language. The author spreads plenty of question marks, which enhance the interest along the plot, and makes sure to answer every last one of them, leaving no loose ends – as any good thriller should do. Overall, it was an intriguing and suspenseful read that had made me want to read more of this author. ",2,-0.9639,0.159,0.748,0.094,0.5725139058472392,POSITIVE,0.9951
89,188633507,07/24/2011,4.0,"""No Time For Goodbye"",""Linwood Barclay""  ""I recently read three of the mystery stories by Linwood Barclay. He is a writer who was new to me, and writes about ordinary people with all their flaws who get entangled in extraordinarily dangerous situations. The people in his stories seem very real and the situations believable. This was a page turner. Imagine a young girl aged 14, waking up one morning after a fight with her parents. She is alone in the house. Her mother, father and brother have vanished without a trace, with no note as to their whereabouts. The story jumps in time to 25 years later. She is married and has a young daughter. She has continued to be distressed about the past, and is seeing a psychiatrist. Her husband is supportive, but when a series of incidents relating to the past tragedy start to happen, the husband and police begin to doubt her. Is her family alive? If so why were they never in touch? Were they murdered? Her beloved aunt who raised her from the time her family vanished plays a major role. Why is someone watching the home where she now lives with her husband and little girl? Is someone breaking into the home and leaving notes written on husband's typewriter. Is she, herself, doing this to get police attention in her stressed state, or maybe her husband is the culprit? They hire a private detective. The plot moves quickly and the husband joins forces with the most unlikely person in order to try to solve the mystery. For those who like mystery stories this is a book difficult to put down.""",2,-0.9296,0.106,0.83,0.063,0.4795180976430977,POSITIVE,0.6853

What made me lower my rating of this book was the fact that the narrator is a high-school English and creative writing teacher who, on occasion, uses incorrect grammar; who manages to stay out of school whenever he has to deal with family problems (he's friends with the principal, so evidently he can do what he wants); he describes his creative writing class as a bunch of misfits who evidently hate school (but creative writing is an elective, so kids who take it usually want the class); he actually uses the ""f"" word with the class (he'd better be really, really good friends with the principal!); he never seems to have to write a lesson plan for his series of subs; he never has papers to grade--in all, he is NOT a high-school English teacher that I have ever seen or known. Because the portrayal of his job was so unrealistic, I became quite annoyed.Secondly, the story supposedly begins in May, 25 years after his wife, then 14, woke up one morning to find that her dad, her mom, and her older brother had just disappeared. As far as I was able to tell, the story took place in a few weeks after the anniversary. Yet school continued to be in session--and it was not described as summer school.If a book is going to be published, then either the author or the editor or . . . somebody! needs to pay attention to details that are bothersome and annoying.But--as I said, the story is interesting and it's a fast read.",2,0.9366,0.049,0.853,0.098,0.5286231884057971,NEGATIVE,0.9941

The characters were good and although they made some rather dumb moves, they were the dumb moves any normal person might make. The problem was that I didn’t feel that involved with the characters. In fact, my favorite characters where three rather minor characters and the best part of the book came with a group a criminals toward the end. I figured out way too easily where the story was going, the motive required a major suspension of believe and the end of the book fell apart a bit for me.

Beds are made, no signs of breakfast-leftovers, a note or anything to explain. 25 years later the girl is happily married with an 8yr-old daughter of her own. She does a TV-bit on her vanished family members, hoping someone will finally step up to tell her something about their fate. Instead weird things start to happen that imply her family might still be alive after all these years.That part I liked.

After having the bomb drop, that's when I remembered all the subtle (and not so subtle, smack you in the head) clues. Linwood is one of my favorite authors these days in the thriller category.

In fact, the author seems to struggle to create his ordinary, decent characters who have simply experienced some extraordinary and tragic events in their lives. These characters come off as awkward stiffs and I don’t like the results. I say ordinary to avoid calling the book boring because, if it was so boring, why did I finish reading it? I don’t know.

They are spotted by her father who immediately hauls Cynthia back home. Following a huge family row Cynthia storms off to her bedroom, locks the door, and falls into an all-consuming slumber. In the morning, Cynthia -- full of remorse, goes downstairs to find that her whole family has vanished. There’s no note of explanation, no signs of life, and no clues as to their whereabouts.Understandably Cynthia is worried because, even 25 years later, her family’s disappearance remains a complete mystery.She marries a high school English teacher named Terry Archer, and they share a modest house in Milford, Connecticut, USA with their 8-year-old daughter, Grace -- not far from the Bigges’ old home on Hickory Street. Terry has had to cope throughout their marriage with Cynthia’s longing to learn the fate of her family. Naturally, rumours about what really happened have formed and spread over the last quarter-century.After her parents and brother vanished, Cynthia was brought up by her aunt Tess Burman, so their bond is strong. Cynthia tells Terry that Tess struggled to raise her, not just emotionally but also financially, as she had a modest job. Somehow, though, Tess, made sure that Cynthia went to  university and graduated.Then things start to go seriously south for the Archer family.  Cynthia spots a brown car in their neighbourhood, following her and Grace. Fearing for her daughter’s safety, she starts projecting her paranoia onto Terry. They visit her aunt Tess who speaks to Terry and tells him a secret that she has kept from Cynthia all these years.  After visiting Tess, Cynthia and Terry discover that their house has been broken into, and left on their kitchen table is a tatty black fedora hat -- the same type of hat that Cynthia’s father, Clayton, used to wear. Cynthia becomes convinced that her family are not dead.As with all good literary thrillers, No Time for Goodbye is a difficult novel to review, because revealing too much will spoil both the journey the characters have to endure, and the story’s twisting conclusion.  I can say that the disappearance of Cynthia Bigge’s family was far more complex than even she imagined.When I finally finished reading No Time for Goodbye, I sat in silence for a moment gathering my thoughts about an extremely clever novel.",0,0.7642,0.084,0.825,0.091,0.4953306878306877,POSITIVE,0.9345

When fourteen year-old Cynthia Bigge wakes the morning after a huge fight with her parents, the house is too quiet for a school day. She had been caught drunk with a boy whom Patricia and Clayton Bigge did not approve. She checks the entire house - her shock and panic increasing as she moves from room to room. No note either; her mother always leaves one. She had yelled at her mother last night, wishing she would die. Now in the light of day, she wishes she could take bake all of her words. The house is empty. Her family is gone. Why? The now adult Cynthia is standing in front of her childhood home, close to the 25th anniversary of family's disappearance. The TV camera's rolling. Maybe the TV show will bring some clues to what has happened to her mother, father, and brother. And by answering the What, she may find out the Why. Why did they lePOVave? Why did they leave her behind? The answers may help to ease the strain in her marriage and her daughter's anxiety, too. Aunt Tess needs to know what happened to her sister also, though she's never said exactly those words to Cynthia. She had tried mightily to step into Patricia's Bigge's shoes.  The crank calls begin soon after the telecast airs. But one call begins a sinister chain of sinister events. ""Your family want to forgive you,""said the anonymous voice. A Strange car follows Cynthia as she walks Grace to school. A man is seen watching the house at night. An email appears after her father's fedora magically appears on the kitchen table. But when two murders are committed, Cynthia knows that she, her husband, and daughter are in grave danger. And all of the evidence is pointing towards her. The premise is very good, but the execution was awful. The story is told in the 1st person from Terry Archer's POV and intermittent phone conversations from the ""bad guys."" I enjoyed those, because they brought the suspense level up, but Terry's 1st person POV drove me crazy. It's Cynthia'a story after all. I can see how Mr. Barclay chose to tell the story that way, and can even understand his decision. But I can't understand why the characters were so underdeveloped. Huge chucks of dialogue could have been left out also without damaging the storyline. The reader really has to stretch to believe the ending. But No Time For Goodbye is an easy and fast read perfect for the beach or plane. ",0,0.3579,0.091,0.824,0.085,0.6449999999999999,NEGATIVE,0.9975

The beginning and the end were strong and full of twists and surprises, but found myself comfortably predicting what was going to happen in the middle section,I felt it started to get a bit slow in the middle of the novel, and was debating whether I was going to finish the book or not, however It started to pick back up and I am happy I kept reading it. Once I was passed page 195 and the clues were popping and Vince was added to the scene, then the story came to life.I was surprised when I realized the first person narrator was Cynthia's husband, Terry and I'm still trying to figure out whether I liked that or not, It was the first time I have read a thriller from the point of view from anyone else besides the victim.Cynthia is a 14 year old teenager and starting to rebel(staying out past curfew, drinking, smoking, dating boys ect) she comes home late one night and after a heated argument with her parents she says some things she will later regret.The next morning she wakes up and there is no one in the house, she thinks mom has dropped off her brother, Todd to school and dad has left home to get to work himself, when she gets home there is still no one in the house, her mom always leaves a note for her if she is leaving to go somewhere and when she cannot find one, she becomes worried.25 years later she is married to Terry and has a daughter Gracie and she still wonders what has happened to her family. A Local news station offers to do a segment on this unsolved case, in hopes of someone hearing the story and shedding some light on what happened. Cynthia starts noticing a unfamilar car in the neighborhood and things start happening which leaves Cynthia's family believing she is starting to go crazyThere were a few characters in this book that were not needed,Lauren the P.E teacher is one, She held no point to the story what so ever. As well as Pam, if she was Cynthia's best friend, you would think she would have been supporting Cynthia and all her theories and thoughts, WRONG.

184,1302113884,06/08/2015,3.0,"This felt like Thriller by numbers. If you don't get that I mean it's like Linwood Barclay saw a How To guide on how to write a thriller and followed it to the letter. The plot was intriguing. Tearaway teenage girl wakes up after a drunken fight with her parents to find them and her older brother have finished seemingly into thin air. Fast forward 25 years and it's still a mystery as to what happened. Once set in the presence day the book switches narration to her husband. This was a wise choice as the wife (understandably) is still erratic at times trying to piece together what happened and we wouldn't have got much intelligent or interesting insight other than ""I need to find out what happened"" and ""I don't understand why nobody will help me"" for the entire book. Being a thriller the pace is a quick one and for the most part is a page turner. Chapters end with cliffhangers making you want to continue straight away and unlike a crime novel the police work is left to someone else leaving you to follow the events through the eyes of the people it effects instead of just bringing them in whenever questions need to be asked. If you've read a few thrillers though very little will shock you. You'll see characters and it'll be like there's a big flashing light bulb above their head as if to say ""I'm hiding something, I'll be important to the plot development later on"". Likewise events will play out and it'll be obvious that something isn't right or it'll be revisited down the line. This wasn't a bad book. It was just too predictable. This kind of book needs its fair share of red herrings and there either wasn't any or I didn't really notice them. I'm going with the former. A quick note. Most reviews I've read on here simply focus on the swearing and the fact that even though the main character is an English teacher, his use of grammar is incorrect. Personally I don't think the swearing was all that OTT. Put yourself in some of the situations he finds himself in. are you going to say ""Oh dear that isn't good""? No. You're going to get angry / scared etc etc and swear your head off. As for the grammar. Yes he's a teacher, yes he knows the ""correct way"" to articulate a sentence but come on. Most people wouldn't say ""Cynthia and I"" they'd say ""Me and Cynthia"". It's how the average person speak and therefore it's how he speaks. To complain about it smacks of nothing more than snobbery.",0,0.898,0.042,0.865,0.093,0.4581995201181247,NEGATIVE,0.998
185,1595611529,03/30/2016,4.0,"No Time For Goodbye was another exciting read by Linwood Barclay. I've come to view his novels as pure entertainment and allow myself to be swept away in the bizarre problems his characters get tangled up in. Here, Cynthia awoke as a teenager to find her mother father and brother all gone from the family home. The missing person's case turned into a cold case, and twenty five years later Cynthia still wondered what happened to her family.Now married and with a child of her own, strange things started to happen as it appeared someone had knowledge of the whereabouts of her family.Told through the perspective of Cynthia s husband, Terry, he struggled to navigate the odd events that drew him into a mysterious ride that would lead to the truth about that fateful night. Terry's narration allowed him to vocalize his doubts about Cynthia's involvement in the disappearance of her family when she was a teenage, and also wonder whether she was behind the present suspicious activity.The first two chapters really took off but the next 100 pages were a bit slow. While some of those scenes laid the foundation for later events, some didn't and merely added unnecessary length to the book.This didn't really become a thriller until the last hundred or so pages, but then it sped up with force! The fact that there weren't any clues for the reader about the disappearance of Cynthia's family culminated in a powerful ending.If you've been reading my blogs, you know I love protagonists who unwillingly become heroes. Terry fit that profile perfectly. All he wanted was to be a good husband to Cynthia and help her continue to deal with the tragedy that befell her as a teen. But to be a good dad and husband he had to get to the bottom of whatever was going on. That meant teaming up with dangerous thugs, lying to the police, and hiding evidence. The scenes that established him as a devoted teacher who was respected by the students, further enhanced this good guy gone bad spin.I'm eager to read the next story in this series, which highlights Terry's mouthy and spunky daughter Grace.

186,93273233,03/09/2010,4.0,"Murder mysteries and thrillers are often the only types of novels I read. I have come across many, both weak and strong and even corny, but this is most definitely my favourite yet. For those of you who enjoy a strong story that can turn around in an instant or one with curious and appealing characters, I think you will agree.	And somehow Barclay does just that, distributes to you both. He mixes an assortment of writing styles and focuses deeply on many key ideas leading to capture a wide variety of audiences. You are able to engage with the characters and feel for yourself their emotions. I, for one, felt a very strong connection to Cynthia. I understood her emotions through out the novel and realized why she chose the choices she made. Losing a family member, or many in her case, is difficult and you will do anything to believe you can bring them back. I feel there is a way for everyone to connect with a character in this book, whether it is through guilt, sympathy, relationships, or experience. 	I think what kept me hooked was the suspense and a little trick he plays that I can’t quite figure out. Mostly towards the first quarter or so, after the introduction to Cynthia’s family vanishing without a trace, I felt there was nothing, no spark in the story, but I kept on needing to read because it felt as though there was something, something big that was going to happen. There was, too many chapters later, but still everything in between was interesting and eventually helpful, which I congratulate as great writing on Barclay’s part. I enjoy the way he moved the book from a slow yet intriguing mystery to a fast paced, edge of your seat thriller.	I finalize to give this book 4 stars because there were unusual moments, on the writing part, that came off a bit bizarre, but an excellent read overall I would recommend to any mystery thriller loving readers.

I enjoyed the ""voice,"" the story, and the pacing of No Time for Goodbye, although I did have a problem or two with the book over all. This plot is very carefully constructed. Seemingly unimportant objects mentioned casually are mentioned for a reason, and the same holds true for characters. Speaking of characters, my favorite was young Jane Scavullo, a troubled teen with so much potential. I don't know if she shows up in another Barclay novel, but I certainly wouldn't mind seeing her again.Now for the two things that rubbed me the wrong way. Quite frankly, I found main character Cynthia Bigge to be a royal pain in the neck. Everything is about her. No one can voice an opinion if it might be ""against"" her, and she's in real danger of smothering her young daughter. Yes, it's realistic behavior for someone whose family vanished without explanation, but that doesn't mean I have to like her.The other thing that bothered me was the explanation for what actually happened to Cynthia's parents and brother, so I can't say much about it without giving it away. I'll just say that Barclay's solution was a bit over-the-top for me, and I had trouble suspending my disbelief enough to accept it all.But Linwood Barclay can write like a house afire. I love his plots, I love his voice, and just because I didn't like one of his characters doesn't mean I'm going to stop reading his books!

Fourteen year old Cynthia Bigge woke that morning to find herself alone. Her family - mother, father and brother - had vanished without a word."" The actual story picks up some twenty-five years later as Cynthia deals with the questions raised by her past and attempts to find the solution to the mystery that has haunted her for most of her life.The hallmark of a superb psychological thriller is that, for the most part, nothing actually happens. What drives a reader to relentlessly turn the pages is imagination, atmosphere, character, ideas ... all of those literary devices that we used to hate when our English teacher talked about them. NO TIME FOR GOODBYE qualifies in spades. It's a dark, deeply atmospheric thriller driven mostly by what happens in the mind of the reader as opposed to what Barclay actually decided to really commit to the written word.You won't want to put this one one down.

293,3913648668,04/03/2021,2.0,"I by all means really enjoyed reading this book - it's engrossing, fast paced and thoroughly entertaining. It's very difficult to put down, and was just what I needed - a nice and light read intended as a break from more serious, valuable literature. But while the plot is adequately put together, the somewhat silly story and questionable writing bring the overall quality of the book down a notch.The events depicted in the book start with Cynthia back in 1983, a rebellious teenager who is dragged back home by her father, after a drunk night out. She wakes up the very next day, massively hungover, but is startled to discover that neither her parents nor her brother are home, and have left no indication as to their whereabouts. They seem to have simply vanished without a trace, and despite thorough investigations by the police, they are never found. The novel then jumps quarter of a century into the future, to 2008, and switches the perspective to Terry, Cynthia's husband. The two of them have a 8-year-old daughter called Grace, and while they are not exactly rich, they are getting by. However, Cynthia is still dealing with emotional scars due to the sudden dissapearance of her family - she was lucky to have her aunt Tess care for her after the others all vanished. This translates to her being a little overly protective with Grace, but at times also makes her paranoid - she thinks that she is being watched, and starts channelling more resources into her search for the truth. Terry is initially dismissive of her claims and behaviour, assigning them to increased stress, but soon starts observing strange patterns as well: someone following them, breaking into their house, sending them cryptic emails, and everything ultimately descends into a series of murders. The first third of the book is particularly engrossing, because these events start multiplying without really answering any questions, to the point where Terry starts doubting everyone, Cynthia included. Question marks arise from all directions, and lead to an almost paranoid state transcending the characters of the novel and seeping into the reader. However, once the wheels of the plot get firmly in motion, this aura of mystery sort of dissipates. This happens because of an increased focus of the pacing, and the shift to a unitary perspective. What should normally channel the forces of the plot ultimately ends up dilluting it.I said before that the plot is well structured - it definitely is. All details, no matter how apparently insignificant, do end up coalescning into a big puzzle. However, this ultimately harms character development, because it never extends beyond the practical nature of the plot - examples include Cynthia's tennis skills, Grace's faulty telescope and Terry's student. None of them are very interesting per se, and their scope of exploration does not go beyond the confines of the puzzle being built around them. The dialogue might be free-flowing, but lacks any sort of finesse or artistic sense - it's just there to layer the plot and provide windows of interaction between separate elements of it. And Lindwood Barclay opts for the predictable sort of finale, where the final third crescendo leads to a dramatic yet rather banale climax, and then plot twists its way into a post-climax plot twist. Thankfully, he doesn't do the next most common thing by leaving a cliffhanger in the end (because he did follow up with a second novel), but still, it's hardly quality writing. Great to pass the time, though!",0,0.7432,0.09,0.818,0.092,0.4994430520746311,NEGATIVE,0.973
294,1929345442,03/24/2017,4.0,"A thriller that made me sit at the edge of the bed as I frantically kept turning pages, inhaling and exhaling and letting out deep sighs while wanting to finish the book but not wanting it to end, No Time for Goodbye, is a treat to thriller/crime lovers out there. I picked this book on a whim at a Trade Fair last year since the blurb sounded pretty interesting. Well, I wasn't wrong.Cynthia, a 14 year old girl, wakes up one day after a night of drinking and partying to find a deserted house. Her parents including her brother Todd seem to have vanished from the face of the earth. No one has any clue where they are or if they're even alive. Fast forward to 25years later, Cynthia is now married to Terry Archer and they have a beautiful daughter named Grace and Cynthia still doesn't have any idea what happened to her parents.Cynthia does not give up and seeks the help of a popular reality TV show in the hopes of finding any leads about her parents. This shakes things up. Suddenly, she starts getting mysterious calls from people, her daughter is being followed by someone, a hat (probably her fathers) is found on the kitchen table all this adding to the suspense of the novel. To make things even more complicated, Cynthia's aunt is murdered right when she was about to reveal something closely linked to Cynthia's past. The detective, Abagnall, is also murdered while investigating the disappearance of Cynthia's family. There's an eeriness when you read this book, and you can feel something's not right but you can't put your finger on it.If we talk about the characters then I'd wish the author would've chosen the POV of Cynthia herself. That way we'd have an insight into the psyche of a daughter trying to put together the missing pieces. The story has been narrated from the POV of Terry Archer, Cynthia's husband, who is an English Teacher trying to maintain a balance between being a supportive husband, caring father and a professional. He is the calm to Cynthia's storms and I loved the chemistry between the two. Despite, the trust and understanding between the husband and wife, Cynthia's breakdowns made Terry question her sanity. It was a conflict for him; is Cynthia making things up or is something really wrong? This, I feel, added to the tension even more and gave a unique angle to the story. Although there were certain instances in the book that seemed implausible, the plot packed with high emotions and dark nature more than made up for tiny plot holes.Sometimes we think we know other people, especially those we supposedly are close to, but if we really knew them, why are we so often surprised by the shit they do?The writing style is effortless, easy to adjust to and is fast-paced. Linwood Barclay is a brilliant writer who has sketched a mystery that's hard to decode.Was I able to put together 2 & 2? NO. I wasn't good at math anyway. I kept guessing and failed but I believe that's what made the story entertaining. It kept me alive and wanting to know and get closure. No Time for Goodbye is my first Barclay book and safe to say it won't be the last.",0,0.9915,0.09,0.757,0.154,0.5576433430515063,POSITIVE,0.9979
295,4380413576,12/10/2021,4.0,"There should be a branch of the thriller genre with a title like The Impossible-Scenario Sub-Genre, made to include non-supernatural thriller novels that follow characters trying to make sense of a seemingly-impossible event. Take NOWHERE CHILD by Christian White, for example: it follows a woman who learns that her childhood was a lie, and that she was born to parents in a completely different country. THE CHALK MAN is another example: after a group of Losers-Club rip-offs devise their own secret code, somebody uses this code to lead them to a dead body. While both of these books disappointed me, they could still be considered parts of this imaginary sub-genre. The best book within this sub-genre that I have read, though, would have to be Linwood Barclay's NO TIME FOR GOODBYE, a stunning thriller that keeps you guessing.The book follows a guy named Terry, whose wife, Cynthia, was given psychological damage when she was younger: twenty-five years ago, her family - father, mother, brother - disappeared without a trace, and she has not seen them since. Desperate for answers, the two agree to let a news company make an episode out of Cynthia's predicament, hoping that it will lure somebody who knows something in and give answers. It works...but not in the way that Terry and Cynthia had been hoping...One thing that I found interesting about NO TIME FOR GOODBYE was that it made Terry the narrator instead of Cynthia. Usually, the narrator is the one who has gone through something bad, and is viewed by others as being paranoid. However, as the story progresses, it is Terry who slowly begins to doubt what Cynthia has seen. I thought that this was quite clever since it doesn't adhere to the usual convention of the thriller genre - everybody thinks that the narrator is crazy when they are actually right - but instead flips it around. I also liked how everything clicked together at the end of the book, even the most random details being made use of. Barclay takes almost everything into account, so that even the most outlandish of occurrences or sightings are made use of. It takes a clever plotter to do something like that - and, fortunately, that is just what Barclay is. While not my favourite Barclay book, NO TIME FOR GOODBYE is still an outstanding thriller.

There are many twists and turns, and spine-tingling answers that will keep you engaged throughout the whole story. The story was well written and kept me on my toes the entire time. I didn’t see anything coming, and the answers that Terry finds are nothing like I expected. I couldn’t put this book down, and when I did, I was constantly thinking about it, desperate for answers. Barclay hardly ever disappoints me. He is a master storyteller who creates realistic characters and complex plots. He often blows me away with what he writes, which is why I always come back for more. I will never get tired of reading his books.",0,-0.8867,0.096,0.832,0.072,0.4387663398692811,POSITIVE,0.9997
