1,418562302,09/20/2012,5.0,"Excellent. I read A LOT of bios- especially rock and celebrity... but I never read one that I connected with so personally, or was so sad to finish. I just want to have coffee with Sharon every morning.... in another life, perhaps.Painfully honest about her struggle as the wife of an addict. I am the wife of an alcoholic, and I have read a lot of books about addiction and/or addicts. But none other has touched my heart so deeply. If you love an addict- spouse, child, friend, etc- and have found other accounts to not exactly portray your pov, try this one. I am a similar smart-ass, no-back-down personality to Sharon, I think. But I often feel others think my commitment to my husband is viewed as a weakness. Like, if I was so tough, I would ""just leave"".... this aspect of living with an addict is a central theme of Sharon's book. So also is the guilt brought on by considering cutting lose someone who has a real disease, when all of your own success was built on their back.But, dont get me wrong-- this is NOT a whiny wallowing version of being an addicts wife. It is an account of owning your part, and remaining faithful, while maintaining to the end a position of fighting for an addict until they are either in remission or gone. I may some day see my husband finish himself off... but it wont be without me fighting him every step of the way...It was also a story of hope, in that- at the time of it's finish- Ozzy was 2 years clean, and her son 3 years. Sharon's story reinforced my belief that my way may not be the AlAnon way, but it is MY journey... not conducive to the choices of others, but not ""wrong"" either.",7,0.9395,0.087,0.788,0.125,0.6134920634920635,POSITIVE,0.9998
2,174147683,06/06/2011,2.0,"I must admit I expected a lot more from Sharon Osbourne, being the strong opionated woman that she is. Instead I discovered a woman very much dependant and dictated to by those around her, particularly her father (who was not a nice chap to put it nicely) then by her partners and husband. I was shocked to discover that the woman we know today did not come out until she was nearly killed by the man she had married and to whom she stood by despite his abusive nature. Putting that aside I was also surprised by how little Sharon actually gave of herself to the book, keeping it focused on the acts she grew up around, toured with, managed etc rather than looking into the more personal aspects of her life, such as her personal relationship with her parents (rather than the business one) and how this impacted her decisions in later life. It was not until she has been diagnosed with colon cancer and Ozzy has calmed down dramatically that I began to feel that it was the real Sharon talking rather than a show-biz drama queen. This is an interesting book , particularly if celebrity is your thing but don't expect heart-felt explorations into her past or details of her as a person rather than as a music agent/manager.",7,0.1368,0.046,0.897,0.057,0.4369082125603866,POSITIVE,0.9247

6,3692605,07/28/2007,3.0,"this review first appeared on [http://intraspace.blogspot.com]anna got this from her book club, i think. i came across it when i was looking for something a bit lighter to read...i suppose it's a bit of a ""girl's book"", but it's also a rather interesting insight on the music industry of the 50s, 60s, 70s and 80s.sharon osbourne is famous to most people for being the wife of ozzy osbourne, former lead singer of black sabbath. but apart from this significant accomplishment, she was also on the inner circle of the british music industry.her father was an artist manager, and was responsible for bringing rock n roll to britain. he turned down management of a new band called ""the beatles"" because he thought the idea of british rock was a joke. instead he continued to focus on bringing american acts like chuck berry over to the uk. other famous artists he represented included ELO in the 70s (by then he had caught on to the idea of british music).sharon became involved in the industry, and much of this book is about the corruption and criminal under-current of the music business. nothing girly about that! sharon herself was (is) a bit of a hard woman - not afraid (it transpires) to use her excrement (literally), her language and her fists to prove a point. before i leave off talking about the music industry bits of the book, i should also say - did you know that sharon once managed the smashing pumpkins? she ditched them because billy corgan was a royal pain in the arse.the rest of the book is about her relationship with ozzy - enduring weekly beatings and his insane drug and alcohol addiction. she also talks about her kids and her fight with cancer.so lots of aspects to this book - well worth reading for either the music industry stuff or for the human drama.",3,0.1134,0.059,0.878,0.063,0.4111847643097643,POSITIVE,0.9791

8,426772320,10/02/2012,2.0,"Everyone talks about Mrs. Osbourne as a hero but after reading this book I see her as a victim of serious abuse who is incapable to break the abusive circle she has forced herself and her kids to live in. She is a sad example of a woman who keeps staying together with a man who abuses her physically and mentally and tries even to murder her. I don´t see anything heroic in that and definitely wouldn´t count her as a role model. She is an incredible talented and smart woman, so why does she spend her entire life of being a co-dependant for a violent drug user?Also, the style of the book was quite shallow. Osbourne gets by huge happenings in her life in 1-2 sentences. That might of course be because her life is so full of dramatic turns that they wouldn´t fit in abook though it had 5000 pages.If you´re interested to know how functional the Osbourne family truly is I´d recommend a documentary God Bless Ozzy Osbourne,co-produced by Jack Osbourne.

After all it's filled with alcoholism, drug addiction, abusive men and above all a very abusive main relationship between Ozzy and Sharon.

I think I would find it near impossible to love someone who constantly cheated on me, punched and hit me, broke my teeth and of course tried to strangle me to death!

10,85266555,01/16/2010,4.0,"I have always thought Sharon Osbourne was an interesting person. Now, after reading her book, it is confirmed. She is an amazing person. Her life was nothing short of an adventure. Her father was a manager in the music industry out of the UK. He was not the ideal father. He was a scammer, a cheat, a mobster and he used Sharon so he could run his crooked business under the radar. Her mother was not any better. Even though her husband cheated on her and treated her worse than a 2-bit whore, she defended him over Sharon several times throughout her life. I didn’t realize how experienced Sharon is in the music business. She meets Ozzy when she was in her early 20’s. They become great friends. They become romantically involved when he is still married. It’s a rocky road, but Ozzy does eventually divorce his wife and marry Sharon. Sharon talks a lot about Ozzy’s addictions and the violence that ensues. She is very open and honest in her writing. I admire her for that. A few things that stand out in my mind after reading this book. Sharon and her family must have lived in 50 different. I swear they are moving to a new house in every chapter. They bounce between LA and England. Sharon gets robbed. Not just once but SEVERAL times. You would think they would learn and get an alarm system or safes or something.

18,682057787,07/31/2013,2.0,"“Memory is a strange thing, and since starting this book I have discovered that people’s memories of the same event can be very, very different.”Tell me about it, Sharon. In fact, it’s something I am increasingly finding in these ghost-written celeb tomes. That, in some way, the celebrities are forced to put their own side of versions, albeit ghostwritten (in this case by Penelope Dening, who surprisingly gets a mention on the title page with her subject), to somehow justify where they feel their actions and their character have been scrutinised in the past.None more it seems has this been the case, it seems, but with Sharon Osbourne. TV Star, Mother, Wife to Rock God and a large number of shit excreting small dogs.It should go on record that despite what I might say, the book became the biggest selling British autobiography ever upon release and the most successful female biography upon release when it topped 2 million sales (621,000 of that was in hardback), which is a huge acheivement for the wife of a rock star, currently fading in terms of the chart success he has had in the past. Granted, the very fact that Sharon was not only a judge in possibly one of the most successful shows on TV currently, but the promotional budget behind this title and the avenues of opportunity already out there in terms of her exposure could have done nothing but aid her in this milestone display of selling.Now, let it be said that I firmly believe that not only is Ozzy and Black Sabbath one of the most underrated acts in British music but that Ozzy himself is one of the least talked about successes in terms of that all important industry white elephant, “Cracking America”, with his hugely successful solo career (something unheard of at the time) and what then eventually Ozzfest, a no-nonsense hard rock alternative to the more avant-garde Lollapalooza at the time. But back to Sharon. Mrs. Osbourne (nee Arden) is the daughter of the legendary concert promoter, Don Arden and the relationship between her and her father, not to mention a quite unique and turbulent business partnership, despite her young age. Sharon is nothing but adamant about how she was manipulated as early as in her teens to basically sign her life away on behalf of her father in her business dealings. This has made her not only quite hard and surly but also majorly beligerent and callous towards anyone she takes a disliking to. She has learnt over the years to fight her corner and had her Fuck You, punk spririt firmly established and instilled within her a number of years before the Pistols first rose up from their squats and tread the boards.As early as the Sixties, she was making the sort of important industry decisions that people have spent years in the process of making their way upto in these days. Sharon puts this down to a question of experience and woe be tide any cocky shits in the industry today that try to cross or fuck with her.I, on the other hand, clearly believe that Sharon has got to where she is today through what was essentially a life of priviledge through her father, despite her protestations at the amount of work she has done to add to his legend. The constant naievity of the younger business woman, even well into her thirties is very frustrating and annoying, especially how it has affected her family and her relationship with her husband. A man with his own personal demons and struggles with addiction.In her defence though, she is an absolute rock for Ozzy. As is he for her. Through his rehabilitation and her own battles with colon cancer. The couple have the most passionate and clearly loving relationship that most I’m sure are envious of, that is evident to anyone who even watches an episode of that other surprise success in their lives, their famous MTV reality show, which has made huge stars of Sharon and both children in the programme, Kelly and Jack. It is true that Kelly has not been as successful as first thought, but then why on earth any member of that family would want to follow such an icon as her father into music, I do not know. What I love about Sharon is her attitude and that she doesn’t give a flying fuck. This is admirable and useful no doubt for the business that she is in, but her constant violent and rude nature has damaged her reputation in the public eye. She has been widly criticized for her actions and behaviour as a judge on all seasons of The X Factor, even though I do agree about the guy that won the first season. But then I think everyone realised that you would not have heard of him after the show came to an end. But then The X-Factor has failed to produce anything of either the success or standard as Simon Cowell’s other baby, American Idol.To my dismay, this book was majorly lacking in any ending. To say it was half arsed, would be fair. I really slacked towards the end, despite what I thought would be a great read for me, considering who Sharon is. But I really got a bit sick of Sharon’s constant self-justification and volitile nature. This made it hard for me to actually get to the end of what seems to be a very jumbled and patchy account of events towards the end.It it a very aggressive tome. There is a history of violence and abuse from both sides of the relationship and as heartbreaking as it is, there are interjections of wit and humour along the way. It is quite hard reading though in terms of the arguementative tone of most of the book.I wonder how those two million buyers felt at the end.

145,3009913151,10/12/2019,3.0,"I wouldn't give it two hoots about Sharon Osbourne, but just because her dad managed Black Sabbath and she is Ozzy Osbourne's wife I decided to give her a go and pick her autobiography. After all, any insights into the Sabbs and their line up can't hurt! Well, what's there to get?There are some nice glimpses at the music business of the 50s and 60s, when rock n' roll hit Britain and her dad, Don Arden, once described as the 'Al Capone of music', used to manage some of the then big names. It's nice; but since she had a nasty feud with her father it quickly turn revengeful, a family vendetta where her dad is all but spared. Don Arden was indeed a big name, and so getting to see his disgusting scams and how he ripped even his own bands (ELO...) is here quite a take on the music industry back then:'... he was just one among many. The business was full of lying, cheating mobsters. There was barely a decent person among them. Everywhere I turned there was another liar, another bullshitter, another fake.'There are whole chapters, too, dedicated to her husband Ozzy. How she picked him up after he was thrown out of Black Sabbath; how she launched his solo career; the tragedy that unfolded (the death of Randy Rhoads...); how she tried and have him to get clean and sober; the creation of the Ozzfest… There's no denying she's a tough, tenacious woman, and a determined manager who knows what she wants and usually gets it! Thing is, since she's Ozzy's wife it quickly turn into an insight into their marriage, and the whole becomes an unsettling tale of a toxic relationship. She wasn't a saint for sure (agressive, arrogant, violent) but the recounting of all the abuses, physical and emotional, melted upon her is frankly harrowing to read. Ozzy has a reputation for being clownish, wait to see how he was behind closed doors...Now, yes, she's a self-centred 'motormouth' and in between the lines you see all the shallowness and insecurities of the celebrity culture she belongs to: the craving for fame, money flouting, names dropping... I found it all, not annoying, but quite pitiful. She can also sound funnily hypocrite, as when she offers her opinion on nowadays music industry:'... full of small, blinkered persons. There are few pioneers..., people prepared to take a chance... the majority are pampered, untalented also-rans who have no musical ability at all. I don't even know an A&R man these days who can play an instrument or read or write music. All they have is an ear for what is current.'This coming from someone who paid her debts by being some judge on some sh%tty talent show, it's quite gutted!Having said that, she can attract sympathy and some sort of admiration too. She's coming from a dysfunctional family and, sadly, ends up living in a dysfunctional marriage herself (although she's absolutely head over heels about Ozzy! Her love just shines throughout...). She is selfless to the point of coping with Ozzy's behaviours, even if for the sake of her kids (sadly, ain't it always like that with abused women?). She is also very strong, as her battle against cancer shows quite clearly. She has, in a word, the tenacity of an indestructible warrior - there's no taking that away from her.A loose canon ball with a attitude, Sharon Osbourne surely is not everyone's cup of tea. Well, as a shallow celebrity she certainly is not mine; not matter how admirable her determination! But I picked this up to get insight into the music, and when it comes to that her side of the story makes for a great read. From the rock n' roll era to the Ozzfest, straight through Black Sabbath and Ozzy Osbourne (I personally don't care about The X doolali) here's a frank insight into it all. Like her or not: her impact remains. ",2,-0.9649,0.148,0.72,0.132,0.5575086967539797,POSITIVE,0.5958
146,2776980179,04/09/2019,4.0,"What an eye opener! Extreme is the perfect title as Sharon takes us through her life with a manipulative, angry, abusive father, a loveless mother and a tumultuous life of highs and lows. Her love for Ozzy is evident. The abuse is mutual, a result of difficult upbringing, and having been taught that violence is the norm. Home life and life on the road are purely absurd. The Osbourne's infatuation with peeing, and defecating is a bit off-putting, if not downright disturbing.  This autobiography is raw and real. It brings the reader on a journey through the business of music on the road, from the filth to the joy. You can feel yourself next to Sharon just off the stage feeling joy, pride and love for her husband, except for the times she feels fear and disgust for that same man. This is life. It is in its most extreme form, but it is real. It is authentic. It made me feel compassion, worry, hope and love. It intrigued me to search the videos of Ozzy, Black Sabbath and Kelly's music, as well as Leno and Letterman interviews, ranging from Ozzy with tremors and seemingly incoherent, to interviews with a year sober, looking fantastic and showing his loveliness, and wittiness that has continued to charm Sharon over the years.

If you expect the story of a rock 'n roll princess you will be surprised not to find that but instead, the story of someone very gifted, who perseveres and triumphs and adapts to find incredible strength scrambling out of the world of quicksand celebrity. She tells the truth and the truth is more valuable than anything. I can now see how this woman can be so vibrant and has experienced so much. She is a great role model for someone like me. A gifted business woman and orchestrator, I can learn so much from her. She wears resilience like chain mail but beneath that she completely understands the unconditional nature of love and kindness.

I was determined to read this as I like Sharon Osbourne and I felt that if I was going to read a genre I don’t normally read I want it to be someone I like. First thoughts are you can not make this sh** up, I felt like I was reading fiction, talk about Sharon’s dad being a wannabe mafia man. I felt that the first 12 chapters or were very business oriented and not about Sharon’s personal and private life, at stages I felt that it very name dropping and show offy.I felt that the second half of her book from about the cancer onwards was much more Sharon Osbourne and the Sharon we have come to know, it was more personal than the first half.

The final chapters on the X Factor and the Osbournes felt a little rushed, but perhaps that was due to the fact that when this was published, only one series of the X Factor had been made.
