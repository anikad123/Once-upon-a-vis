Though I am yet to read the final one, I think it'll be harder to beat this one out of my-favorite-of-the-series spot. What an adventure.""Yay! Blow-things-up time!""Time for having laughs all over the place is over (at least for the most part) and penultimate book means serious business. Percy, Annabeth and the team embarks on the most thrilling adventure yet, immersing us in an eventful journey. Everything's well written as always, it's difficult to stop until one is finished reading. Events are building up nicely towards the Battle of Half-blood camp, while keeping the reader oblivious to the way how seemingly unrelated plot lines will come to unravel at the end.""so many things. Large snake. Large dogs. Men with swords.""Oh! There are so many good things to tell about this one, but I can't wait till I get started with the next.

Or snark for that matter! ;-P I’ve to admit that the way things are going it sounds like our heroes will have to use every ounce of will to keep their good humour intact though. As I already suspected this didn’t only get way darker than its predecessors but also a little more mature as well. Yes, our little baby heroes are growing up and for the first time monsters aren’t the only thing they have to deal with. There are other kinds of problems they have to face and most of them seem to be of a more – erm – romantic nature. XD I’m sure sometimes troubles like that might be even worse than monsters. What do you say, Percy?”So you told her the truth.”“She recognized me from Hoover Dam, so –““You’ve met her before?”“Um, last winter. But, seriously, I barely know her.”“She’s kind of cute.”“I – I never thought about it.”Jeez! Annabeth, jealous much? Could you be so kind and give Percy at least a little chance to get in a few words? Or, well, maybe a proper sentence? *lol* Just saying! Would make it easier to understand him, right? XD All that gibberish isn’t going to get you two out of the labyrinth anytime soon. Oh yeah, the labyrinth. I almost forgot to mention it! Love troubles will do that to you. ;-P I definitely don’t envy Percy right now. Amazingly enough and despite everything they still manage to keep their minds focused on the most important things. Like for instance the task of finding Pan!”Percy, I can’t go back to camp without finding Pan. I just can’t. You understand that, don’t you? I can’t face Juniper if I fail. I can’t even face myself.”Poor Grover, he has a really tough time in this one but thankfully Tyson, Percy and Annabeth always got his back! And of course there are other new characters I sorely missed and that actually reappeared in “The Battle of the Labyrinth”. For instance Rachel Elizabeth Dare and Nico di Angelo! And before you even say anything: Yes, Rachel adds to Percy’s drama and Nico, well I suppose in some way he does too. No, not the way you think! *lol* He’s more like Percy’s little baby brother and it’s kinda cute how much he worries about him. Nico certainly isn’t defenceless though! That kid! I swear I love him to bits and pieces and can’t wait to see more of him. He’s not only adorable but also quite resourceful and assertive. In short: This kid rocks! ;-)Minos laughed. “You have no power over me. I am the lord of spirits! The ghost king!”“No.” Nico drew his sword. “I am.”He stabbed his black blade into the floor, and it cleaved through the stone like butter.For all of you who keep wondering what our heroes are doing in the labyrinth. Well, it’s Annabeth’s quest and they need to find Daedalus before Luke does. Yep, our dear archenemy is still around and kicking and of course he’s up to no good! But worry not, before the grand finale takes place there happen quite a few things first: For instance our heroes encounter more and more monsters they never knew about or heard of and also most certainly never wanted to know about as well, Tyson has intriguing conversations with Hephaestus and Percy tries his hand at teaching.”Well, a Cyclops. Good, good. What are you doing travelling with this lot?”“Uh…” said Tyson, staring in wonder at the god.“Yes, well said,” Hephaestus agreed.”New lesson, class,” I announced. “Most monsters will vaporize when sliced with a celestial bronze sword. This change is perfectly normal, and will happen to you right now if you don’t BACK OFF!”Okay, that one didn’t go all that well and I strongly doubt that this is a possible future career path. At least not for Percy. ;-P I’ve to admit that he grew quite a lot in this book though. Alone his encounter with a certain girl on a certain island shows how much his character developed and changed over the course of those last few books. And, yes some part of me ached with Percy. >_< The ending of this book made me really sad but unfortunately I’m more than just certain that the worst is yet to come. There’s one last and final book and I’m convinced that it’s waiting for me at my library! I think I’ll just, you know, finish this review, leave you here and go grab it! ;-P Happy reading and take care!________________________________I can’t believe I’m already reading the fourth book! As it seems Percy Jackson reads really fast! *lol* Also I’m very curious how this series is going to continue. As far as I know this is the penultimate book and since the last book took a turn to the dark side I can only assume that this will hold true for “The Battle of the Labyrinth” as well.I wonder if they’ll meet the Minotaur.

A fun read, though the monsters get steadily more outlandish as Rick mines the lesser known corners of Greek myth. In this book we meet the Empousa who are pictured as women wearing brazen slippers and bearing flaming hair. The name is said to mean ""one-footed."" This is because they are a one-legged hybrid, with a donkey's leg and a celestial bronze prosthetic leg...Part of me is wondering how long before South Park's Scuzzlebutt turns up with a hand that's made of celery and Patrick Duffy for a left leg? We also meet Kampe who is depicted as having the head and upper body of a beautiful woman, the lower body of a dragon, a massive scorpion's tail full of venom, snakes around her ankles, and 50 grisly heads of various creatures (wolves, snakes, bears, lions...) bubbling around her waist. She also possesses black wings on her back and a pair of envenomed swords!The labyrinth itself and Daedalus were interestingly portrayed. Percy's girl cluelessness continues unabated. And the Luke/Kronos plot comes to a bubble.I also liked the rather silly Mrs O'Leary hell hound and the issue of giant dog biscuits and squeaky pink full-sized buffalo chew toys.Normally the inconsistent level of farce and semi-seriousness would bug me, but the series' style and charm has somehow inured me to it.Celyn continues to make her 'yes' sign when I ask if I should give these books 5* and who am I to argue with the expert?

9,2094897495,08/16/2017,5.0,"See this review and more like it on www.bookbastion.net!_____________This entry to the Percy Jackson series just took things to a whole new level! As a first time reader of the series, it blows me away that not only am I enjoying this series as an adult reader, but I'm actually finding that my excitement and love for it has grown with each book as well. The writing has improved, and the way that Riordan has slowly been building up the stakes in each story has definitely stoked my interest as well. I'm so hyped to see how the big showdown in the next book is going to go down! I have to talk about the characters for a second. The dynamic Percy has with his friends has gotten better and better with each book. I never thought I could find another group of friends in a children's story that I enjoyed quite as much as the gang from Harry Potter, but Percy's gang of friends are just as compelling. I love the core trio (Percy, Annabeth and Grover) but the outliers that Rick Riordan has added on over the course of the series (like Tyson, Rachel Elizabeth Dare and Thalia) have grown on me as well. None have grown on me more than Nico though. In the previous book, I had some real issues with Nico. In a lot of ways, this book seemed to build off of much that was introduced in the previous one and I thought it worked out well for Nico in terms of growth. I really felt for him and his struggles during this book. Also, I love his strange on-again, off-again burgeoning friendship with Percy. I'm very excited to see how that develops in the final book, especially considering the implications of their existence and the whole prophecy subplot that Rick Riordan has been establishing for 4 books now. Hopefully it doesn't let me down! I'm a sucker for magical locations and creatures in my fantasy - the stranger the better! So the fact that basically this entire book gets set in a spooky, atmospheric and magic-filled Labyrinth was essentially a dream come true for me. I think it had earned points in my mind for that before I'd even started the book, to be honest. Riordan doesn't disappoint with the setting either, instead he utilizes the magical properties of the Labyrinth to introduce a whole host of memorable locations, creatures and events. This is the most fun I've had in a Labyrinth since I had to rescue my stepbrother from goblins. If I had to change one thing, I would have wanted this novel to be a trifle longer! While I think Riordan's ability to write characters and plot a story is definitely improving, in some ways I wish the prose would slow down a bit and describe things a little bit more. There are certain scenes (particularly the action sequences in this book) that I felt like could have been a bit more grand or of a larger scale than they ended up feeling because the prose moves along with such zeal to get to the next event. Sometimes a sense of dread and danger is good, and I think it's muddled a tiny bit in those fast-moving scenes. With that being said, plot-wise and character-wise, this was definitely my favorite of the series! I love the way the main plot and theme of the series has sort of unfolded around Percy and the years he's spent questing for the Gods of Olympus. I'm looking forward to seeing how his final clash with the Titans is going to turn out!

I have no good explanation and if you ask me I'll just give you the shifty eyes and mumble something incoherent because I don't have a good reason. What counts though is that I am reading them now right? On the upside I don't have to agonize for the long wait for new books to come out, but still... if I had just known!So as expected Percy's summer is going to be filled with another quest and yet another colossal problem that brings him closer to the prophecy. This time around Annabeth is in charge of the quest and they will have to find Daedalus, the creator of the Labyrinth, to stop Kronos from attacking Camp Half-Blood. Of course the Labyrinth is no regular maze. It shifts and deceives and there are a butt-load of monsters on every corner. In the mix we have Rachel Dare who we meet briefly in the last book, and she will play a major role here. We get to see what Nico is up to, and I gotta say I really liked him in this one. Can Percy, Annabeth, Grover, and Tyson solve the maze in time to find Daedalus before Luke does? There is this one scene where Percy is alone and contemplating a tough decision he has to make and I took a little sniff and thought, ""Aww.. Percy is growing up."" Just like they all are. Things are getting to be more dangerous and we are getting nearer to the climax. More pieces of the puzzle are being presented and Riordan is being crafty just like a good storyteller would be. I actually can't fathom how he keeps up with all of it. All these gods, monsters, and plot-lines to follow; truly great stuff.

I read some real middle grade ones this year & they were just okay-ish (not even sure if I will continue them or not tho). I mean, yeah sure, the characters' ages are about middle grade & it is mostly cute & hilarious, but apart from that, it is serious matters & complicated problems & felt like intertwined with our worlds, that many people regardless of their age can enjoy it. I believe that's a talent. (my first read of his series was when I was 22. & I loved it & still do. still can find clues hidden under the layers of the story that only can be revealed in the rereads. the ingenious of the author.)& I love it in Riordan's books, every characters has their own story, the minor characters fell in love too. also the relationships are cute, funny, realistic & understandable. (even some love triangles -which I actually noticed because someone mentioned, because they mostly were teens' crushes, not real love, so I didn't assume them as triangle- & Riordan wrote it very nicely & realistically. also these books are not centered around the romance. so it is one of the few that I approve & like & it doesn't bother me.)I just love everything about this series & these characters!-World building: ★★★★★/5Characters: ★★★★★/5Written style: ★★★★★/5HUMOR!: ★★★★★/5plot: ★★★★★/5Cover: ★★★★★/5General idea: ★★★★★/5",109,0.9976,0.037,0.691,0.272,0.6054539295392956,POSITIVE,0.999

I'm currently reading the fourth book and I kind of don't want to finish this book, so I won't read the fifth book because I AM STILL NOT READY TO FINISH THIS SERIES, but I also want to know how this book ends and how this series ends. 😭😭😭THE REVIEW IS POSTED**SPOILERS READ AT YOUR OWN RISK**on this review, I'm just going to tell you guys why I didn't really like it. this is hard for me to say this but this book was just not that interesting for me. I mean, the first, the second and the third book were all pretty good and they could make me laugh. But this book, it wasn't funny and I might smiled once or twice but I didn't laugh and I also have this problem with Annabeth. it's just like I don't know her anymore. in my opinion, she was pretty different in this book and different in a not good way. she was pretty mean or sarcastic towards Rachel. for examples : 
""You're the guide,"" Annabeth said with mock politness. ""lead on."" ( page 250) 
 
""So, Rachel,"" Annabeth said, ""where are you from, exactly?""  She said it like, What planet are you from? But Rachel didn't look offended. ( page 253 )
look, I don't know what was Annabeth's problem until she acted that way towards Rachel. I personally think that Rachel is a nice and sweet girl and I think it's impossible to not like her but well, Annabeth didn't really like her so much, I guess.and there's also this scene where Rachel guided them towards Daedalus's workshop but Annabeth said it's wrong and bla bla but then, Rachel found the workshop and Rachel was right and my expression to Annabeth in that scene like "" ha. yeah, right, Annabeth""and there was this scene that annoyed me so much and it involved Annabeth 
Tyson told Rachel she was pretty, which made Annabeth's nostrils flare like she was going to blow fire. (page 311) 
Seriously, was that even the same girl I had idolized since the first book? where's the old Annabeth? I want her back! I don't want this Annabeth that acted pretty bitchy and annoying. I don't like this Annabeth at all. I can't believe I'm going to say this but to be honest, I ship Percy with Rachel. but will this ever happen? *sighs*and let's talk about the plot of this book. The plot was interesting and I understood it but I didn't feel shocked when I knew that Quintus was Daedalus but I also wasn't expecting that to happen. how could I not be shocked for something that I didn't expect?? ... W E I R D... and I wish this book was funnier. this book wasn't funny. it's not like the first, the second or the third book. This book seems darker than the first, the second and the third book but it's so much less funny. I would've gave this book a higher star if it had been funny. But the truth is, it's not funny or barely funny. I didn't even laugh while reading it. sure, I smilled but laugh? nope, I didn't laugh. in conclusion, I didn't really like this book. this book wasn't good but it's not bad either. it was fine, but this book certainly didn't get a special place in my heart but I will still read the fifth book because I'm curious how this series ends and I'm also curious about Annabeth in the next book. will she still act like that anymore? or will she become like her old self? and I wish I'll see more Rachel's scenes in the next book. she's so awesome! thank you for reading and liking this review, guys!

So I’ve subjected myself to completing them all in one evening. I know, I’m a mess.To be fair, every time I thought of actually  writing  a review for this series it just made me scream for the remaining hours of the day, like that’s how unstable I get.  The Battle of the Labyrinth  was one of the BEST books in this series. It was thrilling, action-packed, mysterious, and so fricken adorable. How Uncle Rick manages this, I don’t know.Percy, my son, has the best luck in the world. Not only does the mysterious mortal girl he met in the previous book appear during his freshman orientation, but he also manages to get on the bad side of demon cheerleaders.His life is a dream, I know. In this book, Percy and the Half-Bloods are running out of time to defeat the butthead, Kronos. Even Camp Half-Blood’s borders are growing weaker with no signs of improvement and only incoming invasions. The only way to stop the attacks are to follow their quest, through the Labyrinth. The underground maze is hella creepy with its twisting corridors and its shifting hallways. On the way, they meet some  pretty  strange creatures. Also, lots of #percabeth, don’t miss out on that, folks. Have you ever met two idiots who were denser than these two like come ON!!

“Be careful of love. It'll twist your brain around and leave you thinking up is down and right is wrong.”
First, I have to say that Labyrinth was the first PJO book I’ve read via audiobook instead of a physical copy, and WOW, do I recommend this narrator. He was absolutely hilarious and throws in so many bonus voice changes and accents to really bring the characters to life in a brand new way. My bank account is totally glaring at me because, despite the fact that I own physical copies of almost every book Uncle Rick has written, I’ll probably be checking out the audiobooks for most of them here on out!
“People are more difficult to work with than machines. And when you break a person, he can't be fixed.”
As usual, the characters are wonderful and complex, Percy is a lovable yet sometimes clueless little bean, Annabeth endears me more with each passing installment, Tyson is my forever fave and I would protect him at all costs, and the world of gods, demigods, monsters, and Titans grows more complex and wonderful all the time.
→ D I S L I K E S :

“You deal with mythological stuff for a few years, you learn that paradises are usually places where you get killed.”
I originally gave this one 4 stars like I have with the 3 books before it, because—as with the first books—I wasn’t totally sure it had sucked me in enough to be “worth” 5 stars, until I was sitting here typing this review, weeks later, and realized two things: 1) I don’t have a single legitimate complaint about this installment, and 2) I inhaled most of the audiobook in one sitting and couldn’t put it down, so clearly it did suck me in that much! So, I’m happy to announce that The Battle of the Labyrinth gets a solid 5 out of 5 stars from this reader.
→ F I N A L THOUGHTS :
You can really tell that Rick Riordan meant for the series to grow up with the readers, because the books have steadily gotten just a little bit darker and heavier, but unlike many other series that follow this “aging up” style, PJO is still solidly middle grade and kid-friendly even by the end of this one, 80% through the series. I mean that as a good thing, though, because it means that Labyrinth is still a fun, comforting read with the stakes just high enough to create suspense without ever overshadowing how hilarious and fun the journey is.
→ RECOMMENDING TO… :

And also to find the god of wild, Pan, to save Grover's career.  => Characters of Percy and Annabeth were the best in this book. Although the narration of Percy became less humorous, I still loved this book. Annabeth. This quest was lead by her. I must admit that the prophecy of this quest wasn't that amazing. Anyway, I didn't pay much attention to this fact as I was so busy in enjoying this book. :p=> In the previous book, we got the glimpse of a character named Rachel. In this book, she played a significant role. I am not sure I am satisfied with her role yet. Not that I didn't like her role. But her presence in the book seems a huge coincidence. Anyway, This fact didn't look that bad. It can be ignored.=> The quest was amazing! This time it was full of dangers and actions. => Nico. I loathed him soo much in the beginning, even though I was very interested in him from the previous book. He was just annoyingly stubborn. But there was explaination on this fact. After that my interest in him had re-developed.=> Tyson. He was amazing! I loved his character.=> In Geryson's ranch, Percy had to clean the stable full of poop. It was wonderful how he did that. ;p=> For the first time, goddess Hera played a role in this series. Looking forward to how she will turn out in the next one.=> I was expecting Hade's role in this book. But he didn't appear. => The biggest flaw I found in this book is, three is lucky number. Only three person can go on the quest. But here there were four. And all returned safely which is againt the ancient rule according to this book.

It’s time to head back to Camp Half-Blood, because trouble is brewing…huge, scary ‘the-TITANS-are-plotting-dastardly-plots’ kind of trouble. The ancient Lord Kronos is slowly reforming, aided by Luke and his unearthly army. Kronos' plan is to invade Camp Half-Blood, raze it to the ground along with its heroes and then head off to destroy the Olympians.Although the camp members were under the impression that Camp Half-Blood was impenetrable, they soon realize that Luke intends to invade it through one of the exits of the famous underground Labyrinth. Percy and gang decide to head into the Labyrinth themselves and discover Daedalus’s (the creator of the Labyrinth) workshop, so that they can find a way to stop the invasion.Piece o'cake, right? Not really.The Labyrinth is supposed to be the only piece of architecture that changes constantly. Even the creator Daedalus himself has no control over it. Tunnels change, new ones pop up, traps are laid at the most unexpected places and monsters are lurking just around the corner. Sadly, backtracking is never a good option because you never know what is in store for you...left, right, back or front. A person could enter the maze and never get out. Ever. Add to that the constant threat of running into Luke’s demonic army and Percy has his job cut out.Is Percy doomed to roam forever in the mind-boggling Labyrinth?

And will the heroes survive to fight another day? All that and much more.....perfectly packaged in another superb instalment by Rick Riordan. Percy Jackson, the Prince of understatement, is as quick with his trusted sword ‘Riptide’ as he is with the droll quips and quicksilver action sequences.

“Be careful of love. It'll twist your brain around and leave you thinking up is down and right is wrong.” 
My favorite of this series. Everything in The Battle of the Labyrinth has developed from the last book. The relationship of Percy and Annabeth is more complicate, I see how much they grow up and the others facets of these characters. Likewise, the plot is smart and intricate with getting lost in the labyrinth, we'll see many unexpected things happen through the book.
“Don't feel bad, I'm usually about to die.”
I enjoyed this book more than I expected. Finding Daedalus in the labyrinth is hardship for Percy and the others. The ending was incredible and heartwrenching, though. I loved Nico, he's just adorable and has his style which impressed me so much. And I see some potentials between Percy and Nico, when Nico feels lonely and insecure, Percy is the one being with him, and I was so glad.All in all, The Battle of the Labyrinth is so amazing. All things are going to be wrapped up in the next book and I can't wait to reread it again. Yeah !

Read at your own risk.Thank you to the incredible Niharika for Buddy Reading this with me! I had a great time discussing this with you. :)Click here for her review.Also, thanks to my little sister for having the patience to sit down and enjoy the story I read to you. I am so glad you loved it and had an amazing time fan-girling about it with you. <3Onto the review!This book was beautiful. Uncle Rick wove so many concepts in this book, I loved it. High stakes adventure, love, betrayal, and death, Riordan waves his magic wand and conjures up a whole new world: Beautiful realistic characters, a highly enticing plot, along with hilarious writing with a touch of sarcasm.Let’s start with the 
plot:
There’s a reason why this is my favorite book in the whole series. It was my favorite 5 years ago, and it’s my favorite now. Percy, the main character, has been given a chance. His mom’s boyfriend, Mr. Blowfish Blofis, has offered Percy a spot at a high school where he teaches. Percy actually has a change to live out a normal school year.However, are things ever that easy? Nope. At the new student orientation, Percy with an unexpected ally, Rachel, team up to battle demon empousas. After that, Percy has no choice but to flee to Camp Half-Blood with Annabeth, and leave Rachel.At camp, things are more wound up than usual. Despite falling off a cliff, Luke is alive and ready to strike back. He is aiming to breach Camp Half-Blood, and help Kronos rise.Soon, Percy and Annabeth stumble upon an opening to Daedalus’s labyrinth, one of the inventor’s greatest creations. The labyrinth can lead you to anywhere, however it is very easy to get lost down there. Now that Camp Half-Blood has a vulnerable spot, the camp is in more danger than it already is.Soon after, they find out that Luke is after Ariadne’s String, one of the only artifacts which can help navigate the maze.So Percy, Tyson, and Grover embark on a quest led by Annabeth, to go through the Labyrinth, find Luke, and beat him to Ariadne’s String.Not only do they have to do all that before Kronos rises, but Grover is now able to detect Pan’s presence. In this unforgettable book, high stakes are even higher when the gang embarks to defeat Luke, navigate the Labyrinth, and find Pan once and for all. They make amazing friends, strengthen relationships, and mature incredibly throughout this story. The ending will get you on the floor, groveling for more.The plot was so good! Riordan weaved many Greek myths into the story which I completely forgot about. It was a great refresher, and very cool to learn more about these Greek figures.Not only does Uncle Rick educate us efficiently on these myths, but he keeps the plot fast and interesting. The plot twists are crazy and you will not see them coming. The plot is something that will not disappoint you.Continuing onto the 
characters:
Wow!! These characters have matured so much. As I look back on “The Lightning Thief,” and compare the trio to what they are now, the growth is extraordinary. They have all grown into their unique selves whom are impossible not to cherish.Percy: Amazing amazing amazing! Percy is a fun enjoyable character to have adventures with. His jokes will crack you up, but his personality and growth is pretty bit as well. Percy is ready to do whatever it takes. Whatever it takes to save camp, and whatever it takes to help his friends. With Grover more determined to find Pan, and Annabeth leading her first quest, Percy must look after them, and keep their sanity. There wasn’t much conflict in Percy in this book, but when there was, it did not disappoint. I really like how much Percy cares for his friends and family. He is willing to do whatever it takes to stay with them. That means a lot to me and I found that very sweet.I also think Percy became more considerate and compassionate in this book. With both his best friends going crazy over their quests, he had to help them the best way possible. He’s not just a mischievous boy now! Look at him, he’s growing up. Annabeth: starts sniffling She was amazing! The best I have seen so far in this series.Annabeth is extremely excited but deep down is a bundle of nerves. She finally has been given permission to lead a quest! However, this isn’t any quest. It is a quest which determines the fate of her beloved camp. What will happen? Will she pass with flying colors, or leave the camp to its doom?In this book, Annabeth is finally put into the spotlight and given a chance to shine.As always, Annabeth is bustling with a bright personality. She is witty, smart, and is as stubborn as a mule. Her personality is an icon and she’s someone to strive to be like.Not only is Annabeth’s personality darling, but her development and growth in this was exceptional! I really loved how much she grew throughout this book. Annabeth learned how to comb through her conflicts and sort them out. I think her mental self got so much stronger than this. I can tell how much Luke’s betrayal got to her, and this book really portrayed her pushing past this. Loved the conflict, and how it was resolved.She is also a spectacular leader! She learned to be more clever than usual, and how to organize and handle quests in a dignified way. Awesome character, now if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to spoil myself with some Annabeth fan art.Grover: drops the sniffling and plunges into sobs My Grover has now grown up omg. It feels like just yesterday he felt like a failure. Now look at him! An amazing leader has been born.Grover is scared, very scared. He has a freaking week to find Pan, his idol, his god. If he fails, he will be shunned and not be allowed to continue his search. What if he fails? He has already disappointed people so many times, why would this be any different?Throughout this book, you will grin as he matures and assumes leader-like qualities. Grover becomes so much braver and stronger than he was before. He starts to believe in himself and becomes more confident. I can’t explain how he grew so well without spoiling the book, but his growth and development is tremendous. You do not want to miss Grover. That is final.Additional Note: Those Rachel and Tyson were treated more like side characters, I think I should at least cover them a bit. I loved Rachel and Tyson. Tyson has become so mature and leader like, I am so proud of him!I also really like Rachel because she defeated a monster with a blue plastic hair brush. She’s a strong female character and I’m looking forward to seeing more of her in the finale! Finally, the 
writing:
There is truly nothing better than sitting back and reading Riordan’s witty handwriting. You will find it easy to relate, hilarious, and very charming.You will find it very easy to get into this book. Riordan structures his sentences in a way that they are easy to understand, but will give you the ability to transport to Camp Half-Blood. It’ll almost be like you’re wearing an orange t-shirt yourself! To conclude, this book was awesome. Beautiful. Touching. Thrilling. Whatever you want to call it. It’s my favorite book in my series, and little to nothing can change my mind.----------------------------------------Did not disappoint! Incredible as always.

“People are more difficult to work with than machines. And when you break a person, he can't be fixed.”
Ah, the Labyrinth--I’d forgotten what an intense adventure was in store for our crew. Relentless action paired with Riordan’s humour is always a perfect combination. It’s so great to see this series get better and better as it progresses, whereas some middle instalments tend to be less interesting.After The Titans Curse, I’m so glad Nico is becoming an integral character in this series! (he’s my favourite if you couldn’t tell). Riordan does such a great job of weaving newly introduced characters into the story as if they were always there. It’s near impossible for readers not to love someone in the PJO universe, as there’s so many vastly different characters to discover. This ending was the best in the Percy Jackson series to me. It leaves plenty of room for future conflict while also creating some resolve, if that makes sense. I can’t wait for more of Rachel and Nico alongside the half bloods!",45,0.9796,0.067,0.734,0.198,0.5345151515151515,POSITIVE,1.0

REACTION AFTER READING THE BOOK
MY FAVORITE FROM THIS SERIES, SO FAR.I'm crossing my fingers that the last book would be even better!Usually, I hate series, and I tend to stop mid-series run because I get bored or lose interest. That isn't the case with this one. I am absolutely, irrevocably, hooked with The Percy Jackson world, and I would, most definitely, read the other spin-off series.RICK RIORDAN, you are amazing! Keep these myth-inspired books coming!

THINGS WORTH MENTIONING
1. PERCY IS A DEMIGOD, BUT HE'S ALSO A TEENAGERPercy may be the only chance Olympus have of surviving, but let's all remember, he's also just a teenage boy, with teenage emotions. I liked that Rick Riordan did not forget this when he wrote about Percy. I would have hated to see Percy be this teenage boy who could go through anything, but not the ones that he has to go through as a teenager.2. DEATHDeath is inevitable in George RR Martin's Game of Thrones. I think Riordan took some cues and decided it was okay to kill a character, or two, per book.3. PERCYBETHI ship Percy and Annabeth so bad. There weren't a lot of PERCYBETH moments in this book, because I feel their feelings for each other isn't solidified with something yet, but I can feel they're perfect for each other, nonetheless. One thing I would like to commend Riordan is how he didn't push for these two to be together right away. He is taking his time writing about these two character separately, then eventually, he'd bring them together. Am I right? Or am I right? For those who have read Heroes of Olympus, please tell me I'm right.4. THE LABYRINTH WAS A CHARACTER IN ITSELFThe way Rick Riordan depicted the Labyrinth is beyond me. I really liked how it branches to each part of the world, without you noticing it. It could seem like you're walking for an hour in the same line, but before you know it, you're coming out of the Labyrinth from the opposite side of the world from which you came in from. But that's not the only good part, the Labyrinth has sections that you'd not expect to be there. I'd love to get the chance to visit, given that'd be able to get out.5. THE RISKS AND CONSEQUENCESI feel that, among all the other books I've read so far, this has got to be the one with the most risks and the dire consequences. While reading this, you get the feeling that it's prepping you for the events that soon to come on the last book, which I am currently reading, by the way. 6. DAEDALUSFor those of you know their Greek Mythology, Daedalus, was a great inventor who made flying shoes for his son, Icarus, and also made the Labyrinth. At first, you'll start to wonder when you'll be meeting this mysterious person, but as the story goes along, you'll realize he was right under your nose all along, and that was a big plus for me. I did not expect him to be who he was. He has, indirectly, a very prominent role to this story. I liked how his character was used to this installment. 7. I MISS LUKEAs much as I would like to hate this guy, I actually really missed him. He was there, but not really. 8. IT WAS FAST PACED AND FULL OF ADVENTUREIt's one of the things I loved about this series, actually, but this book in particular, had the best quest and action (so far that is).
FINAL THOUGHTS
Overall, I thought this was a strong installment to the Percy Jackson series. I can't wait to finish the last one. I'm hoping it would ""wow"" me better than this one. I really want to know what happens to Percy, Annabeth, and everyone in the camp, and also, how it would transition to the Heroes of Olympus series.",41,0.994,0.074,0.783,0.143,0.5187988628287137,POSITIVE,0.9987

In Battle of the Labyrinth we delve DEEP into Greek mythology; we learn about Calypso, Daedalus, Icarus, King Minos, Pan and a lot of other amazing myths that made this adventure story rich with history and adrenaline! Percy and Annabeth's character development are evident in this volume (view spoiler)[and that ONE kiss we got...... was short but will forever live in my heart thank you  (hide spoiler)]I started buddy reading this with Eliza but got too excited and read ahead (terrible buddy i know). I did feel like some parts were a bit long, not unecessarily long but I could've done without so much detail! My heart did go out to Calypso and her heartbreaking story though :(I love the incorporation of Rachel Elizabeth Dare and NICO DI ANGELO OF COURSE!!!! Honestly there's a lot to love about this book and the ending just makes me want to go pick up the last book right this second!  1st readTHIS IS MY FAVORITE INSTALLMENT IN THE SERIES SO FAR. THIS had so much action and just the right amount of hormones starting to affect Percabeth's relationship and UUUUUGUH FEELS. I always have a soft spot for characters who die, like I always take a liking to characters who die. I don't know theyre going to die obviously but EVERYONE I LOVE ALWAYS DIES. So when we see Bianca's apparition talking to Percy and counseling Nico I near damn cried a river. I loved Bianca and even though I was really upset because she left her brother behind, I still loved her.ANYWHO. We see the unraveling of the events after the Titan's Curse and I don't even know how to formulate a proper review. I JUST LOVED THIS BOOK. I loved the A+ character development we get to see throuhgout the whole book. Specially with Percy and Nico. And Grover. Like all of the characters unraveled before my eyes in ways I could've never imagined. We learn even more about Greek mythology as Rick Riordan incorporates even more myths into this book (my favorite one personally was Calypso's <3) I think one of my favorite parts of this book is the way that Rick Riordan incorporates the Greek mythology and has his own way of making it its own. I find it so magical and absolutely beautiful how he can create something so outrageously perfect. I LOVE THIS SERIES AND THIS ONE SPECIALLY. THIS ONE IS MY FAVORITE ONE TO BE HONEST.

Annabeth finally gets her dream and leads this quest into the Labyrinth to hunt for Deadelas(not sure I spelt that well).Annabeth was a bitch almost throughout the book, I just do not get her loyalty to Luke despite everything, I wonder why Percy even puts up with that.I so did not know about this before
‘Percy, you know how Athena was born?’‘She sprang from the head of Zeus in full battle armour or something.’‘Exactly. She wasn’t born in the normal way. She was literally born from thoughts. Her children are born the same way. When Athena falls in love with a mortal man, it’s purely intellectual, the way she loved Odysseus in the old stories. It’s a meeting of minds. She would tell you that’s the purest kind of love.’

38,3239075164,07/14/2020,5.0," The Battle of The Labyrinth  has to be the best Percy Jackson book so far. It’s intricately woven details are the very epitome of a wonderfully addicting story. No wonder they decided not to continue the movie series. (I haven’t watched it yet, therefore I have no opinion on that matter) Nothing about this book is screaming juvenile to me. It’s marked for kids as young as 9, so I went into this series assuming I was in for a quick, easy read. It may have been quick, but it was better than a lot of ya series i’ve read. I envy those of you that have read it at a younger age then me, though the nostalgia will carry on. I’ve decided not to write very many reviews for this series, and as you can possibly tell, I have hardly been able to help myself. Each book has a small blurb at the very least, yet i’m sure this is the longest one I have for the series. It’s just such a good book. I cannot stress that enough. (or i’ve possibly overdone that a bit) This is definitely not a perfect series, but I presume that’s what makes it all the more enjoyable. And Annabeth and Percy in this !!! i’m officially dead right now. the. KISS. it finally happened. it took 4 books and it HAPPENED.the percabeth fanart is getting out of hand pls stop making me want to read these books quicker than i already am, ty. Grover and Pan!! I cried again. How many times can a series make one person tear up? I feel like I don’t talk about Percy by himself too much but he’s so sweet, and whenever he gets into arguments with his friends it’s actually funny. He’s literally a half blood out here saving the world, what more could a person want?This book is an emotional roller coaster. One moment i’m laughing, another moment i’m looking like the world is about to end, and the very next i’m a hot mess from some event that was inevitable, but I still didn’t enjoy. All that’s left to say is that the next book has some high standards to be met, but there’s not a doubt in my mind that Rick Riordan will be able to top it.  “And loss a love to worse than death.”  Annabeth has tears in her eyes. “That was the last line, Percy.

[3rd time - April 2, 2020]The first time I read this series, this used to be my most favorite among the five books. I still loved and adored this as I always do and nothing can change that fact, but now I realized this is the book where I liked Annabeth the least compared to other books with her in it. I found her so frustrating at times. Her trust for Luke was sometimes irrational and it was exasperating when she was having her bitch moment because of that. Which comes to the next realization; that my negative impression for Luke is increasing the more I re-read this series. I mean I didn't like him, but I didn't hate him either. But right now, I'm not so sure anymore. But regardless of those points, this book will always hold a place in my heart. This is where Nico and Percy started having a casual talk again. Though they can never go back to how they used to treat each other, that's understandable considering how they both changed. Nico, especially. Oh, my poor Nico 😢😢I'm so excited to finish this series again and one month seems so far.",31,-0.4338,0.127,0.742,0.132,0.5914592352092354,POSITIVE,0.9997

46,1494032292,11/15/2017,4.0," “People are more difficult to work with than machines. And when you break a person, he can't be fixed.” Another cute book in the Percy Jackson series – I’m thrilled the series kept its quality and my interest. The Battle of the Labyrinth is the fourth, and next to last, book in the long-running series that has helped form future readers out of kids. The simplistic writing style fits any age, and the humor and fun adventures speak to the inner child I have tucked somewhere in my head.The quests aren’t as intense as some of the previous novels, but the main focus is a confusing Labyrinth that has a long and twisted backstory. We get glimpses into the past to see the building of the Labyrinth and all the characters involved with it – fascinating stuff, especially a horribly sad scene with the creator’s son. Percy seems to have had his dreams amped up, because now not only is he seeing Nico and what he’s fallen into through the water messages, he’s also seeing behind the scenes with Luke, backstories with the old Kings and long-gone cursed inventors.A lot of the story involves what Percy is lucky enough to glimpse beyond the veil, but that’s not to say the present story isn’t as interesting. Grover and Tyson, two of my favorites of the series, are missing most of the book on their own side-hunt, but when they’re there – they still bring in the fun. Grover’s obsession with the lost and worshipped Pan adds another element to the character besides just being the fun and loyal back-up quester buddy. I could do without Rachel but she’s not a bad addition, I just don’t care about her yet. Oh, and Annabeth and Percy, sitting in a tree?The ending with good ol’ dad was simply heartwarming. Finally that absentee father shows up!We get new revelations about Niko that changes the potential of the prophecy completely, so this was all a good lead-up book to the last of the series. There aren’t frustrating dangling ends to make it feel incomplete, but there’s plenty left to wonder about and solve that made me want to pick up the next book immediately.Among the humor and joy, there was some depressing stuff for this series, especially for an inventor I couldn’t help but like and the beautiful but tragic Calypso. Surreally written scenes for that side-story, which is a new technique for this series and writing style. Calypso’s scenes were top of the series as a whole.Pretty much every book starts with Percy getting into trouble at school somehow, and this one isn’t an exception.

47,22044718,05/11/2008,4.0,"I can't tell whether this is my favorite of the existing Percy Jackson stories. After a while, it has become just a story that I must read because it's in the series and there is no way that I can stop now! But it is definitely highly entertaining and I especially appreciate the fact that Riordan manages to make the young characters grow up convincingly as modern teens. I have a fascination with mazes and labyrinths so anything with this setting tends to make me happy, although I did not quite ""feel"" the labyrinth setting in this one since the entries and exits and twists and turns are all so disconnected. It did not quite have a ""maze"" feeling, unlike that in The Silver Chair or in The Tomb of Atuan. This is just Riordan's convenient way to ""teleport"" his characters to different parts of the world. Things are definitely magically convenient, but that is part of the charm of this series. One just knows that things will work out for the heroes. I wonder if Riordan will ""pull a Rowling"" in book five and have one of the main/major supporting characters die?Oh, and I just realized that Thalia is not in the book and was only mentioned once or twice in passing.. what's going on THERE?Nico is a good character and the plot surrounding him has not been as predictable. I liked that. The story arc concerning Kronos' reincarnation is getting taut and tension is high and I hope there will be a huge pay off in either the next volume or the volume after that. But, I'm hoping that he does not drag the series on too long. Make it work, Riordan!",28,0.9909,0.026,0.809,0.166,0.6144907407407407,POSITIVE,1.0

“People are more difficult to work with than machines. And when you break a person, he can't be fixed.”
This is just so fun and I love how this one takes more dramatic turns than the previews novel. This book is an introduction to how dangerous it really is and we come to think of them not only as adventures and as heroes but as people who can die just as easily as a human being. They are mortal, our heroes, not immortal.Like I said, this series just gets more and mature and I think I love this more than if it had stayed like the first two novels. We get deeper into our characters feelings and realize how scared they really are, how they don't know what to await. It all becomes so complicated and realize that they'd sacrifice themselves for each other. That's the kind of friendship there is between our heroes. For Aphrodite's sake, Annabeth just grab and kiss Percy because he really is blind when it comes to you. How can he not see that you love him just as much as he does? Kids. Hahah, I love how their relationship reaches into a more subatomic level, they are friends who have romantically feelings for each other which is so cute and I just want to make them kiss. Am I making any sense? I hope so.Like I said, this gets more dramatic. This one was the most dramatic yet, but still it didn't lose it's funny edge and our heroes kept it at balance without making me cry my eyes out the entire time. Summing it up: it's still just as fun as it was, but it's far more mature.",28,0.9978,0.06,0.662,0.278,0.5371621621621621,POSITIVE,0.9995

52,3508306307,10/21/2020,5.0,"lowkey my favorite book of the four PJO books I've read :)I'm pretty sure I started this right after I finished Titan's Curse and have been reading a chapter whenever I got time, so that's why I took so long to read this, but anyways, I LOVE THIS BOOK AND THIS SERIESThe hype is real for the series. I repeat, the hype is real. This book in particular was so fun! I loved the change in pace; I always got the feeling the first three books in PJO were very similar in plot and characters, but this changed the course. We follow Percy and his next adventure. Luke and Kronos are on the rise and gathering a large army to overtake Camp Half-Blood and Olympus eventually (where was Camp Jupiter during all this, though? Yes I know about that already :), and Percy and the gang (with a few moderations and characters met along the way) have to go through the Labyrinth Maze to stop Luke and Kronos. It that doesn't sound like a good time, what does?
characters
-Percy, as usual, is totally swoon-worthy. I feel like reading it at this age, where I think of fictional characters as crushes, I have a huge crush on Percy, but reading Harry Potter at such a young age really never made me swoon over any over the characters. It was weird, I just can't crush on characters I've grown up. Maybe if I had read PJO earlier, I would feel the same way about Percy and other characters, but instead I'm reading it now. Annabeth is the role model we need in our lives. She's smart. Sassy (just like Percy; PERCABETH FOR FREAKING LIFE!!!!). She's totally crushing *hard* on Percy, and I'm waiting for the moment when they get together (because I KNOW they do). Honestly, Annabeth is the Hermione Granger of PJO (vice versa too; Hermione Granger is the Annabeth Chase of Harry Potter).We visit Rachel Dare again, who I loved. She's so fun, smart, hilarious, and I have a feeling we'll meet her again. I really like her!Nico, my baby! The poor boy's been through TOO MUCH, and if there's a Nico protection squad I'd like to join it, thank you very much. We meet our fair share of gods in this book again (Poseidon's cameo there at the end made me laugh for an actual ten minutes afterwards), and Grover and Tyson are staples to this series, of course. 
plotline
-like I said before: it was such a nice change. I love the first three books A LOT, but the plotlines felt a bit repetitive. The Battle of the Labyrinth's plotline was exciting and kept me on my toes. That's literally all I feel like I need to say, because it was good. Another reason why tBotL is my favorite book PJO yet. 
representation
-It's... good? We've got our gay characters (Nico!) and our ships (Percabeth) but other than that there isn't much. I understand, though, because it's a struggle in fantasy books like this where there's this whole world with different species, so putting a lot of rep in it is difficult. I gotta hand it to Uncle Rick, though; his mythology is good and spot on 1000%. What he excels in (which is just about everything), he excels in. 
relationships
-do I even need to say anything for this section? ------PERCABETH FOR LIFE------okay I'm done now, but yes, I have fallen into the Percabeth fandom hole and I don't think I'll ever get out <3 <3
world-building
-This is hands-down one of Rick Riordan's strongest areas of expertise. These books make me want to actually BE in the Percy Jackson world of Demigods and Gods. I'm in no way a Greek god believer, but reading about them like this introduces me to a whole new perspective of them and knowledge of them as well. He does the same thing for Norse and Egyptian and Roman mythology, AND IM SO EXCITED TO READ MORE OF HIS BOOKS!!!! Seriously, though. The world is masterfully crafted and has a solution to everything. No world holes or anything. It all fits together like a jigsaw puzzle, and it's so amazing. Also, ya girl's a Daughter of Athena and proud of it :)
overall review
-gosh, I love this book. It's so fun (yes I'm aware I've used this word at least fifteen times but it's 10 in the night and I have no brain power left :). I can't rave about it. Did the end fight scene disappoint me just a little bit? Yes, but I've heard the final book in PJO has an epic last fight to finish off the series, so I'll overlook that one thing. Everything from the world to the characters to the plot in this book was perfect. Please read it if you haven't, because it's amazing!!!oh and btw I feel like I'm missing something to talk about, but I can't remember so... cool? Am I late to the hype, though? Yes, yes I am. Riordan literally JUST released the last book in his whole Greek Mythology series compilation, but here I am raving about the fourth PJO book :)Anyways, 5 stars!

This is super satisfying because all of this build up finally gives us something more than just the fun light reads that the series was before this.

58,846318098,02/05/2014,3.0,"The Battle of the Labyrinth is the fourth of Rick Riordan’s Percy Jackson and the Olympians series, following after The Lightning Thief, The Sea of Monsters, and The Titan's Curse. For those readers who have been off the grid for years, Percy Jackson is the half-mortal son of Poseidon, Greek God of the Sea, who has been training at Camp Half-Blood for years to confront the ominous Kronos and his Titans; a group of divine beings determined to avenge their ancient defeat and destroy the Olympian gods. Like several books in the series, this one begins with Seaweed Brain (a.k.a. Percy) attending yet another new school; one that he is determined he will not get kicked out of. Unfortunately, for all his good intentions, Percy seems to attract trouble, and so as soon as he enters the doors of the establishment, monsters (This time cute, peppy and man-eating cheerleader variety) attack him. After a fight, the accidental burning of a school classroom, and the reintroduction of a mortal girl named Rachel Elizabeth Dare, who just happens to have the ability to see through the Mist (You know, the divine cloud that hides gods and monsters from mortal perception), Percy decides to head back to Camp Half-Blood. I mean, it has to be safer than regular school, right?Once there, Percy finds that it isn’t, because there are issues looming large in the land of demigods, satyrs and nymphs. Grover, the satyr with the most, is an emotional wreck, because his dream of finding the lost god Pan might be taken away from him. Annabeth, daughter of Athena and Percy’s best friends who is a girl, seems to be extremely irritated with him and acting oddly. And then there is Nico di Angelo, the more than a little emo son of Hades, who is out and about in the underworld trying to resurrect his dead sister in exchange for another, living soul – preferably Percy’s. And guess what? Those are the not so bad things going on at camp, because the danger of Kronos is almost overwhelming, as it has become obvious that his followers are planning to attack Camp Half-Blood!So what do you do if you are a bunch of teenage demigods waiting around for an all-powerful being to attack you camp? What else: you go on an epic quest.So like old times, Annabeth is assigned a quest (This time a trip through the perilous and ever-changing Labyrinth of Daedalus) with her best buds Percy, Grover and Percy's Cyclops half-brother, Tyson, tagging along. The fun, fights, growing up and general adventures follow thereafter. Without a doubt, The Battle of the Labrinyth is Percy Jackson’s most action-packed book yet, filled with monsters, gods, demigods, and battles. It succeeds in being fun as well as poignant with real danger, real horror, and real death entering the lives of our teenage heroes. But more than that, it does a great job of building up excitement for the next book, never letting a reader forget that in The Last Olympian the final battle of the gods will occur and – according to a prophecy – either Percy or Nico di Angelo will make a decision that either destroys or saves Olympus!",25,0.4861,0.132,0.729,0.139,0.3876276802907238,POSITIVE,0.5837

Fun times!!Percy is back in fine form, with another dramatic school exit leading into another chaotic summer of dealing with godly issues while trying not to get his friends or himself killed. Yeah. Good luck with that, kid.
WARNING: This review contains spoilers for the previous three books in the series.
Things are not going well for the gods and their offspring because, thanks to our old traitor friend, Kronos is getting closer to restoration and the titans are shaping up for one hectic brawl. Grover is more motivated than ever to find Pan, and Annabeth and Clarisse actually agree on something so clearly these are dire times. Their conclusion? It's time to venture into The Labyrinth. Please leave your fears at the door and don't forget to take your trusty Handsome Hero with you, Annabeth.If you know your myths then you'll smile knowingly when you encounter names like Minos, Daedalus (and his son <3), Theseus and Ariadne. The twists and turns of the labyrinth also lead us to an interesting assortment of allies and enemies so don't try to expect anything other than the unexpected. Percy's advance through his teenage years is also becoming more evident as we see his interactions with the ladies acquire a wonderful clueless charm despite his growing confusion over his feelings. NOT THE TIME, PERCE. FOCUS.I must say I really loved this adventure, even though things are getting more serious and we're starting to appreciate the magnitude of what's happening. There's an urgency to this story that we haven't encountered before now and I think it really amps up the tension and makes it a much more thrilling read. I didn't have to deal with Thalia being a pain this time and I am keen for more Rachel. Annabeth is a BADASS BABE as always. The squad is solid.One more book to go in this series and I'm starting to get sad that it's nearly over! But it's really been a fun series and this one was another easy read.

He honestly says the funniest things sometimes and I absolutely love his character to pieces. I also really liked seeing Rachel again in this book as well. I’m interested to see the role she will play in this last book. As for Annabeth, well she honestly kind of annoyed me sometimes in this book. Like I just really need her to get over Luke already.

Poseidon,’ I said. Then I whispered, ‘Help me with Nico, and Luke, and Grover’s problem …
Problems...problems...problems everywhere.▶ Nico hates Percy and blames him for his sister's death. Would he pose a new problem?▶ Grover is about to be exiled by the council of elders because he hasn't found the god Pan.▶ Luke remains forever the faithful antagonist, who doesn't relent in his vengeful schemes and plans to bring back Kronos, the Titan lord, bring down Olympus and end the reign of gods.▶ Annabeth is still trying to come to terms with the fact that NOT EVERYONE CAN BE SAVED. Let go honey. Luke is not worth it.▶ The old gods are stirring, to whom would they pledge allegiance? And what about the minor gods?▶ And wee...it's about time Percy's hormones started raging. Uh. Not.All these sum up to the need for a 
quest
(of course) which leads Percy, Grover, Annabeth, and my baby Tyson into Daelalus's labyrinth in search of god pan and answers concerning Luke's  new scheme. And of course we get our 
usual dose of adventure 
and infusion of new characters.
My thoughts
I never thought I'd be the one to wish an 11year old kid dead, no matter how steadfast they were in the their path, on the wrong side of the road. But I did, I kept wishing Nico(and Luke) would just die already at the beginning of the story.You know how the question of salvation for the lost is always a touchy one, a very hard subject to explore indeed. How far off the deep end does someone have to go before you deem them unredeemable? How broken and lost do they have to be before you finally say to yourself, "" I can't do it anymore. You're gone. I give up"".This is just a children's book series but the topic keeps popping up as an underlying theme; First with Luke (Percy's antagonist), and for a while with Nico.  And I just love how the story impresses the importance of
 family and friendship
 too. That's probably what I love most about this series. Well that and the adventurous air about itAnnabeth annoyed me so much, she became so bitchy really unpleasant in this book. What an appropriate response to the change in dynamic between you and Percy! *Clapping like a giddy child* Bravo Annabeth. UGHH JUST STOPThe books prior to this, I received as gleeful entertainment, it was all games and fun. I'm pretty sobered up now. The war is finally at the heroes' doorsteps, this book is the final step towards the doom prophesied to take place in the last installment of the series(when Percy turns 16). One last book before the end of the series. I just wish it wouldn't end yet. I've really come to love this series, the characters, their world, and the foundation it's built on;Greek mythology. I really appreciate everything this series offers.It's amazing how imparting books are even when they don't mean to be. If there's one thing I've learned about books it's;

I just got stubborn with book 3 and forgave many things. This will not happen again.You see, I'm starting to get really annoyed by the fact that they're all the same... with some minimal changes.I hate formulaic books, okay? I feel as if I'm being cheated - as if the author is only using me to get money - so the fact that all these damned books follow the same formula annoys me a lot, no matter how entertaining they are.And we have to add also the amount of Deus Ex Machinas used. Rick Riordan has surpassed the limits of my patience with them. They are just too many!However, when I said this was better than book 3, I meant it. The plot is more entertaining and less predictable (although some of the twists were painfully obvious), the characters are just as fantastic, and it was so much fun.I have one problem regarding the characters, though, and that is they don't seem to age a day. I'm not talking about Chiron or any of the gods - it's mainly Percy. He feels the same boy he was in book 1. I'm not saying I want big changes, but I suppose facing death several times in two years must gradually shape you into a different person, and not to mention the fact that now he is almost 15 years old... and yet he still sounds like a 12-year-old.Nonetheless, I forgave this small bug because of a line he said almost at the end:That’s when I ran. There wasn’t even any thought to it. No debate in my mind about—gee, should I stand up to him and try to fight again? Nope, I simply ran.How awesome is it the fact that he doesn't play the brave hero and just embraces the fact that he's afraid? It's so rare to see that. I loved it!Also, can I just slap some sense to Annabeth? Sure, she's Athena's daughter, but Christ, stop being ""territorial"" (as Chiron said) about your friends! Percy can talk to all the girls he wants! He's not your property! Jeez.Compared to book 3's ending, this felt more weak in my opinion because of the Deus Ex Machina used ((view spoiler)[Grover's panic scream (hide spoiler)]), but that didn't prevent me from wanting to pick the last book ASAP. I'm nervous about picking it up since it's the last, but I'm so curious as to how this will end.Off to book 5!",21,-0.9528,0.126,0.786,0.088,0.4925433739387228,NEGATIVE,1.0

When they reach the Camp Half-Blood, Annabeth and Percy accidentally find an entrance into the Labyrinth during a competition organized by Quintus. It presents a possible invasion route into the Camp for Luke and Kronos’s army. “We need to go in,” Annabeth Announced. “We have to find the workshop before Luke does. If Daedalus is alive, we convince him to help us, not Luke. If Ariadne’s string still exists, we make sure it never falls into Luke’s hands.”  The Oracle delivers the prophecy. The quest is to be completed under the leadership of Annabeth, and she chooses Percy, Tyson, and Rachel to accompany her as she endeavors to stop Luke Castellan and his army from invading Camp Half-Blood through Daedalus’s Labyrinth by trying to prevent Ariadne’s string from falling into his hands. “You shall delve into the darkness of the endless maze,The dead, the traitor, and the lost one raise.You shall rise or fall by the ghost king’s hand,The child of Athena’s final stand.Destroy with a hero’s final breath,And lose a love to worse than death.Riordan has intricately written the Labyrinth and through it introduces a variety of ancient monsters and explores lesser-known gods. As Annabeth and her friends travel through the Labyrinth and the mystery unwinds, the quest becomes thrilling, action-packed and it took an unexpected turn after the revelation of Daedalus. Often, White authors write and publish offensive content when they try to include diversity just for the sake of it. Likewise, Riordan made an insensitive remark concerning African readers. If they only hire sensitive readers before publishing a book! “The other was African American with dark curly hair like Medusa’s (and, believe me, I know what I’m talking about).” As an author, Riordan never disappoints, and I’m amazed at how much I enjoy this series as an adult reader.

Definitely the run in with the Sphinx. That was hilarious. (Perhaps even more so because I am a teacher, and I know that Rick Riordan used to be a teacher.)2. Annabeth's birth is explained. It always bugged me that she is the daughter of a virgin goddess. 3. I like how we get to meet a couple more gods in every book. Their descriptions are always humorous. 4.

77,1942233530,03/14/2017,4.0,"My love, my love, my love~---------------This series never ceases to amaze me with the plot. For a series that has used so many ideas and stories that have been told before for centuries and centuries – it somehow ends up being one of the most creative and original storylines that I have ever read. I would like to look into Rick Riordan’s brain because how the heck can anyone imagine and create something so… brilliant?Anyway, this series is getting increasingly more serious and mature. There have always been lessons for the characters to learn in each book, but the mood of this book certainly feels more somber. It makes sense considering how Percy is literally growing up and maturing, and having to shoulder more burdens. I like that it’s forming this new dimension because of his physical and emotional growth, but at the same time, I can’t help but miss the “good, ole times” where it was a lot more light and relationships weren’t so complicated.…Speaking of complicated relationships, there is certainly a bigger presence in the romance. In the previous books, there were just a few cute moments, and some potential crushing/infatuation. This book is where Percy is reaching that awkward age (*cough* puberty *cough*) where he likes a girl, and he maybe likes her more than that? But it’s weird and awkward and he doesn’t know what the heck he is doing? It’s kinda funny and cute, but also, I’m cringing because wow, he’s such a disaster. And while the depiction of Percy starting to see his female companions as “more” is rather realistic, I am not entirely sure if I like some of the developments in this book.The only real uninspiring aspect of this book, for me, is the Calypso arc. I understand that Rick Riordan is trying to first, show another aspect of The Odyssey and second, give a different perspective to Calypso. I have to admit that I have never liked Calypso, at least the way Homer told the story with her in it. She just seems so irritating and weak and man-obsessed and disrespectful, etc. etc. It’s really the feminist side of me rolling my eyes (at both Calypso and Odysseus). On the other hand, Rick Riordan shows her as a victim – a kind, lonely girl who has been cursed to be lonely forever. I don’t hate this angle because I suppose it could make sense why she is so desperate for someone to be tied down with her on her island. However, I am simply not convinced because her arc is so short, maybe a chapter or 2, with the most vague and brief information. She obviously SEEMS nice, but there is no personality or real interaction besides her helping Percy out and “oh wow their hands brushed.” *eyeroll* If I were to be convinced to genuinely like Calypso as a character, I need more substance, more personality, more real interactions. Perhaps the brevity is an intentional move because we are not supposed to love Calypso as much as we do for Annabeth. Or perhaps only Percy should be affected by her, while even the audience has to be excluded in seeing her genuine “greatness.” Or perhaps it is written to be more like a “dream sequence,” and it’s written like a total blur to us, but the impact has still been great on Percy. Anyway, that is me playing devil’s advocate because this whole thing dimmed my enjoyment of the book a bit. I finished this Calypso arc feeling just weird… especially seeing Percy appearing so somber and deeply affected and saying stuff like “my biggest what-if,” while I’m here, thinking, “Wait. What? We literally just met her a second ago!” Anyway, besides this one weird area in the book, I really have enjoyed this book.There have been some interesting developments in this book – most of them are good. 4 stars for amazing plot and endearing characters.Things that you might want to know (WARNING: Spoilers below)Is there a happy/satisfying ending?

“Be careful of love. It'll twist your brain around and leave you thinking up is down and right is wrong.” 
These books are really cute and fun and I love the characters. I think the plots are a bit predictable, but they ARE middle grade so I can't really fault them too hard for that. There was actually some twists and turns that surprised me which was really nice! I love Percy, Annabeth, Grover, Tyson and Nico so much and it's always fun to follow them. I really liked how much of a role Nico had in this one and he's a really interesting character. This book definitely felt more mature then the last one, and things are definitely getting serious. I was living for the Percabeth romance angst jghdkjg they're so cute and I THRIVE off of this angst thing but also that they're such good friends anyway. Percy is so clueless though rip. I have to say, I listened to this on audiobook and I hate that the narrator used a strong accent to narrate the Japanese character. That felt really uncomfortable and kind of messy? The audiobooks aren't my favourite anyway (but I don't have the physicals so it has to do) and that just kind of felt .. very uncomfortable.

I'm still really enjoying my reread of the original series. I liked the new myths that are woven into this installment, again. Daedalus is a great characters, and I liked how he and Nico had some major reflecting to do in order to decide where they stand. The growth of the characters was really well done. I like that children other than the main 14ish deities are being brought up. It's a little more angsty than I usually like, but I mean... it's Percy and Annabeth.

85,211680090,09/20/2011,5.0,"I have a kind of unconditional love relationship with this series. By which I mean I love it regardless of what anyone else might say. And this book, The Battle of the Labyrinth was a favourite in the series when I read it. That said I don't want to merely write a review that indicates my emotional reaction to this series but also my thoughtful philosophical reaction.I am on record as having said that I can't appreciate a book unless there's something for me to take out of it. No doubt there would be many people who would think: 'what can you get out of these adolescent books aside from a quick fun read?' I don't want to be condescending and say that they're reading these wrong but they are. All jokes aside, I think that some books resonate with audiences in different ways. I see things in some of these better YA books that I don't even see in the established classical novels. I see things in established novels that others don't. We all have our own personal way of looking at books which I think reflects on our ways of looking at the world.I love the mythology in this book. I've always loved mythology and I particularly like the twist Rick Riordan has with his modern myths. If I were teaching 12 year old children about Greek mythology I'd utilise these as a tool. They are quick reads, I personally can read them in the time it would take me to watch any movie version, and that's perfect for children wanting entertaining information about the Greek myths. Also, I find that the book's writing perfectly encapsulates Percy Jackson's perspective nicely. He's a bit of a humorous and unreliable narrator and I find him an endearing protagonist. Speaking about humour I've always found that the funniest jokes or witticisms are those which contain truth or reflect on truth. In many ways the narration is very funny and quite clever.This book has plenty of fun with a narrative journey featuring a quest into the labyrinth of Daedalus, a meeting with Hephaestus, Titans, monsters and mortals. The plot also leads the series closer to the final climactic battle between the good and evil. So, if you've read up to here in the series you can expect more of the same and yet for some reason this is one of my favourite books in the series. With the last being my favourite.Fun aside I do pick up some interesting motifs in the series. I feel this book of all of them reveals the overall ideas of the series best. Yes, you have the typical ideas about good and evil, although for children's literature Riordan does an excellent job of portraying the ambiguity of his characters. In one book the gods want to kill Percy Jackson and in another they want to honour him as family. Yet a motif I observed in this story is the one of changeability. This series and in particular this book, has the idea of how everything in time changes and yet at the same time stays the same. It is the idea that old ideas (the gods, the monsters, the old mythological locations) rise up again in new forms (gods with technology, monsters running boutiques and mythological locations in key tourist hotspots). It is also the idea that people change over time. We see the protagonist Percy Jackson change. We see the villains and the secondary characters change. And yet at the same time they are the same characters we begun with. Change is such a fascinating topic to me. At the same time it is one many people both like to think about and want to ignore. There are some changes which are awkward, which we want to rebel against. No one wants to grow old or to undergo the final change from life to death. No one wants to undergo a change which causes us to lose friends or families. There are many things we sentimentally do not want to change and hence why nostalgia is such an appealing idea. There are also changes we want (changes to laws for the good, new ideas arising, new books, new movies, new distractions). And yet I still hold this idea that there really is nothing new but rather all changes now are things which arise from the old. I think this series addresses that idea excellently.I encourage anyone who is young at heart or looking for a fun read full of mythology to read these. And perhaps if you've already read these maybe you won't look at them quite the same when you consider that there are deeper ideologies and motifs in these novels.",18,0.9975,0.083,0.762,0.155,0.4876277838627237,POSITIVE,0.9999
86,1808299647,11/10/2016,5.0,"I stand by my claim that Nico Di Angelo is the most important part of this book despite only being in it for five seconds because I love him. But let me try to actually review this book properly. This is my favorite book in the PJO series, which I find a bit funny since it follows my least favorite book in this series. I think the development that we get in terms of Percy's relationships in this book is *chef's kiss* and honestly it makes the whole book for me. This time around, I also realized just how much of the Heroes of Olympus series is set up in this book, which I think I really appreciated the first time around because not everything was always wrapped up in a neat package and it felt messy which I love. I also completely forgot what the plot of this book was and the plot twist shocked me just as much the second time around as it did the first time and I absolutely love when that happens. There was also so much happening, concerning the plot, but it was structured really well and in a way that never felt like the plot was rushed or too slow. I really loved the way different plot lines intertwined and connected and I love the labyrinth so much and!! God the plot in this book is just so good. My one criticism of this book is Annabeth and Rachel's hatred/resentment of each other makes absolutely zero sense and I wish this would stop happening in books, but I also really liked how it was resolved and I really appreciated that it didn't get worse than it was at the beginning of the book. It's lovely to watch Percy develop more and more as I reread these books because I absolutely love seeing Percy's journey as a character and it's bringing me more joy than I expected it to, which is always a pleasant surprise. ~~~nico di angelo: has like 50 pages of page time in this 350+ page bookme, a gay: he is my son and i would die for him",18,0.9969,0.051,0.732,0.217,0.5187037037037037,POSITIVE,0.9983

THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ANNABETH'S QUEST. My girl waited for her quest since she was seven! And when she finally gets one, everyone but her was important in it.
Annabeth was so useless and extra in this book- which was meant to be HER quest- that it could be written without her and nothing would change. If anything, Percy and Rachel will get some peace. The only thing Anna did here was nag Percy about Rachel because jealousy, jealousy and Percy is completely oblivious to both his and her feelings.Even Tyson, the allegedly dumb Cyclops was more of use than Annabeth Chase, daughter to Athena, the wisest girl in the camp, alleged leader of this quest.Annabeth was supposed to be the leader of the quest. Not Percy, not this Rachel girl. Zoe Nightshade, Thalia Grace came for one book and had more action and importance than Annabeth in the fourth, which was supposed to be centred around her.Annabeth's personality only consists of:1. Luke is good. I'll save him🥺2. Percy understands nothing. Not Luke, neither my feelings so instead of talking to him I'll pass snarky comments.3. ✨Architecture✨ I'VE LOVED ANNABETH CHASE. This being her quest, I was expecting character development- development other than teenage boy drama. She's her own self.. not just a sidekick to Percy who could turn invisible.Even Grover got more development here.Talking about Grover. Wow! Now this is what we call character arc. I couldn't write more about it without giving serious spoilers but Pan! I'm more invested in Grover than Percy at the moment.Dionysus. He's my favourite God! After Poseidon, of course. He hardly comes for 10-20 pages a book but even he has more story, development than Annabeth. He's got a backstory, is really funny.. like really, really funny. Feigns indifference towards the Camp's children but cares for them. Hell! Chiron and He are the reason the Camp's standing strong.I really need to talk about the monsters in this book. Woah!!! I'm so absolutely terrified of them. Especially Kampe! The way Mr. Riordan describes them is so vivid.I would really appreciate to know your thoughts about Annabeth's character writing. Actually I NEED to know others' opinion. And please don't say 6 more books are left.. we're already 4 books in. That's quite enough to flesh out a character.Here after reading the first three pages of TLO:▪️Rachel got a whole chapter named after her, saw it in the contents. Did Annabeth get one after/about her in FIVE EFFING BOOKS?!▪️ Percy and Rachel are out on a vacation on a beach- ALONE. In Percy's Prius. Rachel kissed Percy!!!

94,3655124887,01/12/2021,4.0,Just a heads up-There may be some tiny spoilers but not enough for me to want to put the spoilers thing up. This book wasnt as great as the previous ones but still a good read. I don't know why I didn't enjoy it. It started off really interesting but I just couldn't get into it. It took me while to read this book even though I loved the plot line. I think it was really unique to add in a huge maze that can kill you if you take a wrong turn. It was just the right thing to add to a book about half bloods. I was relieved when Grover and Tyson were found alive and that they weren't injured whatsoever. I was shocked thought the Grover actually found Pan. I mean no offense but I had no faith in him at ALL!! I thought he was gonna lose his searchers license and sit forever in mourn at camp with Juniper. I really love how Rick Riordan adds such a diverse personality to every one of these characters and each has a tragic and amazing backstory that is similar to no one!! He really knows how to hook a reader into loving and connecting with characters. The battle scene closer to the end when all the monsters come out of the entrance at camp really intrigued me. I enjoyed how each cabin had a specific task in the battle and they were all comfortable in doing what they needs to do. AND DON'T GET ME STARTED WITH ANNABETH!!!!!I just want to die over her!!! I really do feel like I connect with her on so many levels and every story I feel like I am somehow brought closer to her. In this book she really took responsibility for what she needed to do but also relied on others to help her throughout everything. I think everyone needs to be a little bit of an Annabeth. We all need to have courage and trust our friends but also be smart and cautious at the same time.Ok now back to the book. Some parts I really enjoyed but during some parts I just wanted to fall asleep. I understand that Percys dreams are important but they bore me to death!! And Rachel Elizabeth Dare just doesn't seem like she needs to be there. I don't know why but I feel like she was a just silly add on and just doesn't have much of a purpose. And why do we need to know so much about Nico?? I get hes the son of Hades and all but come on. This kid just seems like a big coward and is only doing what's best for him and his sister (who isn't even alive)!!! Like kid get real. You're not the only person who's in danger out there!Although this book was definitely not my favorite in the series I'm still looking forward to reading the fifth one.,16,0.9921,0.132,0.671,0.197,0.5356256332320162,NEGATIVE,0.974

The same goes for college, which will make you think you should use the little leisure time you have to accomplish some delayed tasks - Ok, I may have some other problems right now and should probably be dealing with them instead of writing this review. Whatever. This year I had the aim of increasing my reading time. As I still enjoy been a functional human being, and my sleep schedule is on the limit of my mental and physical health, I started doing audiobooks (during my gym time; nothing is perfect). First, I started with some science books, extremely segmented, so I could begin to train my attention while working out. All this to say that this is the first romance I've listened to and, I must say, I think I started with the right foot. “Don't feel bad, I'm usually about to die.” We all are, Percy. All the time. Revisit this series after so many years brought me a joy I couldn't imagine it was so easy to achieve. Actually, I don't even remember why haven't I finished it during my teenage years. Anyway, I was glad to meet again Percy with his sassiness and Annabeth with her knowledge and almost arrogant wisdom (it sure also reminds us of other protagonists of famous YA series, but let's ignore that).In this adventure, we get closer to answers than we have ever gotten. The war is coming, Luke and Chronos' plans start to reveal themselves, and the battle is knockin' on Half-Blood Camp door. Riordan presents us with laughs, love, morale endurance and some painful goodbyes - maybe not the best book for a gym reading unless you wanna make yourself look like a fool. The scenario for most of the story? The Labyrinth of Dedalus! At first, I was a little skeptical about it. However, I must admit that it soon became a natural enough scenario for me. Congratulations, Rick Riordan. “But remember, boy, that a kind act can sometimes be as powerful as a sword.” A cheerful reading of a series about which I had almost forgotten and which I plan to finish still this year (fingers crossed!).",17,0.9814,0.083,0.757,0.159,0.5417328042328041,POSITIVE,0.9981

Anyway, this book is so great. I've said that in practically every review I've written of this series but I mean it. I'm not even sure what I'd rate it. I have a distinct feeling that The Last Olympian will surpass it. I think it'll earn the five stars.Let's start off from the beginning...the orientation at Goode High School was very interesting. Rachel being there was extremely convenient for the plot, which did bother me somewhat in the beginning, but it leveled out eventually. Rachel is a very interesting character, and honestly, I do think she as a character is way too convenient because somehow she's always available to come and save the day. I do like her though, I think she's very strong-willed and admirable and I love that for her. The demon cheerleaders were an interesting plotline as well. I hated them with a passion but it was a very interesting action sequence.The awkwardness with Annabeth cracked me up the whole time. I do know how it's all going to end, which made it even funnier to me, and every single scene where there was a subtle commentary about her and Percy's feelings for each other made me fangirl. That one scene on Mount St. Helens made me scream internally and every single awkward reference to it made me laugh as well. Also, the fact that Annabeth considered that Percy might be the ""love"" from her prophecy melted my heart. Quality content.Tyson and Grover honestly made huge comebacks for me in terms of likability. When Tyson offered to go with Grover to find Pan, and he called him a ""friend"", my face contorted into the puppy dog eyes emoji that I would insert if I was typing on my iPhone. Grover does bother me at times still, but that's natural for characters. We vibe, so it's all good. Tyson is such a good friend and loyal brother and it's just...o))))I have some words to say to Annabeth, here we go: Annabeth, as much as I love you, as much as you are one of my favorite characters in this series...PLEASE STOP GETTING HUNG UP ON LUKE! I do understand that she loved him (as a family member, yes, as more, well, that's debatable) but he has turned evil. You are allowed to be sad, but don't shut out the other people in your life who really care about you*cough* Percy *cough* *cough*!Speaking of Percy, I love him. If you've read my other reviews you will know this already. It's simply a fact. I've also mentioned how much I love his narration. That still rings too as well. He is SO annoying sometimes though...oblivion centralizes his character in general and he can be SO dense. I still love him though.Let's talk about something I haven't mentioned at all in this review: the plot! The plot was confusing at times but it was also very intriguing. The parts that fell flat to me were all the dream sequences though...sometimes those were just plain boring. The reveal with Quintus shocked me though...it was probably fairly obvious but I can be dense when reading sometimes. The plot was not as interesting as I would have hoped but I did like it better than most of the others. It was very well written and woven together even though it was riddled with convenience.Calypso is now one of my favorite characters. She is so beautiful in mindset, actions, and physical! Now, of course, I didn't want Percy to end up with her but I felt terrible for her when she revealed her feelings and that she was stuck on the island. Calypso, I'll come for you! We can be best friends! (omg what even is this review)The dynamic between Rachel and Annabeth made me feel so weird. I obviously can't justify Annabeth's rudeness towards Rachel because girl-on-girl hate is just not it for me, but I can say it does make sense and it's very realistic. Was there a real reason for her to be acting like that towards Rachel though? I mean, I ship Percabeth so I don't want to seem biased, but Percy never seemed to show that much romantic interest towards her. He seemed very interested in the idea of Rachel like ""whoa, what if she..."" but his mind always seemed to be focused on Annabeth. I do hope that Rachel and Annabeth develop some sort of friendship, though. Annabeth needs some girl friends.I love the way Rick Riordan wrote Nico in this book. He is very complex even though he is still just a little boy. It broke my heart how what happened to Bianca shattered his innocent Mythomagic-playing little boy identity into this dark soul who doesn't want to express sadness or fear. I really hope he isn't messed up by Kronos in the last book, it would break my heart if he was ruined even more.The gods finally seem to be giving a f***, thank the Lord. Dionysus saving Grover from exile is probably one of the most surprising things in this group and I just love that he did. Poseidon coming to visit Percy was also extremely unexpected and heartwarming too, but I'll talk about this later. Paul Blowfish being jealous of him made me laugh though haha.I laughed out loud for like 25% of the book. Awkward situations make me laugh all the time for some reason, even if it's totally not funny, it just cracks me up. These books are literally so funny, especially since I just came from binge reading The Mortal Instruments with serious undertones and a monotone impartial narrator.Now we're back to the ending scene. The ending scene of Percy's birthday party was so sweet, especially since Poseidon came by. Poseidon telling Percy that he was his favorite son almost made me cry a million times. I must have reread that part ten billion times. I also hope that Nico and Percy become friends because it was so nice how Nico came inside for some blue cake.Side note: Am I the only one who literally remembers everything about every single book they have ever read? I literally have a shelf of four or five books that I don't remember anything about because those are the only ones I can't remember. But I was talking to my school friend after I finished this book because I wanted to talk to someone about it. It's one of her favorite series but she didn't remember a thing about it...Overall, this book was the best so far, I just found it so fun and intriguing. For the next book, I hope Nico and Percy are friends, I hope the plot convenience dies down, and I hope Perachel lasts two days :) (no hate to those who ship them, we all have our own opinions). Thanks for reading this, you guys! If you read this whole thing you're a real one!

Percy:Frustration is all I feel when I think of this character. He really is blind, isn't he? I mean, I understand that most teenage boys are like this, but he's 15, 15!!!!!!!!!!! He still acts like he's 10. Either I'm missing the character development or it just isn't there. I'm going to go with the latter because I think I would have remembered it considering I've been waiting for 4 BOOKS. It's fine, it's fine. I ask for too much, I assure you. He also is so easily distracted by gorgeous females. Seriously??? You're supposed to be the one to either destroy or save the world and you run away the moment another girl walks into your life. I'm disappointed in you Percy. Annabeth:(view spoiler)[""Annabeth glared at me like she was going to punch me. And then she did something that surprised me even more. She kissed me."" (hide spoiler)]I CAN'T HANDLE THIS. I missed Annabeth so much in the last book, or was it the book before? It was the last book, right? See what I mean! These books all just blur together. I can't tell any of them apart in my mind. Anyway, Annabeth was still a bit too helpless in some situations for my taste, but hey, what's new? Other than that, she was still a badass female character and I can't wait to see what she does next. (starts singing AJR song)Grover:NOPE NOPE NOPE. I guess good for you? You disappeared a quarter of the way into the book because you felt ✨Pan's presence✨. Give me a break, please! Spare me the agony! I really, REALLY HATE this character. He has yet to do ANYTHING in 4 FREAKING BOOKS. I said in my review of the first book that he could disappear and I wouldn't notice. Well, guess what? He disappeared and I didn't realize he had until Percy mentioned that he was in trouble. He was so POINTLESS that I didn't even take note of his absence until Percy went looking for him. WHAT THE HELL. I should NOTICE when a character DISAPPEARS but Grover is so damn forgettable that I just didn't care. Yay! You found a dead god. You FAILED. The only 'purpose' you ever served was to find Pan and you failed there too. Now, what is the point of your existence? Answer: there isn't one and there never has been. Your dialogue isn't good, your character sucks and you have an overly clingy girlfriend. PLUS you can't even bother to tolerate your best friend's half-brother even though it is BLATANTLY OBVIOUS how much it hurts Percy. You also won't even consider going underground because YOU'RE TOO SCARED. WELL GUESS WHAT? SO IS EVERYONE ELSE BUT YOU DON'T SEE THEM COMPLAINING. YOU WANTED TO FIND PAN AND YET YOU WON'T DO THE ONE THING THAT MAY ACTUALLY LEAD YOU TO HIM. UGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHOthers:I don't think any of the other characters were all too important, so they all get to share this section. Rachel Elizabeth Dare should have her own section, but after the rant about Grover, I really don't feel like it. So here are my thoughts, Rachel is wonderful, Nico is meh, Luke is bleh, I feel like Ethan will be important, Father-Son moments, Go Sally!, and I'm sorry Pollux. Again, the characters are extremely forgettable.

The Plot

It is still the exact same plot as the other 4 books. It was ok. Wasn't great, wasn't terrible. The fifth book will probably be the exact same. As you can see, all of the books are blurring together. This is what happens when you don't come up with original plots. The empathy bond STILL has not been explained. *sigh* I already know it never will be, but still, *sigh*

I don't know why she bugged me so much but she wasn't my favorite in this one.I feel like Percy is always in trouble and Grover too. I wonder what the next adventure will bring them.

105,21446916,05/02/2008,5.0,". . . that I can enjoy a book series as much as Harry Potter! I really love Percy Jackson and the Olympians, probably even more than the kids. As I have said before, they are even better read-a-louds, to my elementary age children, than the Potter series. The dialogue is rich (work on your many voices) and just about any page is a great stopping point because there are so many cliff hanging action moments. Nothing is ever slow in this series.Probably the best thing about Percy Jackson in the Olympians and how it compares best to the Potter series is that it is FUNNY. The humor ranges from slapstick to clever, but book 4 is the least humorous of the bunch. What comes more to the forefront in the story is character developement and heartache. Yep, this is the most on target with Greek mythology in terms of tragedy and consequence. The characters are maturing and changing realistically from year to year so Labyrinth is also richer in romance and the dark elements increase as the characters age up. So, another similarity to Potter is that the young characters are always faced with difficult decisions that effect more than just their individual lives. You can change your actions but the impact of your choices can sometimes be everlasting.In Labyrinth, we also get a more in depth study of some of the most familiar Greek characters, like Daedalus the father of Icarus. I thought the author's take on Daedalus' life after the fall was both original and captivating. (You see Daedalus early in the book so I don't consider this a spoiler. - I sure hope not, I hate those.)The saddest part of this series is that there is just one more book left. If you or your kids love greek mythology and/or good ya fantasy then definitely try this series out! I haven't had a book in a long time that I just wanted to turn around and read immediately again after. There are more subplots in this story then in the previous ones and I just want to revisit the characters and dwell with them in their many different experiences. And sorry book loyalists but I can't wait until the movies come out! And if any of you want to start a fan club - I am so in.",16,0.9962,0.034,0.776,0.19,0.5199763593380615,POSITIVE,0.6707
106,2767956056,06/15/2019,4.0,"My youngest son (age 9) is getting into reading books, flew through this book in about 3 days, and insisted that it was so good that I must read it too. With such a strong endorsement, how could I refuse?And it was a fun read. It does a good job engaging the reader on a series of adventures that readers of all ages can enjoy, and keeps things moving enough to engage younger readers' attention spans. It also does well in interesting younger readers in the Greco-Roman myths and figures that figure prominently as motifs and themes in so much of Western literature and art. I liked how it related them to current times (Poseidon appearing in human form as a beach bum, the shepherd of the gods appearing as a Western rancher, etc.) which made the book entertaining and humorous. It also does great at super-imposing legendary locations alongside or within such locations as Mt. St. Helens, the Garden of the Gods, Times Square, etc, such that it may make young readers want to learn more about these locations named in the book.So, all in all, a great book for young readers.

I found myself ripping through it at breakneck speed, because I was so interested to see what happened next. I was not expecting to like this series this much...but I did. I can understand now why it is so popular. The characters are becoming more three-dimensional and the dangers are becoming more real (but even with all this said, these are still relatively light-hearted books.)I don't know why so many people compare these books to Harry Potter. I think they are completely different animals. Riordan's tone and voice is a far cry from Rowling's. I feel it unfair to compare these two series.

109,2329188190,02/15/2019,4.0,"My review  “Don't feel bad, I'm usually about to die.”If you thought Percy was going to get a break from monsters and Olympians, you are so wrong. Percy got a shot at a new school but during his orientation gets attacked by two dracanae. I’d probably be surprised if anything went with no trouble in Percy’s life xd After setting his school on fire (again), he leaves with Annabeth for Half-Blood Camp where new problems are awaiting.Labyrinth is an ancient, giant structure designed by Daedalus. It is located below America’s surface and has hidden entrances all over the continent. Namely, space and time in labyrinth have a bit different concept so it could be used to get somewhere faster and crossing shorter distance or… bringing an army of monsters into a camp full of demigod children. But the problem lies with navigating it. Its creator supposedly still lives, in the core of the labyrinth where he hides from death and works on his designs. Camp is in danger if Luke manages to get a magical string that could grant him power over labyrinths traps so Percy and Annabeth have to take a quest and set off in one of the most dangerous places for demigods.Four books into these series and I have to be honest, but I haven’t got anything to say anymore. It isn’t a bad thing, it’s just that I want to write something about it and I be like “uh no I wrote this in the other review I don’t want to look like I’m repeating my thoughts”. Percy Jackson and the Olympians just keeps getting better. Every book surprises me a little bit more and leaves a new mark on my small bookworm heart. The Battle of the Labyrinth was filled with action, unexpected plot twists and surprising reveals. I enjoyed every second of it, things just kept getting interesting and there wasn’t one second story felt slow or boring. Rick RiordanRiordan has a perfect pacing, writing a short-ish, but eventful and intriguing story.(view spoiler)[ The part I liked the most was the final battle at Camp. It was inevitable from the beginning and the anticipation was building throughout the whole book, but it still surprised me when it happened. Mostly because there weren’t any real battles before and it only shows a course of seriousness and maturity these books have taken.  (hide spoiler)]Until recently, I didn’t care much for Greek mythology and these books’ worldbuilding, but I am pleasantly surprised with this story and where it got so far. There is a lot of foreshadowing involved, with all prophecies that used to annoy me, but add a certain factor of mystery and dread to the plot. Percy’s dreams and insights in other people’s pasts also have an important role and I am looking forward to see where it all takes us. I am really excited for the fifth book because a lot of small clues and details seem to be overlapping, and I feel like it all might happen in the final book of the series.My tiny brain still cannot comprehend the perfection of the concept called Percabeth. UH, how does one talk about them without crying? I don’t remember I’ve ever read a better or cuter development of feelings. There is just so much going on, but sometimes I feel like the only thing I could think about is them. Every interaction they have is interwoven with love and friendship, but angst, jealousy and demons from the past. Yes, Luke and Rachel annoyed me because they stand in path of the most amazing couple ever, but it only makes them better while seeing Annabeth struggling with her feelings for Luke the brutality of his treason, and Percy trying to give her space but protect her at the same time ugh ugh love them.I think I’m done here, now if you’ll excuse me I have to go destroy my chances of sleep by starting the The Last Olympian :P“But you'll be killed!""""I'll be fine. Besides, we've got no choice.""Annabeth glared at me like she was going to punch me. And then she did something that surprised me even more.

“Don’t judge someone until you’ve stood at his forge and worked with his hammer, eh?” 



Another great read by Rick Riordan, another epic adventure that has kept me wanting more from these novels. I never thought id be so into this series as it isn't really my normal read, however what a surprise i was in for. I have one book left and i feel like its just not going to be enough to satisfy my enjoyment of this series, but we'll see. Just like the Harry Potter series, the quests and dangers get darker and darker, book by book, growing with the characters themselves- And i seriously love that. Although it could still be classified as a junior read, its becoming more of a YA as time(or should i say books) goes by. If you haven't read this series, than read it. If you like adventure, mysteries, suspense, epic battles, slight romance and Greek mythology, then this series is definitely for you.“But remember, boy, that a kind act can sometimes be as powerful as a sword.” 
When Percy returns to Camp Half Blood, things are changing, the up and coming danger of the war is drawing closer. There is a new teacher, the director of camp is away for business. His friend Grover is on trial to decide his fate, he has a girlfriend and is still on the hunt for the long lost Pan. Percy is still keeping the truth of Nico's parentage a secret due to guilt over his sister's death, when keeping an eye on the lone boy, Percy realises Nico could be in real danger and could also be part of the prophecy that could determine the end of the god's world and the rise of Kronos. Annabeth is about to receive her first ever quest, quite possibly the most dangerous one yet and the most challenging- having a prophecy spoken to her by the Oracle, Annabeth must navigate Percy, Grover, Tyson through the Labyrinth- a maze full of traps, monsters , secret entrances and the scariest of all, has the ability to turn people insane being helplessly lost in the forever changing and growing maze. One of the entrances is right in the middle of Camp Half Blood and Luke is still out there plotting revenge on Percy, the gods and all the half bloods- if he happens to find his way through the maze and convince the Labyrinth maker Daedalus to help him, all the lives at Camp Half Blood will be in grave danger. With so much evil looming all around them, this mission could possibly be the most difficult one that the friends have yet to face, the rise of Kronos is drawing nearer, the prophecy set in motion and the fate of for all will soon be underway.Annabeth is possibly my favourite character throughout all the novels so far, she is smart, wise, witty and has a good heart. Once a friend always a friend, even when they may bring the destruction to all, she still sees hope in finding the good in the person, trying desperately to bring them back to the light. Being a child of Athena means she is really intelligent and likes to feed her mind. Her fascination with architecture and her knowledge has helped the friends many times during their quests, and really is part of the reason they have all survived so long , or so i believe.Being torn between Percy and Luke is a little annoying, although i get why she is so reluctent to act on her feelings for either, Luke has gone to the dark side, so to speak and Percy seems to be attracted to ever female in one way or another when their paths meet.I like strong, intelligent female characters, and Annabeth is definitely one of my favourites.“Be careful of love. It'll twist your brain around and leave you thinking up is down and right is wrong.”

111,1195077071,02/08/2015,5.0,"The Battle of the Labyrinth is the 4th book in the Percy Jackson and the Olympian series. Normally around the third book of a series, I start to lose interest in the story and characters and find myself struggling to complete the series. However, like the HP series, this book keeps me wanting more and continues to capture my attention.I will not write much about the plot while attempt to write a spoiler free review. I will say that I still love the fact that I learn so much about Greek mythology while i read these books. And I love Percy and the crew (of course Tyson being my favorite). I love the humor and sneakiness in the dialogue, the writing, and I love the fact that I can not predict what will happen most of the time. Most middle grade can be pretty predictable, but not this series. I honestly can not express how much i enjoy this series. It brings me back to the times of when I first read Harry Potter and could not put the books down. Rick Riordan is a genius. This series... just perfect. (view spoiler)[In this book, Percy discovers that Kronos is trying to use the Labyrinth to enter and destroy Camp Half Blood. With Annabeth leading her first quest, her, Percy, Grover and Tyson descend into the maze in order to find a way to stop Kronos's army. Grover is still on his quest to find Pan and is in danger of losing his searcher's license since the Council of Elders is starting to doubt that his credibility. I loved the different characters in this book. Quintus, Geryon, Minos, Calypso (I almost wish he had stayed but that wouldn't have made for mch of a story) Hera, Hephaestus, Daedalus, and the One Hundred Handed one, and even Poseidon himself coming into NYC for Percy's birthday at the end. Honestly, the story kept me on my toes and was a little surprised that Kronos is using Luke's body as his new form. I am also very happy that Nico is not as annoying as in the last book and by the end of the book, has forgiven Percy for Bianca's death. However, I thought it was super irresponsible and dumb of him to try to raise Biance from the dead. It's never a good idea to raise the dead. Except when trying to fight off Krono's army in order to prevent them from destroying your camp. Might I say that battle scene was intense!Grover proved to be a badass and it turns out Dionysus has a heart after all!It was a little sad that Pan had to die and disappear but it was for his good and he passed his power onto each of the demi gods (excluding Nico, poor kid)Basically, I loved this book. I can honestly say that I do not have a complaint about this series.  (hide spoiler)]",15,-0.9824,0.16,0.721,0.119,0.5112020202020202,POSITIVE,0.9998

I don’t think I have encountered a book that has made me laugh out loud as much as the PJ books have. They are an absolute riot.Yes, they are children’s books. Yes, they are predictable. Yes, I know, our main characters are not in any real danger….I know these things, and yet I still love these books. This series has not disappointed me yet. I was glad to have Annabeth back in this installment. Her presence was definitely lacking in the third book. It was refreshing to have the back and forth banter between her and Percy. It’s so typical of an awkward teenage boy/girl friendship. It makes me laugh thinking about my old high school friendships…*sigh*The Labyrinth was so neat. I am not familiar with Greek Mythology other than what I have read in this series (don’t judge me!) and found the whole story behind Daedalus absolutely fascinating. Heartbreaking, but fascinating. I have held off reading the last book of this series because I am just not ready to be done with it. They are such quick, fun, and witty books they are a nice reprieve from grueling, soul-sucking, heart shattering books like the Song of Ice and Fire Series (which I am also currently reading). I guess the great thing about books is that you can always revisit them. I am sure this is a series I will go back and visit again and again.

Percy is supposed to go to school -> Blows up the school because of monsters -> Has to go back to camp -> Has to go on a quest with friends and the vaguest clues about what the hell to do -> FIGHT ! -> Back to camp. It gets boring after 4 books and I hope the last one has a different storyline structure.Other than that I really enjoyed getting back into Percy's world. I love roman and greek mythology so this series is clearly made for me. Adding Daedalus' labyrinth this time litterally made my heart flutter and I couldn't get enough of it. I actually wished more of the action took place in it but well...I also feel like the secondary characters got more development than usual so that was great ! I wish we could have seen more of Grover's quest for Pan but I understand it would have made the book way too complicated with all the various stories. Also Nico is great in this book !

The Battle of The Labyrinth may actually be tied for my favourite, with The Last Olympian. So much happens, heart-wrenching events.

120,93932587,03/13/2010,2.0,"The Battle of the Labyrinth was a huge disappointment to me. It did not get good until halfway through. The first half of the book was action-packed like the first three books of the series, but the action was, for lack of a better term, dumb. At the start of the series, Percy Jackson was twelve. Throughout The Battle of the Labyrinth, he was fourteen. The book was written as if there was no mental development or personal growth during those two years. Percy behaves as if he had learned nothing. He constantly makes the same mistakes and is still surprised that things are mystical or immortal or just plain not normal. He is the son of Poseidon; his persistent surprise and disbelief are unrealistic to me. A little of it is fine, but this book was filled with way too much.I knew it would be hard for this book to please me as much as The Titan's Curse did. Three of my four favorite characters from that book do not appear in The Battle of the Labyrinth. That fact combined with the thoughts I had while reading this book helped me to realize by problem with Rick Riordan's writing: he writes battles well and relationships well and teenage girls very well, but he is pretty crappy at writing from the mind of a teenage boy. The best parts of this book were the times when Percy interacted with girls, specifically Annabeth, Rachel, and Calypso. Everything else was rushed and, to a certain extent, nonsensical.After reading The Battle of the Labyrinth, I feel as though hours of my life were wasted on the search for Pan. The resolution was not bad, but the execution of it was. It was rushed. A scene that could have been developed and brought forth great drama was quick and, ultimately, disappointing. It, like much of this book, was a letdown. The climax ended too quickly, too perfectly. Events that should have been filled with tension and drama instead came and went like the snap of a finger. It was very much like the climactic scene of the No Country for Old Men film--you waited for it and waited for it, but it never really happened. The only difference here was that The Battle of the Labyrinth gave it to me on four separate occasions.It was a necessary book in the series, and the plot was not at all bad. Poor execution hurt it. Despite that, it is not difficult to get through. It still builds the reader's anticipation for the series finale, The Last Olympian.",14,0.7195,0.14,0.706,0.153,0.5004563492063492,NEGATIVE,1.0

So like in every book Percy and his friends are on another quest that is filled with a problem that needs to be resolved and this gets him one step closer to the prophecy that he is doomed with.

Not sure why, but almost everything in this one felt new. I like that Percy grows through the series. I don't remember noticing as much change in him on my first reading, but I have seen more of a progression this time through. He is still very much the same, but you can tell he's getting a little older, a little wiser. The ""romantic"" drama that cropped up in here was a little annoying, but it was kept to a minimum, so it wasn't unbearable. The ending for this was a little bittersweet and had more of a cliffhanger feeling than the others. And although I've read the entire series before, I'm still excited to get to the final installment and see what happens. Jesse Bernstein was once again the narrator for the audio.

The Battle of the Labyrinth is one of my favourite books in this series! I enjoyed all the hilarious moments and action that happened! Percy and Annabeth's quest to navigate the Labyrinth is probably my favourite because I liked how we got to see different mythological beings and so many events happened! The stakes were much higher in this book now that they knew the titan's army is close to invading camp. I also liked how Rachel played a more important role in this book.

I can't say much without throwing out spoilers, but it was really interesting to read how he handled some of the events in the book. Calypso wasn't a main character in this book, but it really annoyed me how she's portrayed - like a helpless damsel in distress. I know that this is resolved a bit in Trials of Apollo, but it was still annoying. Then, of course, there's Percy and Annabeth (and Rachel).I'm not gonna lie: when I read this how so many ever years ago, I hated Rachel just because she was getting in the way of my ship, and would hate Perachel shippers automatically. What can I say, I was a crazed fangirl and still am. But I swear I'm sane chill now. For real.

136,3582699475,10/17/2020,2.0," This book was in my opinion the weakest of the series so far. I mean, I enjoyed the concept of the labyrinth per se, but that was pretty much it. The execution of the idea was also pretty underwhelming imo. The problem is, this series is becoming quite repetitive. The structure of the books is always the same, so in the end it becomes boring. I had to switch to the audiobook at some point, because I was struggling to keep my interest level high enough to turn another page, which really sucks because at the beginning of this series I was seriously in love with it. I am going to jump straight into book five and hope this was just a low point in an otherwise great series!Also, on a side note: you know when authors are writing a series and decide to put some remarks here and there to ""recap"" what happened in the previous books? There is a good way and a bad way of doing it and I am pretty sure that this is not the good way... It just sounds clumsy and I mean, in this case I would appreciate more a recap at the beginning of the book that you can skip if you want. But, as always, this is just my personal opinion.

And most importantly, it carries the best ending of the book in the Percy Jackson series (so far) of which I enjoyed reading.There were a lot of scenes that either melted my heart or shattered it. There, I said it. But what did I even expect? The books are starting to get darker by every quest, and I'm just wondering why I haven't stopped turning the page? Why? It's because I know that this isn't an adventure that ought to be missed. (view spoiler)[Aside from the fact that some characters had to die, I wasn't expecting a dose of romance to occur anytime soon... most especially from someone, Calypso, who was just introduced to Percy in this book. Although it warmed my heart at first but ended up destroying it, because duh, Percy is destined for Annabeth, right? Oh, wait. There's also Rachel Elizabeth Dare, and her blue plastic hairbrush to save the day. THIS IS SOMETHING I WASN'T EXPECTING BUT I'M NOT COMPLAINING. I THINK?! I'm conflicted. But yes, let me get back to 'some characters had to die' part, I'm still here bawling like a child, because WHY?! Like we suddenly discovered where Pan has been and it took me a minute to feel so happy for Grover that I wanna just jump between the pages and give him a warm hug until Pan gives me a wake up call and... dies. LIKE, MAN, THAT WAS SO DEPRESSING BUT SO REALISTIC THAT IT CENTERED ON REAL LIFE ISSUES. And Nico... Oh, Nico, my half-brother. I never once hated him because I myself understand his pain, but I'm surprised, let alone, proud of him for choosing to finally let his sister rest when given the opportunity to bring her back from the dead. He truly has matured and grown up to be the young man that his sister had wanted him to be. I honestly feel like his choice was the turning point of his character development and as a child of Hades myself, I admire him for it. (hide spoiler)]Let's just say it was still an exciting read, an adventure that I won't ever forget. I'm surprised Percy is still alive. I think this was the hardest quest that he ever had to take, but lucky for him, he is blessed with friends and a dad who is beginning to make it up to him. I'm also amazed how Annabeth defied the expectations on going for quests because I was quite worried that this might come to haunt her later in the book but seemingly enough, she's one tough cookie and knows what she is doing since this is her quest after all. All the characters are acting their age, which is quite a relief, and I'm glad Rick Riordan let this show, that it's even enjoyable to watch them grow.This series is getting darker and darker… which makes me scared but excited.

SPOILER WARNING!!!
 Although there are no spoilers for this book. There are spoilers in this review for those who haven't read the previous books. So if you haven't already read the first three books of the series then you may not want to read my review. I try to express only my most honest opinion in a spoiler free way. If you feel anything in my review is a spoiler and is not already hidden in spoiler brackets please let me know. Thank you.Percy, Annabeth, Grover, and Tyson are on another quest. This time into the labyrinth. Here they meet more challenges and monsters to over come as they search for Daedalus to ask for his help. Because Luke is looking for a way to navigate the Labyrinth in order to storm the camp and after them, Olympus.The thing about this book and the series is that although I still loved it and enjoyed reading it, it does start to get repetive. Its attacked by monster, go to camp, get quest, go on adventure with gods, monsters, and other challenges, win the day, go back to camp, sad news, go home. Then on the next book for a repeat. Bright side is that there are always different locations and monsters and challenges. Same bad guy for the most part though. I love the character too. I think my favorite character might be Tyson. Such a sweet and loveable cyclopes. The hints of romance between Annabeth and Percy seem to be progressing. Mind you very slowly. It will be interesting to see how the story wraps up with only one more book to go.
How I choose my rating:1* Did not finish, or hated it but forced myself to finish.2** Didn't really like it. Didn't hate it but not sure why I finished it other then for some closure.3*** I liked it. I had some issues with it, but as a whole it was good. I probably won't reread again ever, but there is a chance I might finish the series. (If part of one) But if not it's not a huge loss.4**** I really liked this book. Maybe not a work of genius, but highly entertaining. I might reread this again, and I will finish the series. (If part of one) I would recommend to those I know hold interest in this books content.5***** I loved this book. I found little to no issues with it at all. I will definitely be rereading this and probably more than once. I will finish the series and reread it multiple times. (If part of one) I will recommend this book to EVERYONE!!!!

It between the side of Gods and Titans. Not with the help of most powerful Demigod that can do the right things to save between the 2 worlds of Greek and Modern Time unless the Prophecy can be one of the Big Three to the Fate of the World. It’s not between the Good vs. Evil, it’s the inevitable war of freedom and power. What is unbelievable that Gods doesn’t care about their Demigod children, but to their bless and respect. Demigod can be more respect to the Gods as parents. Others don’t, Which is vey brutual, they think that god use them and never love them to side of the Titan to be more peace and power without gods.Only one hero who is part god to be more powerful with nature force and another part is human can be more noble and kind with friendship, love, and family. And he’s got a sense of humor.This is up to Percy Jackson and his friends who can do a quest for a risk to find the inventor for Adriane’s string in the Labyrinth, underground in the America, a endless Maze, which remind of The Maze Runner And Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.Every moments is wow and woah, like hera’s perfect family but not all of them, Legendary Daedalus’s Dark Past, Calypso feel alone and sad in the island, and Annabeth kiss Percy before his heroic’s sacrifice, Nico to bring her sister alive desperate. It was unbelievable to Gods and Titans can be more Crazy with their Personal.If you ever read a classic Greek stories, which I wish I need to know, just remember it.By the Way, you got to meet Mrs. O’Leary, she’s very special and lovable hellhoundP.S. you had to bring a human dummy before you’re dummy.Writing Plot- A+ Unforgettable Storytelling Plot Twisting- A+ Shocking to be Reveal Characters- ATheme- ASetting- A Very Well AppearanceReview- ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 😱😨Described-Dangerous And Deadly Action And Thrill As Epic In Fourth Installment with the Infamous Maze",12,0.9971,0.107,0.648,0.245,0.5660568086883875,POSITIVE,0.9999
148,3871522272,07/09/2021,4.0,"4.5/5 stars, this one felt different in such a good wayThe books previously in the Percy Jackson series had all had a very similar formula; go on a quest, almost die, meet new friends, go back to camp. It's an interesting story and I certainly love meeting new characters and seeing everyone adventure, but it gets a bit boring over and over. Of course, this series is middle grade, so I really can't fault it for that. But this book switched things up a bit, or so it felt like, and I really enjoyed that! In the fourth book in the Percy Jackson series, war is looming and everyone has to be ready to prepare. Percy is now in freshman year and expects his orientation to go fine until a pair of demons attack him. He finds out that even safe places like Camp Half-blood get more vulnerable as Kronos's army gets bigger and stronger. To possibly get the upper hand, Percy and his friend decide to venture into the labyrinth, and hopefully make it back out alive. It's been great going through the books and watching Percy grow up, he's still a teenager but way closer to my age and it shows. I think Riordan has done a fantastic job of keeping Percy to his roots while also allowing him to grow as a person. He's become more mature but also funnier, more determined and brave, and even more loyal to his friends. He's one of the best main characters from the middle-grade genre, and I see him being one of my favorites overall in the future as well. I love all the other half-bloods in this book, and how we've seen them more and more as the books go on. Annabeth is a great side character, and she has also grown into who she is. I love her to death but she gets caught up on this one thing a lot, when she really shouldn't, and it seems annoying sometimes. But she's still just a human and we all have things that are our downfalls. Grover and Tyson are still so much fun, and both of them are such good friends to Percy. I love the greek mythology aspect of this series too, it's so much fun and really drives my love for the story.

When the story begins, Percy is a 14-year-old who is ready to begin a school year at a new school. He is on his orientation tour when disaster strikes and monsters attack. This is the beginning of a summer during which Percy has to head down into the Labyrinth with some of his closest friends in order to save the world.After his orientation, Percy heads to Camp Half-Blood where he learns about the Labyrinth. The maze was designed by Daedalus and according to Greek mythology, is part of King Minos' palace in Crete. Annabeth is intrigued by the Labyrinth and discovers that she is about to lead a quest and it involves passage through the Labyrinth.Percy discovers that Luke is on his own quest for revenge and plans to use the Labyrinth to enter the heart of camp to destroy it. He finds an entrance with Annabeth to the Labyrinth and descend into it so they can stop Luke and his army. Their goal is to find Daedalus, which is an extremely difficult task since the Labyrinth continuously changes and grows on its own. It causes madness, which frequently leads to death.The friends fight monsters, free prisoners, solve riddles, and succeed in challenges on their way to finding Daedalus. At one point, Percy becomes separated from the others after he blows up Mt. Helens. He lands on Calypso's island and has to decide whether to become immortal and live in paradise with the beautiful woman or go back to finish his quest to save the world. He makes the difficult decision and leaves.Even though it's Annabeth's quest, the answer to getting through the Labyrinth lies in Percy. He realizes that they have to enlist the help of a mortal named Rachel. She has the unique ability to see through the Mist. While others struggle to choose between paths in the Labyrinth, she can see the correct route clearly. They eventually reach Daedalus, but he is hesitant to help them.Grover is on his own quest. He has to find Pan and prove his existence or he will lose his job. While in the Labyrinth, the friends find Pan who is about to cease his existence. He breathes part of himself into each of the members present in the room, except for Nico, who is the son of Hades.Luke finds Adriane's string, which leads his army out of the Labyrinth into Camp Half-Blood. A fierce battle ensues. Grover bellows, and the sound scares the enemy away. This sound came from the part of Pan that now lived within him. When the battle is over, Daedalus lets himself die, therefore closing down the Labyrinth forever.",11,-0.9652,0.107,0.819,0.073,0.5137241985068072,POSITIVE,0.9378

”A section of wall. A boulder. A doorway. A sewer entrance. But it would have the mark of Daedalus on it. A Greek Δ, glowing in blue.""
The mark of Daedalus is a mark that represents the entrance to the Labyrinth. Daedalus was a skillful craftsman and artisan. He was also an inventor, architect and a genius who created the Labyrinth, a maze built for King Minos and it traps the Minotaur. Daedalus is one of the major characters in this book and his Labyrinth served as the central plot element.The Battle of the Labyrinth is the 4th installment of Percy Jackson and the Olympians Series. Now that Kronos is stronger, the Olympus is in danger. But destroying the Olympus is not that easy because the heroes at Camp Half-Blood won’t let them. Luke’s army has to invade the Camp first before they attack the Olympus. They must go through the Labyrinth, the only way to enter the Camp Half-Blood.Percy, Annabeth, Grover and Tyson must also go through the Labyrinth to find Daedalus so that Luke can’t get Ariadne’s String, a thing that can help Luke navigate the maze. Percy and Grover also felt that Nico Di Angelo and the Great God Pan are also in the Labyrinth. They have to find them while finding Daedalus.Characters:Percy Jackson is now mature, he’s stronger, wiser, braver or should I say that he’s the greatest demigod ever. If you compare the Percy from the 1st book and the 4th book, they are so different from each other. He is not the Seaweed Brain anymore, he always has a plan when they are in trouble.Annabeth Chase leads this quest but, for me, she didn’t act as the leader. I was shocked and disappointed with Grover Underwood’s quest. He did everything to find the great god Pan. Good news: he saw the God. Bad news: (view spoiler)[ after seeing him, The God talked to him and died.  (hide spoiler)] It’s like “HERE IT GOES” then POOF!! That’s it. What happened to Thalia? She’s not in this book. Too bad, I was begging for more Thalia.This book is better than the previous 3 books. For me, the series gets better and better. Their quest is harder than the previous quests they had. They are inside a maze and they don’t know how to navigate it. I’m addicted to this book, I started reading it and I can’t put it down anymore. I didn’t even attend my class just to finish it. The cliffhanger is intriguing too; I can’t wait to read the last book. ADDICTING!!! 4 stars. ",11,0.9669,0.065,0.817,0.118,0.4762544802867382,NEGATIVE,0.9205

HOW???????????????? You're about to read one big period of me having a fangirl attack but whatever :D This book was even better than the third, and that one already blew off the roof!

There's something big coming up for the two of them I think ♥ *breathes heavily*Rachel was absolutely awesome, I loved her.That whole Daedalus/labyrinth situation really did it for me.

Ahh yess, Ogygia (shhh I had to look it up again). I couldn't help but feel a little sorry for her, so I found it really adorable when he planted that tiny seed in his mothers' pot^^And I adored that whole sequence with Pan. Beautiful writing! And now Luke: (view spoiler)[I knew that was going to happen. Seriously. I knew it from the moment they talked about Kronos requiring a physical body to rise to his fullest. Luke was acting pretty weird in this book too which only confirmed my suspicions about him being the host for Kronos' soul. There was already a lot foreshadowing going on in the last three books. Also WHAT exactly did he try to tell Annabeth in the arena??? I never hated Luke. It's quite the opposite actually, because he's been just a pawn in Kronos' ""game"" right from the beginning. His hate for the Olympians somehow amplified that...call it vulnerability, on his part. I hope he's not gone yet and still somewhere in there. I want him to redeem himself by beating Kronos in the end. But I don't think that's going to happen to be honest :( (hide spoiler)]Yeah, that's it for my review for now.

Percy is worried about Nico, what he would do and if he is the one the prophecy talks about. The old sea gods are also in play in this book and the impending war might be closer than we think. Percy has also been having visions about Luke and how he's trying to reincarnate Kronos. Percy and friends must stop Luke and co from entering Camp Half Blood through Daedalus's labyrinth and prevent him from getting his hands on Ariadne's string. This book has Annabeth's quest and she takes along Percy, Grover, and Tyson for help. In the prophecy Annabeth receives about her quest, they deduce that they might find Pan through the labyrinth as well. Throughout the book though, these guys have a lot of hurdles and near death experiences, and for some - actual death 😰 
“You deal with mythological stuff for a few years, you learn that paradises are usually places where you get killed.”
I absolutely loved the inclusion of various other Greek mythologies in this book and how they were woven in with the plot.

Percy came back again to camp after an attack in his new school’s orientation involving vampires and a mortal, Rachel Elizabeth Dare, the fierce talkative girl with the ability to see through the mist whom Percy had met briefly in his adventure in the third book. But there’s a mystery going on at camp. Clarisse had found Chris Rodriguez, a camper who took Kronos side, half-amnesia and mad, emerged from a labyrinth door near her house. As it turned out, there was a labyrinth door inside camp’s barrier and Luke was trying to get his monster armies to enter camp through it but didn’t know the way. It’s now up to Annabeth, the camp’s best architect, Percy, Grover and Tyson to beat the labyrinth before Luke did. But it wasn’t easy. The labyrinth was bound to be dangerous and make people lost and gone mad just like it did to Chris. But Percy also have another purpose entering the labyrinth. To find the lost son of Hades, Nico DiAngelo.This book has the most thrilling adventures in the series. The labyrinth was really infuriating. You couldn’t beat it with powers or logic. The thing was alive and constantly changed. It lead even Annabeth astray and there were a lot of dangerous terrifying monsters in it though, thank God (or should I say thank gods? :p), Minotaur, the original resident of the labyrinth hadn’t back from Tartarus. And not just monsters, there were other unexpected things too there. I like how things were here. The gods need demigods and the demigods need mortal. To solve the labyrinth, Percy and Annabeth needed the most unexpected help from Rachel Dare. It’s a bit emotional too with Percy believed that Nico had turned evil and how he thought it was his fault. It’s the start of Percy and Annabeth romance too >.< though it’s just because Annabeth was jealous of Rachel. But Rachel was impressive! There’s the most memorable moment of the series.He was ten feet away when I heard, “PERCY!”Rachel’s voice.Something flew past me, and a blue plastic hairbrush hit Kronos in the eye.There’s the sad story of the original labyrinth designer too. I had mixed feelings for Daedalus. He’s really smart but he’d done unforgivable terrible and cruel things and he’s cunning but in some occasions, he’s also very kind. Not like the previous three books which the main battle fought by some demigods in mission, this book’s final event was a full war met by entire camp. I can’t say this book is my favorite, (I love them all. I can’t decide which one I love best) but this one is certainly special, especially with Poseidon came to Percy birthday party and nearly gave Sally Jackson a heart attack :p. And there’s a nice change in mr. D too. Who thought that he actually cares of his half-blood son and that he could be nice and wise if he wants toBut remember, boy, that a kind act can sometimes be as powerful as a sword. As a mortal, I was never a great fighter or athlete or poet. I only made wine. The people in my village laughed at me. They said I would never amount to anything. Look at me now. Sometimes small things can become very large indeed.It’s a great book that made me anticipating the next book with great enthusiasm. :D",10,0.9941,0.126,0.682,0.192,0.6172204418957665,POSITIVE,0.9997
181,3891570886,04/12/2021,5.0,"I had started to think that the entire Percy Jackson series would end up being 3 stars, but Rick Riordan really knocked it out of the park with this instalment!As the penultimate book, it does an excellent job raising the stakes to the skies, whilst also acting as a standalone. The sense heightened pressure is evident throughout, making our heroes success in their quest all the more pertinent. For the first time, the rapid jumping from action sequence to action sequence was actually cohesive and flowed well.The Labyrinth itself deserves a massive shout-out, with its creepy corridors and terrifying monsters lurking behind every corner. Rick Riordan uses this and the rest of the story to further his world-building. In particular, his retelling of Daedalus' story was particularly moving.In terms of the characters, they are now very much in their teenage years. Percy has learnt a lot since the beginning of the series, maturing into a more introspective character. He avoids many of the mistakes he made in earlier books and becomes more strategic in his thinking. There was also the presence of 3(!) love interests which somehow manages to work.Really looking forward to the finale!!",11,0.9204,0.068,0.821,0.11,0.4590384615384615,POSITIVE,1.0
182,865407503,02/25/2014,4.0,"Much like the first three books, but better with each one. The story line has lots of fun action, that keeps you involved and engaged and wanting to turn the page. And my favorite aspect again, is the educational value this book has. I had forgotten just how much there was to the mythology behind the stories. Not something I'd ever read again as an adult, unless I was reading it to my kids, which very well may happen. But a great series for middle school age or maybe even a little younger, depending on your reader. I think to really appreciate and understand the book though, the reader needs to be old enough to understand the concept of ""the Gods"" and all that goes with it. I started to read the first book to my advanced reader who is 6, and he enjoyed it, but didn't understand much of the slang or anything to do with the mythology, so the movie was more enjoyable for him. I think he'll really enjoy it when he's older though. In this book, I really enjoyed the whole idea of the Labyrinth. And underground maze with monsters and magical beings really revs up my sense of adventure. I'm a board gamer and play many different types of board games but one of my favorites is a type called ""dungeon crawls"". This book pretty much sums it up: a bunch of heroes trying to navigate through underground tunnels to kill monsters and score treasure while the evil overlord (usually played by yours truly) tries to take them down. What a blast! This book could have easily been one of my game scenarios. Also, being a gamer, Nico's love of his gaming figurines holds a special place in my heart as well. In fact, he's another one of my favorite characters because he's torn between what's good and his dark side, where he comes from. I hope in the end he's either good, or even better, he finds a balance of both, able to keep who he is as a part himself. I also like seeing Percy torn between Rachel and Annabeth. It gets a little sappy when there's an obvious love interest for the hero and I like that it's not so easy for him. For the record, I love Rachel and the fact that she's a mortal. Hope we see more of her in the last book. The only part I might have changed would be Chiron. We're in the fourth book now and I'm still not seeing much depth in his character when there's so much potential. It's almost as if Riordan wrote him off as being easy; the main good guy who's always there but just a little mysterious. He annoys me. Dionysus is much better, with his struggle with drinking and his attitude, we've never really sure where he stands and that's so much more interesting to me. Overall, a great series. Highly recommended and a fun read. And to my readers out there, if you had to recommend another series by Riordan to me, which one do you think I should start next?

I am really enjoying them so far and found the fourth book to be fun! This book put Percy and his friends on another quest where they ended up in the labyrinth which runs under America currently but has moved around in the past. They are in search of the labyrinth’s creator to help stop the forthcoming evil and to also help keep Camp Half-Blood safe. The book starts off with Percy attending orientation at his new mortal school which goes terribly and puts Percy on the run (thus starting the drama and the quest). Personally, I love this series and this book was very exciting for me. The idea of the labyrinth was interesting and they were still battling with the Pan situation (which now had higher stakes) and I was beyond ready to meet Pan or see some resolution to this situation.

I also love Nico's character arc here and I remember that this was the book where I started to fall in love with him (well that's all in the past).This book also has one of my favorite chapters in the Riordanverse which is the very last chapter where Poseidon and Nico crash Percy's birthday party.

I hate how addicting these books are, because I have school and obligations and a life and this is all put on hold when I start reading. Like the previous books, The Battle of the Labyrinth did not disappoint. It was super intense and action-packed, making it impossible for me to stop reading; even when I did, it was always on my mind. I really loved the fact that we got to see more of my favorite Greek myths, like that of Icarus & Daedalus. Rick Riordan always represents them so well, and he knows exactly what to add and how to alter them a bit to make them even more interesting. Also, let me just say that I absolutely loved Rachel Elizabeth Dare and I'm excited to learn more things about her in the next book (I'm hoping I will). It was cute how Annabeth got jealous and all, but she still has her Luke thing going on and honestly, girl, enough. He's a freaking Titan Vessel. That's usually a pretty good sign that you should get over someone. This book broke me but it also made me very happy. Some simple examples:Broke me: Calypso!! Such a sad storyline. I know we're gonna see her again, and that makes me feel kind of better. I just hope she finds some happiness.Made me very happy: Poseidon's visit! That was so unexpected and such a nice scene to read. I love how kind he is to Percy, and I really enjoy reading the scenes he's in, even if there have been like three so far in the entire series.Poseidon put his weathered hand on my shoulder. “Percy, lesser beings do many horrible things in the name of the gods. That does not mean we gods approve. The way our sons and daughters act in our names…well, it usually says more about them than it does about us. And you, Percy, are my favorite son.”He smiled, and at that moment, just being in the kitchen with him was the best birthday present I ever got.

Yay! Percabeth finally happened, at least they kissed. I can't believe how clueless Percy sometimes is (*sighs* boyssss).I like Nico a lot, I actually feel really sorry for him. Someone protect that poor child.Percy got hold of his powers a little more - he actually learned that he's more powerful than he thought he was, and I do think we'll see a lot more of that. I like seeing the half-bloods use their powers in battle in general, I think it's so great.And let me just mention that I absolutely loved Blackjack? He's so funny and cool!And I very much enjoyed reading about Poseidon's visit in the end. A little more father-son-bonding is always great, since Percy does strive for a little recognition from his parent.

217,1397236386,09/20/2015,5.0,"It has been over a year since I have last delve into the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series and I believe that is too long to rediscovery this epic fantasy series. The reason why it took me so long is because I read the first three through the library and once I read an entire series it increases the odds that I will never buy it for my own possession and I need Percy Jackson in my life. After months of research and having the right resources I was able to own the whole collection and now I get to finish this saga. I definitely had to use major recaps to remember what happens in the previous books but this book in my opinion was standalone from the rest.We get reintroduced to Percy Jackson who is now an incoming freshman attending freshmen orientation at Goode High School. He is always getting kicked out of every school that he attends thanks to monsters and other catastrophes and he needs to work harder this time around because Percy's moms boyfriend, Paul Blofis, teaches at the school and who defended him when the school was reluctant to accept him. While attending the orientation, he sees a familiar face and immediately panics because he cannot believe why she is attending this school and we learn it is no other than Rachel Elizabeth Dare.If you do not remember her do not worry because there is not much about her except that Percy met her at the Hoover Dam on a quest the previous year and she saved him from evil skeleton warriors. He never saw her again until now and we discover that she lives in New York and is attending the same school as him. Before he attends the orientation, Percy bumps into a pair of senior cheerleaders who are acting strange around him and appear to be something else and sure enough Rachel tells Percy to run when the cheerleaders show up on stage.As Rachel and him run out of the auditorium and hide, we learn that the cheerleaders are empousa which are flaming hair monsters with fangs and their legs is one part donkey and the other is celestial bronze prosthetic leg. They are the inspiration for our vampires and immediately Percy has to fight them and kill them without making a mess of everything. Luckily he kills one but the other escapes leaving the school in flames and framing Percy as the trouble maker.Percy escapes with Rachel and once he gets outside he bumps into Annabeth who came to hang out with him and go on their unofficial date. She immediately gets jealous when she meets Rachel and all the wonderful plans go down the drain as they need to visit Camp Half-Blood before all hell breaks loose. Once they arrive, Percy notices that while he was enjoying the normal life of being a teenager, he has forgotten that everyone else in the greek mythology world have been making plans and strategies over how to stop Kronos and defeat Luke and all the other bad guys that they have encountered.As he gets adjusted to camp, he discovers that Dionysus is on a mission to make sure that the lesser gods are in an alliance with Olympus, no word on Nico di Angelo (previous book), and we have new members to the camp which is the new swordsman named Quintus and his hellhound companion named Mrs. O'Leary. We meet again Tyson who is Percy's step-brother and Grover who is granted only one week to find Pan before his searchers license gets revoked and his dreams of meeting his God is over. The following day Percy learns that Quintus has set up a game that will test the young half-bloods skills and strengths in combat and Percy gets to team up with Annabeth. At first the fighting seems easy with one big scorpion but then out of nowhere three appear and they have to retreat under a boulder. As they hid inside, Percy and Annabeth notices that this boulder has turned into a cavern and Annabeth makes the connection as the entrance to the Labyrinth (the one that is famous for the Minotaur and Theseus).With the discovery of the entrance, Percy discovers that Annabeth and everyone believes that Luke is trying to enter the Labyrinth in order to infiltrate Camp Half-Blood and destroy it. Annabeth, Percy, Grover, and Tyson are now on this quest to enter the Labyrinth and find Daedalus (who is the creator of the labyrinth) and make sure Luke doesn't get a hold of Ariadne's string. If Luke gets it before them, he will attack with a taste of Kronos army and the gang might not be able to fight back. Will the gang be successful or will Luke and Kronos become bad asses and ruin the day?I try to make this spoiler free and even though I have written a mouth full of information, this barely makes 100 pages and in the book there is plenty of epic battle scenes, secrets revealed, and so much more. What I loved about this book is that it left you at the edge of your seat as time is running out and Kronos army gets bigger each day. This book definitely beats the previous novels and I believe if you are currently reading this series and still haven't made up your mind to continue it I would say read this book and it will blow your mind in epic proportions.Even though we are getting more action than the other books I believe that this one has become the turning point for the future of this series. Percy is now in high school growing up and with that comes maturity. I love this series and I felt like in the beginning it was very innocent and playful and now with this book we realize that evil is a real thing and the end of the world might appear sooner than later. This book reminded me a lot of Harry Potter especially from Book #4-6 because this book was darker than the previous ones and we encounter death as never before.As the reader we get an insight glimpse into what is war and how innocent casualties get killed in the line of battle. I believe at that moment is when we open our eyes and grow up as human beings. I loved every second of this book and I have no clue what the final book is going to be about and how it will lead us into the spinoff series. All I know is I am definitely going to read the last book in the series asap and finally end Percy Jackson and the Olympians.In each book as we discover new characters and further insight into the Greek Gods, I try to picture myself who could be my greek parents? If it could be both Greek Gods then I would say Poseidon and Athena but since this deals with Demi-Gods then I can only pick one. I find the son of Hades powers to be cool in this book but I believe at the end of the day it would be Poseidon. I always try to change it in every book but I always find myself relating to Percy and Poseidon more and more. Hopefully the final book can prove me wrong.This was the first time in a book that I forced myself not to use google to look up these characters and their abilities which I am grateful for because I would have been completely spoiled early on in the book and ruin the entire series. I believe if we do not know about this particular god or who is the greek parents on a particular child there is a reason why and we will learn later on in the story. I lose my patience in this book because I want to read it faster than I can move my eyes and the moments where I am unable to read my book I get sad and coming up with different solutions to read the book without being bothered or interrupted.I cannot get enough of this series and Rick Riordan is a genius as to how to attract people into his stories and how easily we are able to lose track of time in these classic greek mythology adventures. Thank you Rick Riordan for coming into my life and thank you for creating Percy.",8,0.8162,0.095,0.799,0.106,0.4455448435936241,POSITIVE,0.8838

I would definitely say by this point you need to have read all the first three books to understand this one fully! Percy’s ‘love life’ if you can call it that is too cute – but I really LOVE Nico & obviously Tyson! The battles in this book were much more descriptive and entertaining. ""Be careful of love. It'll twist your brain around and leave you thinking up is down and right is wrong.""	""People are more difficult to work with than machines. And when you break a person, he can't be fixed.""	""Don't feel bad, I'm usually about to die.""Although this is ‘just a kid’s book’ it has so many powerful messages – especially the chapters with Pan and how true that message is in today’s world. This is a little lower rated at 4 stars – because I think some things were a little repetitive but this might have been because it only took me two days to get through. Percy Jackson turns 15 at the end of this book – and is so mature for his age but absolutely clueless about girls which I LOVE so much! Percy and his team really go through a lot in this book in his ‘normal life’ and his ‘demi-god life’ and I am with him all the way on this journey!

Will they be victorious or will everything burn all around them?✔ poor Grover, his quest for pan is getting dire. ✔ the titans are growing in power, gaining more and more to their side.✔ demon cheerleaders just aren't what they used to be.✔ there are even more monsters to battle this time around.✔ watch where you're going!✔ knowing the legends just might save your life.If you thought Percy Jackson might be getting a break and have a chance for a normal life, at least, sometimes, you would be wrong. Things are even more dangerous this time around and the prophecy is looming even worse over Percy. He feels like there's a countdown of sorts for him and he needs to make sure the others are going to be safe when it all runs out. Their new quest is led by Annabeth since the Oracle decreed it but she might not be telling them all the details she was told. But things will be revealed through the course of the book. Also, against the power of three, Annabeth has three others going along with her - Percy, Tyson and Grover. A dream team, yes, but Chiron worries about the number, especially going somewhere so dangerous.The Labyrinth was created by Daedalus and he is who they need to find before the other side does. They hope he'll be able to not only help them with a few things but prevent Kronos from using the advantage of the labyrinth. The twisting underground maze has more than a few dangers and they'll have to work hard to not lose their way or their minds. 

 “New lesson, class. Most monsters will vaporize when sliced with a celestial bronze sword. This change is perfectly normal, and will happen to you right now if you don't BACK OFF!""

They'll also gain Nico for their adventures and Rachel Elizabeth Dare. Both of which will help them in ways they never expected and let me tell you I loved every second of it. Each character is so dynamic and I just want to protect all of them. They're all involved in such dangerous things! I have to also say I loved the addition of Mrs O’Leary and another great character thrown into the mix. Very unexpected and I loved the role she ended up playing. I think one of my favorite parts of this series is for sure the humor. I find myself smiling so often even when things look so bleak for the characters at the time! I love the dynamics with all the characters and the friendships really are everything I could ask for. This entire series is like a warm and comforting blanket. I really just enjoy every bit of it. Things are a lot more serious here but there are plenty of light moments, especially thanks to Percy's comments. He can never hold his tongue and I love it. The ending was really something and I cannot wait to see how this series ties everything up with the last book. I want to read it but at the same time don't want this series to end. The struggle!

This is so far the best in the series, in my opinion.What really makes this volume stand out are the stakes. More then ever we feel the crushing weight of the enemy's forces and the impending consequences. We get to see how far the villains are willing to go and how some people have been grievously affected by the events taking place. The darker tone and commitment to showing ruthless natures turn this installment into more of a page-turner.The heroes make more interesting decisions, and this novel is all the better for the gray areas those decisions contain. There are still purely good and evil entities, but many in-between characters are introduced. You might disagree with some of the characters' decisions but they can be understood in their own way. The fun interactions between characters are still here, but they are supplemented with character growth and a focus on choices.The structure of the story has improved as well. The idea of a labyrinth that can let you get anywhere in the U.S. leads to and interesting plot. The reader travels to many different locations and the hurdles our cast encounters are varied and unexpected.The sometimes over the top irreverent tone is balanced with more serious moments.

248,2791644991,04/21/2019,5.0,"You can read all my review on Blog -  Books Teacup and Reviews “People are more difficult to work with than machines. And when you break a person, he can’t be fixed.” Another wonderful book in Percy Jackson series. This is the book I didn’t remember much after the first read and I enjoyed this more than first time read. This series has always been my favorite and on rereading it only has made it sure.Writing was simple yet amazingly gripping and full of entertainment. Sarcasm and humor dripping through every page. Exciting battle, tricky situation and thrilling adventure kept me on the age. This series defines fast pace perfectly and I loved the plotIt started with first day of school, just orientation day, and Percy’s luck was twisted by fates, AGAIN! He met vampires with mismatched legs and a redheaded girl, Rachel who could see through mist and to whom he met in previous book at Hoover dam. After running away from burning music room of the school Percy arrived at camp where he learnt about wine dude’s replacement, met Tyson ‘yayy he’s back’, received Iris message sent by mysterious person from which he learnt the sinister plan of Nico, and had more nightmarish dreams that told about Luke and Kronos’ plan to attack on camp half-blood through the labyrinth.One more life-threatening prophecy, 4 friends in the darkness of labyrinth, maze with traps that might turn you mad. It was exciting to see how they were going to stop Luck’s army of monsters on their way to camp.First of all, it was fun to see Tyson once more. I loved this book more because of him only. He has grown smarter and braver. Grover was in tricky situation with his deadline for finding Pan that led him to the place he dreaded most, ‘the confines of underground’ and that’s too with Tyson. It was amusing to see Tyson and Grover work together.Rachel was quirky. She was surprisingly brave, calm, easy going even in deadly situation. I literally laughed when she attacked with plastic hair brush. Who needs celestial bronze when you have a hair brush! I always liked Nico, even though he was bit off the track. I liked how he learned about his sister’s wish and how it brought change in him. I felt for him. It was so unfair being son of Hades and I agreed with Percy’s thought about it.Percy was as usual fab. He was wonderful friend and brother with heart of gold and clever mind. He was package full of wits, bravery, and right conscience. Poor Percy was troubled by girls around him- first Annabeth, Rachel and then Calypso. It was cute to see jealous Annabeth. She was great in the book. Her feelings for Luke was confusing and I could feel the frustration of Percy. Both of their feelings were genuine and I can’t wait to see development in their relationship.What I loved more was, world building and myth. The world was interesting- Structure of maze, traps, and monsters in it. Giving the maze life and mind of its own was made the plot brilliant. Deadalus might be crazy for creating this outstanding structure. The story of eternal chase between Daedalus and Minos was gripping and enlightening. I loved to meet different Greek gods in each installment. This time our hero met Hera, Hephaestus and Pan who helped in their quest and gave godly lessons. Not just that but we meet older monsters, monster with bad anatomy, and older kids of Gaia.There were many insightful messages in the book. How intelligence, greed, vengeance comes with deadly price, how it brings loneliness and bitterness in life that makes you do terrible things and gives no peace even after death; there is no way to cheat death even after many millennia; how being clever is not enough, one must be wise as well; no dark magic can bring back those who are gone, it only disturbs the peace of the spirit. Oh, and animal rights activists and environmentalists will be happy by this book.It was wonderful blend of Myth, modern world and lifelong lessons.Climax was surprising. Even though this was my reread, I couldn’t guess the identity of Daedalus. Kronos’s plan was shocking and I was mesmerized by Pan’s words. I enjoyed battle scenes and loved the end with two surprise visits. Can’t wait to read final book in this series!Overall, I just loved it! It is perfect book for fans of Greek Mythology, adventure, and witty characters.",7,0.9942,0.101,0.726,0.173,0.6734499007936506,POSITIVE,0.9996

It was about the only thing I was sure of.”Annabeth: “But you'll be killed!""Percy: ""I'll be fine. Besides, we've got no choice.""Annabeth glared at me like she was going to punch me. And then she did something that surprised me even more. She kissed me.”“This might be it,’ she said. ‘Could be.’ ‘Nice fighting with you, Seaweed Brain.’ ‘Ditto.’”THEY HAVE MY WHOLE HEART-	Rachel Elizabeth Dare:“Rachel: You're a half-blood, too?Annabeth: Shhh! Just announce it to the world, how about?Rachel: Okay. Hey, everybody! These two aren't human! They're half Greek god! They don't seem to care.”“I'm calm,"" Rachel insisted. ""Every time I'm around you, some monsters attack us. What's to be nervous about?""‘See you later, Percy Jackson. Go save the world for me, okay?’” AAAHH-	""I left him in his wheelchair, staring sadly into the fireplace. I wondered how many times he’d sat here, waiting for heroes that never came back."" 🙁-	CALYPSOOOO😭😭:  ""They sent Calypso someone she couldn’t help but love. But it worked both ways. For the rest of my life I would be thinking about her. She would always be my biggest what if.""-	Mr. Dionysus:“I turned to Dionysus. ""You cured him?""""Madness is my specialty. It was quite simple.""""But... you did something nice. Why?""He raised and eyebrow. ""I am nice! I simple ooze niceness, Perry Johansson. Haven't you noticed?” AAHAHAHAHAHA-	TYSON I LOVE HIM HE IS SOO CUTE!!!“You are okay?"" he asked. ""Not eaten by monsters?""""Not even a little bit."" I showed him that I still had both arms and both legs, and Tyson clapped happily.""Yay!"" he said. ""Now we can eat peanut butter sandwiches and ride fish ponies! We can fight monsters and see Annabeth and make things go BOOM!""-	Poseidon’s visit: “Poseidon raised his eyebrows as they shook hands. “Blowfish, did you say?”""Ah, no. Blofis, actually.”""Oh, I see,” Poseidon said. “A shame. I quite like blowfish. I am Poseidon.” AHAHAAAA like father like son“And you, Percy, are my favourite son.” AwwSome quotes I really liked:“Be careful of love. It'll twist your brain around and leave you thinking up is down and right is wrong.”“People are more difficult to work with than machines.

251,3550811561,09/26/2020,5.0,"""The Labyrinth is right under the surface of the mortal world, kind of like a second skin. It's been growing for thousands of years, lacing its way under Western cities, connecting everything together underground. You can get anywhere through the Labyrinth.""Silver tetradrachm, Knossos, Crete. 2nd-1st century BCE. O: Zeus, R: Labyrinth. (Alpha Bank Numismatics Collection, Kerkyra, Corfu) Credit: Mark CartwrightThe narrative flows like a labyrinth, with surprises, unexpected respites, detours, and lots of action and thrill. I'm learning from Riordan: writing skill doesn't depend on a genre or a specified target group. Riordan shows extraordinary skill within the parameters of his chosen niche. This one showed more sentiment, similar to the path of the Harry Potter series, when reality sets in, and we come to the inevitable truth everything must come to an end. Two scenes stuck with me. The first: when Riordan reveals Kronos. He does it in such a way you know this guy isn't someone you want to mess with. Riordan has skill in descriptions, battle scenes, pacing, timing. Kronos scared me, and the limitations of the heroes stood out. The second: Riordan pulls the veil off Pan in Grover's search for him. This part of the story made me see the Wild-god through a new perspective. Riordan makes him beautiful, glorious, powerful, and terrifying. Grover's powers increase. He evolves again, from a goofball of furry comic relief, to someone of incredible superpowers.""A strange breeze rustled through the clearing, temporarily overpowering the stink of trash and murk. It brought the smell of berries and wildflowers and clean rainwater, things that might've once been in these woods.""I may read these all again some day. I find them extraordinary.

Characters that haven’t met or interacted much together get the chance to build new bonds in battle, and across awesome adventures. The Labyrinth is used as a clever plot device, and the Greek history surrounding it is immersive. Percy Jackson continues to prove himself not only to be an awesome protagonist, but also a great hero, who is growing up, and smoothly transitioning himself and his story into a more YA centric direction. And doing so without loosing any of the story’s original essence, witty humour, or classic Greek tales. The books are simply growing up with their audience in a natural fashion.

From an overarching plot standpoint, I suppose it doesn't do much. It fleshes out some characters. Establishes Percy as a teenage boy who will fall for just about any girl who shows interest. And continues the threat of Kronos rising--but we already knew he was coming. At the same time, for a side quest, this really develops the world because it grapples with actual, meaningful questions about life. What to do when god goes silent? What does it mean when someone commits horrible acts in the name of god? Is it possible to live in the presence of death? It provides young readers with a space to ask big, life questions and in the process creates a much more realistic worldview than I remembered.

Out of four, this book holds infinite adventures in less than 400 pages.your love for Percy and his squad will literally make your hands glued until the last pages. The Battle Of The Labyrinth exceed the expectations that I had and truly, I love them more than ever now.and I made a list!  (*insert me giggle*) 1. Have you seen jealous Annabeth? It's so fun to see my girl growing, even with her feelings! how she grow affection and love with all the people she loves. (and yes, that includes Luke)2. Oh, Nico di Angelo I love, I love, I love how he finally embraced his true form. Have you read how he stepped up against Minos? that my Nico! and and and his attack at the camp? gods, I love that son of Hades. Though, his exit at the camp worries me, I'm glad how his relationship with Percy grow maturely. 3. Calypso's Island If there is a number one hopeless romantic out of all hopeless romantics, I present to you, Calypso. It made me read that chapter thrice, just to save my heart from breaking itself with this one. Calypso was such an angel and she didn't deserve this curse. The Fates are truly cruel, indeed. That her place is one paradise of a kind, all magical and perfect. Yet, she herself is not perfect without a companion. Perfection is truly an illusion, and love is a tricky one.  ""It'll twist your brain around and leave you thinking up is down and right is wrong.""   take that lesson from Hephaetus people!  4. Clarisse and Chris Oh these two, I am in awe how Clarisse treasure this man, even in the worst. And I don't hate her that much. A daughter of war god, that fight thru blood and bones in the Sea of Monsters? that was badass! 5. Mount St.Helens   ""Annabeth glared at me like she was going to punch me. And she did something that suprised me even more. She kissed me.""""Be careful, Seaweed Brain""  I just want to add this one because I root for Percy and Annabeth so much! 6.  'And to lose a love that is worse than death'  There is no denying that what Luke and Annabeth has, was real. She said it herself that she knows Luke longer than Percy, and still she has a space for him in her heart. But then I feel like there is more than just that. Maybe even not about Luke. Well, the Pan said that Annabeth will play a large role bigger than she imagined. and I have no idea but I guess I just have to read the next novels. 7. Half-blood hill attack Let's go to action people! This scene was aaaaaaamazing. I love how everyone played their role. Apollo archers, Ares' warriors, the Satyrs and all! How nico said 'Serve Me' ahhh and brought up dead warriors to fight again, it made me scream. Kampê landed on Athena's. and Briares comeback? aaaah 8. The birthday visit Isn't nice to be visited by your father who is the Lord of the Sea on your birthday? yes it is.Percy's birthday got more excitement when he came. Not to mention Tyson, but I adore is that his mini celebration is what literally Percy has to do on his birthday. Blue cake, ice creams, and cheesy games.  9. The labyrinth itself I think I need to read more about this one. This was so beautifully written and created. Dadaelus is one true creator. He made that world intense and yet worth the adventure. Knowing that his punishment in the underworld is not that so bad, I'm glad that he got to see his son again.there is no number 10 on this one but I think it will be,  The Last Olympian.  join me with my blue cake to read this epic adventure.",7,0.9929,0.099,0.729,0.173,0.557986898463089,POSITIVE,0.9987

Percy Jackson and the Olympians
: The Lightening Thief: ★★★★☆ (4.5) The Sea of Monsters: ★★★★★The Titan's Curse: ★★★★★The Battle of the Labyrinth: ★★★★★The Last Olympian: TBD Rick Riordan is officially a favourite and this series just keeps getting better and better. While I'm forever kicking myself around over having taken so long to actually read Percy Jackson and the Olympians, I'm grateful that I finally have. These characters, this world, the mythology and Riordan's prose officially own my heart. It is just too good and The Battle of the Labyrinth is one of the best installments. How can one series be so good? This is nothing short of fun and brilliance. The Battle of the Labyrinth sets us off on another delightfully snark, enthralling and action packed adventure. I think that, so far, of the first four novels, this book has been my favourite. (I know, I keep saying that as I read, but it's true.) Percy, Annabeth, Grover and Tyson are all in their elements and I am so thrilled to see them go on a quest together. I loved seeing how much these characters have grown since we were first introduced to them. Each of their relationships have been so fun to watch grow. (Or, in the case of some, deteriorate.) I truly love each of them in their own ways. Part of me wanted to say that Annabeth or Tyson are my favourite characters but then I find myself like, ""Wait! But! Percy! OH, AND GROVER!!! What about Clarisse? What about--"" and it just goes on from there. With every passing installment, the mythology of Percy Jackson's world becomes so much more complex and fascinating; just when I think he couldn't possibly outdo himself, he does. This time, we've got a little more teenage angst sprinkled in for good measure, and as always it doesn't over-power a single moment of the action. Riordan always creates a perfect balance for these stories and I cannot stress how fantastic it has been to witness it. While I'm not reading these as a child, nor did I then, there's something so nostalgic about them. It is like slipping back into my childhood for but a moment and rediscovering this exhilaration and love of reading. I might not be growing up with these characters in the way that I did with the ones in Harry Potter, but I'm so excited to be experiencing it now. There is just so much fun to be had with these novels--they are gorgeously written, witty, full of mythology and fantasy, and are amongst the best of the genre. One look at this series and you're hooked. That's what I've discovered when it comes to Percy Jackson and the Olympians and Rick Riordan in general. This series is impossible to put down and even more impossible to forget! I've adored every moment and I'm so glad to be experiencing it. It's true what they say: better late than never.

You shall delve in the darkness of the endless maze,The dead, the traitor, and the lost one raise.You shall rise or fall by the ghost king's hand,The Child of Athena's final stand.Destroy with a hero's final breath,And lose a love to worse than death.

When demonic cheerleaders invade his high school, Percy Jackson hurries to Camp Half Blood, from whence he and his demigod friends set out on a quest through the Labyrinth, while the war between the Olympians and the evil Titan lord Kronos draws near.

Once again this book is pure perfection, straight from the gods itself! I love how Percy and his friends continue to mature and become more complex through the series, as do their adventures. And boy, do they mature. Rachel and Annabeth are fighting over our poor innocent Percy.
""I'm calm,"" Rachel insisted. ""Every time I'm around you, some monsters attack us. What's to be nervous about?""""Look,"" I said. ""I'm sorry about the band room. I hope they didn't kick you our or anything.""""Nah. They asked me a lot of questions about you. I played dumb.""""Was it hard?"" Annabeth asked."" 
Oh Percy, this is your fault for being so adorable!.
 
RAWR
Back to the book
The story arc has remained unified and compelling, and although readers who pick up the series midstream won't be disappointed, they'll certainly want to go back and start over from the beginning. And heck, even those who have already read all four Olympian adventures will probably want to re-read from the beginning as they wait with bated breath for the conclusion of Percy's adventures in book five.

The wit, rousing swordplay, surprising plot twists and breakneck pace will once again keep readers hooked. Up until now the series has been great fun, but little more. Now as it begins to grow, like the Labyrinth, larger and deeper and more complex, it's even more fun.

268,996112665,07/14/2014,5.0,"Original thought 4/8/12: I am yet to be disappointed in this series; in fact it just seems to be getting better and better!Being the penultimate book in the Percy Jackson series I want to start by saying that I love how strong this series has been right from the start, because it has never failed to impress me.This book in particular is one of my favourites because it has the perfect mix of constant action as well as family/friend relationships that simply brighten my day. Percabeth seems to be finally happening and if that isn’t enough reason for 5 stars… Annabeth seems to still be hung up on Luke though which has always been infuriating to me and Percy has good reason to get annoyed with it as well (even if he’s a boy about it and doesn’t get why he's even annoyed).The gang is back together after they were apart for the majority of the previous book The Titan’s Curse, along with Rachel who is not the pain-in-the-ass character only there to form a love triangle that people expected her to be; and the importance she has in the story, and will come to have, is really interesting.All the characters have visibly matured from the first book up to this point, but Percy in particular still has his signature snarky voice and I’m so glad that the grave circumstances never took that away.The situation with the impending prophecy definitely adds a more serious tone to this book, like it did with the last and the mysterious labyrinth only added to this unease. I can’t wait to continue on to the last book which I seem to remember does not disappoint.Posted on: http://enchantedbyya.blogspot.co.uk/",7,0.932,0.063,0.815,0.122,0.5401875901875901,POSITIVE,0.9998
269,1213903919,02/28/2015,4.0,"*3.5 stars*This 4th instalment in the Percy Jackson series ended up being pretty good, better than the previous ones for sure, which I had found ok but a bit too young. I liked that the book seemed a lot older and maturer, and I think it's set up for an interesting final book. I did get a little bored in the beginning, but the ending was really interesting and exciting, and I read the last half of this book in one sitting, a first for me in this series.One little rant I want to make, and it's not even a rant on this book really, just on society in general. I wish books didn't place so much emphasis on beauty, especially children's books. The character of Rachel was at least on one occasion, if not on more than one, described as pretty (which I suppose is normal as the book is coming from a 15 year old boys perspective) but regardless, it makes me sad to think that girls grow up hoping to be described as pretty or hot, as if that should be a huge importance. It's great to feel confident, of course, and looking good/being told you look good, can definitely give you a mood boost. However, there are more important things in life, intelligence, kindness, humbleness etc. I want my future daughter (or son) to know that beauty is really only skin deep and being an honest, intelligent, fair, kind, HAPPY human being is way more enviable than looking pretty. I was just thinking about this after that awful Twitter tag that trended today, #FeministsAreUgly, so apologies for going off course in this review. It's not a criticism of the book. Just my observation.Good book. Best one yet. Looking forward to the next. ",7,0.9988,0.041,0.625,0.333,0.6185363247863247,POSITIVE,0.9802
270,1732980710,08/19/2016,5.0,"CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS* I would just like to start by saying that I absolutely LOVED this book and I thought it was flawless! I've always wondered what all the rave is with Rick Riordan books and I finally understand it. So, the writing was brilliant! Most of the sentences were so well constructed that they were almost alive in a sense and the similes and metaphors used were so simple yet so understandable. Also, the chapters were really well organized and they kind of made a pathway for the story that just let everything fall into place at the right time. I love and hate the ending because it leaves you in suspense but it also leaves you in suspense (if you understand what I mean.) Moving on to the story: first thing's first: PERCABETH OH MY GOODNESS! Alright, moving on to a more serious note, you can tell that this is the book that finally reaches the complication of the series as a whole, which is really good since, with series like this, not every book can have a happy ending where all the problems are resolved and whatnot. All my questions that I still had from the previous three books are answered, for example, I finally know where Rachel Elizabeth Dare fits in and things like that. The minor conflicts were resolved like the issue with Nico, finding Daedalus and so on. I must say, my favorite thing about these books is all your questions about the prophecy that the characters get before going on a quest are so uniquely answered. All in all, this is definitely a five star worthy book and I'd recommend the PJO series to literally anyone that breathes because it's just so spectacular  ",8,0.9941,0.035,0.762,0.203,0.6560119047619046,POSITIVE,0.9999
271,35064432,10/11/2008,5.0,"I really loved this fourth installment in the Percy Jackson series! It was interesting and informative (something I always appreciate from Riordan - not only the mythology research he must have done, but current research about the country and landmarks). I definitely felt like Percy was growing up in this book and felt the flavor of the book matched that - a little more detailed and a little less clear on those 'black-and-white' lines. Things are still building for the ""finale"" and I'm really curious how Riordan will tie everything up.I also quite enjoyed the characters in this book, and the new places that Percy visits.For me, personally, I do feel the book should have been/was meant to be just a little longer. I felt there were times when there could have been some great character exploration but that it got glossed over. Again, this didn't hurt the book, but I would have liked to see just a little more (again though, this could just be a personal thing). Other than that, this book is a very quick read and exciting the entire time. Yay Percy!! :D***Review pending.

I'm really liking how this series shuffles its main gang of characters around, it's something that I really like to see in series, especially ones longer than a trilogy (see also The Lunar Chronicles) because it keeps things interesting and prevents character arcs from getting too drawn out. I've found that some series with a large cast try to follow the actions of every single important character constantly, and while there is a lot of merit to that (complex storylines, character development, worldbuilding etc.), sometimes having them just leave to do their own thing and then later concisely explain what happened works very well too.(view spoiler)[I really like how Clarisse has slowly become more humanised throughout the series instead of just staying as the stereotypical bully caricature the whole time.

That was cute :D (hide spoiler)]All the labyrinth stuff was pretty cool, it reminded me a bit of Demon Thief by Darren Shan as well as House of Leaves by Mark Z Danielewski (House of Leaves is a given of course, since it outright references the Minotaur throughout the book)Can't wait to read the finale!",6,0.9944,0.055,0.76,0.185,0.4833597883597882,POSITIVE,0.9998
290,3882452576,03/11/2021,5.0,"Another great adventure! This time we learn that under the surface is a Labyrint. Like ""THE LABYRINTH""! It connects places over the Western Civilization, and you can travel through it very quickly from one place to another, considering you won't get lost or get eaten by some monsters hiding in the tunnels.The books start when Percy is on tour in his potentially future school. As always, everything goes wrong when he meets some demons, and they blast the school's music room into fires—a normal day for Percy. He meets this mortal girl from the previous book who has the sight. She can see through the Mist, which hides mystical occurrences from mortal people. Now finally, we have a mixed adventure with demigods and mortals! Percy is going to be fifteen. One year close the famous prophecy which no one wants to talk about it with him. Typical! Now that he is older, he became more aware of girls. It looks like he likes Annabeth less than a friend and more like a girl now. However, the goddess Afrodite told him in the previous books that she will make his love life more interesting. And yes, it isn't straightforward! We have this new mortal girl! And as predicted, Annabeth doesn't like her that much.The quest is to find the Labyrinth's creator, Daedalus, and convince him not to help Luke and his Titan's army cross the labyrinth to attack the Half-Blood camp. Grover and Tyson get lost in search of the god Pan. However, when they all are united, they stand against the Titan's army. There's a big fight, but I guess we will see Percy in his last adventure in the next book! What a ride! ",7,0.9534,0.04,0.842,0.118,0.389057239057239,POSITIVE,0.9999
291,2385483279,05/12/2018,4.0,"I loooove this book. ❤️The story is so action packed and has a very dark atmosphere. There are (of course) a lot of jokes but the overall tone is more serious and tense. The book is full of well written fight scenes and epic battles. The plot isn't as predictable for me as the previous PJO books.What I really liked was that we get to see more of Rachel and Nico. I love these two characters so much and both have some very interesting powers. I felt so sorry for Nico. Seeing him so angry, lost and frustrated broke my heart. But I adore his development thoughout this book.Each PJO book makes me appreciate Percy as a protagonist more. Percy is so adorable, smart and caring. I love his jokes and his relationship with his friends. ❤️Annabeth on the other hand was kinda annoying in this book. I really don't like her jealous attitude.Overall this book series gets better and better and I'm a bit afraid how the story might end in the last book.",6,0.9874,0.157,0.562,0.281,0.5185467980295566,POSITIVE,0.9993

The people in my village laughed at me. They said I would never amount to anything. Look at me now. Sometimes small things can become very large indeed.” Another installment that was fun, funny, lighthearted and easy to read. I know I would have loved this book more if I was younger, but that didn't stop me from attempting a middle grade mindset before I started this series. It was a good thing I did, because I ended up enjoying this book. My friend's kid enjoyed it even more than I did. Especially when I did the voices. This series is perfect for kids. Under all the gods and their drama, and under all the sneaky mythology with ridiculous premises, there are lessons to be learnt. ",7,0.9795,0.053,0.73,0.217,0.6447845804988661,POSITIVE,0.9995

I love the idea behind these books, since I've always had a thing for greek gods, and I wasn't disappointed with the 4th book!Percy is such a great character, he's funny and brave. I also liked getting to know more and more about the other characters, especially Nico, I wish there would've been more about him. The plot was fast paced and easy to follow, it never got boring and was also pretty informative, as the other books were. I love reading middle grade books from time to time because they're so...well, easy. Exciting, but still not too complex. I finished this book in 2 days and really enjoyed it :)",6,0.9852,0.0,0.712,0.288,0.6709876543209875,POSITIVE,0.9996

I am adopting Nico di Angelo as my goth son 🖤I really liked Percy and Annabeth's relationship in this book and I also really enjoyed Grover's part in this book- the cave scene near the end was beautiful and I think it was done so well. I wish I could see a cave like that in real life, it sounded wonderful. I really loved the idea of the Labyrinth and how it's always changing, and the battle scenes in this book were great. I enjoyed the first three, but for me this one just stepped the game up for this series for me and I can't wait to read the Last Olympian.

My favorite scene was the one involving Pan…. There was something about it that I found so captivating and thoughtful. I thought that the storyline was great and it’s really nice to see the characters continue to grow and mature. I’m sad that the series is winding down and that I’m now moving onto the final book….

The reviews on this series are my thoughts.)The depth the series took in the labyrinth was very...charming. I can't deny that I enjoyed reading this too my son as much as he had listening to it.But I feel too that my son will enjoy these more as he gets older. It's a tale of growing up. Growing up in a very different life style, having too be grown so at a young age, but grown all the same.
