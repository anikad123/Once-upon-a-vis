I found this for fifty cents at my library's used book sale last week. A warning I clearly ignored. But it had a good title, a beautiful, mysterious cover, and lots of people are reading it. Lots of people watch ""Oprah"" and ""The View"", too. About halfway through the first paragraph I realized, too late to get my fifty cents back, that this is CHICK LIT. Not even goofy, over-the-top fun chick lit, but ""takes itself waaay too serious"" chick lit pretending to be literature. The subtitle of this preposterous premised-book, choked with a mountain of useless detail, should have been ""My Hidden Breastfeeding Agenda, Brought to You By the La Leche League"". She goes on, on, on, and on about ""the milk rising"", and other numerous references to the Joy of Breastfeeding. At least in the first chapters. Then she drops it like a hot potato, busily filling the pages with endless detail about patterns on people's clothing and how the ground looks. Instead of working on character development. Anyway, the plot is just too much: Husband Pretends Handicapped Baby is Born Dead Keeps Big Secret From Wife and Marriage is NEVER THE SAME. Well, duh.The main characters, except Caroline, are wholly unlikeable.The writing is beyond tolerable; my eyes rolled so often they hurt.Edwards clearly has ""The Writer's Guide to Trite"" and ""The Big Book of Cliches"" on her reference shelf. Ugh. Why do rooms always have to be ""small but immaculate""? Also, while casuarina trees and bougainvillea exist on Aruba, the ""trademark tree"" is the Divi-divi, and cacti are more typical than flowers. Let me guess, Edwards has never been there, right?And note to author: You don't know your ass from a hole in the ground about photography. ""Photography is about secrets"" she writes. Whaaaa???? I thought it was about revelation and discovery. Thanks, Kim, I'll bring my diploma from R.I.T to work tomorrow and shred it in the shredder.

1,1244900,05/16/2007,2.0,"Man I hated this book- the plot had some great potential, but instead you got to witness one scene of frustrated people not knowing how to deal with their emotions after another. Seriously, imagine 60 someodd pages of: wife- ""I'm sad, darling, talk to me"" husband- ""we can't have another baby"" silence...followed by wife being angry and husband yet again being emotionally stunted...ok, fine, I see that it's a result of him giving away their daughter with downs syndrome, but I just wouldn't end! After about 10 of these scenes, we get the point. Then we progress to 60 pages of a new hell: son- ""dad, I love music, you don't know who I am!"" father ""son, don't limit yourself to only this option"" once again, fine as a single scene, but we have to endure it again and AGAIN. Then the book adds some completely random characters, has people reflect on life ad nauseum, and basically does nothing to make you care about any of the characters. Also, despite basing an entire story around the mistake of giving up a child because of a mental disability, it gave absolutely no credit to the young girl who has downs syndrome! She's more of a prop than a person, no part of the story is told from her perspective, and asside from the desire to marry her boyfriend, never gets the chance to show the world what she wants and feels. Great job reaffirming stereotypes! My boss loved this book, and some of my coworkers thought it was OK, but obviously I thought it was bad enough to write a barely-cohesive rant rather than a review.

3,2992109689,09/26/2019,4.0,"The Memory Keeper's Daughter, Kim EdwardsThe Memory Keeper's Daughter is a novel by American author Kim Edwards that tells the story of a man who gives away his newborn daughter, who has Down syndrome, to one of the nurses. Published by Viking Press in June 2005. In early March of 1964, Dr. David Henry is forced to deliver his wife Norah's twins with the help of a nurse, Caroline Gill. Their first child, a boy they name Paul, is born a healthy perfect child, but when the second baby is born, Phoebe, David notices she has Down syndrome. David, recalling the possibility of a heart defect and early death (which his younger sister June had had; dying at the young age of twelve) and decides that the baby girl will be placed in an institution. Caroline was given the baby to take to the institution, but simply didn't like the conditions. She decides to keep and raise the baby, who is named Phoebe. While Caroline is at the store, her car runs out of fuel and she is stranded in the snow with Phoebe. She is picked up by a truck driver, Al Simpson, who drives them to Caroline's home. Meanwhile, David tells Norah that their daughter died at birth. After hearing that Caroline had kept Phoebe rather than take her to the institution, David bids her to do what she thinks is right. Caroline leaves for Pittsburgh to make a fresh start with Phoebe. ...عنوانها: دختری در غبار خاطره‌ها؛ دختر یک راز؛ نویسنده: کیم ادواردز؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز بیست و هفتم ماه سپتامبر سال 2010میلادیعنوان: دختری در غبار خاطره‌ها؛ نویسنده: کیم ادواردز؛ مترجم اصغر اندرودی؛ کرج در دانش بهمن‏‫، ‏‫‏1387؛ در 508ص؛ شابک 9789641740636؛ موضوع: داستانهای نویسندگان ایالات متحده امریکا - سده 21معنوان: دختر یک راز؛ نویسنده: کیم ادواردز؛ مترجم: فرخنده (فریبا) کاظم‌لو؛ تهران حکایتی دگر‏‫، ‏‫1388؛ در 178 ص؛ شابک 9789642756155؛‬‬کولاک برف، دکتر «دیوید هنری» را وامی‌دارد دوقلوهایش را خود به دنیا آورد.؛ پسرش، که نخست به دنیا می‌آید، در سلامت کامل است؛ اما دکتر بی‌درنگ درمی‌یابد، که دخترش به عقب‌ ماندگی ذهنی مبتلاست.؛ بنا به انگیزه‌ هایی که به نظر او معقول است، در یک لحظه تصمیمی می‌گیرد که سراسر عمرشان از آن تاثیر می‌پذیرد؛ او از «کرولاین»، پرستار خود، می‌خواهد که بچه را به موسسه‌ ای که ویژه ی نگهداری از این‌گونه کودکان است، بسپارد، «کرولاین»، به جای اینکار به شهر دیگری می‌رود، و دختر را همانند فرزند خویش بزرگ می‌کند.؛ داستان حاضر حکایت چند زندگی در کنار هم، اسرار خانوادگی، و قدرت رهایی‌بخش عشق استتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 29/04/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی",87,-0.8851,0.042,0.934,0.025,0.3335978835978836,POSITIVE,0.8099
4,23657467,06/03/2008,1.0,"At first I couldn’t pinpoint exactly why I was not enjoying a book that sounded as though it would be ‘my kind of book’ in every way, but the more I read and the more I thought about it, the more reasons emerged.	From the beginning of the novel there were little details that bothered me. The plot often felt contrived, as pieces fell together too nicely. Of course life is crazy and there is always the possibility of the little pieces falling in the most peculiar way, but when all of your characters’ lives seem to follow that incredible pattern, it begins to feel ridiculous.	Some of the characters themselves also became clichés. Perhaps I reached a certain point in the story where I began to look for things that bothered me and therefore found them more readily than other readers. Yet, Norah, the mother of the twins, and her sister, Bree seem to never really develop. Bree is the young, free-loving free-spirit who is thus almost a danger to Norah’s thoughts on life – and that is what she remains, even when older and diagnosed with cancer (although Norah does come to appreciate her). Norah, whose life unravels for a bit after she thinks her daughter has died, drinks too much and then begins having affairs, and this is who she remains for most of the novel. The characters just seemed too much like a sappy Lifetime movie for me to really take them inside of me and keep with me.	I was also very disappointed in the character of Phoebe, the Down’s syndrome daughter given away by her father. She was the driving force of the novel and yet we really never know her other than glimpses through the eyes of Caroline. Paul, her twin brother, is given thoughts but Phoebe’s mind remains a mystery. I understand the difficulty in writing honestly for a character with Down’s but I kept thinking of the autistic narrator in Haddon’s The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time who was so rich and incredible and believable (if you haven’t read this one, please do!!). I just thought that Edwards had a mission in humanizing those who suffer Down’s syndrome; and that she herself undermines her purpose with the complete omission of Phoebe’s voice. I wanted to know this child as a child and not as a sad plot device. In all fairness, however, I have to say that I did love certain passages, as Edwards’ poetic language captured me wholly.	In the end, I think that my largest issue with this book was the absolute destruction of this family. I know that what happened at the birth of the babies was tragic and life changing but I felt as though it was a bit contrived that it drove every emotion and interaction afterwards for the remainder of the characters’ lives. Perhaps, for me, it just made their bonds from the beginning suspect as their destruction was made so inevitable by that one tragic mistake. I didn’t believe it and perhaps, because we read to understand others and to change ourselves, I do not want to believe it. ",78,-0.9672,0.126,0.782,0.092,0.5781498015873014,NEGATIVE,0.9999

There's still time to quit reading!"" Really, it's one of those books that has an interesting premise/situation, but doesn't go anywhere. The interesting premise is this: a couple has twins and the father sneaks away with the one twin who has Downs Syndrome. The mother doesn't know about this baby and it's raised by the father's coworker. You're interested, right? Well, watch out, because after the initial birth scene, which is good, nothing happens for 200 pages. The author drags you through the book, dangling the moment that the mother finds out about her daughter in front of you. If this had been an actual good, daring book, it would have started at the point where the mother finds out about her long-lost daughter. Instead, it ends there. Cop out! Waste of time!

6,17098495,03/05/2008,4.0,"I read a bunch of reviews of this book prior to reading it myself, and wasn't sure whether or not I would enjoy it.I was pleasantly surprised to find that I liked this book quite a bit, and here's why:1. The story was fascinating! What would I have done in that situation? It was fun to imagine myself as Norah, Caroline, David or Paul and determine if my actions would mirror theirs, or if I would have done things differently. 2. The metaphors and imagery that Edwards uses are captivating. For example, she describes ""crocuses shouting"" and ""a wedge of air coming through an open door"". The juxtaposition of physical characteristics ascribed to inanimate objects, and the fusion of opposites added texture to the story.Going along with that, she used the wind as a metaphor-unrest, loneliness, loss, guilt, shame, it spoke a different language to each of the characters and manifested itself in interesting ways. The obsessive compulsive picture taking, the drive to make sense of the world, the bones, the running, the travel-all of these were terrific physical manifestations of inner turmoil, some blatant, others, subtle reminders of the loss.3. Edwards descriptive abilities made it seem that I was in the room with the characters. She pointed out the pattern of sunlight cascading through the windows, or other mundane details that so many other authors gloss over or ignore because they are too busy telling about events that happen. I realize that in some cases this can be construed as ""dragging, boring, or slow"" but Edwards used such beautiful, interesting language to describe those things, that it made the story come alive for me, and I felt like I was a participant observer, rather than just an observer.4. One of my personal fascinations is tracking and tracing the pivotal points in people's lives that determine who they really are. Naturally this book was all about how one seemingly right decision affected dozens of lives. How would they have been different if different decision were made? The only really bothersome thing was that nobody triumphed over the loss...no matter how hard they tried...so, is this a cautionary tale to always tell the truth? To not make decisions based on how you think someone will react, but to give them the agency to decide that for themselves? I understand how the outcomes of each of the characters happened, but also would have liked to have seen some triumph and salvation-and perhaps that's what Rosemary and Jack were supposed to be, at least for David. He couldn't fix his own family so he spent his time fixing others-literally and figuratively. And, I guess, ultimately Phoebe and Caroline triumphed...I just don't like to believe that suffering a loss reduces us to throwing our lives to the wind. I want to think that peace and hope can still be found.",73,0.9878,0.06,0.82,0.12,0.5405753968253969,POSITIVE,0.999
7,44652104,01/28/2009,3.0,"Wow, I'm really torn as to what to say about this book. I will start by saying that Kim Edwards is a skilled writer and there's no taking that away from her. Her words flow beautifully and that was greatly appreciated by me.I began reading this book and fell in love with it. From the beginning, I was very sure that I was going to rate it with five stars. I was intrigued by the premise: It's 1964 and a doctor's wife gives birth to twins. The twins were unexpected (no ultrasounds back then) and so the second baby, a girl with Down's Syndrome, was a shock. In the panic of a moment, the doctor, who had lost his own sister when she was 12 (due to a heart problem), panics and gives his newborn daughter, Phoebe, to his nurse, Caroline. He wants to spare his wife (and himself) the pain of having a child with Down Syndrome who might not live long. Caroline takes the baby to the home, but when she gets there, she realizes she cannot leave the child in such a wretched place and makes a split-second decision to keep her as her own. The author skillfully goes back and forth between the doctor's family, David and Norah Henry (and their son, Paul) and Caroline's life with the girl, Phoebe. I was intrigued.Somewhere, around page 175, I started not liking the book so much. What had been a taut, interesting story, started taking little side trips that I felt tarnished the characters and didn't stay within what I thought the author had set up. But I didn't want to dislike the book for this reason, because I don't expect the author to go where I might go or where I might have liked to see her go. Still, the things that were going on kept nagging at me and making me uneasy in a way that I don't think were intended to make me uneasy.I began to care less and less about the characters, but stayed with the book because it was interesting to see where it went and I had already invested so much time in reading it. There were too many long descriptions of things that didn't matter to me, and no matter how hard I tried, I didn't get to know the characters in the way I thought I should.I am stuck in the middle. In the end, I didn't really care for it all too much, but cannot say that others would not. I give the writer kudos for being so skilled with the English language. I didn't really care about any of the characters very much in the end, if at all, and I think that's what really soured me on this book. This is a hard one for me to judge. If you're at all interested, read it for yourself and see what you think.",57,0.9652,0.07,0.836,0.094,0.4055962059620595,NEGATIVE,0.5109
8,3440269,07/24/2007,2.0,"**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**Reading this book was like an up-hill battle for me. I have looked forward to reading it for so long and was expecting great things based on all the praise-worthy reviews on the book jacket. Boy was i disappointed! The plot and synopsis of the story had such excellent promise but along the way the author dropped the ball. It was very difficult to relate or sympathize with Norah Henry, even though she is the one wronged by her husband's rash (but not unfounded) decision to lie about the ""supposed"" death of their mentally defected daughter while keeping her healthy twin brother. Norah's self destructive ways and at times selfish childishness did nothing but annoy me and drive me farther away from her pain. What the author did really well was humanizing Dr. David Henry because reading the back of the novel i thought he was a monster. He was the only character i actually felt was not overly contrived. Phoebe ""the memory keeper’s daughter"" did not have a true voice in the whole novel and that was a poor choice by the author. The major climax and confrontation i was hoping would happen between members of the family never occurred; instead the author decided do something that was shocking but totally unnecessary to the digression of the conflict. So why did i bother giving it 2 stars? Because the one question i wanted answered -- what would possess a man to do such a horrible thing as to not only give away his newborn daughter but then lie about her death? -- was convincingly answered and somewhat understandable. Also the book was beautifully written, and i appreciate any book that can evoke emotion based on simple sentence construction. So, i will look for other books by Kim Edwards -- at the library not the bookstore, for now.",50,-0.9819,0.183,0.693,0.124,0.6493842364532021,NEGATIVE,1.0
9,2258167602,01/24/2018,4.0,"The Memory Keeper's Daughter crept up on me in a way I never expected. After reading many conflicting reviews I assumed I would either DNF this book at worst or slap 3 stars on it at best.In 1964, Dr. David Henry delivers his own twins. His son is perfectly healthy. His daughter is born with Down's Syndrome. Remembering his own sickly sister who died young, and the unending sorrow it caused for his mother, he is determined to protect his wife from the same heartache. He asks his nurse to take the baby away to an institution, but Caroline, the nurse, chooses to disappear into another city to raise the child herself. The story unfolds over 25 years - two families, unknowingly bound by the fateful decision made long ago.Let me start off by saying, this book is not for the faint of heart. It is not a happy story. Dr. Henry and his wife Norah live a life teeming with grief; a heavy secret, unbeknownst to Norah, settles between them and grows ever larger as the years go by. It's a story I might not have understood a few years ago. I've always been troubled by characters that keep secrets or avoid having important conversations, usually thinking it was bad plot device. But I've recently experienced things in my own family that have opened my eyes to certain behaviors. I think this was something that happened a lot in the 60 and 70s. For whatever reason, families tended to brush things under the rug and keep skeletons in the closet.One of my favourite things about this book, apart from the writing which I found deeply engrossing, was the passage of time. This book takes place over 25 years and I was never once confused about what year it was or how old the twins were at any given time. Kim Edwards' storytelling is seamless; one chapter melting perfectly into the next, even if they were five or ten years apart.This story won't be for everyone, but it's one I won't forget anytime soon.",46,-0.8539,0.083,0.852,0.065,0.5775493025493024,POSITIVE,0.8908
10,2179055,06/20/2007,5.0,"Dark Trees in the Heart The Memory Keeper's Daughter is a story about a secret--a terrible, life-altering secret running central to the story and in the lives of the characters. In spite of spanning only twenty-five years, it has an epic feel. A lot happens. We first meet Norah and David Henry on the stormy night she gives birth to twins. The boy, Paul, is born healthy. The second, an unexpected daughter, is born with Down's Syndrome. While his wife lay unconscious, David, a doctor who presides over the deliveries because their doctor is unable to get to them due to the snowstorm, makes the decision to tell his wife the second child died. Trying to spare his wife the pain and suffering of having a child who, in his mind would surely die an early death, hands the baby to his nurse, Caroline Gill. He instructs her to take the child to an institution. Caroline finds she cannot leave the baby in this place, moves away and raises ""Phoebe"" on her own. This sets the stage for the terrible secret David must live with and the consequences it has on his family.It's called The Memory Keeper's Daughter because David takes up photography and becomes obsessed with the process. Diving into his hobby, which ultimately brings notoriety to him, he is able to take his mind off his secret, and yet at the same time, focus on the life his lost daughter leads away from him. Photography/snapshots/captured moments are the metaphor for this family and this beautifully written story. There is tremendous detail and one can feel the author using a variety of lenses to provide both wide-angle and tight, intimate views of each scene. Although at times I felt it to be a bit repetitive and wished it were shorter by 50-100 pages, I enjoyed the writing so much, along with the emotion it drew from me, that it didn't matter. I kept turning pages waiting to see how it would all play out. I wasn't disappointed.This book made me ask the question . . . ""what if?"" It also illustrated David's view of the world and Paul's discovery, that ""each person was an isolated universe. Dark trees in the heart, a fistful of bones."" Very well done.

The narrator: Martha Plimpton (I guess there is also a version narrated by someone else), did a phenomenal book. She brought this book to life in a fantastic way. 3 different accents AND two characters with down syndrome is impressive. These two separate families, each with a twin, are told in chronological order from before birth. The life difficulties and joys between them were sometimes heartbreaking and hard to listen to. A very great contemporary piece also deals a lot with the stigma of down syndrome and how people reacted to it, and the fights for equal rights for those deemed ""retarded"" or not worthy of a chance in life.

12,12122338,01/09/2008,1.0,"The book begins in 1964. A doctor delivers his own wife’s son, and to his own surprise, their son’s twin sister as well. From her physical features, the doctor recognizes the child has Down’s Syndrome and to protect his wife from the grief of having a child die early (common for Down’s children back then) since he and his own family had to deal with the death of his sister when she was young, the doctor hands the child over to his trusted nurse and instructs her to take the child to an institution nearby. The doctor then lies to his wife and tells her their daughter died at childbirth. Instead of delivering the child to the institution, however, the nurse instead runs off with the child to raise it as her own. The rest of the book’s plot hinges on these two fateful decisions: the doctor’s choice to give up his daughter and lie to his wife, and the nurse’s decision to raise the girl as normally as possible. Note to self: if a book’s author is a graduate of the Iowa Writer’s Workshop, put the book down and walk away. This book is as cliché as they come – not just in the plot and the characterizations, but also in the prose. The plot sets itself up for ongoing tension between the characters due to their past decisions, and then allows all of the characters to redeem themselves at the end. The characters are stereotypes: the noble doctor struggling with a past decision motivated by his past grief; the unsatisfied grieving mother who finds solace in other ways; the noble mother who raises a disabled child to prove that everyone deserves equality. It’s like the Iowa Writer’s Workshop deliberately teaches its students to dream up plots worthy of an Oprah’s Book Club Selection. My biggest grievance is that Edwards overwrites every scene. We understand that the characters all have made decisions they regret, and that their pasts inform their present and future actions. We actually don’t need the narrative to spell that out for us in EVERY SINGLE SCENE. We also understand symbolism: early on, there is a scene where the doctor’s wife destroys a wasp nest to prove to herself that she is capable and able to handle things herself without having the doctor protect her and control her – and yet the author has to point that out to the reader, that the wife felt capable and felt like she didn’t need to be protected any longer.

It was interesting to find myself feeling a great deal of compassion for someone who made a decision that I find absolutely appalling. Telling your wife that one of the twins has died, rather than telling her she had Down's syndrome is something I can never really condone, even in a fictional scenario. It's such a mind-boggling lie to tell anyone, let alone your spouse. Thankfully the story that formed around that lie was very compelling and I was able to enjoy it.I did enjoy the chapters where Norah grappled with her grief, struggled to deal with a marriage that no longer works. Her relationship with her sister was especially interesting.However, it was the parts that followed Caroline and Phoebe that really stood out to me. This book made me realise that I had never really given much thought to the determined parents who fought hard for the rights of their children who were born with Down's syndrome. Sadly, David Henry's reaction to his daughter, his decision that she should immediately sent to an institution, was the prevalent view at the time. I didn't know how little was known about Down's syndrome at the time, or that it was such a struggle to be taken seriously by doctors, schools etc. This was what really absorbed me and what I keep thinking about in the time since I have finished reading the book.“What would happen, they conjectured, if they simply went on assuming their children would do everything. Perhaps not quickly. Perhaps not by the book. But what if they simply erased those growth and development charts, with their precise, constricting points and curves? What if they kept their expectations but erased the time line? What harm could it do? Why not try?”",22,0.2406,0.114,0.777,0.109,0.5231428571428571,NEGATIVE,0.9983

[Contains spoilers!:] Her characters are very deep, but only in one dimension. Her two stories are so clearly divided between good and evil, it's unrealistic. The last 50 pages or so are so filled with action that it made me wonder if she got to a certain point and her editor told her she had to finish within a certain number of pages or time. At that same time, those pages are suddenly filled with inconsistencies (David clearly states he burnt all the letters, but somehow we're supposed to believe that he somehow missed some, b/c Paul and Norah find them later -- David was too meticulous for that), surprising coincidences (Caroline just happens to show up -- for NO apparent reason -- just as Norah is ""discovering"" about David chronicled little girl's lives), and events with no motivation (why did Caroline suddenly show up -- saying ""oh I'm glad I caught you"" (my words, not verbatim) when she finds out that Norah's just about to move -- it could have been tied to David's death, to Phoebe moving out or getting married, but instead we're given absolutely NO motivation). Not to mention that we're supposed to believe David died in his 50s from running. Running??? We were never given any reason to believe he had any medical problems, and if anything, the stress in his life had dissipated! Add on the fact that she brings up the same metaphor over and over again (get rid of that damn wall, already, we know it's there! You don't have to point it out!), it was all rather frustrating.The only saving grace was that so many members of my book club felt the same exact way.",18,-0.8652,0.12,0.773,0.107,0.5077482993197279,NEGATIVE,1.0

Reading some of the more negative reviews, I would have to disagree about the plot needing to be more exciting or the lack of depth in the characters. I believe that was the point of the novel entirely, we cannot label the doctor who gave away his child as ""bad"" because his troubled past was revealed and he was genuinely trying to do good, and it was clearly unfolding throughout the progression of the story that he began to regret his once-confident choice, but felt as though he had to remain stable and confident with his choices, which ended up making him a distant husband and individual. We cannot label his wife, Norah, as some sort of ""pissy alcaholic"", as she had been lied to about her childs death, then denied the right to grieve about it, followed by suddenly having a very distant husband. I believe some reading in between the lines was necessary to realize that these characters were going through emotional changes that were very realistic to real life and how the characters hardly even knew themselves, let alone were able to have very distinct and obvious personalities for the reader to fall in love with. Their growth and change over time was incredibly interesting to read about. The plot progressed slowly but in a satisfactory manner. There was constant stress and debate throughout the book from the doctor (David)'s side about whether or not he should reveal the truth to his wife, it was quite literally taking years off of his life. The novel would have appeared unrealistic if the characters somehow stumbled upon the downs syndrome baby on their own. The entire novel was believable, it had no ""cheesy"" or ""eye-roll"" moments like many chick-lit/adult fiction books often do. I liked this book far more than I intended to!

21,55327434,05/07/2009,5.0,"Wasn’t it just last night that I said I did not give out five stars easily? I have to do it for this book; yes, run out and read it as fast as you can, for this novel will give you whole new insights into the mysteries of life and love and grief. Most of the books I waste my time reading are plot-filled page-turners, in which the author has a tremendous story that pours out through the pages, and you get just a little comprehension of what makes the characters tick as they progress through the action, but in the end how well do we really know Mary Denunzio or Stephanie Plum or even Jack Ryan? Read this novel, however, and you really, really get to know Dr. David Henry McAllister; his wife, Nora; his son, Paul; his nurse, Caroline Gill – you come to know them because the book is told in the third person from their respective points of view, with the linear plot unfolding as you see the action sequentially through their biased eyes. There is very little real action in this novel, however, although it springs from a single impossible act. Taking his pregnant wife to the hospital to give birth, David finds that he cannot get to the hospital because of the raging snowstorm, so he takes her to his own little clinic where he and his nurse, who is secretly in love with him, deliver the baby, a perfectly healthy boy, and then find that there is a twin sister, who has unmistakable symptoms of Down’s Syndrome. Thinking to protect his beloved wife from the problems of having to live with this, he tells his nurse to take the baby girl to an institution, which was actually quite the common thing in those days, and he tells his wife that their baby daughter died at childbirth. From that point on, we simply see these people living their lives, irretrievably bound together by a secret that only a few of them know. Caroline instead takes the baby to another city and raises her as her own child, while Norah and Paul’s lives become poisoned by thinking about the daughter and sister they thought was lost, and David wanders into a hell of his own making as the members of his family become alienated, while at the same time we learn more about his past and come to an understanding of what drove him to do this.Kim Edwards is a marvelous story-teller. Time after time, as I read her biting description of what it is like to love and to lose that love, I said: “That’s my life she is writing.” She understands fully how we all get caught up in our own imaginings so that we cannot be open to the people we love, even when we see that very condition driving them away. One of her messages, surely, is that change is always with us, and we have to live with that change and understand it, even through our human nature forces us to try to contain it and to keep things the way they used to be. Nora gives David a camera as a gift, and he gradually becomes a famous photographer, but the results of his overwhelming concentration on his new hobby only further forces his family apart, while they all keep looking back to the early feelings and memories of their relationships and try to comprehend what has happened to make them drift apart. We see the same patterns repeating over and over, not only in David and Norah’s lives but also with Caroline and her husband, then with Paul and his lover.One of the things that Kim Edwards is astonishingly good at is compressing the story. There is sex in these peoples’ lives, but it all takes place off stage, between chapters or between paragraphs, because it is not important in this story -- in vivid contrast to the novel I wrote about last night, for which sex was the very basis of the book. Similarly, one of the main characters dies offstage, between chapters, as if the passing is merely a minor incident, only faintly related to the plot.I cried three times reading this book, so filled with emotion that at one point I had to put it down and go read something else. Today, however, I had to take my granddaughter to the dentist and then to her swimming class, and the book conveniently was rediscovered under a pile of papers while I was cleaning up my office last night, so it was ready to hand when I had time to spend on it … with the inevitable result that I again got all caught up in the story and came home from a social event this evening and had to sit down and finish it.

22,18727655,03/26/2008,4.0,"	Some moments in our lives are crossroads, moments where the course of our lives is shaped. Sometimes the deviation is minor, and sometimes it is life-altering. Such are the forces that form the first chapter of Kim Edwards’ novel, The Memory Keeper’s Daughter.	A dreadful snowstorm forces Dr. David Henry to deliver his first child, which to his surprise turns out to be twins. The first is a perfect son, ideal in all ways. But the second child has Down’s syndrome. In a moment that changed and defined the life of all five people in the room – the twins, the parents, and the nurse – Dr. Henry requests that his nurse take the girl to a home for the mentally retarded. Instead, she takes the child away and raises her as her own. The mother is told only that her daughter was stillborn.	Edwards traces the lives of the two families over the next twenty-five years. Dr. Henry sought to shelter his wife and son from grief, but his deep, dark secret winds up alienating him from his family, and the pain he caused may well exceed what they would have otherwise have suffered. His monumentous deception creates a wall upon which other lies are built. As he draws away from his wife, she draws away from him. Their deceptions impact their son, who begins erecting his own walls. 	Part of David’s withdrawl is accentuated by the gift of a camera that enables him to remove himself from his family’s life. Even when he is present for events and activities, he isolates himself behind the lens. Only years later does he come to realize that much of his life was spent in observation rather than active participation.	Meanwhile, as Caroline raises the unwanted child, her perspective completely changes. Instead of waiting to be loved, she learns to find fulfillment in loving. After several years, she recognizes that she was not a passive victim but an active accomplice in the deception. 	The Memory Keeper’s Daughter is a tale of deception and treachery, but it is also a story of walls and barriers. Over and over again, David had the opportunity and even the desire to confess and come clean, and yet he never does. Instead, he remains silent, and his silence is frequently misinterpreted, driving another wedge between himself and those he loves. Although few of us deceive to such magnitude, the story manages to illustrate the price of deception of all sizes. Edwards has managed to weave a convincing story of tragedy, fully drawing the reader into her tale.",15,0.3145,0.109,0.777,0.114,0.4815972222222223,NEGATIVE,0.6438

His son is beautiful and healthy, but the unexpected twin shows all the signs of Down Syndrome. At this point in history (1964), children with Down Syndrome didn't live long, were an embarrassment, and were frequently abandoned or sent to live their short lives in institutions. So David sends his loyal nurse Caroline to take the child to an appropriate facility and tells his wife that their daughter was born dead. Instead, Caroline takes the child to raise herself, and disappears. The story goes back and forth between David's family and his son Paul, and Caroline's adopted daughter Phoebe. This heartwrenching story has even more impact for those of us who were unaware of the history of the victims of Down Syndrome. I had no idea that they were abandoned so routinely, nor that if they were sick, medical professionals would hint that it would be better to not even try to save them. Caroline and other parents in the book fought hard to change these attitudes, exactly as the parents of Down Syndrome children did in real life, and this is WHY so many of us are shocked at finding out this history. We grew up watching Corky on Life Goes On, we never heard the term Mongaloid Idiot, attitudes towards the “differently abled” have changed enough for this book to be shocking. Another remarkable thing about this book is that David, while he does something that most of us would consider bad, we still feel great sympathy towards him. Many writers would have chosen the easy path of making him be just the villain, author Kim Edwards creates a character whose behavior is understandable (not condoned, but understandable) because of the times. The downside of this book is that it is depressing and unsatisfying. Ironically, David is one of the most sympathetic characters, while his wife and son are kind of annoying. He and his family seem to constantly make choices that we the readers can see are stupid. I also felt that a long of things weren't resolved in the story, so it's not a book that I will want to keep and reread.",13,-0.984,0.167,0.73,0.103,0.5818304626815265,NEGATIVE,0.9819

After their son is born, his wife gives birth to an unexpected twin- a daughter with Down's syndrome. The husband, in an attempt to spare his wife grief, tells the nurse to take the baby away to an institution. He means to tell his wife what he has done, but instead tells her the second baby died. And it goes from there.It is a very interesting and thought provoking book about the effects of a ""big bad"" secret in a family's life. Of not being allowed to grieve in an open and healthy manner, and this leading to grieving secretly and destructively. Of trying to escape grief leading to sorrow, while facing challenges leading to joy. And of how society's view of grief, of what is socially acceptable, and of Down's syndrome has shifted over the decades.The author wove many levels of detail and imagery into the book, which was a joy to read. I felt she also had an incredible depth of understanding of the emotions people feel in different experiences and times of their life, and what those emotions can motivate them to do. In particular, I really enjoyed how right on her descriptions were of a young grieving mother in a society that does not allow her to fully grieve. Kim Edwards had such tremendous compassion for the characters, that even when I didn't like what they were doing, I felt I understood why they were doing it and what they were trying to accomplish, and so I had to feel some compassion for them as well.

36,29234126,08/04/2008,1.0,"This book was terrible. I can't quite figure out why it's on the NYT best seller list. The story seemed promising: A doctor delivers his own twins during a freak spring snow storm in 1964. The first twin is born perfectly healthy, the second has Down's syndrome. In a split second decision, the doctor sends the baby away and tells his wife that she died at birth. Sounds like the making of a good story. Unfortunately, the book was boring, with nothing much happening in the vast majority of it. Compound boringness with a main character who isn't at all sympathetic (he gave away his own daughter after all) and you have a deadly combination. I kept reading, however, because I wanted to see how the author resolved this dilemma.SPOILER ALERT!The resolution was completely frustrating for me. After 24 years, the woman who raised the twin with Down's syndrome suddenly shows up at the mother's house to tell her that her daughter is really alive. There is no explanation as to why -- after hiding the daughter for more than two decades and refusing to answer the doctor's request to meet his daughter -- she finally steps forward. No reason is given.Then there is the matter of a pregnant teenage girl who shows up in the doctor's life and becomes sort of a replacement for the ""lost"" daughter. When the doctor dies suddenly, the girl is never mentioned again. I found it frustrating because she becomes an important character in the story, but you never learn how she reacts to his death.Finally, the mother who pines for her ""dead"" daughter for 24 years and battles through depression and a failed marriage, finds out about this ultimate betrayal and instead of trying to bridge the lost years to get to know her daughter, gets remarried and moves to France. How plausible is that??? The defining moment in her life is that she never knew the daughter she lost in childbirth, and when she is given this miraculous gift, she continues on with her life as planned??? Oh wait, the Down's syndrome girl is going to visit her in France. Oh, well that solves everything! (Note the heavy sarcasm here.) I just didn't believe it. With 300 pages of nothing much happening, I would have liked more than 20 pages dedicated to the reunion of a daughter, whose loss tore a family apart.One final petty note: In about five instances, the author compares various objects to ""dust motes.""

I could have enjoyed the books theme of how secrets destroy relationships and how everyone has secrets, but it had to branch out and become a women's lib story and a rights of the disabled story - I was waiting for the cancer victims story and surprised it didn't surface. This author does not have the experience or excellence to tackle all those topics well. The book begins with the birth of twins. THe father is an MD and a snowstorm puts him in a situation of delivering his own children. One child is fine, the other he diagnoses immediately as having Downs (I think it harder to diagnose than was presented). He immediately decides to get rid of the Down's child by telling the nurse to take it to an insitution. His rationale is that he is protecting his wife who is a perfectionist. I was touched by the theme of giving away the baby and keeping it secret - if he had just stayed with this theme. THere were a number of the scenes about loss that were well done. I felt that the author must have first hand knowledge of Down's children and also of loss. I also liked the portrayal of the sister sister bond - so different but still so in sync.

There is also much that verges on hokey - the main character it turns out ""lost"" his last name in a mix up while applying for college. Overall, skip this book.

A doctor (David) delivers his own child in a snowstorm only to discover that his wife (Norah) had twins. Hooray, right? Nope...the boy was born as healthy as all new parents hope their children to be. The girl, however, was born with Down's Syndrome. Thinking he was making the best choice for his family, he asks his nurse to take the baby to an institution. The nurse agrees, but then keeps the child to raise on her own. Great! Dr. and the Mrs. have their son, the nurse has a daughter (which she always wanted) and no scary institution for the poor baby. Wrong! David told his wife the child died, which Norah can never get over. Instead, she turns into a bad cliche...a cheat with a liquor problem. David tries to do his best, but the guilt of his secret keeps getting in the way. Oh, and their son is such an angst-ridden (and annoying) teen that he'd put these modern-day kids to shame! What happens to the nurse? Why, she lives (almost) happily-ever-after. Her daughter does well, living a life her true father never thought possible.

Norah now lives with the lie from her husband, that her daughter had past away at birth.	The Memory Keeper’s Daughter by Kim Edwards, is a page-turning novel, that raises the importance of certain subjects of life regarding; relationships, family values and illness. As Norah and David move on with their lives, they both face the consequences of the on-going lie they live with. The book integrates the effect of the loss of Phoebe into their everyday lives and raising a teenage boy. A family’s normal hardships are intensified. Edwards also displayed through the book, the distinct life of Caroline and Phoebe. Through raising a child with a disability in the 60s and how the views of people have changed since then.

48,23513101,06/02/2008,4.0,"This was a fairly emotional read, and I found myself sympathising with the characters at some points, and hating them at others. I think the only character I actually liked the whole way through was Al. The other characters ranged from not liking them at all (Paul), to mostly sympathising, but not completely (Caroline).I think the way that children with Down's Syndrome were treated in 1964 was scandalous. I was appalled at how they were automatically thought less of and sent to an institution. I grew up in the same class as a boy with Down's Syndrome, and although he was slower than the rest of us at learning (he'd been held back a year at school) he was one of the nicest people you could meet. I therefore found they way Phoebe was treated quite upsetting. I think that the writer did a very good job of putting across just how difficult it was to fight for the rights of a child with Down's Syndrome in those days.I tried hard to like David, I really did, but after telling his wife initially that their daughter had died, he had lots of opportunities to come clean and redeem himself but he never did. I just couldn't forgive him for that.I loved the descriptive style of the author's writing. I could imagine everything down to the smallest details and almost felt like I was there. Usually I'm not a fan of this much description, however I felt it worked really well in this book.The characterisation in the book was wonderful. Whilst I may not have sympathised or liked all of the characters, they were all built up really well, so that you could at least understand them and their motives. They were by no means flat - in fact quite the opposite. David especially is a very complex character, who is constantly evolving throughout the book.I liked how the story followed both sides separately... I felt that the interjection of Caroline and Phoebe's story gave a happier tone to an otherwise fairly depressing depiction of the Henry's journey. I felt that the story was a fair assessment of what the consequences of such a huge lie can mean to all of the people involved.I enjoyed this book, and couldn't put it down, although I did feel that some of it was a little too coincidental and parts didn't make sense.

I did however notice that I didn't have the kind of connection I normally have with the characters and the book (does that make sense?)  (let's see if I can remember all I wrote).... When David gives Phoebe to Caroline, I felt bad for Caroline because it should not have been her place to give Phoebe away. I also felt bad for Norah, who didn't even know she was having twins. I think David should not have mentioned Phoebe to Norah at all, since he said he wanted to protect her (not that I condone that). Later in the book, when we found out that David had a sister with Down's Syndrome, it made me question why he wanted to give Phoebe away in the first place; she was described in such high regard. One would think as a doctor he would have this secret desire to help Phoebe like he never could help June.  When they go on vacation, and we meet Howard, I got pissed at Norah. I know she had a secret desire to be like her rebellious sister, but to cheat on your husband so openly is not the way to go about filling the void she had (openly by leaving her clothes on the beach and having sex under an open widow). I have never lost a child, but I felt like once she found out Phoebe ""had died"" she shoud have gone to David for support, not pushed him away. I also didn't grow up during the 60s, so I cant say she should have seeked counseling, since it was described in a sort of negative connotation in the book. Don't get me wrong, I am not blaming her totally for the demise of her marriage, I just feel like she should have connected more with the man she chose to marry.  When she decided to get the job at the travel agency, I was happy for her. I think it did help her grow in to the woman she eventually became and made her a stronger, more independant woman.  The introduction of Rosemary was sort of odd; I feel like this part could have been deleted from the book all together. I do feel that she was the most stable character throughout the whole book, though. I also found it odd that David would confide in a 16 year old girl and share his secrets of the past, just because she was living in his parents' old house. I guess the author(Kim Edwards) was trying to find away for him to have a sort of meltdown and let it all out. I respect Rosemary in the sense that she listened to everything he had to say and she did not judge him, nor did she tell his secrets. (on a side note, I honestly thought her and Paul were gonna end up together).  I wonder if things would have ended differently if David had eventually told Norah about Phoebe instead of finding out from Caroline. I think it would have been too late in their relationship to change anything, but at least he would have that 1000 lb sand bag off his chest. I also feel like Norah would never be able to forgive David.  I sort of don't like the way the book ended abruptly, but I was happy to see that Paul was getting to know his sister. That made me happy that he got a sort of a closure from meeting the twin he never knew.  Overall, I rate this book as average. I might suggest this book to someone else.

54,30143456,08/14/2008,4.0,"For her first novel (although Kim Edwards was not new to the literary scene), Edwards deserves high praise for her ability to create characters that are complex, sympathetic, and believable.The Memory Keeper’s Daughter begins in 1964. David Henry, an orthopedic surgeon, is forced to deliver his wife Norah’s baby with the assistance of his nurse Carolyn because a blizzard has prevented David from making it to the office. But it turns out that Norah is carrying twins. Paul, healthy, enters the world first. When Phoebe follows, David immediately realizes that she has Down’s syndrome. Not only is it 1964 when many Down syndrome babies were institutionalized, but David’s sister died when she was twelve, of a heart defect. His mother never recovered, and David has never told anyone about this part of his past. To save Norah heartache, David decides to tell his wife that the twin girl died. He asks Carolyn to take the baby to an institution. A split-second decision by David; and Carolyn’s subsequent decision to run away, to raise the child herself, sets the chain of events that spans the next quarter of a century. The novel alternates between the experiences of both families, and the effect David’s decision has on all their lives. The Memory Keeper refers to the camera Norah buys for David for their anniversary, and the daughter, of course, is Phoebe. Norah’s gift is an attempt to dispel stress, to give David a hobby, but it backfires. David becomes obsessed with photography. The tension in the Henry household grows as the years pass by, until David and Norah grow apart. Meanwhile, Paul seethes with anger he doesn’t really understand, believing it stems from father’s disapproval of his wish to make music his career. Meanwhile Carolyn struggles to give Phoebe the opportunity to become a successful, happy member of society. She wages a tremendous fight against the societal prejudices of the day.That Kim Edwards chose to structure the novel – 1964; 1965; 1970; 1977; 1982; 1988; and finally, 1989 – meant that, especially during the middle, she didn’t focus on the precise details of daily life as she did in the beginning and end sections. Perhaps it was just me, but I felt disconcerted when I turned pages, discovering that such a large gap in time had occurred, in particular, from 1977 through to 1988. One of Edward’s strengths, though, (and I’m sure I’m not alone in feeling this), is that she characterized David in such a way, that I felt empathy for him, despite his deception, despite the distance he placed between his wife, his son, and the daughter he gave away. I felt that his struggle to live with himself was akin to suffering from an internal hemorrhage of the heart, over and over again. As a doctor, “Do no harm”, is embedded in his character; and he meant well when he did, indeed, do harm to those he truly loved. I thought he deserved forgiveness. Other readers may disagree. This story begins with a decision made by a man with many secrets. His decision becomes the catalyst to move the characters through feelings of loss, regret, love, hope – and redemption. It is a deeply emotional, powerfully written novel, one I hadn’t been sure I’d be able to get into at the start, but that by the end I had embraced.",5,0.9539,0.102,0.764,0.135,0.5233017247302962,POSITIVE,0.9539

No character seemed to have an individual voice. Especially not Phoebe. And isn't she the title character? I felt that perhaps the author was interested in this idea of the rejected Down Syndrome child, but had absolutely no idea how to write such a character in a compelling way. Phoebe never has a three-dimensional personality, she's always just a delightful childlike person.

At some point in this long life, I'm going to realise that being popular doesn't mean that a book is good. The Memory Keeper's Daughter just isn't very good, and at nearly 400 pages, it was with great impatience that I slogged through its overblown prose and inane plot. There will be spoilers ahead as I get specific.The book begins with a sweet romance: love at first sight and a whirlwind courtship, within a year of meeting, David and Norah are married and expecting their first child. When Norah goes into labour during a freak snowstorm that prevents them from reaching the hospital, David, an orthopedic surgeon, is forced to deliver the baby himself at his clinic, with only the help of his nurse, Caroline. A beautiful boy, Paul, is delivered without incident, but then unexpectedly, another baby is coming: a baby girl who displays all the signs of Down's Syndrome. As this is 1964, standard procedure at the time was for such babies to be sent off to institutions to live out their short and pointless lives, and as David wanted to spare his wife the pain of watching their daughter eventually die, he sends the baby off with Caroline. When Norah comes around from her anesthetic, David tells her that there had been a second baby, but that she had been stillborn. What David doesn't know is that once Caroline arrived at the bleak institution and appraised its facilities, she decided to keep the little girl and raise her by herself in another city. This opening was intriguing and well written, but it's all downhill from here.Much later in the book, when musing on his secret West Virginia upbringing, David thinks:There was in the mountains, and perhaps in the world at large, a theory of compensation that held that for everything given something else was immediately and visibly taken away. Well, you've got the looks even if your cousin did get the smarts.  Compliments, seductive as flowers, thorny with their opposites: Yes, you may be smart but you sure are ugly; You may look nice but you didn't get a brain. Compensation; balance in the universe.The book is told from four alternating points of view, and I think that this idea of yin-yang/balance/twinning was the central theme that author Kim Edwards was trying to explore, but it all just became so heavy-handed, repeated in all the different voices. David's younger sister died of a heart defect as a child, so he feared his daughter, Phoebe, would have the heart problems associated with Down's Syndrome – but where one died, the other lives; thrives even. David is disappointed that Paul, with his height and natural athleticism, won't play basketball, but as Phoebe grows, she loves shooting hoops on her driveway (and this fact is explored, over and over). Norah – who allowed herself to get tied down as a housewife – has a younger sister, Bree, who gets to live out all the Baby Boomer stereotypes (war protesting, free love, and eventually, Bree embraces the greed-is-good 80s). David and Caroline – the only two who share the secret that Phoebe lives – both have spouses who travel and are often away, but only one of the wandering spouses is unfaithful. And over and over, characters become aware of the interconnectedness of life, Norah through motherhood:Slowly, slowly, as Paul nursed, as the light faded, she grew calm, became again that wide tranquil river, accepting the world and carrying it easily on its currents. Outside, the grass was growing slowly and silently; the egg sacs of spiders were bursting open; the wings of birds were pulsing in flight. This is sacred, she found herself thinking, connected through the child in her arms and the child in the earth to everything that lived and ever had.David, through his unlikely transformation into a critically acclaimed photographer (“Memory Keeper” was the brand name of his first camera):
I'm doing a whole perception series, images of the body that look like something else. Sometimes I think the entire world is contained within each living person.
And Paul through his classical guitar playing:
Music is like you touch the pulse of the world. Music is always happening, and sometimes you get to touch it for a while, and when you do you know that everything's connected to everything else.
And if the repetition of these big themes isn't annoying enough, small details are repeated and repeated: everyone has secrets and a yearning for freedom that builds “stone walls” between them; being upset makes people think they have a stone in their throats (and all of these stone metaphors, along with David and Paul collecting rocks and fossils together, probably has something to do with David's sense of shame over his father's dirt poor existence as a crook-backed miner); all babies have hands like starfish; everyone's shoulder blades are “delicate and sharp, like wings”; there are numerous wasps and trains and broken bones; and repeatedly musical notes are thought to become visible as they float through the air.And then there are logical problems, like when Norah thinks, Had she been alone, even once, since Paul was born? But just a few pages earlier, Norah mused, Twice in the last month alone she'd hired a babysitter for Paul and left the house. That doesn't count as being alone? Or, would it really be possible for David to change his name based on a typo on his college admission forms (and become a doctor under the wrong name? Become married?) I didn't keep track of more of these inconsistencies, but they're in there. There are also countless, pointless mini-melodramas: a flirtation with alcoholism that goes nowhere; a fear of teenaged pregnancy that goes nowhere; a cancer scare that adds up to nothing; infidelity that's shrugged off. Most bizarrely is the late addition of a new character – a pregnant teenaged runaway that David wants to rescue – who adds absolutely nothing to the story but makes me want to insist: Can we never again have a character named “Rosemary” in a book with “memory” in the title? Pretty please you wacky Iowa Writer's Group authors?In an afterword, Edwards states that the genesis of this book was a story that was told to her about a man who didn't realise that he had had a twin with Down's Syndrome until long after the twin had died in an institution. That would be an interesting story to explore, but so was what she did set up: how does a family get over the loss of a baby, especially when one of the parents knows that the baby never died? That is interesting, but it's not what Edwards wrote. In The Memory Keeper's Daughter, no one ever gets over anything, no one ever talks to each other, and it's frustrating to watch these unlikeable characters stewing in their own misery. Caroline is likeable as she fights the school board and the community to accept Phoebe, and I did appreciate some of what Caroline had to go through. But would a nurse in the 1970s, seeing that Phoebe was having a lethal allergic reaction, really turn to her panicking mother and say, “Are you sure you want me to get the doctor?” (Which has an echo later when it's revealed that David's family once overheard a grief-stricken mother say that God should have taken his sickly sister instead of her own healthy son. All the parallels, yeesh.) And speaking of unlikely prejudice, would Paul (who is supposed to be just a few years older than I am) repeatedly refer to Phoebe as “retarded” once he learns about her? This was in 1989, and I know I wouldn't have used that word then. Phoebe's journey could have been much more interesting if she wasn't just a cardboard bit player; not just there so that Paul can realise that he, who had every advantage, wasn't nearly as happy as his twin, who had to struggle for everything (and I think I've seen that movie and it was called Rain Man).On top of all of that unexceptional plot, I just didn't like the writing. 
For an instant, before the others turned, before Howard raised the bottle of wine and slid it into her hands, their eyes met. It was a moment real to only the two of them, something that could not be proven later, an instant of communion subject to whatever the future would impose. But it was real: the darkness of his eyes, his face and hers opening in pleasure and promise, the world crashing around them like the surf.
But...The Memory Keeper's Daughter is certainly a popular book, and if you like any of these quotes, you might like the whole thing. 'Twas not for me.",4,0.9935,0.084,0.797,0.12,0.5259534632034631,NEGATIVE,0.9832
61,38636320,11/25/2008,1.0,"Admittedly a compelling read, but I rated it 1 star because I think it was over-written and I didn't like it. It didn't make me feel good. I finished because I did want to know what happened, but I probably should have set it aside and continued on with something more edifying. However, sometimes even reading a book you dislike makes you think. Here are a few comments if you care to read them. Beware, it’s a total spoiler. And you have to know, I hope you don’t feel I’m being “judgmental.” They are, after all, fictional characters. The real problem between me and this book is great sadness if this is really how the world is outside the bounds of the happy little life I live. I’m also concerned with combating some of the false philosophy this book proclaims. I don’t know if I’ll do a very good job of it, but I’ll try. Also, I’m sure some of these comments could cause offense to some. I apologize ahead of time. I wrote this with myself as the audience, just as an exercise in articulation. I know it didn’t turn out particularly well, but I just wanted to be clear about that so none of my potential readers feels specially selected as my audience. First, about the book being what I called ""over-written."" I felt the author was trying to hard to make her prose as beautiful as poetry and it showed (her trying, and not succeeding, imho). This made sense to me when I read the interview in the back and she said she loved Ursula Hegi. And, boy, she sure liked the word ""delicate."" I don't think I've ever read that word so many times in a row. Delicate lettuce. Delicate bones under the delicate skin. Delicate wrists. And so on. I’m NOT saying I could have done better, I’m just saying that not many writers in experience have really succeeded in turning prose into poetry and making that work in a novel setting. While I appreciated (greatly) that the author wasn't explicit, I felt that sex was all but the main theme and almost all of her description (of everything) had a sexual quality (maybe I just have a dirty mind, you think?). So, while there was ample physicality and sexual tension between the characters—there was not one instance of a healthy, emotionally intimate relationship—not between spouses, parents and children, or siblings. Not even Caroline and Al, though they were the closest thing to it. What sadness! This is just a book about grief, shame, distrust, and self-doubt. One of the greatest tragedies of modern society (I think) is that physical and emotional intimacy have been so successfully divorced. And then people wonder why they aren't ""fulfilled"" or ""happy."" John Taylor Gatto says this is a product of public school and television. Here is the exact quote taken from his acceptance speech given on the occasion being named “New York State Teacher of the Year,” 1991.“The children I teach are uneasy with intimacy or candor. My guess is that they are like many adopted people I've known in this respect –they cannot deal with genuine intimacy because of a lifelong habit of preserving a secret inner self inside a larger outer personality made up of artificial bits and pieces of behavior borrowed from television or acquired to manipulate teachers. Because they are not who they represent themselves to be the disguise wears thin in the presence of intimacy so intimate relationships have to be avoided.”Take that for what you think it's worth. :) But I don’t see that physical intimacy without love is producing anything good in the world. These unhappy characters not only lacked emotional intimacy, but they lacked any type of moral compass. Perhaps the reason they couldn’t be emotionally intimate was because of this lack of moral compass. I don’t exactly know. I do know that Norah grieves her entire lifetime for her “lost” daughter—something that can fortunately be solved for some by the gospel. David is guilt ridden and lives in a self-inflicted, walled-off way from his family his entire life because he never found out how repentance and the Atonement works. Paul lives a life without any true happiness or joy in his home and never feels the love of his parents that could have been and should be a mirror showing what the love of our Heavenly Father is. Caroline can’t ever be truly happy and content because she knows she can’t put her trust totally in the arm of the flesh, but she doesn’t know what else there is to trust. Phoebe, the innocent, is the only character that ever experiences anything like joy or peace. Is that an inadvertent comment on how the author feels about the “feeble-minded?” Only Phoebe could be happy because she didn’t know better? I found the character of David an interesting case study. I think he really was a good man shackled by guilt and remorse and shame and fear. I felt so bad that his one bad choice led to so much grief for all involved. How could he have thought the tortured life they were living was better than what would happen if he told? However, the fact that the author seemed to imply that David’s choice affected/caused everyone else’s problems is troubling. Perhaps he did set in motion the effects of his bad choice, but the idea that he caused all the misery surely left out the most important notion of personal responsibility and accountability. Norah, Paul and Caroline were not forced into their actions by David’s, no matter how much they felt that way—and there’s that darn moral compass problem again. I didn’t especially appreciate the feminist doctrine. Fidelity was pretty passé. Bree’s life was so glamorous and free. Fulfillment came in a career, not a family. Norah only became a whole, confident, and “useful” person after she did something “herself”—forged a career, built a business, became a jet-setter. I find this is the most convenient place to put my most un-favorite quote: Norah is watching an older couple maneuver Paris together… “Norah felt a pang at this intimacy. Once she had imagined herself and David moving into such an old age, their histories woven together like vines, tendril around shoot, leaves meshed. Oh, she’d been so old-fashioned; even her regret was old fashioned. She had imagined that, married, she would be some sort of lovely bud, wrapped in the tougher, resilient calyx of the flower. Wrapped and protected, the layers of her own life contained within another’s.	“But instead she had found her own way, building a business, raising Paul, traveling the world. She was petal, calyx, stem, and leaf; she was the long white root running deep into the earth. AND SHE WAS GLAD.” (Caps added for emphasis)So, let’s leave aside the leaf metaphor (ha ha) and tackle this little bit of work. Being happily married to one person for life is old-fashioned. Even aspiring to be happily married to one person for life is old-fashioned. Expecting to live a full and happy life married to one person is old-fashioned. Needing the love and protection of that person is old-fashioned. The NEW way, the BETTER way is to do it all on your own. Did you notice the order of the insteads in the quote? Building a business came before raising a child. At least raising the child came before traveling the world. Then, the kicker: AND SHE WAS GLAD. Yep. That’s right. She’s glad. Because it made her tough. It made her do it all herself. What a good life. Wow. Sorry, I really disliked this book even more than I thought. It is so sad in so many ways and, for me, probably not in the way the author intended. Seriously, is this the way the world is? Thanks be to the Lord, not at my house.

When David sent Phoebe away he thought he was doing the right thing, saving his family from heart ache. Years pass and that split second decision caused a ripple in his family’s life and in Caroline’s that would just keep building in intensity. So many other secrets develop in the book in response to David’s decision. As the characters learn throughout the book the truth will eventually come out in one way or another.At times this book was a little too detailed to the point where it was hard to read and stay interested. I love how clever the title is and how it connects into the storyline.I’d probably recommend this book to anyone that likes to understand the whole story.

64,130981155,11/15/2010,1.0,"When I explained the premise of ""The Memory Keeper's Daughter"" to my wife, she replied ""...depressing...sounds right up your alley, honey."" To wit, it does sound somewhat depressing (and the cover blurbs probably drew me to it): A doctor, on a cold night in Kentucky, delivers his wife's baby, a healthy boy; after that, in a painful, post-partum delirium, the mother unknowingly squeezes out a Down Syndrome girl. The doctor spirits the girl away via the nurse in charge to a sanitarium, but the doctor tells his wife that the girl was stillborn and died at birth. In reality, the nurse runs away to Pittsburgh and raises the girl on her own.Okay, strong premise. (Depressing, perhaps, but more importantly, I was curious where the author was going to go with it). And that's where the story unravels into a sea of moribund phrasing, less-than subtle foreshadowing, sledgehammer-over-the-head symbolism and character sketches as one-dimensional as the doctor's photos from his ""Memory Keeper"" (a camera, that for some bizarre reason, the doctor takes up as a hobby in lieu of the ""grief"" experienced from withholding the big secret from his wife). Roughly 300 pages of leaden narrative and insufficiently-explained peccadilloes (mostly the wife's dalliances) ensue from the doctor's harboring this big secret. At no time did Ms. Edwards really give me an opportunity to feel ANYTHING for her protagonists: not anger at the father for giving away the little girl (or dissuading the male twin from a musical avocation); not annoyance with (or pity for) the wife for getting drunk and driving for hours (often with her son in the back seat) ""just because"", engaging in extra-marital affairs because of some vague feeling she had that her husband wasn't entirely there for her; not satisfaction in the nurse overcoming all obstacles and raising a Down Syndrome child that wasn't even hers in a world where few concessions were made for special needs children. Why didn't I feel anything? In retrospect, I certainly should've felt something, and didn't.The whole time I was reading this I was thinking that the novel really needed someone else to tell the story...perhaps a Joyce Carol Oates, or someone else that that has mastered the genre of dour, cerebral topics like the ones Ms. Edwards broached. However I keep gravitating toward one sequence that really summed up my frustration with this novel:After the doctor's death, the mother tries to console her son (not that he was really grieving, but anyway) (and sorry for the out-of-context quote, but it's as just as Hallmark-Movie-of-the-Week-sounding IN context): ""But Paul, you mattered to him. Look, I know what you're saying, because I felt it too. That distance. That reserve. That sense of a wall too high to get over. After a while I gave up trying, and after a longer while I gave up waiting for a door to appear in it. But behind that wall, he loved us both. I don't know how I know that, but I do"".Ms. Edwards, if your characters don't know why, we the readers sure as hell don't either. (And, in all likelihood, probably don't care anyway).

65,14832539,02/07/2008,3.0,"I'm torn on this book. I gave it three stars because I couldn't give it 2 1/2. I loved the premise of the book. In the mid 1960's a doctor, David Henry, delivers his own baby on a very snowy night. He gets a surprise when one baby turns into twins, a boy and a girl. Except for the girl has Downs syndrome and in a swift decision, he hands the baby off to the nurse to take the baby to a home for ""those types of babies."" David's sister died at a very young age and it tore his mother apart. In 1960 the prognosis for a child with Downs was very grim and unknown so David thought he would spare his wife the pain he saw his mother go through and tell her the baby had died.The thing is, the nurse brought the child to the home but after seeing the conditions decided she couldn't leave the baby there. The nurse fled the city, moved elsewhere and raised the child as her own.The book shows each twin growing up and how that secret shapes everyone's lives.The premise is great which is why I picked up the book and the writer really has a knack for human emotion. You can really feel what those people are feeling and it tugs are your heart. She has a way of exposing basic human needs and making the reader really feel them.I was torn on my feelings for Norah. A part of me felt for her and you have to keep in mind, it was the 60's and 70's. The relationship between husband and wife was different and Norah had an obvious case of depression but I'm sure that subject and going to a shrink were a little taboo back then. But a part of me felt like she was blaming David for their problems in their marriage when she didn't shoulder any of the blame.However, the writer of this book went into details that didn't REALLY need to be there. It was a long book that could've been much shorter due to omiting unnecesary details that were neither here nor there. I found myself skipping over much of those details because instead of getting me into the setting and story, it really just bored me and I wanted her to get back to the story and not how the butterflies danced in the golden wheat and blah blah blah. Some is nice but it seemed that the book was half plot, half unnecessary details.I also HATED the way the book ended. Not just the very end but the last 50 pages or so weren't great either. I felt things were inconsistent with characters personalities. When Caroline shows up to tell Norah about Phoebe, why would she do that...out of the blue? And why a whole year after David died? We learn of the inheritance Phoebe receives but what happened to Paul's? We never hear of it. I did like how Paul and Phoebe started to have a relationship which was nice but it felt like Norah and Phoebe's relationship was weird. Norah was trying to force a relationship and didn't acknowledge/care/understand that Phoebe just doesn't get that Norah is her biological mother and Caroline is the one who raised her. Norah seems to think they'll explain it and then everything will be okay. ",4,-0.6789,0.082,0.844,0.074,0.454470284237726,NEGATIVE,0.9996

67,18493971,03/24/2008,2.0,"So...starting the book I didn't really know what to think as I'd heard mixed reviews. One of my best friends, whom I trust immensely when it comes to books felt apprehensive about the novel, not liking it and not knowing why. My fellow teachers, who can be quite unpredictable when it comes to loving and hating novels, raved about it. And now I, too, feel ambivalent, much like I felt when reading THE KITE RUNNER, much like I felt with ATONEMENT. So now I question myself--wonder, ""am I just getting old and desirous of some cheesy artificial happiness in my novels?"" And I know, and you do too if you know me, that that's certainly not the case. I will say I believe that the WRITING in this novel in no way rivals that of the other two works I mentioned. Though it has its moments of beauty, describing the detail with which a man looks through the lens of his camera and sees beauty in the completely unexpected, describing the longing in the human heart upon seeing another for who she is but still being completely unable to reach her in that place, the writing was also (and quite often) forced and fake and redundant. I also wanted a moment of redemption for the characters that seemingly never came, and the book's ultimate theme seemed to be that life is difficult, true communion with another impossible, and that maturity means finally accepting the truth of those ideas. That, I didn't like. I'm tired of reading novels of hopelessness whose lingering hope at the end isn't exactly hope at all. I'm tired of being asked to accept that the only hope in life is a smile on the face of a silent, broken child, the creation of a fantastical perfect life for two lovers severed by a tragic and selfish mistake never truly atoned for, and now the possibility of relationship with a lost sibling without ever knowing what real relationship actually is. Ah...isn't this the human life, though? Maybe I am too hard on these novels. Maybe I am just asking from them what I always grow weary of asking from my students: a simple grasp of reality, of responsibility, when confronting life's suffering and failures. Maybe I'm still hoping that the world we live in will once again embrace the true possibilities of redemption rather than finding it in moments of quasi-truth. And once again, I confront the paradox of my life--I am both idealist and realist, trapped and always conflicting, and never really certain which way to lean.",4,0.9165,0.148,0.67,0.182,0.550378787878788,NEGATIVE,0.9984

The book got much better, though. I thought the author have an interesting story concept--a man gives away his daughter with Down Syndrome and tells his wife the baby died, while the baby's twin brother lives as an only child--but it wasn't really a traditional story per se, with plot driving the book; instead, it was a couple of events--the birth and the eventual reunion (not a spoiler, you know it has to happen)--separated by character development. That's not bad--I felt intensely towards the characters (resentment and pity for dad, sadness for the son, anger for the mother, admiration for Caroline, the woman who raises the girl) and actually wept in a good way at the end. I also liked the author's attention to detail--very symbolic. The father's amber cuff links, for example, signify how he wanted to preserve things around him, not noticing that they may have appeared nice but were, in reality, dead. In my opinion, many authors don't put a lot of thought into the kind of detail they include and how it affects the mood or reflects the story, and the author here did a nice job. She was especially good at writing the ends of the chapters, which were fabulous. That sounds dumb, but Edwards may be up there with Ernest Gaines and John Steinbeck with symbolic, emotionally-charged endings that conclude and don't wimp out.I honestly think the author could have reduced some of the internal emotional wranglings that filled much of the book.

A man who dearly loves his wife and takes his job of protecting her seriously. So when faced with this crises, his personal experience, his professional background and the social norms of the day all contributed to the decision. This was the story of one lie which lead to secrets, guilt and an insurmountable burden of regrets, all of which tarnished and eventually eroded what had been a loving relationship. Spanning the quarter century from 1964 to 1989 the story followed the lives of two families caught up in the decision. This was not a happily ever after kind of story and yet it ultimately ended on a note of hope, in the potential for an improved future, of a belated understanding about so much that had gone before, and an attempt at forgiveness for the lost years that had resulted.I was swept along by the writing, the honesty of the story, the believablity of the characters, and simply wasn't ready for the story to end.

I loved the way the author captured the world view of a teenage boy, among other things. The way that a secret destroyed a marriage was definitely realistic.However, I had several issues. One was that I felt the author lacked discipline, in that she could have cut at least 50 or 60 pages and not have lost anything. (It runs to 400 pages, pretty long for a novel of this type.) I became impatient with David, the main character, a doctor and father of the twins, for getting so close to doing the right thing, time after time, and chickening out. Similarly, another female character ran away from her chance to confront destiny, for no obvious reason.Also, the author introduced three new characters about 60% of the way through. They did not really add to the ethical discussion, unfortunately. Yes, they were interesting characters. But I wondered if the author just liked them so much that she left them in, rather than trimming for elegance.The author did wonderful research, and her prose flows nicely.

82,664412781,07/10/2013,4.0,"This was the story about one man's decision to 'get rid of' one of his twins because of she had Down's Syndrome and the life-long ramifications of this decision for him and his family. It was set in the middle 1960's which is important to keep in mind when trying to understand the motivation behind this decision. I would assume that the medical and educational helps we have access to today wouldn't necessarily have been available then so in one sense this man's decision could be seen as perfectly logical.Having said the above, (view spoiler)[I did feel that David, as good as his intentions may have seemed to him at the time, was being highly insensitive to take upon himself, without discussion with his wife, the decision to 'get rid of' Phoebe as if someone had made him God. The thing that really irked me about him was how he never included his wife in deciding what to do. Phoebe was not just his child but also Norah's and as such she had the right to be included in any, and all, decision making. As a result of David's lies (telling Norah that Phoebe was dead) was that he built a huge wedge between him and Norah which naturally affected their marital relationship (which he acknowledged many, many years later). Norah became distant from him, in part because he was caring around so much unnecessary guilt, but also because a part of her hadn't been able to really accept that Phoebe was dead, which of course she wasn't. Essentially one person's lies in this relationship slowly ate away at it leading to a very dysfunctional and unhealthy existence between the two.I really admired Caroline for taking on the challenge of raising Phoebe like she did. I also admire her for seeing beyond the disability to the child underneath. This makes a massive difference to how someone responds to another human being. In the end, after David's death, Caroline was the one who had to break to Norah that her daughter was in fact very much alive and doing really well for herself. This was a credit to Caroline for believing that Phoebe had a right to some sort of existence and to be treated as much as possible as a normal human being. This she did with great aplomb and with a determination that allowed her to fight for both a better education for people like Phoebe and better medical care as well. (hide spoiler)]This book provides the reader with an excellent snapshot into the consequences of not only lying, but lying within an otherwise healthy relationship and how this affects the relationship. It also speaks to those who have children with a disability about the importance of fighting for that child's rights because they're human beings that deserve the best that can be provided. But I also believe there's another level that this book speaks to: the importance of not being rushed to grieve and get it over with. This latter level, in today's extremely busy society where everything needs to be done yesterday almost, there has never been a more important message to get out there. Grieving can not, and should not, be rushed. People grieve in different ways and at different times and this needs to not only be accepted, but also to be acknowledged.",3,0.9937,0.077,0.766,0.156,0.4877330447330448,POSITIVE,0.8068
83,180219397,06/27/2011,3.0,"The book opens on a fateful winter night in 1964 when Dr. David Henry, a happily married orthopaedic surgeon, delivers his own twins – a perfectly healthy boy and a girl with Down syndrome. Haunted by a secret past and unable to bear the agony that Norah, his wife, might go through, he makes an instant decision to secretly send his daughter away with his nurse, Caroline Gill, to an institution. In a shocking act of betrayal, he reveals to his wife that her daughter died, not knowing that this will alter his life forever. Not wanting to abandon the child, the nurse decides to depart to another city and raise the child by herself as her own. The lives of the siblings, Paul and Phoebe are skillfully told by Edwards using their parallel lives alternatively throughout a quarter of a century. Ignorant of each other, the two grow up in different circumstances, brought up by completely different families. Though affluent, the Henry household is always overshadowed by the presumed death of their daughter, and Norah’s grief quietly tears the family apart as the years go by. Amidst the unexplained tension in the household, Paul grows up constantly touched by the shadow of the sister he never knew. Meanwhile, Caroline raises Phoebe while struggling and fighting against societal prejudices in order to provide Phoebe the same opportunities as other children, and hence, a fair right to life. To me the novel’s success lies in the intricate characters that Edwards creates, allowing the reader to gain a deep insight into their experiences. Edwards’ characters are complex, with each rich detail inviting a mixture of feelings from the readers. Photography is artfully woven in as a metaphor to serve as a tool to give an insight into David’s personality. Unable to let go of the guilt and the secret of his daughter’s existence, David turns to photography to isolate himself from his family. Using a camera called ‘the Memory Keeper’; photography becomes an obsession to David’s wounded soul. Edwards’ pain-staking attention to detail creates realistic characters that essentially have flaws that readers can sympathize, despise or fall in love with, giving us an opportunity to explore the nuances of human emotion. The complexity of human emotion is also effectively illustrated by Edwards. What grips me most is the sense of loss that is suffered by both Dr. Henry and his wife as the story unfolds, and the family is slowly destroyed by Dr. Henry’s lie. Unable to share their pain, they suffer silently and readers see how the distance between David and Norah deepen over the years. The loneliness and frustration that Paul feels from his estranged parents is made clear by accentuating his love for music, which serves as both his refuge and escape. The Memory Keeper’s Daughter, while repetitive at times, is a poignant story of family secrets, an exploration of grief and loss, bonds that unite, and the redemptive power of love. Most importantly, it teaches us to accept others the way they are, and that it is our flaws and imperfections that make us human. ",3,-0.7185,0.131,0.751,0.119,0.4652980239714935,POSITIVE,0.9972
84,18527991,03/24/2008,2.0,"he plot of this story is basic. A father and a doctor delivers his wife's twins. Being a doctor he recognizes that the twin girl has down syndrome right away. It is 1964 and the wife is passed out. He gives the girl to the nurse and tells her to take her to a home. Meaning to tell his wife the truth, tells her of the twin, but then tells her the girl died. The nurse takes the baby to the home and finds the place unpleasant and decides to keep the baby to raise as her own. She leaves town. The stories follows the lives of these two ""families"" from there on out.What may seem like a story that would be heavily concentrated on the differences between down syndrome children and ""normal"" children, it is surprisingly light on the subject. In fact in some ways I feel it is a little too light. But I'll touch on that later. The characters are beautifully flawed and the voice is equally enchanting.Each chapter or section begins with a page that simply tells you what year it is. Then there are sections within that which are from different charecter's pov. (Close third person) The father's, the nurse's, the mother's, and when the boy twin, David is 13, his pov. However different events take place. This is not a ""how each person saw the same thing"" type of story. On Monday we have dad's pov, on Tuesday we have mom's. like that. (only not that contrived)I think this way of telling the story works well. It really gets you to see the characters inside and out and I feel gives a deeper emotion to their troubles and situations. However Phoebe, the girl with down syndrome, doesn't ever get a p.o.v section. She has dialog and is a well developed character as the nurse sees her, but I think her lacking what everyone else has, essentially point of view, turns her into too much of a plot device for me. I think the story and the point of the piece still works, but this did concern me though I do understand that it may be difficult to write a down syndrome pov. Having said that I really did enjoy the book. It is littered with descriptive details of scenery and nature that don't bog you down but really put you there. I think the symbolized in the piece is subtle and nice, though the author at times draws too much attention to it. The ending is what it is. I don't want to give too much away, the story really is touching and interesting, and in many ways unique.

While I was correct about that, there were just so many more layers to the story! This book is set in Kentucky of 1964, and author does a good job of transporting you there. A lady delivers twins, and her husband (and doctor), chooses to send one of the two (who was born with unmistakable Down's syndrome) to an institution with a nurse who was in love with him, and tells the wife that the daughter was born dead. This decision reflected a lot on the doctor's own history and experience with grief at his Downs' sister's death and how that had affected him in his life. This split second decision, however, completely changed the course of their lives. The book progresses as narrations from the point of view of various characters in the story, thus glimpsing into every one's mind for their account of events and feelings. This book paints a grim, but optimistic picture of how mental health issues and their awareness (or lack, thereof) were so far from today's world. How institutions were considered the golden standard for anyone with any mental issues. Besides Down's syndrome, the book dwells deeply on depression sustained by the mother of the twins. SPOILERS AHEAD OF THIS POINT!!! To the world, she has a perfect life - a beautiful boy, a big house ,a husband who is a doctor and an immaculate social life. Yet, she constantly grieves her daughter and regrets not having ever seen her. Over time, she forces herself to close doors on her husband and attempt to build her identity after coming out of her no-risk ms.goody-two-shoes nature. Her husband meanwhile, grieves in his own way, for he knows that the daughter he gave away is alive out there, raised by the nurse as her own. He immerses himself in photography to the point of obsession and lives out his stress from that night's decision in his own way. The nurse meanwhile, has got a child she never had and a life in a new city. Her motherly love for the daughter, Phoebe, is unbounded. She keeps the father posted about her, hoping and not hoping at the same time, that he comes back for her. She fights with the local school system of the 1970s to allow special needs children their right to education.

115,496462296,06/06/2018,3.0,"2.5/5The tale begins on a winter night in 1964 with a storm in the horizon, brewing high like the hopes of an expectant couple. David, the husband, an orthopedic doctor rushes his wife to the hospital trying to grasp a future full of hope. By the twist of fate, David's colleague doesn't make it to the hospital and the burden of delivering his own child falls on David and to his shock, his wife gives birth to twins. A healthy baby boy and a baby girl with Down Syndrome. Plagued by his own past of losing a sister to a heart ailment at an young age, and the memory of his mother's suffering under subsequent grief leads him into making a hasty decison of giving away his daughter to an institution. He lies to his wife Norah that their daughter was a blue baby, dead at birth. However, the nurse Coraline takes the baby and disappears to raise her as her own. The rest of the story revolves around how the weight of the decision transforms the individuals over the years, the weight of the hidden secret drowning each one into their own sea of despair. I wanted to like this book, I really did considering the premise. However, I cannot ignore the glaring holes, the fabric of the story ripping so easily at its seams at the slightest tug. I will give it to the writer for weaving a realistic story, for spelling out the nuances that bog a family grappling with loss, the changing power dynamics between a husband and wife with changing times but the author fails to balance it out. The descriptions of scenes are way too long, and some sub-plots are utterly unnecessary, it almost reminded me of family sagas on televised screens. Also, I couldn't help notice how incredible whyte this story is, a privilege in itself even if it talks about a topic like Down Syndrome. What I did not particularly like is how Down Syndrome is more of a prop in the story and the emphasis of the story lies on David's decision rather than the condition itself. Ofcourse, there are mentions about the struggles Caroline goes through in raising Phoebe and fighting for her rights but this too is handled in the passing with statements from Caroline in the likes of 'I fought like hell for her to be accepted ' . In all, with proper revisions and better editing, the story would have tasted much better than the presentation.",2,-0.5063,0.101,0.804,0.096,0.4779032258064517,NEGATIVE,0.983
116,1868104642,05/12/2017,4.0,"This was just another random book that I found on Goodreads. What caught my attention was the title and the haunting cover of the book. Till date when I look at that frail white dress, it breaks my heart. I hadn't even heard about the author before that. The ratings were pretty good too but I kept going back to the title. It was so beautiful and the blurb was exciting enough for me to place an order for the book. I have learnt to read books with zero expectations these days. I start with an empty slate and work my way up through it. 'The Night Circus' was the first book that I read without expectations and it just blew my mind! I started this one the same way too.Dr. David Henry had a very difficult childhood. Poor parents and a sister who suffered from Down Syndrome. While David loved his sister, most of his memories include regular visits to the hospital for her various ailments and that of his mother crying all the time. Clearly, not a pleasant atmosphere to grown up in. When his sister dies at the age of thirteen, he is heartbroken and decides to not end up like his parents. When he is accepted to a medical school with full scholarship, he jumps in at the opportunity. After the death of his father, his mom goes on to live with her sister leaving David to focus on his life. David becomes a very good doctor and marries Norah who he loves immensely. Norah is very young when compared to him and is happy being taken care of by him. Within the first year of their marriage, they are all set to become a family. David has only one goal. He doesn't want his family to go through what he had to.In early March of 1964, Norah develops labor pains and thanks to the weather outside, David is forced to do the delivery himself at his clinic. His loyal nurse Caroline Gill comes in to assist him. Norah already has names in her mind for the child. Paul, for a boy and Phoebe, for a girl. With the help of a episiotomy, Paul soon comes out perfect and healthy. Just when the new parents are rejoicing, Norah feels another contraction and David realizes that she's having another baby. Twins! Norah delivers their daughter Phoebe and passes out. David notices that their daughter is not like any normal child. She is small and certainly something was not right with her. It doesn't take him long to realize that his daughter has been born with Down Syndrome. Thinking of the difficulty he and his parents had with his sister, he does the unthinkable and hands his daughter to Caroline and asks her to leave the baby at an institution. He then tells his wife that their daughter died at birth.Norah is devastated by the loss of her daughter and arranges a memorial service for her. Meanwhile, Caroline takes Phoebe to the institution. When she sees the terrible conditions there, she walks away with Phoebe and decides to leave her job and move to a new city to start a fresh life with Phoebe as her daughter. She gets a job as a nurse to a wealthy patient and soon finds love in Al, a truck driver who helped her the night Phoebe was born. Caroline brings up Phoebe as her own daughter and does keep David updated about this fact and send him letters and pictures time and again. David, though shocked at first, begins sending money for his daughter still keeping the secret from his wife and son who are growing distant from him. Norah is unable to get the tragedy out of her mind and starts living a parallel life. Paul, who wants to be a musician doesn't resonate with the mighty ambitions that his father has for him. The family has broken apart, even though they live together. On their first anniversary, Norah gifts David a camera called 'The Memory Keeper' and he pursues photography as a hobby soon after.The story spans over twenty five years with both Paul and Phoebe growing up in different situations. Paul, the privileged son who wants different things from life. Phoebe, despite her mental disabilities is growing up to be healthy child and thanks to Caroline, takes up mainstream education. Soon, she finds a job and is doing very well for herself. David keeps receiving photographs of his daughter from Caroline and he continues to send money. Phoebe grows up thinking Al and Caroline are her parents. How long can David hold on to his secret? Will Norah and Paul ever find out about Phoebe's existence?While the story is brilliant, the writing is not that easy. Dialogues are written very well and the story is well paced. What bothered me the most was the narration. Sometimes the narration went on for pages without a single dialogue. The story is well thought of and the author does take us into the lives of the main characters. I cannot flaw the story, but I probably would have ended it in a better way. There always was a thought in my head as to how would Norah and Paul react when they hear about Phoebe and who would tell them, but the answer turned out to be the simplest of all. The only level of mystery in the book is about when the secret would explode, but the build up towards it is very well done. This book goes on to show that no matter how strong a marriage or any relationship is, it can all come down thanks to a single situation. Or a secret.This is a very good book and despite my non existent maternal instinct, I could feel for Phoebe. While she is the secret, more focus is on her adoptive mother Caroline. The book traces the lives of David and Caroline and their respective children. David's character was well written and I could empathize with him on the difficult childhood he had. His choice to send away his daughter was obviously questionable, but he did that to spare his family from the pain he had to go through. Caroline is the perfect nurse, kind and loving and fights hard for her daughter, never once letting her feel that she's not her own. Paul as the angry young man is good too and his character is justified. Norah was an intriguing character. From a weakling battling grief, she turns into someone strong later but does continue to succumb to the loss of her daughter. I would have liked to see more of Phoebe and probably would have liked it if she had a few chapters dedicated to what she thinks and does. Life from her point of view alone. That I missed in this book. Otherwise, this is a book about love, emotions, loss and recovery. It must be read just for its story line.Verdict: Brilliant story and pace, the narration could have been much better.Rating: 4 out of 5 stars.",2,0.9972,0.099,0.756,0.145,0.5495611661066209,NEGATIVE,0.9644
117,2102060544,12/04/2017,3.0,"This novel seems to get panned in Goodreads reviews, and I’m not sure why. It’s not as terrible or nearly as poorly written as some of the 1- and 2-star reviews would have me believe. The writing is innocuous enough, at times lovely but at other times a little bit too focused on the wind and the weather and specific flowers—none of this adds much. I would have liked it less as a younger reader: it seems full of the melancholy of being middle-aged and having made choices from which you can’t return, or maybe choices that so patently drive your life in a very specific direction. The best parts were in the small mundane details, like the incremental choices that Caroline makes on the day she takes Phoebe, and in the futility of rage against that which you can’t change. David seemed particularly undeveloped, an irony given that his decision that drives the rest of the plot was based on “expertise” and was paternalistic in the worst way. You seem to see his fullest development through the eyes of others who must generously inform you of his pain/grief.And my common complaint with fiction these days seems to be that the endings are too pat, too neat. I’m sure that says much about my own headspace. This novel, too, seems wrapped up neatly and cleanly, in which messiness and loose ends are mostly tidied up and swept away.

Dr. Henry finds himself in the position of having to deliver their twins at his office with only his nurse there to assist. His son is born first , and is beautifully healthy, his delivery occurring without any problems at all. But, then the moment comes when the doctor and his nurse realize that Norah isn’t carrying just one baby, but two. Only moments after his daughter is born, Dr. Henry is horrified to discover that she has Down Syndrome and, in the blink of an eye, makes a panicked decision, with the intention of protecting his beloved wife, that will haunt them all for years to come. He hands his tiny daughter, Phoebe, to Caroline, his nurse, with explicit instructions to take her to a nearby institution and leave her there, and to never tell anyone anything about it. He tells Norah that their daughter did not survive the delivery, never suspecting even for a moment, that Caroline may not follow his directions. Caroline does, indeed, take little Phoebe to the institution, as ordered. But, after sitting and observing for a few minutes, she quickly realizes that she can’t leave her there and takes the baby with her, disappearing, leaving no hints as to where she’s gone. She takes the baby and starts a new life for the both of them, raising little Phoebe, as her own. I really enjoyed this story! I do have to admit that, while incredibly well written and developed, most of the main characters weren’t all that likeable, as people. I found both Norah and Henry to be selfish. My favorite characters were Phoebe, Paul, Caroline, and Al. The story alternates between the lives of Dr. Henry and Norah, as they both try to move past the loss of their daughter, and of Caroline and Phoebe, as Caroline struggles as a single mother of a special needs child, taking great care to be the best advocate her daughter could possibly have. This story deals wit regrets and lost chances, with making a wrong decision that you regret for the rest of your life, but don’t really know how to make things right. I found myself wondering what Norah and David would have been like, if David hadn’t taken matters into his own hands and deprived them all of having Phoebe in their lives. It makes me sad that people used to recommend that babies with Down Syndrome be raised in institutions, instead of by their parents and with their families.

120,4014080788,05/21/2021,4.0,"Edwards's novel can be read as a sorrowful meditation on Tolstoy's claim that ""every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way."" I often tell my creative writing students that, paradoxically, the more personal a story or poem is to the writer, the more closely it seems to speak to a wider audience, even if the readers don't share the writer's particular experiences. The Memory Keeper's Daughter does an excellent job portraying how a secret--a doozy in the case of the Henry family in this book--even one unknown to all but one family member, can poison a family and alter its members' emotional trajectories forever. Only two aspects of the novel prevented me from giving this book a five-star rating. One character whose actions resulted in the secret and who suffered the results of those actions in secret all his life died before he could see the results of that secret's revelation. Another character with Down syndrome, while at the center of the novel's action, remains a flat character practically throughout the entire book. Reflecting on this character, another observes, ""All he really knew of her he could put on an index card,"" and this seems true of Edwards's portrayal of that character overall. Fortunately, both of these aspects are resolved most exquisitely in a beautifully rendered final scene.",2,0.45,0.089,0.802,0.109,0.595267489711934,POSITIVE,0.9424

Stupendous writing (how many times did I get goosebumps and cry during reading this?), real life characters who will stay with me long after the reading, easy to read and just can't put down, and made me really think.

I grew up in the 60s and lived near a Downs kid who had prominent parents. Dad was fine but Mom became a recluse and antisocial. Sympathy doesn’t equal acceptance. Author weaves the story very well and an effective sadness drapes over all who are involved. The ending is handled well when I expected a total mess up which we continued to see along the way.

132,65497823,07/29/2009,4.0,"The Memory Keeper's Daughter by Kim Edwards From the reviews I've seen on here, it seems like you either love this book or you hate it. Personally, I really enjoyed it, and I know I'll be looking forward to more from Kim Edwards. What stood out to me the most about this book was her writing. Some people have said that it's too descriptive, but I didn't find it to be. I think her writing is beautiful and lyrical, and I found myself just swimming in her words (and I mean that in a good way). The story itself was so thought-provoking, and really made me think about what I would have done in that situation. Fans of Jodi Picoult would like this one. My initial reaction to David's decision was total and complete outrage: how COULD he, I asked myself. But as I read, and I began to learn more about David and how his life almost molded him to make that decision, I started to understand more of where he was coming from. Not only that, but this story began in 1964. Not much was known about Down Syndrome, and I had to remind myself that David made the best medical decision that he could given what was known at that time. I'm not saying he was right or that I would have done the same, I just found it interesting that Edwards made me <i>think</i> so much about it. I also found it completely fascinating and enthralling how one literally split second decision had major repercussions on the rest of David's life, particularly involving his relationship with his wife and son. I found myself wondering what would have happened differently if David had made the other choice. I love it when an author can make me examine a story so closely. Some books it's easy for me to put down, walk away, and not think about it until I pick them up again. Not so with this one. Edwards also deeply and thoroughly examines her characters, which is another thing I love. As I mentioned before, the more Edwards revealed about David, the more it was evident why he made the choice he made, and how living with that secret choice affected everything he did from that point forward. It was heartbreaking to watch Norah as she dealt with her ever present grief and coped with losing a daughter, and it was frustrating to see Paul's anger and his desire to feel good enough for his father. If anything, the family saga is enough to make anyone want to read this. On the flip side of the situation, there's Caroline and Phoebe, and it was interesting to see Phoebe grow and be raised by Caroline. Just as we saw David and his family live with the decision he made, we saw Caroline live with the decision she made that night. I thought her side of the story was very insightful and informative about Down Syndrome and what challenges and obstacles were (and still are) present, not only for those living with it, but how the rest of the world sees it as well. It was interesting to watch Phoebe grow into a young woman and get to see just what David missed out on. What stirred the most thought out of me was Edwards' metaphorical use of photography. I finished this book hours ago, and I've been thinking about it ever since, through dinner and a long shower to help me gather my thoughts. Towards the end of the book, Norah pointed out that David's photos are moments and memories of life as David (and David alone) saw them. Then Paul recalled a memory where his father was talking to him about photography, saying something along the lines of the fact that each person behind the camera is living in their own ""isolated universe,"" I think he called it. Which made me think that even though each and every one of us can interact with the people in our lives on a daily basis, we are the only ones who truly know what is going on behind our own lens, if you will. And I think that's what Edwards is trying to get across in describing the relationship between all of these people in this book. Based off of experiences that are uniquely ours, we are shaped into the people we become, and no one else can fully understand what we alone are going through. I apologize for the long ramble, but as you can see, this book gave me a lot to think about, which I love! Overall, this is not a light read, by any means. I mentioned earlier that I think fans of Jodi Picoult would like this one. Between breathtaking writing and a compelling storyline, this is not one to miss!",2,0.9949,0.05,0.84,0.11,0.4905006523157208,POSITIVE,0.9987

136,1361055245,08/11/2015,1.0,"This may be harsh, but, I hate this book.  I really wanted to like this book. Which is why I was determined to finish it. Finishing the book was really a triumph for me considering how much I came to hate the characters. The book’s popularity really surprises me considering how tedious and boring it was!  So, aside from being bored, even zoning out for long stretches of text, I found most of the characters to be total dicks. Norah being the worst character in my opinion. Her tragedy was understood and sympathized with, and in no way was her loss, or the loss as she understood it anything other than awful and wrong. With that being said, Norah didn’t know David’s “secret,” and what had really happened to Phoebe; she thought the baby had died, she laid her to rest, and as she claims to have moved forward, yet she doesn’t really appear to move forward and in my opinion, uses the loss as an excuse for her shortcomings. She didn’t appear to even really mother her remaining child (drinking and driving right after the baby was born, come on!). She flirts with being an alcoholic, she bitches and moans about not being able to “reach” David, she has affairs, she becomes a business owner then sort of uses that as a cover for her affairs (at least that is what her son suspects…), oh, and finally, let me not forget that she has zero personality. What a lovely character. I couldn’t stand reading her.  And David! WTF! Giving away your baby based on having Down’s syndrome?! Again, WTF! So David had a sister with Down’s who had heart problems, and as a doctor, he just couldn’t handle the idea of that for his own kid, so he handed off his child to his nurse, to have the nurse essentially dump the baby in some institution he had never been to or seen and had “heard” was nice (father of the year, right...). David spends the rest of the book seemingly regretting his decision, as he should, and drawing away from his family, but at the same time, trying to hold them close, which leaves them confused and messed up. So, Paul, the twin whom David kept, …yeah, nothing really bad to say about Paul other than, maybe I would have cared more about him if he would have had some more character development.  The only redeeming character in the book was Caroline, the nurse David handed his Down’s baby off to. She takes the baby and raises her as her own. As noble as that seems, she still probably should have reached out to Norah… But whateves.  You know, even the secondary character’s pissed me off. Al, Caroline’s husband for example. At every turn he was ungrateful at the good things that happened to Caroline (she received the house, she received a large amount of money to support Phoebe). He was just an undeveloped guy who seemed to not understand Phoebe’s level of care needed, and showed a lack of sympathy towards Caroline’s obligation (“come away with me, Caroline, whaaaa whaaa lets leave Phoebe here alone and jet off in to the sunset and blah blah blah” – clearly, I am paraphrasing). Oh, and Michelle, Paul’s girlfriend, what a bitch.  So this is the part of my rant (er… review) that leads me to the overabundance of details in the book... SO. Yeah. Kim Edwards was literally trying to paint pictures with words. The details. OMG. The details. Bogged down in details, you would almost miss there was a story happening! The long monologs of how so-and-so felt… And at times, it felt like something was going to happen, yet… Nothing EVER did. And that “nothing” that happened was well documented with too much DETAIL!!!  And this is my final thought… Because the overriding sentiment of this review is so negative, I just want to spit it out and get it over with. I hate leaving negative reviews. The whole Rosemary thing… Really? How far-fetched and just random was that. David goes off the deep end and finds some pregnant teenager in his abandoned childhood home? Really? She “captures” him, and he unloads his soul, and they basically live happily ever after (platonically, of course). Give me an effing break.  So, no, I don’t recommend this book.

I slogged through and finished it but I didn't feel improved, enlightened or entertained by reading it. The characters are distant and unlike-able, living in rich and empowering circumstances but always distraught and upset by minor things. In the most recent pure-fiction book I read (The Book Thief), a character is sad when their son leaves them to fight in WW2, for what they feel is the wrong side. That's terrible. That's emotionally difficult. The character is distraught but because of circumstances, must continue their life in the face of adversity. There are many examples in that book and by the end you feel one with the characters and their struggles (although as I have previously complained, somewhat manipulated!)A character in The Memory Keeper's Daughter gets upset when her husband works late and misses their anniversary. So upset that she gets blind drunk and crashes a car. And then there are no consequences. It's just fricking irritating to read about characters who live in decadent wealth and awesome circumstances whinging about how their lives suck and they feel emotionally empty. Get some freaking therapy, people! Talk to each other for a change! Look at the world around you and realise how unbelievably lucky you are!And the repetition... how many times must the characters reflect that everything has been going fine for a couple of (weeks/months/years) but they can't shake the memory of (tragic event) from a few (weeks/months/years) ago. It's really, really boring. It feels like they all have the same internal voice - a whingy, melodramatic narcissist.Adjectives are hyperbolic and again, repetitive. There's a 'sudden snow' after a 'sudden spring', literally in the same sentence. Why are the characters always surprised that stuff happens? Yes, snow falls. yes, the seasons change. Seriously, you are not the first one to notice this.About the only thing I liked, that made it worthwhile to get to the end of this, was that the ending was actually somewhat unexpected and interesting. It was nice to see the characters doing something a little different for a brief period, and(view spoiler)[David's death (hide spoiler)] with plenty of book still to go rather surprised me. Then of course they are parted by a tragic holiday with all the oodles of cash they have, and reflect how there's never enough time to be really emotionally fulfilled because of (tragic event that wasn't actually very tragic as it turned out). Ugh.If you want to read a moving fictional story about the difficulties disabled people faced in the 20th century, pick up Skallagrigg. You will be WEEPING at points.If you want to read an interesting story about a beautiful and melancholy love affair in the face of truly tragic circumstances, read The Time Traveler's Wife or Never Let Me Go.If you want to read an over-long ramble about a bunch of unlikeable, whiny characters making mountains out of molehills, read The Memory Keeper's Daughter.",2,-0.991,0.197,0.662,0.14,0.5923497267759563,NEGATIVE,1.0

The over dramatic inner monologues, the saccharine sweet melancholy, with everything just so theatrical and artificial... And most of all the unfairness of everybody hating David.Here's what I think about this book; it is unrealistic. Not the actions; the abandonment, the infidelity or the teenage angst, but the constant whining about the giant hole in their lives. Again and again they talk about how the death of the daughter caused them all pain, causing the couple to drift further and further apart. But why would that cause Paul and Norah to hate David? They don't know that the girl has been given away and alive and well. EVERYBODY loves to hate David, the only sincere, logical human being who made a rushed mistake when he was confused and emotional and just couldn't deal with the consequence of it. David who helped a young mother, who tried to give every comfort to his family and shield them from the heartbreak of early death like he faced with his sister. And then there is Paul, who is at best juvenile in how he handles relationships. At his age, which is older than me towards the end of the book, a person should be more aware of the sacrifices and hard decisions and the sincerity said decisions to protect the child that parenthood brings. Such a coddled unaware kid he will make when he is 30.And Norah... I loathed Norah. Making more mistakes and causing the most damage and still somehow finding herself right every single time. ""I have had multiple affairs, but they were all David's fault because he wants to give best to us and works hard and is rarely home although I'm always saying how sure I am of his love for us."", ""We have drifted apart but it was because David didn't want to wallow in self pity for years and become and alcoholic despite our very healthy boy and the wonderful future that awaits us."", ""I am going to confront David about his mistakes (like working too hard, or having a hard time talking about his feelings because apparently those warrant hatred and bitterness) but avoid speaking or sorting out any problem caused by my affairs, my cold unforgiving and unwarrantedly harsh attitude towards him, and will continue to make the same mistakes, despite knowing even my own son let alone my husband knows them."".By the end of the book I was glad he gave the girl away. At least she grew up with a loving mother. She raised a healthy boy and look how crippled and ""retarded"" he turned out.And of course at the end of it alll Norah and her drama queen son would find themselves wronged, and yet once again angry at David.I believe has they raised the daughter Norah would have whined and drank her way through life, crying about the unfairness and the complexity of it all. She would have made a selfish mother, and Phoebe wouldn't have had half the experiences she had with her, with no mother to push for regular education, or a job.I detest these people.I hope I will never meet such selfish people in real life and never become one of them.",2,-0.9956,0.198,0.697,0.105,0.53430115635998,NEGATIVE,0.9999

141,360773999,07/03/2012,4.0,"The Memory Keeper's Daughter is a wonderful novel and Kim Edwards is a truly gifted writer. The story builds upon the act that one husband and father makes (view spoiler)[after delivering his wife's twins (a boy and a girl). Realizing his daughter was born with Down's Syndrome, he gives the baby to the nurse who assisted him and told her to take the baby away to an institution - only to tell his wife that the little girl had died. After taking the baby to the institution, the nurse realizes she could not leave this child there and makes a decision to raise the baby as her own. (hide spoiler)]This novel is a lesson in secrets, lies, love, and the what if's of the choices we make. There is so much to process with this novel as there were so many different stories going on within the story. I feel like every character (David, Norah, Paul, Caroline, Bree) was so developed and interesting that I came to at least understand why each person did the things they did. This book is heavy - it's not a happy subject and the lessons you get from it do not brighten your heart, but it carries a truth in it that I think we have all felt. (view spoiler)[David felt he was doing the right thing by giving his child away, Caroline thought she was doing the right thing by keeping Phoebe and not telling Norah. Norah justifies her infidelities by blaming David's unexplained emotional distance from her and Paul just seems angry most of the time, and quite honestly, I found him to be an ungrateful, spoiled brat - although I think he himself realizes this at the end. It was sad (but very realistic) to see the deterioration of David's marriage to Norah - how two people who were so enamored and in love with each other at one time, can grow to completely resent and show no interest in the other. Norah and her son made David out to be this unfeeling object in their lives, and I felt sorry for David throughout most of the book. David, who was so racked with guilt for so long, accepted the mistreatment he received by his wife and son as his punishment for doing what he did.

142,242390013,12/02/2011,1.0,"Oh lord. No, really, oh my lord. This was one of the worst books that I have read in a long long time. In fact, this book was so bad I was forced to actually put it down several times to read other books to assure myself that reading was, in fact, still pleasurable.I had actually asked a friend about taking this with me on a trip. As she was trying to explain the plot, some loud music came on. ""I mean, the daughter's a dwarf,"" she said. ""Get over it."" I really really wish this book had been about a dwarf. Instead, what I think my friend was saying was ""so, you daughter's dead, get over it.""Yes, seriously, please do. This whole fucking novel was a cornucopia of whiny white people who couldn't seem to get over it, whose every happy moment was immediately obscured by doubt and fear. But even that would have been alright, and in fact works perfectly well in many novels had it not been for the horrendous writing. Look, I am also total shit with commas but I know when description turns less into scene-setting and more into fullout imagerial masturbation. Kim Edwards uses adjectives like dildos, her sentimentalities are almost profance, her characters all speak like they are all caught on a couch in the early days of Freud spouting out their thoughts after reading too many Dickens' novels. The edition I read had a reader's guide at the end where Kim Edwards talked about her creative style. Apparently someone had told her a similar story and then she decided to go with it. Maybe that's why it feels so artificial and histrionic, because she was trying to capture emotions secondhand. Or maybe it's because I'm at a point in my life where I really tire of people not getting over things and ruminating to death.It's like, I jsut wanted to send all of the characters a lot of Xanax.I wish I could explain even more why I hated this book so much, but I feel like this shallow explanation will do it, lest I start sounding anything like this author.Ugh, still annoyed at the time wasted hoping for good things on this one.

As I sip my cardamom spiced tea, some words filter in... closure, pain and lastly, SECRET. Cold words. They destroy us, but what makes them a part of us? We do.. with our constant brewing and over thinking, like aggravating a bee sting. Closure: or the lack of it, that Norah didn't get to see her dead baby. The black hole it created. Her trying to fill it up. With her happiness, her love, her marriage until ultimately she lost everything to it. Her constant sorrow was depressing and irritating.Pain: David. He'd struggled to get his far from a poverty stricken childhood, and the loss of his sister, June. He loved Norah, yes yes he truly did. Ever lived your entire life caring after a sickly retarded person? His mother did, and she never got over it.And he didn't want that for Norah. But what he did wasn't his decision to make, not alone at least. He didn't mind hating himself for it. Not easy knowing that you're the rotten apple in the relationship, and accepting it to keep the other free from pain (or so he thought). Carrying an ugly secret for the rest of your life is shitty.Its scary how important trust and communication are in a relationship. Scary that two people in love suddenly become strangers. What Norah and David faced is proof of it. As the author switched through both these character's minds, it was amazing how much they both misunderstood each other, simply because they never spoke, never expressed. David's love for photography was a typical example.Though two things I strongly felt the author missed out: I believe Paul should have have told Norah that David knew about her affairs. Because towards the end she seemed to believe that David was entirely responsible for all the falls. Secondly, I really really wished that it in the end, David was the one to come out with the secret about Pheobe. These missing events seemed so important to me, that the book lost one star.

When she meets Caroline again, her world is torn into pieces when she reveals a dark secret that has been buried years ago.I have never in my life have read an emotional,gripping and powerful novel as this one! I usually do not express my emotions reading, but this book had me in tears.

Unfortunately, it would maybe pass as a first draft? A jumble of semi-finished bits and pieces, sketching the possible threads the story could follow. Most definitely not anything more. I was convinced I was going to give this book one star. Yet, by the end it either got better or my mind filled in the gaps itself because it couldn't bear it anymore. And the general skeleton of the story wasn't really that bad. Hence, 2 stars.1. The characters felt like cardboard. Mostly they are all eerily the same: vague and bland blobs of inconsistencies, their actions mechanic, vessels for parables. It seemed like it was always obvious what the author wanted to express and it was painful to see it stated instead of emerging naturally.2. The author clearly did not know what she was talking about in way too many places. (Somebody buy her some weed.) Yet she went into great detail with that awful didactic tone making it all sound absurd, if not sad.3. You know that ew feeling you get when someone tries REALLY hard to sound very artistic and smart? Yeah. That.

I found it to be a very touching story and also pretty thought provoking as well.Set in the 1960's when women were still gassed during a delivery of her baby, a doctor finds himself having to deliver his own twins. His son is born first and he is healthy and perfect, and was thought to be the only child until his twin was born minutes later. It is a little girl who is not born perfect and healthy, but is born with Down Syndrome. The father makes a decision to have the little girl sent to an institution since her prognosis was not good in his eyes. And the story goes from there.I think the characters were pretty well developed. I could many personality changes in each of them during the course of this story. At first I actually really despised David who is the father/doctor, and I really like Norah who was the birth mother. As I watched them develop and grow throughout the story, I saw some very distinct changes in both of these characters that made me change my mind on that. I ended up not really caring for either one of the main characters.The twins Paul and Phoebe were also well developed although I feel like the story with Phoebe was less developed than it should have been. I saw more focus on Paul. I would have loved to see more about Phoebe in this since I thought the story was more focused on the aspect of dealing with Down Syndrome. I also found that this brings up the question, 'what would you do?' in this situation. Because of the time period, I could understand many of the sides of this story. And then on the other hand I found some parts rather unforgivable. This is definitely worth the read, and I found myself taking my time because the story gets a little complex with different stories being told by different characters. And also some parts got a tad bit draggy and boring. It was still pretty easy to follow. I also got worried thinking that I would not get closure on a certain aspect of the story. Which is really what drove me through the book. This is getting a solid 3.5 stars from me.",2,0.9898,0.045,0.82,0.135,0.507675983436853,POSITIVE,0.9973

This is the basic premise of a book about the Henry family. Dr. David Henry delivers his own twins during a blizzard: one is a normal, healthy boy, the girl shows all the signs of Downs syndrome. Without consulting his wife and remembering what his own life was like with a 'slow' sister who died young, he decides to tell his wife that the baby was born dead and hands the baby girl to his nurse to take to a home for the retarded.Only thing, he has handed the problem to someone else who doesn't see it in the same light and who can't just hand over a baby to a run down institution where the child will not get the loving care of a family. Instead the nurse, Caroline, keeps the child and raises her.This is indeed a deeply moving story of two parallel families each with a connection with the other. And Kim Edwards has written about real people who fight and grieve and suffer. My only fault is that in this whole case, I don't believe that the Henrys - David and Norah - act like a family grieving. Norah, particularly, behaves in a way I don't understand. Grieving, hard drinking -- clearly depressed during an era when people didn't seem to go to psychiatrists -- she also seems to benignly neglect her own son and takes a job that removes her from her home entirely. David, burdened with guilt for the one act and again reacting to his own childhood, wants the best with his son Paul but seems to shut down both his wife and his son -- that I can see a bit more.Because I see a husband-wife relationship that never really developed ... even from when they were first attracted to he other before getting married. And that is what I see as the true tale here about a couple who clearly did love each other but never understood each other. Who carried two many secrets that they ultimately became strangers to each other.Because if they had and been honest with each other, they may have averted the ultimate secret that they carried throughout the book and the one that became somewhat resolved only at the end of the tale.",2,0.9206,0.072,0.835,0.094,0.5227904040404041,POSITIVE,0.9423

I was wondering if this book would do justice to the plot line it hinted at. I mean, who could not love a book that was intense, filled with human flaws, deception, and healing? But I found anything such. I feel as though the author hyper focused on the deception that David Henry chose to commit to. I didn't like how she would clumsily describe things. That is another aspect that, in my opinion, caused a great deal of damage to the book. It was as if she would throw in certain details as an after thought. Example: The wine bottle had been brought out a couple paragraphs before hand, but then towards the bottom of the page she wrote, ""The wine was dark with berries and faint oak."" This just seemed like an after thought to me. I don't know how much research the author did on Down Syndrome, but the way that she portrayed Phoebe was simple, as best. She did not give enough time to Phoebe and Caroline, the two characters that I enjoyed reading about. To me, she made Phoebe seem simple. People with down syndrome are anything but. They are some of the most loving, caring, trusting, and most complex people that I have ever worked with. I did not get that full sense for Phoebe. Only a small glimpse at the end. If she would have done more detail for her, then I think that we would have appreciated the complexity that she was trying to show of how people with disabilities were treated in 1964 versus the current times. I don't think that she conveyed that fully like she should have. I realize that this book was centered around David and Norah and Paul, but they were not complex characters. I can only imagine how much better this book might have been if she chose to show it through the story of Phoebe, Caroline, and Al. Then, maybe then, I would have like this book so much more. I am hoping, one day, to read a book that will do justice for those people that have down syndrome and their caretakers. ",2,0.997,0.046,0.752,0.202,0.5080522486772487,NEGATIVE,1.0

A story based on one man's VERY bad decision and then his lie to not tell his wife about it.**Spoiler Alert**I was so upset with David in his decision to give up the baby. It took me almost to the end of the book to realize that he gave his daughter away because he thought she was going to die soon (and not because she had Downs Symdrome). He truly wanted to spare his own wife the same grief that his mother had over losing her own daughter (David's sister). I know that it states this earlier, but I had a hard time believing it until the end. I found myself wanting to skip over the chapters that were about David, Norah and Paul. I only wanted to read about Caroline and Phoebe - They had a much happier life. I kept waiting and waiting and waiting for David to tell Norah the truth and could not believed he kept that secret for so many years. No wonder it destroyed their family. I wonder how it would have ended if Paul had found his father's letter to Caroline in with the money that was hidden...It is amazing to me how Kim Edwards showed how differently people view things. I really like this about her writing. Here's one example: When Caroline comes to see David at his art show. Caroline: ""As she watched, he reached up and put the envelope casually in his pocket, as if it contained something trivial and mildly unpleasant - a utility bill, a traffic ticket."" David: ""The room swirled around him, voices rose and fell; in an instant of silence he became aware that his heart was pounding, that he still held the envelope Caroline had given him. He glanced across the room again - yes, good, she was still there - and tucked it carefully into his shirt pocket; his hands were trembling faintly.""All in all it was an ok book, but I wouldn't read it again and I would recommend it either.",2,0.8499,0.08,0.823,0.096,0.6617283950617283,NEGATIVE,0.9995

In a nutshell, it examined how grief and deceit between family members and how they were profoundly affected negatively for years to come. That's pretty deep subject matter but the author just didn’t succeed in writing a good book in my opinion. The book completely looses the fact that sadness is fine and dandy but when the characters are shallow and self absorbed, it doesn't matter and all the author's deep thoughts are lost. And this is coming from a person who just loves sappy depressing books! What got me was the sadness was not enlightening but self-serving. For me I’ve got to see the light and the end of the tunnel or else it’s too much wretchedness. I don’t want to think there are just horrible people out there with no morally standing. I know people like that exist, but I certainly don’t want to read about them. And this is one of the reasons this book failed miserably.For example, I keep on remembering this tacky scene where the wife is cheating on the husband and she throws her shirt of while jumps into the arms of another man. Now all I can think about is wow, why was she was wearing a flamingo shirt?! The whole point in that scene was not to be more concerned about the poor fashion taste of the 80's! The whole drama and emotional implications of the affair were completely and totally lost on me because I didn’t give a damn if she cheated or not. Wasn’t I supposed to care she’s cheating? Well I thought it was disappointing that the wife (plus everyone else in the book) kept on justifying all her horrible choices because she was so selfish and felt wronged. Didn’t her mom teach her “two wrongs don’t make a right?” Hello! This concept was drastically at odds with the whole concept of the book because the character didn’t improve much. I’ll stop ranting now, but after reading this book, now I know why it was made into a Lifetime movie! Because it's CORNY!",2,-0.9929,0.206,0.673,0.12,0.5646616541353382,NEGATIVE,1.0

Carolyn cannot go through with this, and runs away with the baby.Obviously, there are going to be some problems, and I wanted to know the outcome, of how someone could live with this terrible deception and what it will do to the people involved.

This was sadly diluted, however, by frequent introductions of minor characters who seem to show no other purpose than allow for endlessly descriptive, dull, detours and passages that delayed getting to any kind of resolution. The experience of reading this book is like being told that something monumental and significant is about to be announced, like you are holding the winning ticket in a contest, and then enduring a great deal of hype and then getting told something anti-climactic and lame, like ""you just won a $2.00 off coupon.""

The doctor/ husband is delivering his wife's baby pg 12 ""He sat on a low stool and reached up into the soft warm cave of his wife's body.""Now i am not particularly squeamish about childbirth, nor any other aspect of sex or child raising, but there is something about the choice of language for descriptions in this book that i found unsettling... much the same way how many people feel uncomfortable at the usage of the word ""moist."" In my opinion, things could have been phrased much cleaner.Another example, referring to the wife breastfeeding pg 36,""Her milk flowed and mysteriously, Norah felt herself becoming a river wind, encompassing everything: the daffodils on the dresser and the grass growing sweetly and silently outside, the new leaves pressing open against the buds of trees. Tiny Larvae, white as seed pearls and hidden in the ground, transforming themselves into caterpillars, inchworms and bees. Birds in winged flight, calling. All this was hers.""To me this reads like bad poetry and a lot of hot air, or maybe more like it was destined to be another cheesy lifetime movie. Isn't that exactly what it wound up being?

This is as troubling a moral marital drama setup as they come, so thumbs up! The story goes on quite well for a moment after that, with David guiltily covering up his tracks (he admits to his wife that she had twins, but claims the daughter was dead-born) and Norah grieving and somehow sensing there's something wrong.But then Norah just goes crazy for decades, obsessing about her loss (and she doesn't know or suspect there's more to it than that, and never confronts her husband about it), David withdraws and takes to photography, and Caroline stubbornly bravely thwarts David's attempts to get back in touch.And that's pretty much what happens, for hundreds of long pages.

In my own life, I wonder if tragedy could have been averted by a slight delay in traffic or stopping to tie a shoe. Is it fate? Karma?

The descriptions are sometimes long and banal. The characters basically did not really earn any emotion from me. I did not like them or hate them or sympathize with them or respect them.... nothing. Therefore I did not really want to read about their feelings, loves, hates, frustration etc. I just followed on in order to know the plot. I am sure this is a good book to discuss in book clubs, schools etc..... Why did this character feel this and why did that character feel that. As entertainment for my mind it failed. I do admit that I did get a bit emotional at the end of the book and this added a star to the rating. ",2,-0.1099,0.128,0.746,0.126,0.5048196248196248,NEGATIVE,1.0

The only reason I got this book was because I was trying out a new book app on my iPhone. I was quite surprised when I started reading it, and kept reading it until I finished.Synopsis: In 1964 Dr. Henry delivers his twins, the son is perfect, the daughter has Down’s Syndrome. Dr. Henry sends his daughter away, the general feeling at that time was people with Down’s Syndrome were ‘retarded’, had numerous health problems, could not be productive members of society and died young. His actions are understandable, inexcusable, but understandable. He asks his nurse to take the baby to an institution and tells his wife the baby dies. The nurse disappears with the baby and raises her as her own.This book teaches a lesson about the folly of prejudging people and how the best intentions can lead to one being bit on the backside so to speak. It does this without being preachy, it just tells the story of how Dr. Henry’s life and marriage fall apart, and how Caroline finds love and a fulfilled life with the baby that was supposed to die.

Although this is supposed to be his central plot point, he doesn’t seem to reflect on it much, other than to consider the consequences on his family.

264,2511848453,11/16/2018,4.0," A Memory Keeper’s Daughter showed me a different way of looking at life. Each chapter had a new struggle and learning experience. Each stereotype I had was quickly proven wrong by the characters in this story. They were each faced with impossible choices and while I blame David for making a horrible one, I can’t say that I would make a better choice than some of the other characters.  Kim Edwards wrote about a doctor who delivered his own children on a snowy night. He delivered a healthy baby boy and a girl with down syndrome. He gave up his daughter after remembering the grief of losing his sister at a young age. The nurse took care of the daughter from that moment onward while the mother was led to believe the baby had died. I started the book by immediately hating David. I thought the way he lied to Norah to get her to talk to him was creepy and he was weirdly obsessed with bones. I believe he made the wrong decision in giving up Phoebe and consequently ruined everyone else’s lives. David was so overcome by his guilt that he was never a good father to Paul and became an emotionally abusive husband to Norah. He thought he was saving Norah a lot of heartache by giving her child away. I thought it was ironic that in the end, he caused her more pain than he saved her from.   I assumed that Paul would have a better life since he did not have to deal with the struggles of down syndrome. Instead, Caroline built a stable, loving home in Pittsburgh with Doro and Al. Phoebe was always supported and given all the attention she needed. Caroline fought for Phoebe’s right to education and made Phoebe believe she could accomplish anything. On the other hand, David’s guilt consumed him day and night. He could not look at Paul without thinking of Phoebe and talk to Norah without being afraid of being caught in a lie. Paul spent his life trying to prove himself to his dad and not understanding why he couldn’t. Norah looked for love in affairs and spent as much time away from home as possible. As a result, Paul suffered with the feeling of never being good enough and became bad at knowing how to love. David thought he was building a better lifestyle. I kept waiting for the moment when David would look at Norah and explain everything. I was angered that he never did. He had his last opportunity on Norah’s birthday and again he chickened out. David would never know that his family was reunited and happiness was restored. David hid from his choices in his dark room to relieve him of his guilt. Overall, I thought this was an eye-opening book about the consequences of a split second choice. It also showed that life is met with continuous troubles that must be faced with love and strength.",0,-0.8557,0.141,0.743,0.117,0.5535202523574619,NEGATIVE,0.9699
265,2578330762,11/16/2018,4.0,"The Memory Keeper’s Daughter follows the story of two twins and their families. Norah and David have a healthy baby boy, Paul, along with a baby girl that appears to have Down syndrome. David had a sister with a chronic disease growing up, and saw the effect that had on his mother. Fearing what would happen to him and his wife, he gives the nurse the baby girl, Phoebe, to take away and tells his wife that it was born blue. However the nurse, Caroline refuses to give Phoebe to an institution once she saw the conditions in in and decides to raise her herself. The book then follows Paul and Phoebe’s families and lives, providing woven parallels through both of their lives. While Paul lives in a “perfect” appearing family, with two married parents, a father who is a Doctor, and a wife who can stay at home, because of the secret David’s hiding behind the family falls apart from the inside out, and Paul grows up in a stressful household full of secrets and conflict. Ironically, this is what David was attempting to avoid by giving away Phoebe, but that becomes the cause of the family’s pain. Caroline takes Phoebe to take care of herself, and finds a caretaking job, and eventually a husband and is given a house. While Caroline and Phoebe start with nearly nothing, Caroline’s love and determination provides a nurturing environment that allows Phoebe to grow to her full potential, even was able to get married, with a very sturdy family and psychological environment. Caroline always had Phoebe’s best interest at heart, while David was unable to look past his own fears and wants and ends up affecting his family. Throughout the book the author is very visually descriptive. I appreciate these descriptions as they help provide a placement for each scene, character, and emotion in the book. While at times it can be frustrating when there’s dramatic events going on, it almost helps as you experience frustration with the characters in the book. While David’s character does horrible things, the book portrays him as needing sympathy, and while I do feel bad for him at some points, what he did caused terrible things to other people and it becomes inexcusable. I enjoyed the deep analysis into each character this book provides, even minor ones, such as Norah’s sister, has an important story and part. Events in this book are not wasted. While sometimes slow and a bit dramatic, a generally did enjoy this story with colorful descriptions and inside looks into multiple character’s minds. It also teaches the importance of self-sacrifice and sympathy. This book is extremely clever, with two lives and stories woven into one book.

266,208801813,09/08/2019,2.0,"I found it difficult to rate this book – I was stuck between two and three stars. Goodreads’ categories helped me decide: three stars is “liked it” whereas two stars is “it was OK”, and it truly was just OK.The novel starts its story in 1964. Dr David Henry is forced by a blizzard to deliver his own twins. His son is born first, perfectly healthy. Born second, his daughter has Down’s Syndrome. In a split-second decision based on his own life experiences, David knows that his daughter’s prognosis is not good and asks his nurse, Caroline, to take the baby to an institution and pretend she died, keeping his secret forever. He tells his wife, Norah, that their daughter was dead when she arrived, and his lie is set in stone. However, Caroline cannot bring herself to take the Henrys’ daughter to an institution, fearing what may become of her there. Instead she disappears and raises the child herself, far away. On the one hand, I liked the sections of the book following Caroline who has to make difficult decisions and find a way to survive with a baby all alone, in a society where being an unmarried mother was still frowned upon. Her life was interesting and satisfying, because she did everything she could to make little Phoebe’s life the best it could be.On the other hand, I found the longer, more frequent passages about the Henrys and their son Paul more difficult to read. I know that it was meant to be this way – the secret held by David eroded the sense of safety and security within the family and they began to implode in different ways. It was difficult to watch David and Norah spiral in depression and grief, throwing themselves into any pursuits but building a successful marriage, drifting further and further from one another. Even Paul has a hard time because of the tense environment he has grown up in. I think I rated the book as I did because it was tough to read and ultimately not very satisfying. These flawed people living flawed, secretive lives with no real reward was challenging. At the end there is some closure, some sense of moving forward, but I didn’t care much about the new relationships in the characters’ lives. Perhaps the fact was that I didn’t care much about the characters, characterised so much by their grief and dysfunction, so when they started to heal and be happy I didn’t feel satisfied.",0,0.9617,0.098,0.776,0.125,0.5849326599326599,NEGATIVE,0.9996

And when this came through as I checked it out in audio format, with the picture of what looks like a christening gown, I was like, ""Eesh. Here we go."" This is one of the picks for the Schaumburg library book club, not a thing I would gravitate toward and I did my best to give it a fair shake but this is not for me.Its the 1960s and Doctor whatever his name and his wife, whatever her name, are excited to welcome their new baby into this world. They got engaged in like, 5 minutes, and he is a lot older than her so already, great match, what could go wrong? When they are surprised with twins, and he identifies that his daughter has down syndrome he makes the choice to ask the nurse to take her away. Yup. Yuuuuuuuup. Because his sister was sick and died and he never got over it or whatever but C'MON MAN. Come. The Heck. On. And hilarity ensues. And by ""hilarity"" I mean ""years and years of silence and betrayal and awkwardness and geez just get divorced already.""For me, this is yet another book that tugs on the heartstrings of the reader by having the characters be in self-created agony, largely because they choose to keep secrets rather than communicate. Maybe it is because I tend to be an open person, but nothing drives me battier in literature than characters who have created their own problems by refusing to be honest with each other.I don't know if I can say this is a bad book, but I did not like it.

268,2018039251,06/02/2017,4.0," The book, ""The Memory Keeper's Daughter"", by Kim Edwards, was a good book. This book is about a doctor and his wife who have twins, and when noticing the daughter has Down's Syndrome, he orders the nurse to take her away. She then end up raising her as her own. It was a good book because it explored many different opinions of the situation that was present in the characters' life, it maintained a well balanced view of opinions, and it showed the heartbreak of the situation.  One reason I enjoyed this book is because it explored the feeling of everyone. The book managed to do so by being of a third-person omniscient point-of-view. This way, the author could tell how everyone was feeling, not just one person's opinions. Another reason I enjoyed this book is because of the set up of the chapters. I believe that these chapters were set up well because one chapter would be about the family with Paul, and the next would be about the family of Phoebe. This made a nice balance and showed where everyone was at the same time. Lastly, I enjoyed this book because it showed the effects of a situation like what the people in tis book were going through. After thinking that her daughter had died, Norah was heartbroken and it was a common theme throughout the book. I feel like this is a good book. It shows that different perspectives in a rough situation, it is well set up, and it explains what it's like for people who deal with things like a disability or loss everyday.

269,1299308933,05/09/2021,4.0,"Review to come... synopsis for my memory: (view spoiler)[David Henry and his wife, Norah have twins in the middle of a blizzard. The baby girl comes out with Down's Syndrome. David decides it would just be best for everyone if the nurse, Caroline Gill, takes the baby to an institution and he tells his wife the baby died. Norah's grief is so hard to read. It's just all very depressing.Lots of time goes by. The book ends when the twins are in their twenties I think. In this time, Caroline has been raising Phoebe as her own. She has fought for hers and other disabled people's right to go to school and work and do things other people can do. She marries the truck driver who gave her a ride home the night Phoebe was born. He wants to go on adventures. Caroline feels like she can't leave Phoebe. Raising a Down's Syndrome daughter is difficult on many levels. Their story is a fairly happy one, if you forget about where Phoebe came from.Unfortunately, we also get insight into the Henrys' lives over this time and theirs is not happy. David puts a lot of pressure on the son, Paul. David is obviously keeping a huge secret and it causes rifts between the whole family. Norah starts having affairs. Their son Paul isn't happy. NO ONE is happy!After a while David meets (in a really weird way) Rosemary, who he tells the whole awful story to and he helps her over the years, as some sort of making up for not being there for his own daughter I guess?

270,4173129265,08/13/2021,4.0,"I enjoyed reading this book - I liked following the chronicle of the lives of David and Norah and Caroline over the 25 year span of the book. I liked the positive storyline of Phoebe and Caroline and Al, and how Phoebe had her limitations but grew up safe and capable and happy - thanks in part to Caroline's grit and determination to get her an education. I would definitely recommend this book.As a 65 year old happily married gentleman, I would confess to an old fashioned resentment of the ""bad guy"" treatment of David - all of the characters in this book were nuanced and not black and white, and David was no different in that sense. He was a great doctor who grew up dirt poor and achieved tremendous Horatio Alger-like success both technically and artistically, and was a doctor for the right reasons, turning down a profitable practice in his 50's and providing lower cost care to patients at a clinic thereafter. He had a terrible childhood experience in losing his sickly sister June at 12 years old, and probably needed a lot of therapy for that but never got any - and that shaped his efforts to shield his family from experiencing the worst of a Downs Syndrome baby. A very bad decision, that he could never undo. But in his own way he valued family and tried to provide a good life for Norah and Paul, and at least took financial responsibility for Phoebe. I did not like the author's choice to make Norah, a somewhat self-absorbed serial adulterer who allowed her son to be a spoiled brat much of the time, to get ""heroine"" treatment in this book. David made a bad mistake and a mistake which would in today's world (vs 1964) be repulsive, but Norah was no heroine.",0,0.9471,0.149,0.661,0.19,0.5131581117295403,POSITIVE,0.9916
271,170706550,05/24/2011,1.0,"Sometimes I fall in love with a concept or a description of a book. When the idea doesn't turn out the way I'd hoped I get bitter. Then I take it out on the book by deducting stars. I really was so interested in this book. I knew it wouldn't be all rosy, but I didn't expect to feel all out loathing for Norah, the person I'm supposed to feel the most sympathy for.I could tell almost right away this book would be a struggle for me. And not because of content. Because the author's writing style is tedious. Important things are skimmed over, the irrelevant are given too much time. The sight of dust, the feeling of breast feeding. Now, I am not repulsed by breast feeding. I think it's natural, but there's only so many times I can hear about how it makes Norah feel like a river before I'm quite done. I don't really understand why for the entire first chapter no names are used. I'd think using names would help draw a reader into this sad story. So, obviously, the story begins with a doctor and his wife rushing to the hospital as the wife goes into labor. The doctor delivers a set of twins with the help of a nurse who has a crush on him. The unexpected second child is born with Down Syndrome. The Dr. Henry, traumatized by the childhood death of his sister from heart related problems, asks the nurse to discreetly bring the child to a home that would be best suited for caring for her. He tells his wife that there was a second baby but that she died. In reality the nurse, unable to leave the baby, takes the baby and moves.Dr. Henry's actions, under a modern light, are appalling. But I think we have to think of the times. Even if they'd kept Phoebe, she would have been in a home. You simply didn't raise your own child if they were born with such a genetic problem. Dr. Henry knew his wife, and as we see her melt down over the smallest things, I'd say he could see Norah had zero ability to handle the situation. From the stress of one baby Norah becomes an alcoholic, even driving her child around while drunk. I have zero tolerance for such things and nothing could have won me over to Dr. Henry more than his wife's behavior. Her struggles with postpartum and depression are severe and biological- not having to do with the loss of Phoebe.Caroline, the nurse raising Phoebe, turns out to be exactly who needed to be raising her. She fights for her daughter. She doesn't break down, she picks herself up and does what's needed. She doesn't break from pressure. Norah would never have fought for Phoebe the way Caroline did. The scenes where Dr. David Henry is talking to his young son are so touching. Always patient, always lowering himself to his son's level. He is by far the better parent. You can see David trying with his wife. He still adores Norah, he tries to capture everyday things about her, but that makes her angry. He compliments her, brings her flowers, brags about her to others. She is filled with nothing but disdain. Why? It's not like she knows about Phoebe. Norah knows David works hard to keep his family comfortable. That's a way of showing love. Norah complains about the walls he's put up again and again, but she's the only one we actually see retreating. I can't tell you how disgusted and angry I was at Norah's affairs. The first one, Howard, was so bold as to begin to touch her in the presence of her husband. It made me want to vomit. She complains that her husband is detached, and has to tell herself not to move way from him when he moves towards her to show affection, but this random man groping her in the dark is exciting? She hates that her husband takes pictures of her, but when this random disgusting stranger does she thinks it's great. Disgusting Howard lied and said that he was getting a divorce, but even after Norah knows he's going home to a wife and three kids she doesn't care. She thinks David doesn't see her and in her selfishness doesn't realize her son and husband discovered her affair. She has others, and yet has the gall to be suspicious when David tries to help a young pregnant girl? After having several affairs he could have actually moved a girlfriend in and been in the right in my book. The way David reacts to Paul, he's the most patient father. He deserves better than the loathing everyone in his life feels for him. Paul trashes the photos David worked so hard on and his father tells him he will have to spend the time helping him fix it, even missing rehearsals. 13 year old Paul says no. Because he loves music. And David doesn't push it. Really? I'd like to slap that kid. Again and again David proves his love, and Paul rejects him. I couldn't take it. In the end Paul still feels his dad should have apologized to him. I liked Rosemary. The random girl David finds and supports. She actually knows David, sees how good he is, and gives him the family he deserved. She's the only reason I finished this book. I only wish she would have screamed at Norah and Paul.When David dies Norah comments that the only reason people come to his funeral is his free clinic. They thought he was a saint but hadn't been married to him so wouldn't know. I wish she would have had that one moment where she wondered, had she been wrong about him all along? Was it in fact she who didn't see him? Norah is too selfish for that. Even when Norah finally meets Phoebe, she proves her selfishness. She immediately asks Phoebe to leave her mother, her boyfriend, her life, and live with her. She thinks she's being nice, but she just further demonstrates her inability to display empathy or feel that Phoebe has anything in her life worth staying for. The book could have slightly redeemed itself if Norah and Paul had become aware of their selfishness. If Norah could have just broken down and realized all the years she shoved her husband when he needed her is what had ruined their marriage. Norah's internal dialogue prove she wouldn't have been happy in any role because she herself was unsettled. If Paul had realized ALL parents are going to try to encourage their kids not to pursue only music. Side note. I hated Bree. Why exactly did she dislike David? Because he worked hard? Because he liked taking pictures? In any scene with them both he is always kind and polite. Get over yourself you harpy.  ",0,-0.9801,0.143,0.733,0.124,0.5555631141345426,NEGATIVE,0.9999
272,2288729917,02/25/2018,4.0,"Beautifully written! The way Edwards illustrates emotions and inner thoughts through the subtle words and actions of the characters is brilliant. She explores how people grow and change through time and how certain moments can shape the course life takes.Even though I enjoyed the story telling style I often got annoyed with the decisions of the characters and the turn the story took. I like myself a happy forever after and the ending seemed abrupt and too little too late. But I guess thats life, it doesnt turn out as we expect and it mostly never ends perfectly tied up in a bow. This story is about a decision that shaped the lives of many people. David gives away his daughter after discovering she has Downs. He tells his wife that she died and only her twin brother survived. The baby girl is actually given to a nurse who raises her as her own. We follow both families over the years as time passes and life happens. The supposed death of Davids daughter acts as a catalyst that changes his relationship with his wife and affects every decision he makes including his relationship with his son. In the end David dies and Caroline comes to Davids wife Norah and tells her the truth. By then the twins are in their 20s. Norah and her son Paul get to meet their daughter/sister and alls well.",0,0.9122,0.053,0.839,0.107,0.7022408963585435,POSITIVE,1.0

I consulted my Goodreads Want to Read list for ideas and when I sorted it oldest to newest by date added, this book rose to the top. I added it to my ""To Read"" list in 2009 (!). I have no idea why I waited so long. The Memory Keeper's Daughter is a poignant, realistic and heartbreaking story. The book opens in a midwest snowstorm in 1964, as Norah and Dr. David Henry await the impending birth of their first child. The storm and the pre-dawn hours predicate that Norah must deliver at the clinic of her orthopedic surgeon husband rather than the hospital she intended. Dr. Henry's long-time nurse, Caroline Gill assists him with the delivery, and as was the custom at the time, is the one who administers the gas that renders Norah mostly unconscious for the arrival of her baby. Of course, things don't go as expected and after she delivers her healthy baby boy, she pushes out a baby girl, who even at first glance by her father and the nurse, has all physical signs of Down's Syndrome. Making a decision that will alter the course of all three of their lives, Dr. Henry instructs Caroline to take the baby girl to an institution for the feebleminded and tells Norah that their baby girl was born still. Caroline, shaken and exhausted, does as Dr. Henry asks, but as she waits in the anteroom at the facility, she realizes she cannot leave the baby and without forethought, takes her out the door and back to her apartment. What follows is the parallel stories of the Henry family, haunted by the absence of their son Paul's twin, and fractured by the secret that David shoulders, and Caroline & Phoebe who struggle with everything you'd imagine in 1960s America as a single mom raising a special needs child.Highly recommend!",0,-0.3425,0.041,0.913,0.046,0.4183730158730159,POSITIVE,0.9999

Not a lot happens in terms of events, however, you get drawn into the inner workings of three of the characters (David, Caroline, Norah) and, towards the end, you learn a little more about how everything has impacted Paul too.The story kicks off in 1965, when David (an orthopedic surgeon) is forced to deliver his own children due to a severe snowstorm. The birth happens in the local clinic, however, due to the storm only David, Norah and Caroline the nurse are present. To David's surprise, it turns out that two babies are waiting to enter the world that morning. The first, a boy (Paul), is perfect in all ways. The second, his sister, Phoebe, is born with Down's Syndrome. At this point, David makes a decision, driven largely by his experiences of his own sister, that changes the lives and relationships of everyone in that room forever.The story moves in gaps of five-ish years, told mostly through the voices of David, Caroline and Norah. The writing is luxurious, with delicate detail around the small things, that is beautiful without being overwhelming.

For example, in many instances, I found myself getting angry at Dr. Henry for sending his daughter away just because she had down syndrome. It is one of those books that you think about even when you are not reading it. I often found myself visibly shaking my head at the toxic dynamin of the Henry family. They were all so dysfunctional and I couldn’t help but feel like a fourth party in the middle of their arguments. If I feel like I am part of the book, then I know the author did a fantastic job. My favorite character had to be Caroline. Her growth throughout the book was so noticeable. She was a loner who hated herself and just wanted love at the beginning of the book, but by the end, she was a loving mother who cared for an unwanted child to the best of her ability. She gave Phoebe a life that she may never have had if she took Dr. Henry’s advise and left her at an asylum. This book is not one for the faint of heart. It depicts a family in emotional turmoil, all because a man had a moment of panic when one of his babies had down syndrome, sent her away, and told his wife that she died.

279,267603633,01/25/2012,1.0,"I’ve been reading this book for 3 1/2 months . This is the longest book that I’ve read continuously, I mean. I usually skip a book and leave it for a year then comeback and read it again from the start in just a matter of 3 days one week the most. So in a way, this book is the longest one that I’ve read so far (and it looks like it has a competition now… ).I usually shy away from this type of genre. Family drama which is pretty odd since I actually loved watching it on-screen. So when I read the premise of the book I was intrigued.The first few chapters are really good. The pacing is fast and I was turning pages eager to what would happen next…. But after the funeral scene (wherein David Henry and Norah “buried” Phoebe). It was a letdown. The story became too dragging for me. This is the book that I hate half of the characters particularly David Henry (which IMO has no redeeming qualities) or the author was not able to addressed that effectively. I just find the reason of him giving away Phoebe is because of what happened to June and he just want to spare Norah from heartache and grief on the possibility of losing a child. His view is so myopic that I end up thinking he is stupid. As if telling your wife that her daughter is dead would not cause heartache . IMO, it is still the same, death of a child no matter how old or young would still bring immense grief. Norah, I never really liked how the author presented her, I should sympathize with her but I end up not liking her . Her main conflict was that she had many affairs whilst still married to David because her husband was drifting away from her but she failed to translate to me the main reason why she did that in the first place. All through out the marriage, the couple never seemed to addressed it which I guess is what the author wants so that it would all come into place with the big reveal. However, the reveal came to flat for me. For all the build up that the author did and that’s just it. I felt the last parts were a rush.Paul Henry, he seemed to be a good character. The author actually have written him with more depth (apart from David) than any other character. However, I felt like his reason hating David was quite superficial. Angsty teenager because dad does not want him to go to Julliard (screams white people problems to me ). I mean, in the first few chapters while growing up, the author described them having a pretty good relationship. Takes trips together, albeit David always being on-call. But I don’t get the deep anger that Paul had on the last chapters. I would have understood that if David never really paid that much attention to him and would compare him to a girl (his own age). The whole music over medicine, it’s a typical scenario that for me does not warrant Paul having that anger over his father. Plus, in the end, David allowed him to do what he wants but he is still so emo over it .The only redeeming characters in this book is Caroline’s family. Caroline, Al, and Phoebe. Maybe because the author presented them as the polar opposite of the Henry family. Caroline is written quite good, a headstrong woman who loved and cared for someone who is not her flesh and blood. Phoebe is written very charmingly, I have to give props to the author about it. However, Al is the weakest link amongst the three. The author failed to develop his character well, to think that he is Phoebe’s father. I think she just wrote it for the sake of romance which was mehhh to me. Caroline and Al’s conflict centers around him being away from them, from her. What do you expect? You married a truck driverI actually liked Rosemary but she was introduced pretty late. She would have been a good rival of Paul while growing up and would have given him more reason to hate David. Although, I did sense that but just a bit though, the author never really delved into that relationship any further.Michelle is a waste of book pages, for me she’s just written as a filler. I felt more with Robert and Phoebe’s relationship over Michelle and Paul. Bree, supposed to be an interesting character but never gave anything to the table. Her conflict was not even good. The cancer storyline would have been better but I felt the author just did that to make Bree some sort of important character. She’s just there. Doro was written better and her character added some sort of twist in Caroline’s life. Frederic, I felt he was just written to gave Norah some sort of happy ending. But damn, why can’t she just be alone and be successful? Why does a man and a wedding needed for her to have some sort of fulfillment? I would have liked it if Norah had built a relationship with Phoebe over her marriage to Frederic.Apart from characterization, I also had problem on how the author presented the story. The important parts were rammed in the last few pages of the book. And the reveal was after David died. I would have liked it if David was still alive and the reveal came earlier because it would provide better conflict between the two families. I just felt like the author wanted the families to have a connection because of Phoebe but she failed to do so and ended up with this is the Henry family and this is the Simpson family. Their lives were not really intertwined. Another thing is I would have loved if Caroline and David have a bit of involvement romantically and she and Al were not yet married, it would have raised more conflict, and would have given Al some sort of character. He’s boring.The ending sucks…. Paul and Phoebe singing on David’s grave…. It was such a huge letdown for me… I was like that’s it…. I wasted time for just it I did not like the book at all. The author spent her time describing the flowers and skies and what not and failed to create good characters in which you could sympathize and somewhat understand where their emotions are coming from. The book failed to connect to me as a reader. I was just reading for the sake of finishing this book.",0,0.424,0.108,0.782,0.111,0.4709967320261438,NEGATIVE,1.0

The story has promise: a father’s split second decision defines the rest of not only his life, but of unsuspecting others’. Too soon, though, the story is bogged down with flimsy overtures that never go anywhere. Honestly, it was a struggle to make it through. Last, I’m truly disappointed in the seemingly dismissive development of Phoebe, the intellectually disabled daughter that was given away. It’s as if she’s an afterthought, and everything that describes her is pure stereotype. What’s worse, she’s used as a hook on the back cover, and you enter the story expecting to understand how her life was impacted by her father’s decision.

294,70480695,10/24/2017,4.0,"A well written and well researched family drama. The story is told through four different povs who each have their own unique voice and with whom I could all sympathise. A strong and touching story that asks some interesting questions. Don't expect a hugely literary read, this is not what the book is trying to be. It's nice light reading and if you don't read twenty books at the same time like me it's probably a very quick read too. Four hundred and something pages that go by very fast. Would highly recommend to anyone who enjoyed The Light Between Oceans and personally think this is a much better read.",0,0.9701,0.0,0.795,0.205,0.6134313725490196,POSITIVE,0.9998

I finally decided to bring it with me on a trip so I could leave it behind when I was finished with it. The premise was interesting - The year is 1964: a man's decision to give his newborn ""Down syndrome"" twin daughter away while keeping her ""normal"" brother. He tells his wife that their daughter died during childbirth. The book follows the next 24 years and the repercussions his decision has on everyone involved. I found the main characters to be unlikable; which most likely affects my rating of this book. 2.75",0,-0.4709,0.055,0.915,0.03,0.5072222222222222,NEGATIVE,1.0

As Edwards weaves together the story of four people whose lives are irrevocable impacted by one secret, you find yourself drawn into each character one by one to experience their anger, heartbreak and loss as though it were your own. This book is like a fine wine; it should be savored one long sip at a time. ",0,0.631,0.123,0.706,0.171,0.6625000000000001,POSITIVE,0.9999
297,2341945107,06/17/2020,4.0,"First and foremost, I was so impressed by this author’s ability to write such an incredible book without graphic sex and tons of vulgar language. Many seem to think their novels require those things, but this book just shows that they’re not necessary to hook a reader. This reader definitely appreciated that. There were points in the story when other authors would have taken the opportunity to... embellish. But these moments weren’t the focus of the story and she was able to keep them classy. I loved this story. While I wouldn’t call it a “happy” story, it was still one of the better stories I’ve read in a while. It was emotional, heartfelt, and suspenseful. Very well-written.
