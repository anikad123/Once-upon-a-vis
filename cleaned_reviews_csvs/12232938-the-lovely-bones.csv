1,13316930,01/23/2008,1.0,"Haaaaaated it. I am one of those OCD literary nerds who takes on a war bunker mentality with books that I've started and dislike: ""I will see this through to the end."" For ""The Lovely Bones,"" I made an exception.Somewhere, sometime, someone told Sebold she could write. That person should be made to apologize to me, in person, and to all other poor souls who were duped into buying this shlock. The literary press also needs to break out the cattails for a serious bout of flogging. Lev Grossman of Time Magazine is at the top of my flogging docket; he called this book ""a beautiful, sensitive, melancholy novel"" and repeated that claim a year later in a review for a book called ""The Dogs of Babel"" (a book just as terrible as The Lovely Bones). I can only assume that Mr. Grossman confined his reading to the zeros on the check accompanying the publisher's blurb or else has some sort of vitamin deficiency that causes his brain to process ham-handed tripe as ""beautiful"" art.It was Mr. Grossman's review along with the alluring premise of the novel (a young girl posthumously tries to make sense of the events that led to her death) that led me to order ""The Lovely Bones"" and ""The Dogs of Babel,"" which at the time were only available in hardcover. Financial reasons made this an extremely uncommon practice for me, and my experience reading both of those novels ensured that I would never do so again.To further illustrate how absolutely wretched this novel is, I'm going to provide a paragraph of background. The ""substance"" of the novel will be criticized in the subsequent body of this review.During the summer of 2003, I was occupying space as an intern at a company that accepted me at the last minute and had nothing for me to do. The company was white-collar and behemoth in office space. HR sent me to an deserted floor to file documents that took up, at most, 2 hours of my 8-hour day. Even in this vacuum of monotony, I could not finish this book. I chose to watch paint chip away, and pick up dust bunnies with recycled paper (I didn't have a broom) rather than finish this book.So with that said, I suppose I should actually mention something specific about the book I hated. My caveat here is that I am unwilling to punish myself by picking through a copy of the book for textual examples. I'm going by memory and online synopses alone.The narrator and victim is ""Susie Salmon."" Let me stop there. SUSIE SALMON. That really should have clued me in, but I was too eager to see how the author would represent the afterlife, to catch a glimpse of this beautiful pain of looking a life that goes on without you.Unfortunately, Sebold managed to bleach out anything remotely interesting out of the plot in spectacular fashion. Heaven is a school, you see, not that Susie spends much time there or learns anything. Her rapist and murderer is a creepy loser while somehow being the dullest of all of Sebold's numerous dull characters. The ""reason"" for his murderous tendencies could be guessed by anyone who's ever even heard of a pop psychology book.You'd think her family would at least be interesting in grief, but Sebold reduces them to one note drones. Everything in The Lovely Bones is a gimmick, played cheaply for sentiment and with no other reward. I'd compare to a Hallmark movie, but Hallmark movies do not adopt the pretension that Sebold belabors with terrible pseudo-post-modernist metaphors. All of this would be bad enough, but what made me throw this book ""aside with great force"" is the offensive, and unjustifiable resolution to Susie's laments that she did not get to live. This unfairness, although poorly developed, was at least a cause of sympathy until Susie decides to forcibly correct it at the expense of others. In the hands of someone else, this last turn could've been bleak insight into motivations of the cycle of victimization but Sebold conveys not one iota of ambivalence.Much of my hatred of this novel results from its inexplicable popularity and commendation from people who have a responsibility to promote reading. I shudder to think who else picked up this novel convinced it was the best that the contemporary literary world had to offer. It is not my intention to slam those who enjoyed this book. If you did, I am glad to hear it. I love books, and I want others to love books. I simply fear that someone who is tempted out of a long vacation from reading might pick up a novel like this and give up the cause for lost.",353,0.8996,0.112,0.762,0.126,0.5340842490842489,NEGATIVE,1.0
2,6577751,09/21/2007,5.0,"I worked at Borders for more than a year and I worked the boring ass registers, usually at night whic was always slow. I leaned there with my chin in my hand staring at the shelves actually wishing that I could help customers in their purchases. It's purely insane, but I think that's what happens anytime you place someone in any kind of confinement. The thing is that if I wasn't a register girl, I would have constant actual contact with the books themselves. All lunacy aside, one book that I stared at the entire time was this one, cuz it was literally on the number one shelf in the front of the store for a good two years or so. It sounded interesting and got good critical reviews despite its sucess with the bookish Oprah-watching housewife types. So, I REALLY didn't wanna jump on the bandwagon and read it. But at the same time I would open it and try. But I just didn't get into it. Last week or so, I was reading a friend's blog and she talked about reading the book and how it was so affecting that she found herself driving to work in complete tears. From then on an invisible seed had been planted. I went to the library the other day to pay my fines ($2.75! Man.) and suddenly remembered the book. I read it in three nights. Sebold's voice is entirely unique. Never seen it before ever. I think that being allowed into the vision and point of view of another person is probably one of the awesomest feelings ever. I think that's what it is to be in love, actually. Get in someone's skin, sit in a recliner in a little theatre located behind their eye sockets, and just watch. Not judge, not worry, not affect. Just experience someone who is so not you. Sebold allows this on two levels. She sets you up in the front row seat right next to Susie the murdered and raped 14 year old while she watches her former world from Heaven. But she also delivers this language that is new, original, totally fresh and yet entirely accessible. At 3am. In bed. From a free city library borrow.Her characters are completely amazing individuals, but not unreal or impossible. The way she wrote the book, from Suzie's viewpoint, was definitely some work on her part. And she pulls it off. What I really enjoyed is the way she would sneak in these little pieces of info - I call them "" 'omg, are you serious?' mystery info nuggets"". She would just be writing a scene, and at an unsuspecting moment she'd just add in a little sentence. And ofcourse, since the story revolves around the grief of the family and the Susie's unsolved case, their are moment of utter thrill as the reader joins the characters in their search for understanding, motive and the killer himself. The sentences feel like when you've been looking for something non-urgent for a while, and it's not really a big deal to find it now or later, but when you do find it your like, 'Man, now I can do this, and this and that, cuz I finally found this thing that I've been inactively searching for for a while'. So, the nuggets definitely keep you reading and sometimes they even make you say, 'omg' out loud. As always, if you read the first few pages and hate it, then don't force the feeling. Just cuz I thought it was a total modern classic, don't mean anything if it really ain't your thing. Either way, truly a great story, even if your mom thinks so too.",314,0.9889,0.067,0.811,0.122,0.4990418346021794,NEGATIVE,0.9156

This leads him into the arms of the latest victim’s mother (who, incidentally, reminds him of his dead wife - eww).-Mrs. Singh – the exotic, wise, independent, and strong foreigner who calmly dispenses cool sage-like personal advice to near-strangers.-George Harvey – the ‘odd-but-harmless neighbor’ otherwise know as the psychotic pedophile/murderer who builds dollhouses in his spare time.

Small blessings. Cliché after cliché. If you haven’t already gotten a sense of the hackneyed construction of this book please re-read the first page of this rant. Only a sportscaster from some small-town cable station would stand a fighting chance of besting Sebold in a contest of cliché slinging.The EndingWorthy of Hallmark. Every loose end is tied up with nobody owning up to the consequences of their actions (with the exception of Mr. Harvey, because he’s bad, you see). The family is reunited, the murderer is murdered, the daughter marries her high school sweetheart and has a child of her own (thus proving that life does go on…sniff), and lastly, the teenaged ghost of murdered Susie Salmon transcends her personal minor heaven (a staging ground for spirits who persistently cling to the living world) by ‘falling’ back to earth, inhabiting the now 20-something body of a lesbian acquaintance in order to trespass into another person’s home and have sex with the now 20-something boy she had a crush on shortly before her murder. The moral? Only after wilfully experiencing the delightful carnal pleasures of the flesh can one, even the spirit of a murdered teenaged girl, let go of those lost earthly pleasures and move on to a higher and presumably more enlightened plane of existence where you are free to smite those that have wronged you. Touching, really.The Lovely Bones reviews-Why do they always say “brutal” murder or “brutal” rape? Is that opposed to the “wonderful” murders and “superb” rapes in other novels?-Did any of these reviewers even read the book?! They just seem to be reading each other’s reviews, praising the unique first person narrative of a protagonist in heaven and how it deals with such a horrifying topic. The fist person perspective does not offer anything new and the only thing horrifying here is that people consume mind-numbing garbage like this at an alarming rate.-There’s nothing new here.

It is the story of a teenage girl who, after being raped and murdered, watches from her personal Heaven as her family and friends struggle to move on with their lives while she comes to terms with her own death. On December 6, 1973, 14-year-old Susie Salmon takes her usual shortcut home from her school through a cornfield in Norristown, Pennsylvania. George Harvey, her 36-year-old neighbor, a bachelor who builds doll houses for a living, persuades her to look at an underground kid's hideout he constructed in the field. Once she enters, he rapes and murders her, then dismembers her body and puts her remains in a safe that he dumps in a sinkhole, along with throwing her charm bracelet into a pond. Susie's spirit flees toward her personal Heaven, and in doing so, rushes past her classmate, social outcast Ruth Connors, who can see Susie's ghostly spirit. ...تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز سی ام اکتبر سال 2003میلادیعنوان: استخوانهای دوست داشتنی؛ اثر: آلیس سبالد (سیبالد)؛ مترجم: فریدون قاضی نژاد؛ تهران، روزگار، 1382، در 495ص، شابک9643740285؛ چاپ دوم 1383، چاپ چهارم 1384؛ چاپ پنجم 1386؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان ایالات آمریکا سده 21معنوان: استخوانهای دوست داشتنی؛ اثر: آلیس سیبالد؛ مترجم: میترا معتضد؛ تهران، البرز، 1382، در 435ص، شابک 9644423682؛ عنوان: استخوانهای دوست داشتنی؛ اثر: آلیس سیبالد؛ مترجم: فریده اشرفی؛ تهران، مروارید، 1383، در 421ص، شابک 9645881536؛ قهرمان داستان، دختری چهارده ساله، به‌ نام «سوزی» است؛ او پس از آنکه از سوی «جرج هاروی»، مورد تجاوز قرار گرفته، و به قتل می‌رسد، با زبانی کودکانه، و جذاب، رویدادهای پس از مرگ خویش را، روایت می‌کند؛ لحن کودکانه ی «سوزی»، با گذشت سال‌ها، همچنان کودکانه می‌ماند، و این روح، به روایت ماجراهایی می‌پردازد، که در طول ده سال، پیرامون والدین، دوستان، پلیس، و حتی قاتلش، رخ می‌دهد؛ راوی همچنین توصیفی ساده و صمیمی، از بهشتی که در آن مستقر شده، ارائه می‌دهد؛ و ...؛تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 14/06/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 17/05/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی",260,-0.3612,0.079,0.841,0.08,0.3787878787878787,POSITIVE,0.926

I was greatly disappointed.How has this book become such a worldwide success? It's slow, boring and there is no real connection with any of the characters. I found myself disliking everyone in the book.The overall idea could have been very good, even though it isn't exactly original, but I just thought the author didn't make the most of this great idea that she had. The best part of the book, without meaning to sound gruesome and morbid, was the death scene at the beginning. I admit that it was creepy and well told, I read that and geared myself up for a good book. But for me, it was as if the story ended there and the rest was a load of slow-moving waffle. The great idea had come along, happened for a while, and then died a painful death with the protagonist. The characters weren't interesting enough to hold up the rest of the story, I was just relieved when I finally got to the end. It was a painfully boring book... and I've lost count of the times people have told me how much they love it - why? Did I miss something? I honestly feel like I've read a completely different book from everyone else... I do not understand it's popularity at all.",233,0.9386,0.152,0.664,0.185,0.6251851851851852,NEGATIVE,1.0
6,20145272,04/14/2008,1.0,"This book has single handedly shown me that I spend too much time skimming and not enough time really reading and thinking about the books I have been reading. I have two kids and so I'm busy and I often find myself reading when I am stealing time or tired. But that is not even an excuse for this book. When i read the book I thought it was pretty good. Not great, but not bad. I liked the concept and the fact that the girl was the narrator. I like a murder mystery, so I liked the suspense of waiting to see if the guy would get caught, etc. So when all was said and done and I finished the book, I thought - yeah, okay. Not bad, but not great. Then I went online here and read the other reviews, particularly one by TheDane (http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16...) and I went - HEY!! That's right! I mean, the writing alone is something I should have picked up one had I really been paying attention. Pupils pulsing like olives?? Buttering toast with tears?? Umm... I really must have been distracted or skimming like crazy because that is ridiculous. And the real meaning of the final scene went WAY over my head, which I am somewhat ashamed to admit. When I read it, I really was like, yeah yeah, oh that's sweet she got one night with her boyfriend which she had been cheated of and all. But when you slow down and really think of this, the enormity of that is overwhelming. A young girl who dies after being RAPED. A girl who's first sexual experience was RAPE by an older man. A girl who actually barely knew this boy in her life. This girl can only let go of life after having sex. With that boy. That she really didn't know that well. That alone is enough to send of some big alarms. But then you add that she was allowed to go back to earth - to have sex??? Not see her family, not comfort her father and brother and sister? Not point out the killer?? Nope, heaven lets her go back, then of all times, not earlier when she wanted it more, or could have done more both for justice and her family? So the admission to heaven is teen sex? Really? The way to overcome deep grief and gain acceptance and peace is.. again, teen sex? Wow. I missed out as a teen because that was NOT my experience. Okay, now louder warning bells should have been going off. But the final issue - she takes over the body of a ""friend"". Without the girl's knowledge or permission. The ""friend"" who is a lesbian. And uses her body to have sex with a boy. Just taking over her body is a violation. Taking over her body and using that time to have sex is another violation. And to have sex with a boy, knowing that is the antithesis of everything this ""friend"" would have wanted or agreed to is yet another violation. What the hell??? And none of that gets brought up or mentioned. No, it is a feel good ending. yeah! I mean, I have some pretty close friends - some I have known for at least triple the time these two girls have ""known"" each other - and if I somehow managed to just steal their bodies and have sex with a woman?? Well, it would be good for me that I was already dead. That is a betrayal in the worst sense on so many levels it is shocking. And what of the possible consequences? Pregnancy? STDs? Never mind the ""lesser"" consequences of emotional damage, damage to their friendship, the trust issues, etc etc etc????? After thinking about it more and more, I was truly embarrassed to have not seen these dark and disturbing connotations, made all the worse for the fact that the author serves this up as the feel good ending - not noticing the irony at all of having the main character who was raped and violated in turn rape and violate a friend, while denouncing the first act as a heinous crime and lauding the second act as happy ending?

First, I have to say that I liked the movie very much and I've seen it several times. The scenes from In-Between are one of my all-time favourites.

All I'm going to say that even reading quotes gives me the ""tension"" feeling in my jaw, which I usually have right before I'm about to cry. It just breaks my heart. Because of Susie. Because of the real Susies who go through the same thing she did. Because of their families. And because Georges Harveys exist in the real world. “The living deserve attention, too.”But I have to say that this book is right up my alley, I enjoy books when people die and get a chance to relive their last day to make things right, where they are still there and watch their families.

10,1449874070,08/24/2020,5.0,"THE LOVELY BONES by Alice Sebold earned 5 intense stars from me!My Tease…Heaven’s Inbetween is for “the watchers,” those souls who aren’t ready to leave behind their connections to Earth. Souls…who have unanswered questions or unfinished business. Who haven’t learned to accept their deaths.Fourteen-year-old Susie Salmon is a watcher. Although Susie knows that Mr. Harvey (whose house is in her neighborhood) raped and murdered her, none of the living know. At least Susie’s father and her younger sister Lindsey have growing suspicions about the loner who has a bird’s-eye-view of Susie’s junior high school and the adjacent sports- and corn- fields from his second floor window. Trouble is, the police have no evidence to implicate Mr. Harvey. All law enforcement knows is that the eccentric widower answers all their questions.In her Inbetween Heaven, Susie has her own questions, only she doesn’t know the answers. Should she spend her time watching Mr. Harvey, in hopes that he will be stopped? Or should she watch her family as they struggle to accept her death and move forward?Which focus will heal Susie so she can leave the Inbetween and transition to the Heaven intended to bring her peace?Thoughts…MESSAGE:For me, THE LOVELY BONES offers a spiritual message, which is remarkable since I don’t remember religion being mentioned once! The story, however, is much more than its surface. From my perspective, THE LOVELY BONES addresses the ancient question of where we (the living and the dead not resting in peace) should focus. Should we focus on plucking out the weeds (like vile Mr. Harvey) in our “fields” of existence? Or…should we focus on growing the corn or wheat or soybeans (which when healthy, will choke out the weeds)?This seems to be the very question character Susie Salmon struggles with. I can empathize with this internal conflict, as I wanted more than anything to have Mr. Harvey plucked from the Earth and thrown into burning Hell. To be frank, it was this desired outcome that compelled me to flip the pages.In fact, I actually wanted to take away a star from my rating because… (view spoiler)[I didn’t get what I wanted for a long, long time. Mr. Harvey lived on and on and even became secondary in the story. I started shouting to the author…WHAT ABOUT MR. HARVEY??? He’s still on Earth STALKING AND KILLING young girls and women??? DO SOMETHING! NOW!!!Years later, something FINALLY does happen to Mr. Harvey, but it feels more by chance than by intention. (The movie made it seem like a deliberate intervention, but I didn't get that from the book at all.) (hide spoiler)]But then I restored the star because… (view spoiler)[this is a story of acceptance and finding peace, not on delivering retribution. Of knowing what you can control and what you can’t. About growing and finding peace despite evil lurking in cornfields or neighborhoods or parks or buses. Not sure about you, but this focus and practice are difficult to achieve. Which is why the message is so important. Which grows peace faster…growing goodness or weeding out evil? The answer is certainly worth thinking about! (hide spoiler)]WRITING:The writing is outstanding. Even the simplest sentences carry emotional weight:“Inside, my sister’s heart closed like a fist.” HUMOR:No doubt, it is hard to interject humor into a story like this; however, there is some humor found:“Grandma Lynn predicted I’d have a long life because I had saved my brother’s life. As usual, Grandma Lynn was wrong.”OVERALL: This was an intense read that offered a surprising message. I highly recommend this 5-star read about finding acceptance and peace among the vilest of weeds.Note: This book contains triggers regarding rape and sexual violence toward children, girls, and women.",162,0.9965,0.084,0.739,0.177,0.5210444444444444,POSITIVE,0.9833

I always seem to be a few years behind, for whatever reason. Sometimes this works to my advantage, as it allows me to avoid a degree of hype that surrounds certain books. I do remember seeing the blue cover of The Lovely Bones on shelves in every bookstore when it was released a few years ago and seeing mentions on best-sellers lists. But I didn’t take much interest in it because, sometimes, when a book/movie/album gets so many rave reviews, I’ll expect it to blow me through the roof and will end up disappointed when it’s only mildly entertaining or moving (see: The Time Traveler’s Wife).I prefer to go in with low expectations and let myself be surprised with greatness. Not that I’m a bitter person or anything. Not at all. Ok, I’m working on it.Anyway, I was visiting my tiny local library for the first time, searching for a book to check out, when I saw the blue spine peaking out from the shelf. Since I had already read the few classics they had in stock, and don’t really go for Harlequin romance, I took Alice Sebold home with me. Much to my surprise, I finished the book in a day’s time. It wasn’t so much Sebold’s writing style, which is good but not spectacular, or even the tinges of mystery in the plot that captivated me. It was the raw human emotion that she so perfectly conveyed through each character. The characters felt real—both their positive qualities and their shortcomings. The pain, confusion, regret, and maybe even hope that they each felt in their own ways really impacted me. The Lovely Bones is the story of a young girl who is raped and murdered in her neighborhood. She speaks to the reader from her version of heaven (it can be different for each person), and looks over her family as they unravel after the tragic event. Perhaps it had something to do with my already delicate state (I was home sick while reading) but the book managed to make me cry. More than once. I’m slightly embarrassed to admit that, and the book snob in me would prefer to believe I am “above” sentimental plot devices, but to be honest—the book is just really sad.I also liked the subtle message of hope that carries through the novel, without reading like a “Chicken Soup” book. The ending isn’t the overly hokey “I will survive” type, and still has a shade of melancholy, but seems to say that even through utter grief and personal devastation, life goes on.",126,0.9692,0.123,0.715,0.162,0.508528971028971,NEGATIVE,0.991
14,8202903,10/24/2007,5.0,"""The Lovely Bones,"" had me crying from start to finish. This book is extremely emotion packed. But this book was interestingly written because it's from the point of view from a girl who was murdered. The book starts like this: ""My name was Salmon, like the fish; first name, Susie. I was fourteen when I was murdered on December 6, 1973."" Already you want to read it; right? You follow the life that this young girl once had as she tells you about the memories she had, the things she learned, and the people she loved. Susie also talks about her ""heaven."" In her heaven, Susie does not let her family and friends go. She follows them through the years, watching her younger sister Lindsey does everything that she would have done if she was alive. Susie can't let her family go, and they see her everywhere; in the valley where she was killed; in her fathers work room. It makes you value your family when you read about the devastation they were left with. I especially was sympathetic for her father. Through out the book you can see how difficult it was for him to realize and begin to let go of the fact that his first born had been killed. It's hard to imagine losing a child, but from reading this book I’ve begun to realize that it's a kind of sorrow that can only be felt by a parent. If you are in the mood for reading a depressing story then this book is definitely for you.The diction that Alice Sebold uses creates clear visuals in my head of what it was that Susie saw, and what she felt like being dead. You invision her family members and the environment that Susie had once been in. Another things that made me like this book so much was the fact that there were details that were used to help describe Susie that were also about me. A simple once was the fact that she was reading Othello in school. The use of details to develope the characters are very well done by Alice Sebold.

She spoke what was on her mind, the perspective was fresh and the subject wasn't typical. Maybe this was a product of hype? I hadn't heard of it until a few friends recommended it to me last week.

17,12646800,01/16/2008,1.0,"I was really disappointed with this book. The first half was easy enough to read and then unfortunately I started getting bored particularly when Sebold started rehashing the same old lines which was just frustrating after a while. However, if that was the only problem I had I wouldn't be complaining.There were a bunch of unfeasible ""random"" coincidences such as Samuel and Lindsey pulling off the road in the rain, running to the abandoned shack then running all the way home only to ... find out at the conclusion that Ruth's dad owns the house. What about Hal, what was the point of Hal's character? To be Grandma's sidekick? I felt like there was no point to these side-line stories and superfluous characters. I also would've liked to have seen some insight into the mother leaving and completely abandoning her family. So okay, I'm not the author and the author chose to not take that route but I think if you're going to include something as dramatic as that in the novel perhaps touch on it a little more. For me, it would've made it a juicier read. I didn't want know that she was working in a wine factory, I wanted to know what was going on in her head! I mean, she wandered back into the final pages, had a cup of tea with another random character, her son runs past because he has new drumset ... yikes. I'm not a believer in heaven but am interested in other's perceptions of it. I found Sebold's ideas disappointing. School buildings? A few people dressed up as snowflakes at Christmas time? A very random connection with her Grandfather? To me, this novel felt like a good first draft and just really felt like it needed a good edit, or a heavy rewrite. The ending was particularly irritating; falling to earth into a body to have sex with some guy who we didn't really care about ... for no reason? I was pretty confused because she'd watched her murderer stalk her sister hours (minutes?) beforehand and didn't use the opportunity on earth to confront her murderer, which is something I, and I presume many people, would've done. But okay, let's just accept that she's not that kind of person, the ending bothered me because the first half really did have promise but then Sebold threw me into an unexpected (and unwelcome) supernatural spin. Great idea. Poor execution. Maybe that's what everyone got so carried away with. The idea was grand - so grand that they were blinded by the weakness of the actual plot. Further, I guess people find comfort in the idea of heaven. The fact that we mean so much to people that we'll continue having such a huge impact on them once we're gone, that we get to watch them from above after we're dead (voyeuristic much?). All in all, if people love this book and it affects them, changes their life, their outlook, makes them feel warm and fuzzy, makes them tearful or full of rapture - that's a good thing.

Also, she says she doesn't want to go after her murderer while in the host, that's real fucking nice, Susie, the whole book's about you wishing you hadn't died and the strain it put on your family, and you'd rather take a dick in a bathtub then stop him from raping/killing more children. That's great. And that whole idea was a rip-off of the movie ""Ghost,"" remember? If you're gonna plagiarize from a Patrick Swayze movie, please make it ""Roadhouse.""P.S.

20,25793953,06/28/2008,5.0,"Reviewed by Cana Rensberger for TeensReadToo.comTHE LOVELY BONES will haunt you. This book tells the story of the most horrific thing a family could ever endure, the murder of a loved one, a child. The child is 14-year-old Susie Salmon. We see the murder through her eyes, after she is killed. Susie narrates her story from heaven, a place like I'd not before imagined. Her heaven begins as her school playground. Slowly it grows to become more. Susie merely longs for something she misses from earth, and it appears, except, of course, the living. Although she can watch her loved ones, know what they are doing, thinking, and feeling, she cannot be with them, or they with her. The book begins with the emotional, frightening, and vividly shown homicide. Through Susie's eyes, we understand how he tricked her. We feel her terror as we realize, with her, what's about to happen. Then the scene moves to another, equally heartbreaking moment, three days later when a neighbor's dog finds a body part. You would think, at this point, that you wouldn't be able to read further, that you'd close the book and never reopen it. But you won't be able to. Like Susie, we want to know her family will be okay. We want to know the killer won't get away with it. The author, Alice Sebold, artfully forces you to read on. Susie watches her friends whisper about her at school. She watches as her younger sister, Lindsey, hardens to stone. Her four-year-old brother, Buckley, is passed from neighbor to neighbor, having sleepovers, told his sister has just gone away for a bit. She listens to the detective, Len, tell her parents the inevitable, that they are now investigating her disappearance as a murder. Her family slowly begins to crumble and Susie can do nothing to help. This sounds like a suffocating, depressing book, but as you read you'll feel encouraged as Susie's family begins to move on, never to forget, but to begin to live life without her. Buckley struggles to understand the meaning of forever. Susie's dad becomes obsessed with proving he's not crazy, that he's certain who killed his daughter. Susie's mom handles the stress by hiding from it. And Lindsey, known as the girl whose sister was murdered, strives to find herself again. She searches for love. And she takes a huge risk to help her dad flush out the killer. The ending is incredibly sweet. Amazing as it may seem, you will feel Susie's joy as she lets go of those she's left behind. For me, the ending wasn't perfect, it left me wanting, but I imagine that was deliberate. Life itself is not perfect. But life has hope. And that's the feeling that will stay with you as you turn the last page. It's a memorable read, not for the faint of heart. Expect to feel. To fear, to cry, and, yes, to laugh. THE LOVELY BONES will touch the very core of your being. Alice Sebold has written beautifully of the ugliest scenario possible. Wow. ",97,0.8568,0.134,0.715,0.151,0.5976190476190476,NEGATIVE,0.8142
21,281291801,02/20/2012,3.0,"Well that wasn't a happy happy good time...The Lovely Bones is going to be difficult to review without spoilers, so if you haven't read it yet I'm gonna have to go ahead and ask you to leave, m'kay?Why am I not surprised to learn that Alice Sebold was raped at a young age? Because only someone who'd been through something as horrific as that would write a book like this. I'm not just talking about the subject matter, but rather the tone. Everything about this book is a victim's silent scream. Suzie, the dad, the surviving kids...it seems like everyone has someone taken from them. Maybe even the mom. I mean after all, the life she wished to lead was raped from her after she had the chance to lead it. Honestly, I thought this was going to be even more depressing than it turned out to be. There's an unexpected hopeful strain through out, a nice pairing with some of Sebold's better writing.On the other hand, some of her writing is irritating. Most notably were the many instances in which she attempts to utilize suspense writer techniques. As readers we are expecting a divulgence of information regarding the focal murder of the story. So, it's a big old tease when Sebold abruptly states ""I saw him."" Many times out of the blue she starts a new paragraph or section with just such a line and then goes on to talk about the family dog or some other nonsense. It's bullshit. Overall though, this isn't bad. At times I enjoyed this look (maybe not the POV from which the story's told) at the after affects of a young girl's mysterious murder. The grieving period for family and friends, and the various paths each of them takes, is portrayed with authenticity. Some grieve harder than others. This isn't a murder mystery, this is real life. It's not always interesting or entertaining. Sometimes it's just sad and thought provoking. So yes, I did like The Lovely Bones, but as for my tepid 3-star rating, all I can say is, Oprah lied. She told millions to read this and their perseverance upon that endeavor eventually got me to do the same. I read it. I was not Oprah-amazed. Why blame her? Because if she hadn't kicked it all off with her recommendation, I never would've read this. It's just not in my wheelhouse. Thus, I never would've had the opportunity to give this a lower rating.

24,1440799935,11/12/2015,3.0,"Several years have passed since the publication of Alice Sebold's most famous novel, but back when it was released, The Lovely Bones hit the literary world in a perhaps surprising way. Bluntly dealing with the effects of a young girl's rape and murder and her family's reactions, Alice Sebold uses interesting writing techniques to delve into different viewpoints and point out the enormous impact of such a horrifying family disaster.In case you haven't read this book yet, it is easy to enter it with wrong expectations. Is it a gruesome, horrifying and tear-jerking account of one family's devastating fate? At some points yes, but overall it is written with a rather hopeful undertone, emphasizing the author's intention to balance out the different elements of the story. Early on in the novel, the main character Susie Salmon is raped and killed on her way home from school, with her soul ascending to heaven. Alice Sebold creates a comforting and soothing image of the heaven Susie's soul rests in to compensate the horrible time Susie's family has to go through in the wake of her death. The book has been confronted with very mixed opinions; after all, even on Goodreads you will find about as many 5-star ratings as you can find 1-star ratings.Susie's voice accompanies the reader throughout the entirety of the novel, yet she often withdraws into the position of an observer; Sebold presents us with the family's reactions and the events surrounding the search for Susie's real murderer, but rarely gives Susie a chance to comment on what she is capable of seeing from her position in heaven. Thus it may be difficult to relate with any of the characters, even though the author still succeeds in painting a convincing picture of a family's mourning and their longing to find peace again which can only be achieved by the murderer's arrest and punishment. In addition, the narrative is difficult to get into since Susie seems to be capable of reading the minds of her family with no explanation given; apparently Alice Sebold expected us to accept and embrace Susie's ability, but it left me disturbed because Susie kept switching between being an observer and a mind reader.Susie's heaven in the 2009 movie adaption.If you have watched the movie, then you should give another thought to reading the book since it approaches the story in a more insightful and moving way than the movie succeeded to do. On the other hand, if you only know the book, you will not regret not watching the movie since it isn't an adaption you could necessarily call 'successful' (or you may watch the trailer which spoils everything that happens in the movie).Even apart from all the criticism this novel certainly deserved, it can still be recommended for quite a lot of strengths: in the writing of her book, Alice Sebold knew how to convincingly portray a grieving family; she knew how to create a heaven without losing herself in religious details and possibly contradicting descriptions which can easily occur with such a difficult topic. As many readers also pointed out, the first 20% of the novel were mesmerizing and intriguingly written, and during the rest of the book it constantly loses its appeal, then picks it up again only to lose it again after another couple of pages. You may love it or hate it, every reader might find a different approach to either embrace the beautiful aspects of the novel (which were definitely present), or to criticize the rather offsetting moments. (To give an example, right before the ending a scene occured which I had to completely block out of my memory because it made me want to throw my book against the wall in frustration.)One of the book's greatest qualities may be that it somehow manages to stay with you. However, even if the premise interests you there is no guarantee you will love the book, just as you may like it even though the premise sounds dull to you. Personally, I liked the novel (definitely more than the movie), but neither did it convince nor annoy me. If you haven't yet, you may want to wait with reading the book until you really feel in the proper mood for it.",86,0.9926,0.145,0.655,0.2,0.5794433266264253,NEGATIVE,0.7549
25,20597456,04/20/2008,5.0,"Alice SeboldThe Lovely BonesNew York: Little Brown & Company, 2002329 pp. 21.950-316-66634-3	Susie Salmon, a young girl murdered at fourteen, sits in her heaven as she watches her family grieve, suffer and fall apart without her. Susie follows the lives of her family and friends as they struggle to cope with the aftermath of her death. In watching her family on Earth, Susie’s journey to understanding the life she was robbed of becomes the central idea in the extraordinary novel “The Lovely Bones” by Alice Sebold. “The Lovely Bones” evokes joy and sorrow in its reader, making the whole reading experience worthwhile. 	Alice Sebold delivers originality in her novel by creating a heart-warming story told from the fresh point of view of a young girl in heaven. The novel begins with the protagonist, Susie Salmon, already in heaven. Most novels do not start by introducing a central character that is deceased before the story unfolds, but “The Lovely Bones” begins with the main character saying, “My name was Susie Salmon […] I was fourteen when I was murdered […]” (Sebold 1). The most interesting aspect of the novel is the point of view from which the story is told. The point of view also plays a significant role in the novel. Even though the main character, Susie, is dead, she still manages to evolve throughout the novel, therefore being dynamic. As Susie watches her family from heaven, she matures with them and experiences life by observing. The idea that life continues after death is the central theme of the novel. After the protagonist dies, she manages to stay in touch with her family by appearing at certain moments, almost like a ghost. Susie lets her family and friends know that the dead are here “All the time. You can talk to us and think about us” (Sebold 309). A connection between the living and the dead is established throughout the novel, which ties into the central theme. Eventually, through this connection, Susie and her family gain a better understanding of the love, life, and unfortunate circumstances that often tie people together in the world.	Apart from the viewpoint, Sebold’s writing style adds to the fresh appeal of the novel by contributing vivid descriptions of the setting and characters. In the novel, heaven is said to be different for each character. Susie and other deceased people “Had been given, in our heavens, our simplest dreams. There were no teachers in the school. Our textbooks were Seventeen and Glamour and Vogue” (Sebold 18). Sebold depicts heaven as a young child would depict a colorful candy store. Because Susie is only fourteen when she dies, the novel uses language and ideas that most teenagers would use. However, as the novel progresses, Susie’s thoughts and opinions seem to mature, almost like those of her family and friends on Earth. Just as she would have on Earth, Susie learns that life must continue, even when it seems as if it is the end of the world.	“The Lovely Bones” offers a new outlook on life, death and the journey in between. It sheds new light on the importance of family and the magnitude of love by focusing on a road to recovery after tragedy occurs. The novel leaves the reader feeling as if they have gained insight, but it also leaves the reader feeling empty once there are no more pages left to turn. Alice Sebold demonstrates originality by seamlessly connecting the living and the dead in her rightfully acclaimed novel. “The Lovely Bones” gives reason to believe that life does not have to end when death takes hold.",81,0.9976,0.102,0.679,0.219,0.4865461336049572,POSITIVE,1.0

That doesn’t mean the weaker one doesn’t love the stronger.”“My name is Salmon, like the fish; first name, Susie. I was fourteen when I was murdered.”“If I had but an hour of love,if that be all that is given me,an hour of love upon this earth,I would give my love to thee.”“There was one thing my murderer didn't understand; he didn't understand how much a father could love his child.”",80,-0.8987,0.196,0.619,0.186,0.5169217687074831,POSITIVE,0.6971
28,108596527,06/24/2010,2.0,"Rating: 2.75* of fiveThe Publisher Says: The Lovely Bones is the story of a family devastated by a gruesome murder -- a murder recounted by the teenage victim. Upsetting, you say? Remarkably, first-time novelist Alice Sebold takes this difficult material and delivers a compelling and accomplished exploration of a fractured family's need for peace and closure.The details of the crime are laid out in the first few pages: from her vantage point in heaven, Susie Salmon describes how she was confronted by the murderer one December afternoon on her way home from school. Lured into an underground hiding place, she was raped and killed. But what the reader knows, her family does not. Anxiously, we keep vigil with Susie, aching for her grieving family, desperate for the killer to be found and punished.Sebold creates a heaven that's calm and comforting, a place whose residents can have whatever they enjoyed when they were alive -- and then some. But Susie isn't ready to release her hold on life just yet, and she intensely watches her family and friends as they struggle to cope with a reality in which she is no longer a part. To her great credit, Sebold has shaped one of the most loving and sympathetic fathers in contemporary literature.My Review: Susie Salmon is dead. She knows she's dead, and she's even indoctrinated into the rules of the Afterlife by Franny, her spirit guide: Heaven can be whatever you want it to be. What Susie wants is to be part of the life she's supposed to leave behind.Susie was murdered. And she doesn't want her killer to go unpunished.Susie watches as her killer kills again, and again, and her father—resolutely pursuing leads the police have dismissed, with the help of Susie's sister Lindsay—gets closer and closer to solving the heinous crime of child-murder.Susie, who can never grow up since she's dead, comes to terms with her afterlife, although she can't really get with the program about adulthood. Her mother mires herself in the horrendous cloud of mourning and grief that follows the death of your child. Her friends move on, sort of, though she sees how her death has changed their lives. Susie ends her surveillance and moves on to......who knows what.And here is the problem that I have with the book. What was the point of this framing device? What, in the end, is served by poor little Susie leading us all a merry chase and we voyeuristically move inside the lives of her nearest and dearest? At the end of the day, the point of the book has got to be about Susie, or her presence is contrived at best and prurient at worst.I read this on a vacation to DC many years ago. I wasn't sure why I was so dyspeptic about the read then, and took quite some time to realize that I do NOT like being jerked around by unnecessary child-harm in stories. Okay, the point is the murder of a child, okay, okay: BUT then the child doesn't need to be part of the murder's solution! It smacks of abuse to me. Let the poor little thing rest. Millions disagree with me here. I didn't like [Room] for the same reasons. It's just me, I guess.",75,-0.9919,0.166,0.734,0.1,0.539616402116402,POSITIVE,0.9973

This book was just alright, and I'll probably forget about it in two days because I was passively listening to it as I cleaned my apartment. I will admit I kind of only read this because it's so popular and I wanted to see what's behind that popularity, which in itself wasn't a whole lot. I liked the idea of this book and Susie's narration, and where I thought it would be more of a ""let's catch the murderer"" book, it was a lot more heartfelt.

Although the subject of a little girl being brutally raped and murdered is extremely disturbing I thought it would be interesting to read about her in the afterlife as she watched her family try to solve her murder.There is not much that I can even say without giving things away, but I did not like this book at all. I still had about 50 pages to go before I stopped reading this, and I may go back and finish it, but for now I just couldn't take any more. Everyone knows I am usually really into dark and disturbing books, but reading about her family moving on and knowing that the killer was right there was just something I could not handle. I felt very bored at certain parts too, and found my mind wandering, but I'm not sure if the book was genuinely boring or if my mind just wanted to escape the thoughts of it.About the rating.

32,5304447,08/29/2007,4.0,"This book could have easily fallen into the ""same old, same old"" category, but it didn't and that's why it's so good. There are certain things that I'm going to pick apart and point out that could be considered spoilers so this is your warning. Don't continue reading if you don't want to be spoiled. If you continue reading, don't bitch at me that I gave something away because I warned you. If you want to know in brief what I thought (because I know you so desperately value my opinion) here it is: beautifully written and unique novel with engaging, fully developed characters. Really, what more could you want in a novel?Okay, now down to the nitty gritty. At first I thought that this was going to be a sort of mystery novel. We know that Susie is dead, but I bet we're going to have to figure out who killed her and why! Nope. Straight off the bat Susie tells us who, what, when, where, why and how. Then I'm thinking, okay, so what's going to keep this novel going? In any other novel you pick up that has someone murdered you usually keep reading only to find out who, what, when, where, why and how. Now why am I reading this?Despite being curious about how heaven was going to be portrayed, it was the fact that I held the knowledge of Susie's death that none of the other characters held. It's the feeling of omniscience that kept me reading. So many times, along with Susie, I wanted to scream at characters, tell them to wake up! Tell them that Susie was still there, to not be sad. The novel ends up not being so plot driven as it is character driven. To have book being pushed along by characters is always a risky thing, but Sebold pulls it off beautifully.It's Susie watching them all that makes it so beautiful. She doesn't age as everyone else does. She watches her sister and can only grow up through her. She can only have experiences such as a serious boyfriend, finishing school, losing her virginity, through her sister. You feel pity for Susie during these moments. You know that she has been robbed, and you feel so angry about that.The only part that I found strange was when Susie suddenly becomes Ruth and has sex with Ray. It didn't seem to fit with the style of the novel and would have fit better in a fantasy style book or ghost story rather than what Sebold had been giving us the entire time. I wonder if Sebold didn't really know how to end it or she felt bad for Susie and wanted her to have that one moment for herself. As much as you want to give Susie that moment, I think it would have made the novel so much deeper and touching if she never got it. She's dead! She was murdered! Really, she'll never get that moment. How much more would that have meant to the reader? Of course you would be left feeling bad for Susie, but it's reality. The rest of the novel had been steeped in reality, why was this one part written to be not so?That was the only part that bothered me. Over all though, this novel was touching and an awesome read. I like books with a unique take on old stories... this is one of those. What happens when we know how the murder occured? What happens afterwards?

33,90335777,02/18/2010,4.0,"When I read The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath, I remember thinking, geez, this is really an okay book. The writing is good. The story is fine. There is a certain genius in the effect, how the main character's descent into madness slowly evolves with the introduction of tiny details. But the reason it gripped me - the reason it probably gripped you - is because the author's ghost haunts every page. At the end of The Bell Jar, the heroine is hopeful, and has put her dark days in the past. Yet we the reader knows full well that Plath was never able to do the same. For Plath, the dark days - the oven - were still ahead. It gives the autobiographical novel profundity and resonance beyond the words between its covers.I got the same sensation reading The Lovely Bones. Alice Sebold is not dead, but her story of a murdered girl's family is clearly a powerful meditation on her own experience, and of the life she might never have lived. In her memoir, Lucky, Sebold begins by writing: ""In the tunnel where I was raped, a tunnel that was once an underground entry to an amphitheater, a place where actors burst forth from underneath the seats of a crowd, a girl had been murdered and dismembered."" She goes on to describe how, as her rapist was on top of her, she saw a pink hair tie on the tunnel floor. She wondered if the hair tie belonged to the dead girl: ""I will never know whether the hair tie was hers or whether it, like the leaves, made its way there naturally. I will always think of her when I think of the pink hair tie. I will think of a girl in the last moments of her life."" This novel, in a way, is the story of the girl with the pink hair tie. It begins, famously, with a disarmingly candid statement from the narrator: ""My name was Salmon, like the fish; first name, Susie. I was fourteen when I was murdered on December 6, 1973."" That is, pardon the pun, quite a hook. And if it won't resonate down the ages like ""Call me Ishmael,"" it certainly demands the reader keep reading. Susie was lured into an underground shelter in a cornfield by her creepy neighbor, George Harvey. The novel begins with Susie explaining, in flashback, what happened to her. At times, her tone is a little off-putting, a little too matter of fact, with a calmness that belies every fourteen year-old girl I ever knew. For instance, she remarks, offhand, that a neighbor's dog had found her elbow three days after she disappeared. But maybe that's just the perspective of heaven. The description of the rape is discrete, yet horrible, with just enough telling, personal details to let your own awful imagination turn loose. ""Don't, Mr. Harvey,"" I managed, and I kept saying that one word a lot. Don't. And I said please a lot too. Franny told me that almost everyone begged ""please"" before dying...But he grew tired of hearing me plead. He reached into the pocket of my parka and balled up the hat my mother had made me, smashing it into my mouth. The only sound I made after that was the weak tinkling of bells...I felt huge and bloated. I felt like a sea in which he stood and pissed and shat. I felt the corners of my body were turning in on themselves and out, like in a cat's cradle, which I played with Lindsey just to make her happy. He started working himself over me. Following this flashback sequence, we are introduced to Susie's heaven. The sequences set here are the weakest in the novel. It is cliched, simplistic, the place dreams come true. Every time the book returns here, it serves only to soften the impact of the real drama going on down on earth. If nothing else, Susie's heaven gives her a vantage point from which she can witness her family's disintegration, and later, its rebirth. Her father becomes obsessed with finding her killer, and zeroes in on Mr. Harvey. Her mother struggles to deal with losing her daughter and her now-myopic husband. Eventually, after dabbling in adultery, she bolts and tries to create a new life for herself. Her sister, Lindsey, tries to help her dad, while simultaneously lurching forward on her own path to adulthood. Her little brother Buckley, in another minor cliche, is the youngster attuned to spirits, and can sense Susie's presence. There is also the ""little detective,"" Len Fenerman:Len Fenerman had been the one that first asked my mother for my school picture when the police thought I might be found alive. In his wallet, my photo sat in a stack. Among these dead children and strangers was a picture of his wife. If a case had been solved he had written the date of its resolution on the back of the photo. If the case was still open - in his mind if not in the official files of the police - it was blank. There was nothing on the back of mine. There was nothing on his wife's.This book reminded me a lot of Songs for the Missing by Stewart O'Nan. The plot lines are almost identical (The Lovely Bones came first) and center on the families of missing girls. I found O'Nan's work to be superior, mostly because it never lets you off the hook. By using the conceit of the dead-girl-in-heaven narrator, the reader is spared true sorrow. Yes, the girl is dead, but she's not really, you see? She has an afterlife, and it's pretty cool, apparently, because they have Vogue and Glamour magazines. O'Nan dealt with grief directly; by having us witness events through the prism of Susie's heaven, Sebold only confronts grief obliquely. It's clear that Sebold has a great deal of empathy for what Susie endured. Perhaps this is why she created the concept of Susie's heaven (that and the fact it was bound to get her to the bestseller list). However, this deep emotional current between author and character is to the ultimate detriment of the novel. It leads to the book's most unfortunate scene, a bit of lost youth wish fulfillment in which Susie inhabits the body of a spiritual girl named Ruth in order to have sex with a boy she once liked. It's not that Sebold does a poor job writing this scene, it's that a scene like this can't be written without being creepy. I get that it's supposed to be powerful - since Susie has been denied everything, even her first kiss - but eww. This event takes place near the end of the book. It's part of a draggy third act that also finds Susie discovering herself in a continuum of dead women and girls, which leads to some unnecessary contemplation of the universality of Susie's story. The power of this book is in its intensely focused portraits of the members of Susie's family, Susie's killer, and the dogged detective Len Fenerman. It stumbles when it attempts to be something broader. Susie's Richard Matheson-like, non-secular heaven is undercooked when compared to the sharp observations of the people down on Earth. Nearing the end, I began to despair that such a promising novel was coming to such an unsatisfying conclusion. The last chapter, an epilogue of sorts, comes to the rescue. In just a few pages, a few short paragraphs, she ties up all the story threads, and memorably ends with a man finding Susie's charm bracelet near an old sinkhole. The conclusion is over the top; its saccharine and corny; and when I finished I think I had some dust in my eye. In these passages, Sebold plays to her strengths, with lyrical, cadenced sentences and imparted lessons that might have come across like a Hallmark card had they been delivered by someone who hadn't been in the same dank tunnel Alice Sebold had been.

She watches as her family struggles after her death trying to cope with the loss. Without closure and losing hope her parents struggle with their relationship as well as their relationship with their two remaining children. All of the characters are really well written. We watch as her parents, siblings, teachers etc. grieve in many different ways. Susie herself is a truly unique narrator and remains detached from the events she is describing but very watchful of the loved ones she has left behind. I felt that the story was told very gently and compassionately and I was invested in both what was happening to Susie and her family.

38,1971388,06/14/2007,3.0,"the first chapter is pretty impressive: a perfectly captured voice, a suspenseful and disturbing narrative, a jarring end. overall that first part was a moving and challenging experience. the rest of the novel is less impressive, but there is an originality to it that was appealing. the First Person Omniscient perspective has been remarked upon in many reviews - and it does make this book a rather unusual experience. that personalized omniscience creates an at-times annoying quirkiness, but also some pretty wonderful moments, particularly in the noting of various small details - the kind of details that tell you all about a person, the emotions they are wrestling with, what their life story is all about.but what i found most interesting about Lovely Bones was perhaps not as intentional - namely, the very distancing blandness of our sorta-heroine's voice. if this child had lived, she may have grown up to be ann beattie or margaret diehl or joan didion. her emotional range is not one of many peaks and valleys, it is rather a pleasant flatline. that detachment, that even-handedness, that smoothness... it is a bit strange, a bit creepy. what in the world are they taking up there in heaven, some kind of mega-strength prozac or valium? the afterlife sounds like my exact cup of tea: a place to idly contemplate the lives of those we lived with - but no anxious worrying, no getting unduly agitated or emotional. how relaxing!there was one key part that i did not care for at all, perhaps enough to dock a star off of this one: the unappealing possession-cum-fantasy sex scene at the end. ugh. it is hard to complain about such a scene not being ""realistic"", but it just did not feel real to me - well at least the feelings of the two living people involved did not make emotional sense. also, sad to say, it reminded me of the demi moore-makes out with-whoopi goldberg-who is possessed by-patrick swayze scene from Ghost... and that is never a good thing.",44,0.8713,0.111,0.75,0.139,0.6378623188405795,NEGATIVE,0.9932

Another thing that I just remember about New York that is the reason why I picked this book up in the first place is this: on said subway line I always noticed the different books people were reading, and if I saw the same book often enough (like when everyone had the new Harry Potter, or that Life of Bees book that was just everywhere) it was akin to seeing it on a bestseller list and I invariably remembered the cover art and title. So one of the books on the subway bestseller list was The Lovely Bones, and one day at The Strand I started reading it.

44,9202638,11/16/2007,4.0," The fictional story of the Lovely Bones was really sad, but intriguing at the same time.The book was about a girl named Susie,she was 14 years old and had a wonderful loving family who cared deeply about each other.She was loved by many.One day as Susie was walking across the field from school she was stopped by a man who would destroy her life and the lives of everyone that loved her.He not only ruined her life forever,but her family and friends will never be the same.What he did was so disgusting and unforgivable.For goodness sakes he murdered a young,innocent girl who had many great things to accomplish in her life ahead.  What this man,Mr.Harvey did,was he built an underground room.He would sit down there in his room and mastermind plans to murder young women.What he did to Suzie was he stopped her in the field and asked her if she wanted to see his room.Of course her being as naïve as she was she accepted his offer and went down there not knowing her own fate.Down in that room he raped her then murdered her,put her in a garbage bag and dragged her to his house.He left her body in the bag for many weeks while her blood seeped through the bag onto his garage floor.He later put the body into a safe and took it to the junk yard.At first nobody knew who murdered this young girl.The only evidence was a hat that she had on,and the only bone of hers forgotten in the field,her elbow.  After Susie’s death her family began to separate from each other.Her parents lost their love for one another.Her younger sister who was 12 at the time began to push away from her family and became very quiet and alone.Her little brother Bucky being 4 years old did not really understand what happened,but as he grew up he began to branch out from his family and be much more to himself.He was not the same little boy he once was.Their mom left her family for the detective.This did not help the family at all. Throughout the duration of the novel there was a continuous theme.The theme was that you have to be strong and move on.You can never give up,you have to keep pushing on even in the roughest times.Throughout the story there was one profound tone.That tone was very melancholy.The whole story was sad and very hard to imagine things like that really happen in real life.There was a lot of internal conflict within the characters in this book.Susie’s father was very emotionally drained.He had a very strong suspicion that Mr.Harvey was the killer.Even when nobody believed him he never stopped believing that.Susie’s mother was giving up on her family.She was burned out,sad,and lost.Lindsay began to think that she was all alone in this crazy world and nobody loved her.Bucky isn’t the outgoing little boy he once was.He used to be a wild and an exciting boy.After her death he sat in his box in the backyard and talked to himself.In this novel the Lovely Bones there was a lot of foreshadowing.Like in the beginning Alice Sebold mentions how Mr.Harvey is planning on building this underground room.She explains how he is a bit strange and how nobody in the neighborhood really trusts him and they don’t know much about him.This got my mind running,thinking that he may be a sexual predator and preys on children.Also she mentions the eye connection between Susie’s mother and Len,the detective. This made me see that there was an instant relationship building up.As a result their mother left her family for this man. 	 The story the Lovely Bones was one that I really liked. I liked how the author gave insights to what Susie was feeling,and witnessing while she watched everyone she left behind on Earth. She gave the perspective from Susie from Heaven. What I really didn’t like about the novel is how she skipped back and forth from different perspectives of the characters so quickly without finishing their thoughts or elaborating on their opinions. I would most definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes mysteries. ",37,0.994,0.11,0.727,0.163,0.5094483024691357,NEGATIVE,0.9999

The fantasy element in the story is prominent. This is my first read of this book. I went into it knowing the whole story as I have already watched the movie adaptation when it was released many years ago. The book is very atmospheric. It is about many things like family grief, having a crush on someone, spirituality, and accepting your own reality. I liked the 1970s setting a lot. The book vividly shows what might happen to some families and how they can break up when a tragedy occurs. The author has given Susie all kinds of emotions watching over her family but not being able to intervene or help them. All the frustration and sadness the girl was experiencing in her narration will impact the reader for sure.One thing I am really glad about Alice Sebold’s writing is that she did not resort to explicit supernatural elements to make the story move and unfold. She kept it subtle and I feel that gave a unique beauty to the story besides the melancholy feel.

I find it utterly beautiful and impactful but equally arduous and unsatisfying; I can completely understand why it is so divisive.I read it not long after it came out and loved it so much that I read it over and over, as I did with everything I loved as a kid. Therefore, my opinion could be skewed by my nostalgia for my 12/13-year old self. I was reluctant to read it again as, after seeing so many negative reviews, I expected that my vastly altered reading tastes would ruin a book that I had read to shreds and that had such an impact on me growing up.I was so glad to find that I loved it just as much, albeit in an entirely different way and other than some issues with the writing and THAT chapter, it was perfect. Each day since I finished it I have thought about it more and more, something very few books bring out in me.The beginning is both disturbing and gripping, so much so, that I remembered it vividly despite it being over 10-years since I had last read it, which was a surprise to me as I can’t usually even remember what day it is. I had read the author’s memoir Lucky and I believe this in part has also contributed to the resonance of the first chapter. The middle and end, although less striking (it was a hard act to follow), were a mix of sadness and hope; though it seemed to have lost direction and pace in places, I really felt the message in the end and my love for the characters was enough to keep me going.Now, being an adult, I felt so much more the love and devastation of the adults and saw how the kids are actually far stronger and more resilient. Jack was wonderful, but that wasn’t something we were told, it grew with the story. He is possibly the best, most loving Dad I have ever read about. I was taken aback by some seemingly uneventful moments that now were heartbreaking and it felt as though the author really understood grief in these small details and so much of it really rang true to me.Despite being about a murder, it is not a thriller or mystery as we know almost immediately what has happened and whodunnit. Instead, it is an exposed and authentic account of grief that, due to the unusual point of view, we get the benefit of understanding from both sides and without pretence as Susie can see them without the masks that they put on for others and each other. In this way, it is a character-driven ‘journey’ story and if you are willing to invest yourself in them and have your heart broken then I would definitely recommend it.",35,0.9891,0.101,0.742,0.158,0.5401092896174863,POSITIVE,0.9843

53,146293501,02/06/2011,1.0,"In a nutshell: overrated; questionable characterisation; breathtakingly ridiculous ending.The Lovely Bones is a story about a murdered teenage girl, told from the point of view of said girl - Susie Salmon - as she watches over her loved ones from heaven. So, obviously, it's constantly trying to pull at the heartstrings from page one. In this, it occasionally succeeds - while much of it is a little too schmaltzy, there are some genuinely touching moments too. Given the book's ubiquity and popularity, I thought it might be really trashy, but it in fact the writing isn't that bad, despite the over-enthusiastic use of metaphors and similes. The narrative paints a believable picture of a family falling apart after the loss of a child, and the glimpses of Susie's heaven are intriguing, if disappointingly brief (I wish this element had been explored further). However, I had issues with a lot of the characters. Ray and Ruth, for example. Would two teenagers - one a boy who'd kissed Susie once, one a girl who'd barely spoken to her - really find it so hard to forget her and move on, for so many years afterwards? Though the narrative doesn't detail everything that happens to them, it's implied that Ray in particular (despite apparently being incredibly attractive) never has any kind of romantic involvement with another girl as a result of his continuing preoccupation with the memory of Susie. How convenient, since she's 'watching over' him and the reader is almost encouraged to see him as 'belonging' to her. Similarly, the actions of some of Susie's family (particularly her mother) are difficult to understand. I can well believe that the murder of one daughter would lead a mother to become depressed, alienated from her husband and other children, and ultimately to desert her remaining family - but nothing Abigail does, apart from a cursory affair with one of the policemen investigating Susie's death, is actually explained from her point of view. When she leaves her family, the decision just seems completely baffling - it's one of those 'hang on a minute, what?!' moments because you just don't get inside Abigail's head enough to understand her private motivations.Sebold makes some attempts to flesh out and humanise Mr. Harvey, Susie's murderer, detailing his efforts to restrain himself from committing his crimes; for example, killing neighbourhood pets in a vain attempt to restrain his appetite for attacking young girls. (The ghostly Susie can, it seems, read minds and know every detail of past events she wasn't involved in; again, very convenient, and there's no explanation of how she comes to realise she has this 'power', or how she masters it.) However, the character is such a cliché in the first place (creepy loner, obsessed with his mother, has weird hobbies) that in the end he seems like neither a monster nor a believable human being, but just a strangely indistinct and nondescript character given that he's a serial killer. It's also very frustrating that he's never caught or given his comeuppance. Finally, there's the ending. What to say about the ending?! If you've read the book (unless you loved it, of course), you'll probably know what I mean. If you haven't, all I'll say is that something happens that's so utterly ludicrous that deus ex machina doesn't even begin to cover it. Not only that, but the apparent message of this conclusion, and the moral implications for the (living) characters involved, are extremely dubious at best. Having wavered between thinking this book was kind-of-good and kind-of-bad throughout, the ending pushed my opinion firmly into the negative category and ruined many of the positives for me. Sorry to say it, but this is the kind of book that people who normally read nothing but chick-lit will find really PROFOUND and MOVING, which I'd imagine is why it sold so many copies. If you don't fit that description, I think it's best avoided. Have a look at the top-rated reviews on Goodreads; they're predominantly negative, and I agree with a lot of what they say.",31,-0.9939,0.146,0.77,0.085,0.551730769230769,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Really, I could also talk about how Sebold wrote this novel (with flashbacks and scenes in the future), because it was brilliantly done and fit in perfectly with the whole story.

56,1855088420,12/29/2016,4.0,"ObservationThe Lovely Bones was a book that was different from my norm, but interestingly so. The story relates to the child murder of Susie Salmon, and how from beyond the grave she watches how her family and friends come to terms with her death, and also how the murderer still lives amongst them. 
 “My name was Salmon, like the fish: first name, Susie. I was fourteen when I was murdered on December 6, 1973.…I was killed by Mr. Botte, by the way.”
While we are dealing with a child murder, the fact that Susie narrates throughout the story means that it has a supernatural flavour. After the initial horrific coverage of Susie’s rape and murder, the pace changes and with Susie narrating the full force of her death subsides. The loss is not so tangible as she continues to engage with us.Susie watches, frustrated and saddened that she can’t call out to her family or direct them or warn them as they continue to encounter the murderer, and how he/she continues to stalk menacingly within the neighbourhood. Susie watches as her family pull themselves apart particularly her mother and father as they each deal with the loss totally differently. The mix of emotions is cleverly portrayed from loss to guilt, from sadness to anger, and always with the torment of Susie’s death being unresolved and her body undiscovered. The characters are well developed and continue to evolve along with their various relationships. The relationship between Susie’s school crush, Ray, and a girl Ruth, who seems to have a sense of the supernatural is wonderfully developed. Ray unfortunately due to his closeness with Susie had to endure the initial suspicion and a cloud that he probably finds difficult to shift.This was Alice Sebold’s debut novel and I feel it still remains her best.",28,-0.9984,0.29,0.622,0.088,0.4670138888888889,POSITIVE,0.9423

59,451830478,11/08/2012,2.0,"1.5The Lovely Bones is the perfect example of a brilliant start gone unbelievably wrong.Pages 1-35 was the only portion of this book that felt genuine to me. The rest of it went from being okay to bad to just plain ridiculous. Chapter 22 was especially painful - and I don't mean that in an emotional context. It was one of those WTF moments that I'm glad was cut from the movie.Here's something I don't understand - how can Susie read minds?? This is probably a trivial thing but it's been bugging me non-stop. We are not even told when exactly Susie learns about this ability. It's like one day, she just knows what people are thinking - no explanations how or why. I feel this ruined the narration. There were times when it felt like the usual third person narration and not necessarily like a dead girl's view on things (which is what it's supposed to be). Linsdey was one of the better sketched characters. Her reaction to Susie's death was one of the few things I didn't have trouble believing. Ruth's obsession, on the other hand, was exaggerated and creepy.I wish Sebold had focused more on Susie's heaven - I quite like the idea of it. But sadly, it's left unexplored, like many other potentially interesting things in the book.I prefer the movie. It does a better job at keeping you emotionally invested and is easier to endure than 300 pages of nothing happening.The ending's still lame though.",25,0.9881,0.119,0.652,0.229,0.6048881673881673,NEGATIVE,1.0
60,81274188,12/17/2009,5.0,"This sweetly haunting novel is powerful, heart-wrenching, and strangely leaves one with an optimistic good feeling. It's the strange feeling in the chest you get when you cry at a sad movie, only to have the film burst into comedic scene not long afterward. A light at the end of the grief. Beware, this book is not for the faint hearted. When I say sad and depressing, I mean it. I cried about ten times reading this. The police even find a part of her body to bring home to the parents; their reactions are so genuine you feel your heart crush. I have to wonder how people can really survive this?The book is a classic example of how people handle things different ways. Her father holds on to her memory while feeling powerless. In one particularly gut-wrenching scene, he is in his office surrounded by bottle ships. She's watching him and knows he is thinking the same thing as she: how much she used to love the bottle ships, and how they had built one together. In a violent rage and grief stricken beyond belief, he suddenly begins smashing and destroying each one. The family is naturally torn apart, but the mother chooses detachment as the best way of acceptance, and more than a father-daughter relationship becomes broken. Seeing how it affected her crush, the one she never got to kiss for the first time, and her sister is powerful.The novel is strangely poetic. It is a very quiet peace, moving slowly, almost dreamily. It's hard to describe the tone. The pace is very slow; I felt almost stuck in a single moment, frozen. It's a strange feeling to describe, and even harder to produce on paper or film. Alice Sebold is clearly a talented woman, using words almost as a musical piece without coming across as pretentious or forceful. It's strange that the novel does not appear to try hard to induce pity. It doesn't overboard and miraculously enough, it's not dramatic. That's a difficult feat to pull off. Instead it's filled with a quietly consistent nostalgia that steeps into the mind and won't let up.The main character is of course the murdered girl, Susie, who is not in the actions she's witnessing, and is a sort of narrator of how her family and friends deal with her loss. Her character is strong and convincing, especially considering her fourteen year old age. The scenario of the place between heaven is also interesting, a nice twist that people would feel better believing in. Not a ghost, no, but not yet ready to move on either, and neither is her family.This enchanting book is shocking in the beginning, and goes into precise detail of the violence, which is even sadder when you think about how it really happens. The family life she left behind is very real, with genuine problems and conflicts. The parents intrigued me the most I think, with the mother feeling suffocated with her expected role, and the father feeling like he can't protect what he should have, feeling everyone slip through his fingers.Peter Jackson may be bringing this novel to the big screen. If he manages to convey the wide assortment of grief that's in the books, it's destined to be a blockbuster hit. The best way to describe the story is that it's beautifully haunting. Whether a conflicting phrase or not, it's never been truer than in this case.",23,0.9637,0.149,0.69,0.162,0.4980717418546364,POSITIVE,0.9859
61,30087137,08/13/2008,,"(No rating)Before reading The Lovely Bones, I read Lucky, the memoir in which Alice Sebold gives a graphic account of her rape, at age eighteen, and her eventual face-to-face meeting with her rapist in court. I read both books shortly after they were released. What’s prompting me to add this review now is that I just learned two things: Sebold has written a third book called The Almost Moon; and a movie based on The Lovely Bones is scheduled for release in December, 2009.In The Lovely Bones fourteen year-old Susie Salmon is not only raped, but murdered; and she narrates the story from Heaven. Both books open with violent acts. The Almost Moon opens with, “When all is said and done, killing my mother came easily.” One reviewer said that, in comparison, “The Lovely Bones is a cheerful walk in the park.” I’m afraid The Almost Moon goes to my “never-plan-to-read” list.I love reading debut novels because nowadays so many of them are well-written. A “new voice” generally makes for a refreshing read. And I admit that at first I really enjoyed The Lovely Bones. I thought it was “different” and “bold”, especially the fact that the reader knows right at the beginning that the rapist/murderer is Mr. Harvey, a neighbour. Susie watches (from Heaven, remember?) Mr. Harvey, and her friends and family, and the impact her death has on their lives. She pays particular attention to Ray, the only boy she ever kissed, and to Ruth, who apparently can “feel” Susie. About halfway through the story, the narrative seemed to lose momentum, but I continued to read. Then, near the end, Susie “inhabits” the body of Ruth, so that she can have sex with Ray. Ruth, a lesbian, has no idea what happened until afterwards, when Ray tells her. And Ray, of course, doesn’t know that it wasn’t really Ruth that he had sex with. It is here that I must seriously question Alice Sebold’s motive in writing this novel. Is this emotional revenge, disguised as fiction? How can it be seen as any kind of resolution to have her character use a friend’s body to rape a young man? Or in doing so, to have him, effectively, rape her obviously non-consenting friend? And from Heaven?The title for Lucky was evidently in reference to the police later telling Sebold that she was “lucky”, because she was “only” raped, while the previous victim, in the same spot, had been raped, then murdered, then dismembered. I applaud Alice Sebold for writing Lucky; it cannot have been easy for her to write the memoir – in fact it wasn’t published until a further eighteen years of her life had passed. But I cannot applaud The Lovely Bones. Obviously, many readers disagree; rave reviews abound. This novel has been a huge success for Alice Sebold: it won numerous awards, and now there’s a movie. Like her third book, I think I’ll give that movie a miss.",24,0.9943,0.121,0.677,0.202,0.5867023408690074,NEGATIVE,0.7838
62,6902518,09/27/2007,2.0,"I would never have read this if it weren't for my bookclub. Having avoided it since it came out, I had very low expectations and so was surprised to be engrossed in the story - untill, about half-way through, it seemed to lose the plot and meandered around aimlessly, getting repetitive as it tried to wring emotion out of its characters, and me. Susie Salmon is dead. She begins her story by describing how she is murdered, and her family's reaction. From her place in heaven, she can watch anyone she wants to, but apart from ""touching"" Ruth, a fellow 14-year-old student at her school, on her way out, she can't make her presence felt. Ruth becomes a little obsessed with Susie, and starts to see and feel dead people, keeping a record of them in her diary. Susie's mum uses her daughter's death as a trigger to leave her family and try to recapture her youth. She is constantly described as a woman who never wanted to be a mother. Susie's dad takes her death particularly bad, and focuses on his two other children, Lindsey and Buckley. Susie watches from heaven as her family grows older, watches as Lindsey goes from first kiss to accepting a marriage proposal, watches her murderer, Mr Harvey, a serial killer who is [spoiler alert!:] never caught, and, at the end of the book, possesses Ruth's body so she can lose her viginity to the only boy she ever kissed. The Lovely Bones is fairly ambitious, and although it manages to keep from slipping into sentimental indulgence, it also lacks drive, and misses many opportunities to really delve into some interesting and important issues. Some devices were a bit cheesy, and seemed like avoidance. I guess I, like most people, would have been more satisfied if Mr Harvey had been caught, but that's not necessarily realistic either. The main reason why I struggled to finish it and why I give it only 2 stars is that the second half has nowhere to go, it loses its immediacy as the years go by and people start moving on, letting go of Susie, whose body was never found either. The characters started to annoy me - I wanted to be sympathetic, even of the mother, who, in a way, has the hardest time of all, but they began to get cliched. That said, there are some nice descriptions, Susie's voice is apt, there's a great sense of time (she's killed in the 70s) without being too obvious, and even if you only read the first half, it's well written and gripping before it becomes tedious.

It will never be found or so the killer thinks, but for a single bone from her elbow that's picked up by a dog from the neighborhood. The crime scene is zeroed in on a cornfield that's adjoining Susie's High School and while the police suspect and question everyone in the neighborhood, including Ray Singh who has a crush on Susie and has written a love letter to her, they somehow, never suspect George Harvey. Turns out that the latter is a serial killer and after suffering a traumatic childhood, fell into the habit of raping his victims and killing them in the most gruesome of ways.The trauma of it all takes away simple joys of life from Susie's family. They stop enjoying together as a family. Susie's mother and father grow apart, her kid brother grows mature overnight and her sister, Lindsey wears a thick shield around her at all times so no one can sympathize with her for the loss.

67,1047462233,09/06/2014,,Blog review @Scaredy Engines End of Line LibraryWow. This is the second book in a row I've DNFed this month! To me this book made no sense! It was so boring I now feel like a weight has been lifted off me for DNFing!I couldn't understand where the story was heading it just seemed to be about Susie's family's everyday life and as I've explained before I detest books that are solely about people's everyday life. But then again that was probably the point of this book maybe it was supposed to be about daily life. I went into this book expecting a sort of ghost story especially when in the description it was told by a girl who had been murdered. I shan't waste time on books on daily life and the movie trailer made this look like a story with paranormal elements. The style of writing was very good and if this had of been more about Susie than her living family then I would've really liked it. But it's not for me so there we are.I'm beginning to worry. Why am I suddenly becoming so fussy with my books? Or maybe I'm just making all the wrong decisions either way I see no point these days in persevering with something I'm clearly not enjoying but I really hope not to dnf too many books.

68,208013734,09/13/2011,4.0,"RATING: 4 STARSThe Lovely Bones is told from the young victim’s perspective as she tells us from heaven about being abducted, raped and murdered. As Susie tells the reader about her ordeal her own family is left without answers. The suspense and just the great writing comes from Susie telling us what her family is going through and how they go about finding out what happened to her.I read Lucky by Sebold first (a memoir of the author’s own rape) and for me it made the novel have so much more context and feeling. This was a very difficult subject matter but a brilliantly written novel. Telling it from Susie’s point of view and having us know what happened actually works really well in this novel. I enjoyed the other characters and the killer was so well done I couldn’t help but hate him. I would recommend this novel to most readers – I would only warn people off if they cannot handle difficult subject matter.My Novelesque Life",19,0.9447,0.125,0.658,0.218,0.5935606060606061,POSITIVE,0.9981

Affecting, comedic, disturbing, creepy, heartwarming, etc etc. Unfortunately, some the of the characters ended up bugging me too much, and the story went from poignant to afflicting, from comedic to moronic, from heartwarming to dull. The edgy wise-cracking, and apparently omniscient, grandma was a stupid idea for this story. We already have a dead girl up in “heaven” telling the reader what's going on in everyone's mind. The concept of the world-weary granny picking up on nuances that went unexplained to the reader was annoying and messed up the flow for me. That the mom of the dead girl and the emotionally reserved tough guy detective developed a budding romance...C'MON! F'real?! That idea would've best been reserved for an episode of ER or some other crap. The rift that developed between the mother and father could've been formulated much more subtly. Throwing an affair (and a fuck at the mall??) in there was just plain lazy. I quit reading the book shortly after the braniac turned spy-kid younger sister broke into the murderer's basement. And how do we know who the murderer is? Well, the dead girl tells us. That makes sense. But Dad knows who the murderer is, too, because he built a tent with the guy in his backyard...and he just knows...the wind blew in the right direction or some stupid thing. And grandma knows because Dad told her...and because Dad helped the murderer build a tent in the murderer's backyard, and the wind blew just so...well! It MUST be true! And the braniac spy-kid younger sister knows who the murderer is because both Dad and Grandma told her. My interest in this book totally vanished.

Sebold kept giving hints of a great story, but fell short with endless, boring, inconsequential details and a lack of detail when it really mattered. Call me unimaginative, but I don't like when a writer leaves important details to the readers imagination. Spell it out for me.Being an avid mystery/horror story lover, and reading my fair share of books regarding the ""great beyond"", I didn't get the feeling she had enough knowledge to adequately write about such topics. Her clues and climaxes went nowhere and it left me with more questions than answers. She would draw me in with these little details I thought she's expand on, and never did.If you're not a very sentimental person, don't buy this book. If you're the type of person that likes closure at the end of the story, don't read this book. If you're looking for a wonderful view of heaven and the ""great beyond"", don't read the book.Anyway, it's just my advice.

But I'm glad I read this story, even though it's not quite a book for me.This book is a touching picture of the people we leave behind after death - family, friends, acquaintances and complete strangers - as seen through the eyes of a fourteen-year-old murdered girl, Susie. For this very reason, it is a moving story, especially for younger readers. But older ones will also find some message. Because this story also touches on many other important topics, not only mourning, such as fatherhood, the role of women in the family and society's expectations of women, small-town life, adolescent fascinations and self-seeking. This is quite a few difficult topics for a book for teenagers.And at the same time, the world seen through Susie's eyes is childishly simple. Evil is evil, and anyone can sense its coolness and darkness. Susie looks with great kindness at people on earth, at their faults and imperfections, at the mistakes they make. She doesn't judge them, she doesn't get angry. Although I admit that some quite vivid descriptions surprised me. Especially those of the murderer's actions, these are not the words of a fourteen-year-old girl.We also have an interesting picture of the afterlife, at least of the transitional place where Susie is. Even if it is in many aspects similar to those we know well. However, what draws attention is loneliness in this perfect place where the only activity for the dead is to observe the living. Susie seems bored with the total freedom and eternal happiness she has received. She spends most of her time observing the living, and her greatest dream is to return to the ‘real’ world, even if for a very short time. Even in this perfect place, her life is a constant waiting for her family and friends to come to terms with her death.I'm not quite sure about the ending. Even for this rather fantastic story, it seems too detached from the reality, and even the existing logic of this story in which the dead could not significantly interfere with the actions of the living. Although I do like the ending of Mr. Harvey's part. There is some satisfaction in this.All in all, I think it's a nice book for fourteen-year-olds and adults who are looking for such stories. I personally would prefer a story where the world is a bit more complicated, and maybe even Susie's voice to be more engaged and emotional.

79,525744745,02/03/2013,2.0,"I have this bad habit when I’m reading particular books. As I’m reading, I precipitously nod off. I’m still reading(unconsciously), but my mind however has wondered off and I'm thinking about other things. Such as: “What should I eat tomorrow? Or “What the hell did I even do today?” Now, I don’t essentially notice I’m doing this. It’s only after a while when I return back to reading yet again, and the book is going on about something I don’t even remember occurring, I then comprehend that I must have nodded off. And the furthermost bothersome part about this habit is: I have to go back and read the section I missed, again. This happened more often than I'm able to count in the lovely bones. Don’t get me wrong, the lovely bones has a nice structured idea (not very original) but nonetheless a good Idea. However, the author accomplished to make my tedious life more entertaining than a book. Is that what the book lacked, entertaining the readers? The characterization was spot on for some characters, (not all) but then again that doesn’t mean the characters were attention-grabbing. The book was intriguing at first. I’m not being a creep or anything, but the only stimulating part in the entire novel was the opening of chapter one, and that's when she gets murdered. The rest was in slow motion, and then in the last 100 pages it was instantly fast-tracked five years into the future. The book revolves around the family and friends of Susie who are coping with her murder. That was the whole plot.Right at the end of the book the author does the unthinkable. She shatters all the rules she set out in the whole book about how the dead couldn’t contact humans in anyway. But for some unexplainable reason Susie is able to get into Ruth’s body, and somehow control it. Now, that Susie is able to control Ruth’s body, rather than telling the police where her psychotic murderer could be found or where her dead body lay. Susie instead decides to have sex. Really?This reminded me of Stephanie Meyer’s series - Twilight. Basically, Meyer spent the entire series telling us about how every new born vampire has a difficult time controlling their blood hunger. But however in the end Bella is just a natural at controlling her thirst. Waste of my life.I still gave the book three stars because frankly it wasn’t horrible.

You are probably asking yourself, “Well, what is so interesting about it?”  “My name was Salmon, like the fish; first name Susie.

The setting that Susie is living in and telling us various events is heaven. She is alone and misses her family. She was fourteen years old when she was brutally raped and killed by a neighborhood fellow. Now, in heaven she watched everything and everyone, especially her family and close ones. Along the way of watching all those different events, Susie discovers secrets and things that were never suppose to be seen. Some of the secrets are superior and some very poor, but both of them change her views on certain people.  What I liked about the book was the irony that appeared throughout the book. Just think, a little girl growing up. But she is dead. Another fixation that I enjoyed was all the literary devices that were portrayed throughout the book. That is also what makes the book very interesting. I recommend this book for people who enjoy moving, intersting, dramatic and eye catching things.

At most you feel them as a whisper or the wave of a whisper undulating down.' Susie Salmon was 14 when she was raped, murdered and then dismembered.She watched from her cozy little heaven as things unfurled down below on Earth. She watched as her family grieved for her, she watched as her murderer run loose leaving a couple more dead bodies in his wake while her unfound remains rotted away.I was craving for a book with a huge  whodunnit  case and eventhough this book had already revealed who the murderer is by the first few chapters  (This isn't a spoiler, by the way)  I still wished there was the ever present air of mystery that shrouded the story.As the blurb promised,  I waited anxiously for Susie's death to be justified and her body to be found.  I wanted so bad for the murdering rapist to suffer for what he did. Things didn't go exactly the way I wished but then again, not everyone can have what they want. But I still won't deny that I was let down badly.I thought the point of this story was to read how Susie's family slowly uncovered clues that lead straight to her murderer (which is really exciting) but it turned out that  The Lovely Bones  is really written to show readers how one family can break apart when a loved one is taken from them.For a book with such a promising storyline, this was one huge snore fest for me. The first 40-ish pages got me hooked but as I went past those 40 pages, I found myself being bored out of my mind. I get pages upon pages of FLASHBACKS that are so pointless and doesn't even add up to the story. Being stuck in Susie's head is PAINFUL.She'd describe something happening and the next she's thinking of a flashback and then the next she'll come back to describing the scene again. It made my brain go numb.As boring as Susie's ordinary family is in their grievances,  their love for the girl is actually tear-jerkingly touching. Take Susie's father, his grief was so great he actually forgot there are two of his children who are still alive and breathing. 'Even the living needs attention too.' Now and then, Susie Salmon would  stalk watch her crush, Ray Singh and one oddball of a girl, Ruth, who I can't even call her as Susie's friend since their relationship before she died had never went as deep.While I find the others to be boring and ordinary, Ruth was the only character (aside from the pedophile) who intrigues me.  'She had an expression of someone who was constantly on the lookout for something or someone that hadn’t yet arrived.' She is a psychic who can touch a small part of the otherworld and 'hear' the dead.Susie watched this girl go about her life. She watched how close Ruth is with Ray and if you ask me, she used that 'closeness' they have to her benefit. This is the part where I must spoil a part and rant the hell out of my mind.(view spoiler)[ At the near ending, Susie's soul somehow fell out of heaven and inhibited Ruth's body while she was with Ray. Then Susie somehow managed to coerced Ray into having sex with her while she was using RUTH'S BODY temporarily. I don't care what anyone thinks but  THAT IS A FORM OF RAPE. That scene was just so so so so wrong. It legit froze the tears in my eyes and made me scowl.  (hide spoiler)] When I read that Alice Sebold got raped in her early adolescent, I thought the author would have thought better than to write such a scene.Despite that horrible scene, a part of me was touched by the devotion Susie's family have for her and I actually do enjoy Sebold's melancholic writing.And also despite the anticlimax, this book is still quite lovely that delivered a deep meaning and raised awareness.

Let me tell you a story about a six-year-old girl.At least she was six years old when she went missing. She was also six years old when her body was discovered in a dumpster 5 days later.She had been raped, tortured and ultimately, murdered by a man in her neighbourhood.A twenty four year old man who was a mechanic and regularly visited Zainab's house as a guest. A friend.A man who had the audacity to publically join the ""Justice for Zainab"" movement. Who came to the grieving parents and said ""I'm sorry for your loss."" after her body was discovered.This is a true story. It happened in Pakistan a few months ago. The murderer is currently on death row for the rape and murder of numerous girls. Of numerous CHILDREN. This story caused a huge outcry in Pakistan, and the topic of rape that is so rarely discussed in public was finally being addressed.Now, months later, I can not get the story out of my head. I found so many comparisons between Zainab's story and the tale from this book, that I knew I had to read it.I read this book in hope to get some what of a clue of what Zainab went through in her final few moments. What were the thoughts of an innocent child who had previously only known love and kindness, and who now saw the true monstrosity of human nature? Unfortunately, I am left even more confused than ever.This book shows Susie go to heaven after her murder, but she is not satisfied there. She watches down at the people on Earth and is still invested their lives. I could not, unfortunately relate my beliefs to this, and thus not enjoy it as much as I had hoped. Here is why:1) Firstly, I choose to believe that heaven is so fascinating and fulfilling that it makes you forget about all the hard times on Earth. Otherwise, what would be the reason to live and suffer? Why even bother being a good person?2) Secondly, the author seemed unable to clarify the distinction between heaven and Earth, and the book thus came off a bit confusing.3) The book is filled by some unnessecary fillers about Susie's family life before the incident and the lives of those not concerning the plot line. This dulled the book for me a little.4) There are ZERO emotions expressed by the narrator (Susie).  You'd expect her, given what happened to her, to share her feelings, but instead she simply gives us a play by play of what happens. Perhaps this is done to make the reader less triggered, but it pulled down the writing of the book.The plot of this book was fascinating but the above reasons lowered my love for the book. There were instances when I was brought to tears, but for the rest of it, I could feel no emotion because of the narrator's dry voice.I suppose I really just hoped to read this book for closure. So that I could rest peacefully knowing that Zainab, and the thousands of other mistreated girls like her out there are okay now, that they are happy. I haven't found my answer yet.I can still not fathom how people can take lives of innocent children and commit such unspeakable crimes. While the murderer is on death row and has been found guilty, is it truly enough? Is it enough justice for parents who will never see their daughter laughing again? For a once joyous child who is now nothing more than a broken body? All I can hope for is that they get what they deserve. I hope that little Zainab is up there somewhere, not stuck on her murder like Susie was, rather enjoying the unlimited bounties she gets in the after life. I hope she is happy. And I hope that her family, and those who love her can finally find peace.",14,0.9966,0.114,0.699,0.186,0.5238086126145829,NEGATIVE,0.9996

That said there are some nits here and there in the book that don't work, she has the main character at one point inhabit someone's body and I don't even want to discuss it anymore cause it was weird and off-putting. The only really false step I got while reading this.""The Lovely Bones"" is about 14 year old Susie Salmon who tells you about how she came to be raped and murdered. Her bones (the lovely bones in this story) are hidden and her family has to deal with the fallout from her disappearance. When a part of Susie is eventually found, her family then has to deal with knowing she is murdered and nver coming home. Sebold provides updates on via Susie about her family, the man who raped and murdered her, as well as a boy she had a crush on before her death.Susie's character was heartbreaking. Reading about her rape and murder was awful. You want to reach into the pages and keep her safe. I kept wishing for a different ending while reading this book. When Susie is gone, her soul races off to her own personal heaven and from there she keeps an eye on things. Parts of the book made me cry a lot. Reading about Susie meeting and hanging out with her grandfather and the other friends she makes in heaven are wonderful. Susie's sister Lindsey is dealing with having suspicions on the man she believes killed her sister and trying to hold on to her family as they slowly disintegrate. The younger brother Buckley is having to adjust to having a family that he remembers before Susie disappeared to after where everything seems to be focused on her. I didn't really like Susie's mother. I get people act to grief in different ways, but how she chose to deal with things made me feel sad. I do applaud Sebold though for not trying to sugarcoat things and also for the family to not rush to bring her back into the family fold.The writing was poetic at times. Sebold has a very strong grasp of words. I could picture everything that was happening perfectly (sometimes too perfectly). “My name is Salmon, like the fish; first name, Susie. I was fourteen when I was murdered.” “Murderers are not monsters, they're men. And that's the most frightening thing about them.” The flow for the most part was really good. Things just got slow towards the end in my opinion. You are just wanting to get to the end.The setting of the book takes place in Pennsylvania in the 1970s and then through the next few decades. The ending comes for a whisper almost with Susie starting to move on, but still watching her family. She wishes the reader a long and happy life.

I'm glad I read it instead of judging it based on the movie. This book is really good.I enjoyed that this book was less about catching the murderer and vengeance and all the bullshit that is so prevalent in the movie and more about Susie watching her family struggle with grief. There were some really beautiful moments in the story and I found myself much more attached to the characters than I was in the movie. Susie's family were all very vivid characters and I really liked the ways they were shown to grieve; the mother needs to run away from it, the father gets angry, the sister internalises it and the brother is a bit to young to fully understand what is going on. It all came together to form this really beautiful and interconnecting web of grief that you can see touch people in a variety of ways. This book was good. I liked it. But I don't think it was great. Despite the fact that one passage made me cry and I was quite connected to the characters, it was still just an okay book. I found myself quite bored at times because the book stretches over the ten years after Susie is murdered and a lot of what the family experiences gets quite repetitive.

It was my favorite book of my teen years, and one of the only books I have ever reread. The book manages to have a concept that is so unique, while still managing to be beautifully written, a combination that is woefully hard for me to find. Every character has a depth and a purpose, and you can feel how much Susie loves her family. In fact, you feel all of her emotions; confusion, agitation, joy. And even though the whole idea of the book is far fetched, it strikes a very real chord. It is a tender and unique coming of age story that doesn't leave you feeling like you were punched in the stomach.I love Susie, I love Alice Sebold, and I love this beautiful, heart-swelling, heart-breaking book.",14,0.993,0.076,0.661,0.263,0.6353333333333333,POSITIVE,0.9997

93,762958908,11/12/2013,5.0,"Don't start ""Lovely Bones"" unless you can finish it. The book begins with more horror than you could imagine, but closes with more beauty than you could hope for.Still, there are reasons not to open this runaway bestseller. In the first chapter, 14-year-old Susie Salmon describes how she was enticed into a little cave by a neighbor on a snowy day. He stuffs her hat into her mouth. They both hear her mother calling her for dinner. He rapes her, cuts her throat, and then dismembers the body. It's the most terrifying scene I've ever read.For the next seven years, she describes how her family and friends -- and even her murderer -- cope with her absence. She's in heaven, so she can see everything from up there. It sounds mawkish, like a ghastly version of ""Beloved"" for white suburbia, but Alice Sebold has done something miraculous here.It's no coincidence that the novel has been embraced during a period of high anxiety about child abductions -- perhaps the only dread darker than our new fear of terrorism.With her disarming wit and adolescent candor, Susie drags us behind those stories from Salt Lake City and Stanton, Calif., forcing us to consider the mechanics of rape and murder and grief in a way no news report ever could.A few days after her death, Susie realizes that all the people she's with now are experiencing their own versions of heaven, reflecting their simplest dreams and aspirations from earth.""There were no teachers in the school,"" she tells us about her paradise. ""We never had to go inside except for art class for me and jazz for my roommate. Our textbooks were Seventeen and Glamour and Vogue. Our heaven had an ice cream shop where, when you asked for peppermint stick ice cream, no one ever said, 'It's seasonal'; it had a newspaper where our pictures appeared a lot and made us look important.""She also discovers that heaven isn't perfect. What she wants most is ""to be allowed to grow up."" But that's out.And so she turns back to her friends and family on earth, ordinary people ""who had never understood, as they did now, what the word horror meant."" Here, she almost enjoys the voyeurism that allows her to learn what life could have been.The power of ""Lovely Bones"" flows from this voice, a voice at once charmingly adolescent and tragically mature. She cares for her parents and siblings beyond measure, but the cosmic distance between them gives her a perspective that resolves the blur of sentimentality or vengeance even when the pain she's describing makes you wince.Her father spends his days squirming under the weight of guilt for not being there to save his child. Her mother, who always felt cramped by maternal duties, finds the new burden of grief more than she can bear. And her sister moves through school trapped in the ""Walking Dead Syndrome -- when other people see the dead person and don't see you.""Her classmates react across a full spectrum, from macabre comedy to obsessive sympathy. Most walk through the usual itinerary of community grief -- assembly, funeral, anniversary memorial. But a couple of them find that emotional journey inadequate and follow Susie's disappearance to a deeper sense of themselves and their responsibility in the world.Susie also watches the bland neighbor who murdered her. She sees him offer condolences. She sees him check on the carving knife in his bedroom. She sees him sweat. These are catch-your-breath scenes that teeter between the possibility of justice or another murder. But the author is so careful here. Susie's vision of his abusive childhood doesn't absolve or even, ultimately, explain the crimes he commits.She wishes he were dead, but there's no passion in that wish, only a sharp concern for the safety of her sister as she closes in on the truth. By the end, the retribution he receives is perfectly calibrated -- ignominious and anonymous.Susie watches her family for years, long enough, in fact, to note that ""it was no longer a Susie-fest on Earth."" They eventually reach that once-impossible-to-imagine future with moments, hours, and then somehow whole days of happiness.But this is as much a story about the dead as about the living. On her side, Susie must realize that she has progress to make, too, but first she insists on returning for one rite of passage that was denied her. Indeed, if the novel stumbles, it's on a weird scene of sexual fulfillment that runs embarrassingly close to Patrick Swayze's finale in ""Ghost.""Some readers -- and certainly most reviewers -- are likely to treat the religious elements of the plot merely as literary devices, sweet bits of comfort or wit in a novel about family survival and emotional recovery. But that may be like thinking of John Edward's ""Crossing Over"" as just a talk show.It's significant that this wildly successful novel comes with a heavy serving of spiritualism -- messages from the dead, ghostly visitations, and bodily possessions. None of the characters finds solace in anything as dusty as prayer or a sacred text. And as pleasant as Susie's heaven is, there's no God there, and certainly no Jesus. This is spirituality for an age that's ecumenical to a fault.But emotionally, it's faultless. Sebold never slips as she follows this family. The risks she walks are enough to give you vertigo. A victim of rape herself when she was in college, she includes some deadly satire of the shallow advice people offer in the face of great loss. There is no ""moving on,"" and time alone won't bring relief either. That only comes through the hard work of learning to care for the living while cradling the memory of this loved one. As her father eventually realizes, ""You live in the face of it.""http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0725/p1...",13,-0.988,0.179,0.665,0.156,0.5417148268398265,POSITIVE,0.8274
94,273645891,02/07/2012,2.0,"The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold was an amazing book and well written. It’s about a teenage girl who is killed and stays on earth as a ghost to watch over her family. Portrayal of a 14 yr old as she matures as a ghost over the years is excellent. Description of heaven gave me a new perspective of how it might really be. I don’t generally like sad books, but this might be worth reading to those looking for something a little deeper with a storyline to keep you interested. She lives vicariously through her younger sister quite a bit, which is interesting since it isn’t really her life. Overall, I thought it was a good read. Don’t know if I liked it enough to recommend it, but it definitely wasn’t bad. I liked how it flowed from one thought to another even if that thought was about something that happened years ago and two seconds later we were back at the murder scene. I also think it’s worth comparing the book to the movie, which I rented immediately after finishing the book. Obviously the movie never contains everything from the book. Those people out there that look for the same experience in a movie that they received from the book will always be disappointed. It’s a different medium, therefore it will be expressed differently. Book is much more graphic that the movie. For example, in the movie, the girl gets her first kiss when she goes into the body of Ruth. In the book, when she goes into Ruth’s body she ends up staying for awhile and makes love to Ray quite a few times. In the book, also, it goes into some detail about her rape, whereas the movie glosses over this. These are just small differences. There are others. One thing I really enjoyed about the movie was the imagery they used to portray her heaven. Beautiful, something you can only get from a movie. I do wish some of the smaller details had been added such as her reunion with her dog and how he was one of the few that could see her when others couldn’t. But I love dogs and thought that added to the story. The book also went into great detail about Ruth and her ability to see how people died and how she journaled it. I wish they would have expanded on her character a bit. There were some small differences like the event that brought back the mother, but nothing significant enough to change the feel of the story. The biggest and probably only thing that really bothered me was the time difference. In the book, Suzie watched her family for years and years. For example, her sister graduated from college, got married and had a baby in the book, but in the movie, not as much time passed. For example, I noticed throughout the movie, they used lines read directly from the book to stay true to the story. Well, one they used at the end shouldn’t have been used, especially since they didn’t stay true to the time difference. I’ll quote it here, “You don’t notice the dead leaving when they really choose to leave you. You’re not meant to. At most you feel them as a whisper or the wave of a whisper undulating down.” Undulating is not a word that a 14 yr old uses. In fact, I don’t think I’ve ever heard an adult use it. It’s a great word which has its uses in a literary text, but doesn’t make sense coming from a child. The Suzie in the book says this after years and years of observing her family and you’re not really sure how many years have passed, but it’s almost as she’s an adult in maturity with everything’s she’s went through. So it fit beautifully. However, in the movie, the time difference wasn’t there, and it seemed as if the story ended with the girl still being 14 yrs old. So the line didn’t fit. I guess not a big deal but it bothered me. Didn’t fit with the consistency of the story they were trying to show in the movie. In any case, both the book is worth reading and the movie worth watching for their own interpretations. ",11,0.9974,0.066,0.776,0.157,0.4556145874327691,POSITIVE,0.5785
95,3040930495,11/15/2019,1.0,"I have an awkward relationship with this book to say the least.I don't read a lot of murder mystery contemporaries (is that what it is?) so I couldn't really be the judge of how well that concept was portrayed, but I do know that I still couldn't wedge it deep enough into my interest level. That's not to say that this book wasn't interesting. There were a few things that were slightly intriguing, but they just couldn't hold me for long. The Lovely Bones  is about a girl, Susie Salmon, who was raped and killed and now watches the aftermath of her death from heaven. The plot does not go in any one continuous direction, but rather bounces around from time periods throughout Susie's life to recap memories. The idea the author had in mind was unique, but I did not like it. The atmosphere of the story is ominously twisted. Now, now, whoever may be reading this, I  know  murder mysteries are supposed to be that way. But the thing is, Susie as well as the reader know fully well who the killer is- we even get to see inside his mind at points. Because of that there was less mystery and more frustration. Most of my frustration was towards the side characters in general. Though this may be a work of fiction, nothing in this book felt natural. I can sort of see where it's going, and I don't want to put in the effort to finish. I DNFed at page 145 or so. I've got better things to read. EDIT: So. I looked at the reviews. I saw the ending.And boy, oh, boy am I glad that I didn't finish! What the helheim kind of ending is that??? I don't know about you, but this goes against all my beliefs about heaven.

I just loved how realistic the way they grieved and the way they tried to cope up with their loss. It was heartfelt and hearbreaking at the same time. I knew even before I started reading that this would not be focus on the pursuit of the creepy perverted perpetrator. It just threw me off on how Mr. Harvey paid for all of his hideous crimes. He died, because of icicles. As simple as that. I just couldn't believe he didn't suffer for so long after all of his vicious acts. It was not exactly the punishment he deserved. He deserved more and more of it. But then, this is one of the realities of life. Not everyone can get the right justice they deserved. I am not sure, exactly, what I liked more. This book or the movie version.

She's got her head and heart in the right place, she cares for her family and friends, and she seems pretty innocent. Right? Obviously the author made her this way to gain sympathy from the audience.

It was still back when people believed things like that didn't happen.""Thus begins the novel The Lovely Bones--the title does not refer to anyone's actual bones, as you will find out late in the book--a poignant story of what happens to a family after their eldest child is killed by a creepy pedophile who lives in the neighborhood. Her body is not found but certain people know in their bones, so to speak, who the murderer is. Susie, looking down from her ""heaven,"" tells what is going on in the aftermath of the crime. We see the lead detective on the trail of the killer, but with no body there are few clues and a lot of frustration. His exchanges with the family, especially the distraught father, are difficult. They both know who did it but they can't prove it. We see the killer himself and how he goes about his repulsive life. Susie's dog Holiday (who growls every time she goes by the killer's house), her wonderful loving father, her psychic friend Ruth, her super smart sister Lindsey, Ray Singh upon whom she has a crush, her spaced out mother, her adorable little brother Buckley, her hard drinking grandmother (she susses out right off who did it), Lindsey's boyfriend and his brother all interact as they struggle with the terrible loss of someone they love.

Susie Salmon was a teenage girl who, after being raped and murdered, by her seemingly deranged neighbor, watches from heaven or limbo as her family and friends struggle to accept her death, understand the circumstances, move on with their lives while she comes to terms with her own death.I first heard of this book from the movie. Author, Alice Sebold captured my interest about this young girl who was trying to find justice for her death, and in doing so, discovered other souls who also fell victim from her ruthless neighbor. Then there's also the story of Susie's sister in her coming-of-age phase. The first half of the book was intense and heavy but on the other half, it felt a little weird to me. I don't know how to explain it but I think it didn't really bode well with me in the end. Overall though, it was such a heartbreaking read.

The book is told from her point of view, most of it taking place after her death. I’m not spiritual and don’t believe in any afterlife, so it wasn’t this premise of the afterlife that I connected with. This is primarily the story of a family and how each member relates with each other and the world, including how this girl’s death and life has affected them; that was the aspect of the story I found fascinating and most of it rang true. It was a sad book and the girl’s dying experience was horribly upsetting, but I didn’t find it a depressing book at all, even though it was poignant as the dead girl narrator is the only one who knows what happened to her; parts of the book were even funny and parts suspenseful. And I do love stories of dysfunctional families. ",10,-0.8968,0.155,0.761,0.083,0.6404166666666666,POSITIVE,0.9846

”For the world is not our permanent home; we are looking forward to a home yet to come.”
Setting:Pennsylvania; 1973-1983Cover Thoughts?:The charm bracelet is significant to the story if you read about it. Plot:
”These were the lovely bones that had grown around my absence: The connections- sometimes tenuous, sometimes made at great cost, but often magnificent- that happened after I was gone.”
The details of the crime are laid out in the first few pages: from her vantage point in heaven, Susie Salmon describes how she was confronted by the murderer one December afternoon on her way home from school. Lured into an underground hiding place, she was raped and killed. But what the reader knows, her family does not. Anxiously, we keep vigil with Susie, aching for her grieving family, desperate for the killer to be found and punished. Sebold creates a heaven that's calm and comforting, a place whose residents can have whatever they enjoyed when they were alive -- and then some. But Susie isn't ready to release her hold on life just yet, and she intensely watches her family and friends as they struggle to cope with a reality in which she is no longer a part.This book may not seem like it has much of a plot. After all, it mainly concerns Susie watching her family up from her heaven, with occasional glimpses into the life of her killer Mr. Harvey. And for some, I imagine that this could get to be a pretty boring novel, since it’s more a character driven novel then an action packed adventure. But if you take the time and have patience, the rewards will surely pay off. I read this book BFG (Before Goodreads) when I was fifteen, and remembered that I thoroughly enjoyed it. Now almost six years later, I’ve come back to it and once again found myself immensely enjoying it. If I had to compare it to another work, I would say it’s in the vein of Everything I Never Told You by Celeste Ng (although I actually liked that one a lot better). We get glimpses into what the afterlife means to different people, how we all grieve differently, and how the devotion of our family members can bring comfort to us all, no matter where we are in this world. Characters:
”My name was Salmon; like the fish; first name, Susie”


This isn’t a spoiler, BTW; it’s literally told to you within the first two pages. Susie Salmon is like any typical teenage girl; she focuses on school, worries about whether or not her crush likes her back, and pursues her passions with vigor; in her case, photography. But her life is tragically cut short when she’s brutally raped and murdered by Mr. Harvey. For the rest of the novel, we’re in her shoes as she watches over her family from her own version of heaven. Plucky, tenacious, and almost naively innocent despite what happened to her, Susie is a character to root for (except for that one incident which will be talked about in a bit). I liked Susie and felt enormously sorry for her, since she had so much potential waiting for her if she lived. 
”My murderer was a man from our neighborhood. My mother liked his border flowers, and my father talked to him once about fertilizer. ”
Mr. Harvey; what a walking contradiction. A man who makes toy dollhouses for a living, which portray the picture perfect display of domestic bliss, had anything but that growing up. With a father that abandoned him and a mother who encouraged him to shoplift by the time he was eight, he eventually turned out the be a pervert and a monster, and the disgusting individual who snuffs the light out of not only Susie Salmon, but at least ten other women and girls as well. I had very little sympathy for Mr. Harvey, but I almost felt a bit disconnected in my dislike for the man. We saw so little of him in the book, that it was hard to get a really good glimpse of his character, other than the obvious statement that he was serial killer in the worst possible form. He represents all the skeevebags who get away with this type of behavior for years and never get caught, and I’m sure that all of their victims (like Susie), are watching down here with gritted teeth and hidden resentment at the fact that they’ll probably never get caught. 
”And they had never understood, as they did now, what the word horror meant.”
It’s every family’s worse nightmare. Their beloved child doesn’t come home. At first, there’s denial. We live in a nice place; how could something possibly happen in a place like this? Then there’s anger; Why would something happen to someone so innocent as them? Then there’s guilt; Could we have done more? And then the raw pain of grief. This is the life of the Salmons; Jack and Abigail (dad and mom), Lindsay (the little sister), and little Buckley (the little brother). All who loved Susie and were cruelly robbed of her. And yet, they each deal with her death in very different ways; Abigail begins to withdraw and eventually runs away from her guilt. Jack spends every waking moment obsessed with finding his daughter’s killer, Lindsay does her best to not let her true emotions show and be the pillar of support for her slowly crumbling family. And then there’s poor little Buckley, who is just too young to understand the meaning of it all. The reader simultaneously feels the intense love and sorrow this family has, and I felt that it was done realistically. Pros:If you like books that are more character driven then plot driven, then this would be a wonderful book for you. While not all the characters were as fleshed out as I wanted them to be, it provides a smart and moving portrayal of how one single act can destroy the carefully picture-perfect façade that people try to implement. How if you notice carefully enough, you can see the cracks of uncertainty peeking out. Cons:Here’s the scenario; you’ve just been brutally raped and murdered. You fall to Earth. What’s the first thing you’d probably want to do? Well, I’d want to do two things; first, I’d wat to check up on my family (even though they probably wouldn’t be able to see me), and let them know I’m OK. Then, I’d want to find/track down/obsessively hunt Rambo style my murderer and kill him in ghost form.But what does Susie do instead? She takes over the body of a girl she kind of sort of knows from high school and has sex with the boy she has a crush on. WHAT???? Why would you do that? You even mentioned in an earlier chapter how you’d do it if you ever ran into the moron yourself!
”’How to Commit the Perfect Murder’ was an old game in heaven. I always chose the icicle; the weapon melted away.”
YOU HAD THIS PERFECT PLAN FORMULATED WHEN YOU WERE UP IN HEAVEN, AND YOU FORGO IT JUST SO YOU HAVE SEX WITH THE BOY YOU HAD A CRUSH ON FOR LIKE TWO WEEKS????

This would’ve been the perfect opportunity to off the guy! As far as I know, they can’t criminally charge ghosts with murder….Love Triangle?:Yes; Jack vs. Abigail vs. Len
”His love for my mother wasn’t about looking back and loving something that would never change. It was about loving my mother for everything- for her brokenness and her fleeing, for her being there right then in that moment before the sun rose and the hospital staff came in. It was about touching that hair with the side of his fingertip, and knowing yet plumbing fearlessly the depths of her ocean eyes.”
Before the chain of events, Jack and Abigail seemed to have a perfectly loving marriage. And yet inwardly, Abigail was beginning to chafe, like many women of the era, her role as the perfect domestic housewife. She wanted more from both her marriage and her life. And though it was kind of morbidly convenient, Susie’s death gave her an out for that. This outing also includes Len Fenerman, the police officer in charge of Susie’s investigation. But unfortunately for both parties involved, it didn’t end well. 
”I felt sorry for him; He had tried to solve my murder and he had failed. He had tried to love my mother and he had failed.”
Honestly, the thing with Len was just that to Abigail; a thing to temporarily distract her from the pain she felt. Instalove?:Nope!A Little Romance?:

There are many love stories in this book, but Susie only has one; with Ray. And it’s just that; a little romance. They simply never got to spend enough time together to make it more than that. And apart from that scene (ugh), it was actually very sweet. The movie portrays it much better than the book, BTW. Conclusion:Six years later, and I still enjoyed it. I know a lot of people had issues with this book (these character driven novels are either love em or hate em), but I for one found it to be just as good as I remembered. Alternately heartbreaking and hopeful, it will remind you to be thankful for the time you have had here, as well as the people who have filled those hours with love and happiness as well. 

Watch This:This was made into a movie back in 2007 starring Saoirse Ronan, Mark Wahlberg, Stanley Tucci, Susan Sarandon, and Rachel Weisz. Blessedly, it tones down the whole Ray/Susie/Ruth scenario. Check it out!",9,0.9862,0.155,0.671,0.174,0.5897105672105674,POSITIVE,0.7156

117,3988324192,05/07/2021,5.0,"This is my second time reading The Lovely Bones. I've seen the movie more often than I can count, and I had to read a very beat-up, sad paperback copy of it in high school. I don't really remember a lot of my opinion on it from high school. Some creep crossed out the 'S' in ""Bones"" on the title and replaced it with 'ERS' on the copy from school I had, so this time around, I bought my own copy. Sebold's book isn't really done justice by the movie at all (although the movie is aesthetically beautiful and has some wonderful soundtrack by Brian Eno). The movie is extremely preachy, doesn't do a very good job of accurately portraying what growing up during the 1970's would have been like (according to my parents, sticking posters from The Partridge Family and psychedelic wallpaper everywhere doesn't make it 1970's, so I'll take their word for it), and the more mature themes from the book were cut out or watered down by Dreamworks when they made the movie. The Lovely Bones as a book is much darker. It's a coming-of-age novel about a fourteen-year-old girl who will never come of age. While it does have some sappy, preachy moments throughout, and some of the sexuality stuff in it is heavy-handed and quite awkward, Sebold writes characters and her version of the afterlife very well.The Lovely Bones, set in the early 1970's and onward, follows teenager Susie Salmon (""like the fish""), who lives in the suburbs with her parents and siblings. Her days are spent like most girls that age, dreaming about boys and fashion and glossing over the world in an innocent, romantic sense. The book describes Susie's most memorable life events and childhood experiences, her hopes and dreams for the future, her hobbies, and an older boy named Ray whom she harbours a crush on. The Lovely Bones also follows Mr. Harvey, a Ned Flanders-esque, wholesome-as-Wonder-Bread sort of single guy who lives nearby, an ordinary man (so boring by appearances that it might be unnatural upon closer thought) that few people pay him much notice, including Susie. Unfortunately for her, this man is ultimately her undoing quite early-on in the book.The vast majority of The Lovely Bones isn't about Susie's life, but about her afterlife. It would be chaotic to try and summarize it all and to describe the depth of the world Sebold imagines, where Susie can observe the living but no longer be a part of their world. She makes friends in her new Heaven, mainly a girl called Holly, and she watches her family handle grief, dysfunction and an ongoing police investigation revolving around her absence. Technically she's considered ""missing"". Nobody wants to speak the probable reality out loud; her little brother is too young to understand what death is, her little sister is angry, her father is lost as he struggles with thoughts of revenge and obsession, and her mother becomes distant and increasingly removed from the once happy family. Her old classmates, Ray and a social misfit called Ruth, build a friendship around Susie's absence and their own feelings that perhaps she is still a part of their world in some way, whether she's gone or not.This is a very interesting book, especially in its portrayal of death. It's not nihilistic and cynical, but it's not sugar-coated or predictable, either. The characters are also very troubled, flawed and multi-dimensional; Sebold even manages to give a shred of humanity to the primary antagonist, who struggles with his own guilt, mental demons and perversion. While its main character is a fourteen-year-old, it's written in such a way that most readers wouldn't really understand Susie's journey unless they were maybe a few years older. I'm not sure I would necessarily consider it ""supernatural"", or ""romance"" either for that matter, but it does have qualities from many different genres and it stands out as a really memorable story.",9,-0.9767,0.111,0.809,0.081,0.5296537676415727,NEGATIVE,0.9987
118,3066682678,12/12/2019,3.0,"It could've been 5 stars if it weren't for that horrible ending. If the book simply ended in the first half, it would’ve probably been 5 stars. It feels like the author didn’t have an idea of how to finish the book, so she gave us a romantic-turned-out-to-be-a-rape-scene and just stopped writing and turned it in for editing. In the first few pages, the main character Susie is raped and killed on her way home from school, with her soul ascending to heaven. Her body was taken care of in such a way that only her elbow was ever found. To see the world after death through the eyes of a 14-year-old was unexpectedly touching as we accompany her watching over her family from above while they go through grief and trauma. This is such an interesting premise and a way to present heaven. The author knew how to create heaven without losing herself in religion or making the world-building too complicated. From that perspective, you watch a family nearly get destroyed by the tragedy of one of their members being killed. The loss was so raw I felt their pain and sadness. I actually felt depressed throughout the whole read. Susie has to watch everybody grow up while she will never get that chance. It's interesting enough when you get caught up in the lives of the characters and connect with them, but after a while, even that starts getting old. The problem is that nothing really happens. Susie's family and friends go on living their lives, occasionally thinking about her, and that's all. There’s no plot and there’s no closure. It’s not only about catching the killer. And it’s definitely not about punishing Mr. Harvey for what he did. It’s like this book is one big filler. But I understand why it’s so acclaimed. It’s wonderfully written and doesn’t play with human emotion. The fact that it realistically describes the lives of so many people after such a tragic event has happened is what makes it so different. I loved the writing and I loved the story, despite it being plotless. The thing is, I feel betrayed by its end. When Susie was alive, there was a boy she liked, Ray. In the years after her death, Ray grows up to be and becomes friends with Ruth, another girl who attended Suzie’s high school and was influenced by her death. Suzie watches him and longs to be with them. Somehow, the universe allows Susie to possess the body of Ruth, who was obsessed with the afterlife by the way. Susie uses the opportunity to seduce Ray. And then Susie has to go back to heaven, without reaching out to her family or somehow making sure that her killer pays for his crimes. Basically, this was also rape, as Ruth didn’t really have a choice in the matter of her own body. The way the book presents two instances of rape is wildly different. One is presented as a horrible, evil deed, and the other one as a moment of true happiness for both Ray and Suzie. But what about Ruth? It didn’t seem like she had a say about her own body. Susie ends her surveillance and moves on. And here is the main problem that I have with the book. What was the point of having her perspective if nothing gets resolved?Suzie’s emotional range is not one of many ups and downs, it is more like a pleasant indifferent flatline. That peaceful detachment made it even hard to go through the book. As if she’s so numb from pain, she can’t feel anything anymore. On the other hand, it makes her heaven even more real - there is no anxiousness and worry anymore, only peace. I liked her as a narrator and her soothing tone is one of the highlights of the book.

119,196900704,08/10/2011,1.0,"This book offered so much promise: a well-devised rape and murder scene, a family’s fight to find justice whilst grieving for their loss, the psychology of a serial killer and even an unusual take on heaven. However, when I finished this book I was left utterly disappointed on all accounts. I can’t seem to understand what makes this book a bestseller. And how did it get adapted into a movie directed by none other than Peter Jackson? THE Peter Jackson…there are some things I will never fathom. First of all, do not pick up this book on the basic assumption that it involves a mystery that will be solved. It does not! I won’t be revealing anything important by stating that Susie Salmon (the narrator) was raped and murdered by her neighbour, George Harvey – this was all revealed in the first paragraph of Chapter 1. Rather, this book is more about loss and how different individuals deal with the grief of losing someone. It is a great concept but the book lacked the depth and emotion to pull this of. Like a marathon, the book is slow, boring and long! It gets off to a good start with Susie’s murder but it quickly loses pace somewhere in the middle and near the end, the story just felt laboured. The characters themselves were undefined and could not hold the story together. By the end, I felt no connection whatsoever with any of them.Half of the characters seem to have no relevance in the story. What was the point of Hal’s character? It seems like he was only included for the pleasure of Susie’s grandmother, Lynn. Then there’s Ruth (the sixth sense girl), who hardly made any sense. She wasn’t even friends with Susie, yet seems to have a strange obsession with her death. Susie’s supposedly best friend plays no role in this book whatsoever. Some friend! Then we have Ray, the love interest. Oh, the only reason he’s included is so Susie could drool over him. Then there’s the mother, Abigail. She somehow never really fits in with the family and to be honest I really didn’t care. Whilst Jack, the father, is the only person who seems to grieve his daughter’s death, Abigail is too busy shacking up with the detective and then suddenly leaves the family. There wasn’t even any dramatic effect with her completely abandoning her family. Just a simple – ‘I’m going away to the cabin for a few days' and then just doesn’t come back.And then there’s Susie. They say ‘like mother, like daughter’ – oh how true that is. After seeing her family struggle with her death for years, what is the single most important thing on her ‘to do list’ given the chance to come back to earth? Guess! ‘Tell her family she’s ok, that she misses them, and tell them what happened to her, who killed her and where her body is?’ NO NO NO. That’s not Susie’s style.

I thought it was a very interesting idea.Unfortunately the ending left a sour taste in my mouth, which explains the rating. As many of you know Alice Sebold is a rape victim, and actually managed to get justice for her attacker, which you know good for her! I bring this up because Susie (the main character of The Lovely Bones) was raped before her murder and at the end of the book she comes down from heaven, enters Ruth's body and has sex, more than once, with the boy that Susie was crushing on before her murder. To me, that is just one bit what the f*ck moment. Ruth doesn't consent to this - and has no sexual attraction to him nor his gender. What if she got pregnant? Oh hey mum I technically haven't had sex but I've got a kid on the way... How must Ruth feel having her body violated like that? I ugh I just felt so frustrated with this book and actually through it across the room after finishing it. ",9,-0.7749,0.12,0.765,0.114,0.4969348659003831,NEGATIVE,0.9999

For the most part, her characters and their reactions were all convincing in the context of the story. I also appreciated the interesting POV (a murdered girl named Susie) as well as the new spin offered on the ""afterlife"" and the possibilities.That's what I liked and why I finally settled on 4 stars.What I didn't like?This is told from an omniscient POV at the cost of intimacy. Susie has a bird's eye view of every character and doesn't hesitate to jump from one head to another, sometimes when it serves the story but even when it doesn't. I also felt that at times the story borders dangerously close to sappy, drags, and feels repetitive.Finally, the ending is a bit of a disappointment (view spoiler)[just can't believe that Susie would spend her unexpected second chance at life to have sex with a boy she kissed once at the age of fourteen, considering everything else that was going on (hide spoiler)].

Unfortunately, I found the storytelling very detached, and I really couldn't understand how it is possible with such a horrific murder. I ended up feeling pretty bored, and I finished just through the hope that some revelation will happen, and nothing did. The murder itself is told in the first few pages, so there is no big mystery in the book. The book deals with people who knew Susie, her family and friends, and their reactions, and coping with the terrible event. Sebold gets into their thoughts, and describes many people at length. Together with the distant style I found the it could be much shorter, and definitely much stronger by a more professional hand.

 My name was Salmon, like the fish; first name, Susie. I was fourteen when I was murdered on December 6, 1973.Spoilers in the review are marked! 3.75 stars! this would have been over a 4 but there was a certain scene (view spoiler)[Susie taking over Ruths body and having sex with Ray was just weird and took me out of the story (hide spoiler)] that just bothered me too muchThis was sad, but sad in a beautiful way. I don't know what it is, but there's something beautiful in seeing how different people react to the same traumatic event. I know some ways to deal with the grief feel wrong (view spoiler)[the mother having an affair and then moving away made me so angry, but then again, who am I to say that her way of dealing with the death of her daughter is the wrong way?she was already unhappy before Susie died, so who knows what might have happened if her death hadn't happened? (hide spoiler)] but it also felt very real. I know a lot of people didn't like the way it ended because not everything gets wrapped up nicely, but 1) I adore those types of endings, and 2) it fits the story perfectly in my opinion. Not every story has a perfect happy ending, that's not how the world works (view spoiler)[I know a lot of people got angry about the fact that Susie never gets found. I understand why, but the parents and the police know what happened to Susie and who did it, and I think it gives enough closure for the family. Others got annoyed that Mr. Harvey gets killed in such a way and never faces justice, but he probably would have never been caught, and in this way Susie kinda gets her justice because she ""kills"" him with the icepick (which she always said was the perfect murder weapon).

I don’t usually tend to write reviews with spoilers as I like people to form their own conclusions and enjoy the read. However I have to vent my feelings and using spoilers is the only way this time. So be warned! Major Spoiler alertLet me start off by saying that I enjoyed the concept of Susie telling the story from Heaven, after she was brutally raped and murdered. She keeps an eye on her family to see how they are handling it all, and watches her murderer in hopes that he will be caught. I gave the book two stars, because the first quarter of the book was interesting and written well. It seems everything went downhill for me from there.I had a very hard time with the mother up and leaving her family the way she did. It caused me to not be able to relate to her at all, and resent her for what she did to her children. I can understand and appreciate that you and your family will never be the same after a loved one is brutally murdered, but taking off and leaving your other children was never an outcome that I would have pictured. Lack of trust in people, or obsessive compulsive, controlling behaviours would be more along the lines of what I would have imagined.I was disappointed that the Police seemed to be portrayed as people who could not figure out a clue if it smacked them in the face. Don’t even get me started on the lead Detective Len and his unprofessional behaviour. Just another character I can’t stand.The middle of the book seemed to drag with time passing by and everyone growing up. Pages and Pages go by before you hear anything about what Mr. Harvey is up too. I must be confused because I thought he was one of the main characters. In the beginning of the book it seemed like Susie was keeping tabs on him in hopes he would get caught and then he just seems to become unimportant for a while.I was also put off by the fact that the story seemed to switch genres towards the end, we have gone from a mystery / thriller type novel to a paranormal fiction. I just about had a fit when Ruth all of a sudden was able to see where people died. I liked her better as the odd awkward girl from High School who never seemed to fit in. It made her more human and easier to relate too, but now all of a sudden she’s got some special gift for seeing the dead. Good grief.Which brings me to the part of Ruth and Ray, what on earth was that all about? Susie is propelled from Heaven and ends up in Ruth’s body, and Ruth goes up to talk to the dead. Just by looking at her Ray knows something is not the same and guesses Susie is in Ruth’s body. Off they go and have sex so Susie can fulfil her dream and live the things she missed out on. Does anybody else have a problem with this?Seriously! I just about hurled the book across the room after that. One, I can’t believe Ray who’s studying to become a Doctor would just blindly go along with this whole body possession thing. And two, it’s just not right! You’re taking over the body of a supposed friend to use it to have sex with a guy you liked in High School. Seriously! You would think for a character that has experienced something as traumatic as rape she would be a little bit more respecting of other people’s personal space. Believe it or not, but that still was not the worst part of the book for me. The worst part of the book was when Mr. Harvey follows the young girl out to the back of the rest stop, intending to make her his next victim, and she blows him off, only to have an icicle fall from the rest stop and kill him. That’s right, death by icicle! You did not see that one coming did you?I was very upset with the fact that Mr. Harvey was just killed on a whim; there was no closure to his character. Anything would have been better then death by icicle! How about the young girl turned victim stabs him with the icicle while fending off Mr. Harvey as he tries to rape her. There you still get your icicle in the story if that is so important. Then there would be some sweet justice for the reader as the roles are reversed and the antagonist becomes the victim.I just felt like there was a great idea had for a story, and then about half way through the author was confused as to where she wanted to take things, or how to tie them together, and by the end she had just completely given up even bothering to try. The ending was horrible, and I came away with the feeling of wasting my time. ",8,-0.9888,0.15,0.73,0.12,0.5252413127413126,NEGATIVE,1.0
135,101042433,05/02/2010,5.0,"Lovely Bones might forever be a mystery to me, as I remember new facts and reach deeper conclusions of life itself, days after reading it. The story is told softly and eloquently through Susie, unusual first-person narration from heaven since her death and rape at a tender age of fourteen. She peaks down and stands guard like a sentinel watching down on her family that gets lost in despair and grief from the moment she went missing. The loss of a child, a life altering experience for the parents, spun their lives into a tornado of disbelief and sadness as her sister Lindsay and brother Buckley tired their best to remember their sister but not be forgotten by their parents. The tale bluntly throws issues of how does one deal when their loved one is not coming back home, their bed from now on un slept in, untouched clothes thrown all over the floor in the usually teenage frenzy, books collecting dust that she will never read, Saturday breakfast with an empty seat at the table, memories frozen in time, with no new leads. When Mr. Harvey, the next door neighbor took Susie's life in the cornfield, he also took a bit of her parents, her siblings and friends and family; he chipped at them and changed their lives forever.Alice Sebold wove a crafty tale of love and death, people in heaven who looked on their family members and who lived in their memories and hearts. She wrote the most amazing words and sentences, brilliant and poignant flowing through simple language reaching through the pages and grabbing the reader from the very first page. She would call an oil spill on the ground a gasoline rainbow and gave shapes and colors fantastic illusions giving her tale a dream like quality.I was impressed that when in heaven, Susie was not angry at her killer, instead she used all her strength to reach out to her parents, she wanted to be found, loved, remembered, her pictures looked at, her life not forgotten and buried like her bones. Her father's obsession with finding the killer, her mother's cold mask that hardened the day she died, her sister trying to close and harden herself from what happened so other kids would not whisper about her, her brother's ordeal trying to learn what death was at his young age and her mothers mom, a wonderful and witty grandmother who almost stole the show were written as if life itself told the tale. I felt what they felt, and appreciated life more, knowing how Susie missed hers. As this story continues for years, the reader learns to love Susie's family, and their struggle to be normal, to move on and to stay together.I adored all the characters, they were real people to me, who laughed, cried, sweated and breathed, who baked pies, stole kisses and began relationships, who hanged on to her memory and love forever. I was sorry to see the story end, as the book feels like something one can read forever. Ms. Sebold wrote about the loss of one person and the domino effect it had on everyone around, a network of sorrow and of communication and support. Every time I see a stranger reading it on the bus or in the park, for a second I feel connected to them as I recall the tale in my head and the feelings it stirred.It was lovely; heart warming and sad, but I absolutely loved it.- Kasia S.

Yes yes, I know the author was trying to avoid an obvious ending, that finding the body or the murderer is not important. I applaud her for her effort but I think the ending she chose was somehow incomplete. She left me with all these hopes and questions that I will have to make up the answers for:1) Abi could have cleared Jack about her affair. You know like get it on the table and be done with it. She can't come back into a marriage without confessing it to Jack.2) I wish the author had written about the body being discovered. Even just a few extra words...I would have liked to know what Suzie felt when her body was laid to rest. I would have liked to see Jack get the relief he deserved.3) I wanted to know if the family ever found out about Mr Harvey's death. Not like be exceptionally happy about it but just to know that he got what he deserved even if he didn't get caught by the coppers. Justice was no where to be found.Whats nice is the title. When I read the title I always thought that the ""lovely bones"" referred to Suzie's bones. But no, the bones are actually the people you leave behind when you die. How they scatter because of the grief and gradually repair each other through all that damage over time. The author added a lovely twist when Suzie entered Ruth (not sure how Ruth felt about all that) to give her chance to complete her love story. I liked how Suzie used those oh so VERY precious moments to express to Ray how much she loved him, instead of use that time to tell him where her bones were or the whereabouts of Harvey. She clung to the living moments to talk about love and not to talk about tragedy long buried and forgotten. She found peace for eternity in those few seconds. It made me smile.Its a story about the living, from the angle of the dead. A loss that tore a family apart but only to bring them together stronger than ever.

It's not like I read 50 pages of the beginning and skipped over basically the whole center and read the last 50 pages; not at all.

Quite possibly the most weirdly disturbingly detailed book I've read (not that it was detailed well, but the style of the author's way of describing disturbing moments is...disturbingly terrible). And boring. The characters don't have depth period. I mean with this type of book you'd expect a lot more. You can't just have a book about this topic and be written it like this. Some characters are not remotely lifelike. Not even an inkling. Flat, dull characters. Pretty shallow writing.I like the author. I think she is a good author. I'll add 3 tenths of a star because of that.

It's always been a book that I have been aware of and thought I should read and it was brought back to my attention by the lovely Y10 'book doctors' a few weeks ago.I think we all know the premise; Susie Salmon, 14, is killed by a neighbour and then peers down from heaven and tells us her story. I thought this would be a really cool take on a thriller where we see her killer being tracked down and retribution given, but actually this book is about a how a family mends itself after the death of a child creating new lovely bones.Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with a bit of family drama, but it's not really my thing. After the first section of the book, where Susie's death and the events leading up to and closely following were fantastic and punchy, but this really slowed down about halfway through and I was just trudging along to finish it. I feel a bit robbed. Perhaps I had too high expectations of this book?I was also slightly disturbed by the events that occurred after Susie falls to Earth. It makes not sense whatsoever (girl, tell him where the murderer is!) and also there are issues surrounding consent and abuse of another's body.I'm not sure why this is praised so highly. I think it's just OK.",7,0.4476,0.116,0.744,0.14,0.4385222596333706,NEGATIVE,0.9998

150,2833078168,06/28/2019,4.0," Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️I wasn't completely sure what to expect from this book but what I ended up reading was something really good. I was recommended this book by my mom because it had a satisfying ending (for my BiblioGames readathon) but I'm not sure the end was my as satisfying as I had hoped.   Synopsis    The Lovely Bones is the story of a family devastated by a gruesome murder -- a murder recounted by the teenage victim. Upsetting, you say? Remarkably, first-time novelist Alice Sebold takes this difficult material and delivers a compelling and accomplished exploration of a fractured family's need for peace and closure.The details of the crime are laid out in the first few pages: from her vantage point in heaven, Susie Salmon describes how she was confronted by the murderer one December afternoon on her way home from school. Lured into an underground hiding place, she was raped and killed. But what the reader knows, her family does not. Anxiously, we keep vigil with Susie, aching for her grieving family, desperate for the killer to be found and punished.Sebold creates a heaven that's calm and comforting, a place whose residents can have whatever they enjoyed when they were alive -- and then some. But Susie isn't ready to release her hold on life just yet, and she intensely watches her family and friends as they struggle to cope with a reality in which she is no longer a part. To her great credit, Sebold has shaped one of the most loving and sympathetic fathers in contemporary literature.  Almost all of this book was truly incredible. I was hooked from the catchline on the back of the book that said something like ""My name is Susie Salmon, like the fish, and December something was the day I was murdered."" I assumed it would be told strictly from the perspective of Susie watching people down on Earth. However it was more than that, there were bits of information about her killer Mr. Harvey (not a spoiler, you learn this in the first chapter) throughout the book, like what made him into a serial killer. Things about Susie's mother and father, Ray & Ruth, Lindsey & Samuel, just all the characters had depth and that was something that I really enjoyed. At one point, later in the book, I started crying at the reconnection of two characters (view spoiler)[ (Susie's parents in the hospital)  (hide spoiler)] and their quiet moment together, I don't know why but it struck something in me because their relationship fell apart but they were able to come back together for a brief moment to remember their past. One thing that made this book a four star read was that there was also a lot of extra, not important, information that just dragged this book on and on. I ended up skimming these sections and getting to the parts of the book I was actually interested in. Although this extra detail that I found too much, was what made this book full of meat and shows that it is a mature story. This is one of the few young adult books that I've read that has more depth as a whole, rather than just individual plot points having depth. I'm praising this, but still it is something that made this book less enjoyable because I felt like while there could've been this intense depth, there should've been less in my personal opinion. The whole time I was reading the book, I kept saying to my mom that ""If the ending doesn't have some sort of resolve I'm going to be upset with the entirety of the book"" and this still holds true, however I'm somewhere in the middle on what I thought of the ending. It wasn't the exact result I was wanting (view spoiler)[(which would've been catching Susie's killer and having some resolve to the murder) (hide spoiler)] but it wasn't a complete disappointment. There were parts of it that I enjoyed, including some wrap-up with characters and such but it wasn't the ending that I had been anticipating for the whole book and that's why I'm kind of torn on whether or not this was truly a satisfying ending. I guess part of it was satisfying.. and therefore it counts.. but I'm still just thinking about it like I wanted a little more.  Pre-Review This book was definitely a lot to handle.

151,7691833,10/13/2007,2.0,"The idea for this book is fascinating: written from the perspective of someone who has died watching her family cope with her disappearance. The book turns around everything you know about frame of reference and gives the author a forum to observe all the characters and feed them to us indifferent of opinion. My favorite part is when Susie sees her blood on the garage floor and states its hers in this detached, unaffected voice. I enjoyed much of Sebold's take on the after-life, beautiful without shoving a spiritual message at you. What I appreciated most was the non-emotional way Susie watched her family live their lives without thoughts of revenge for the man who killed her. The perspective on instant forgiveness, or at least lack of anger at the abruptness of her life ending, made the capture of her murderer irrelevant to the story. I liked that the story wasn't about revenge or justice like so many books about murder are.But the author's interpretation of post-life temptation didn't settle right with me. I personally do not believe sex drive and a desire for fornication without a sense of consequence are going to be part of our spiritual experiences, and I know this isn't my interpretation of the afterlife, but it didn't fit here either. The girl is fourteen, in an era when teenage sex is not as prevalent as it is now, and yet Sebold felt this child would die and infinitely regret not being able to have sex, her one and only major regret in life. I didn't buy it. (Nor did I think her boyfriend would have been pinning after her through adolescence and into adulthood.) She could give up anger, revenge, a whole myriad of human emotion that taint our human existence, but not sex. It wasn't consistent. (view spoiler)[If the appetite weren't enough, the embodiment of it killed the book for me. Completely. I could barely handle the idea in Ghost and that was just a kiss. I couldn't believe it or think it beautiful in any way. It was wrong on so many levels: that Susie wanted it, that Ray believed it, that Ruth let her do it, that the welfare of her family all of a sudden didn't matter. Not only was it strange and implausible, but turned Susie from what could have been an enlightened character into a selfish hormonal teenager. It ruined her character and it ruined the book. It kills me when authors ruin their own stories. Maybe Sebold wanted that for Susie, but I didn't. It would have been better to deny her than torture the rest of us.

152,16694534,02/29/2008,2.0,"This was an unusual book. The premise was interesting enough: what is heaven like, and what happens when you get there? I'm always willing to suspend my disbelief for the sake of a good story. I was able to accept Sebold's idea of a heaven that's a lot like where you live, except everything is happy and where you can see what's going on with people who you loved but you can't really affect anything. Some of the scenes in the first half of the book in this regard were actually poignant. I was actually hoping for an ending to the book that rang with Justice - one where Susie Salmon was able to parlay her ability to make contact with the outside world into getting the crime solved. That would have made the book into an interesting combination of fantasy novel, detective potboiler, and crime story.Instead, the author decided to make Susie more interested in getting laid than in helping the cops discover who murdered her, and bringing closure to her family. I don't really know what motivated her to do this. Was it to show that women are liberated in heaven too? That ghosts have libidos? Or that Susie had decided to move on and get past her mid-afterlife crisis, so to speak? There's really no explanation for this story development that I can figure out, except that Sebold got writer's block halfway through the novel and decided that sex was more interesting than the deus ex machina of a ghost solving a crime. Indeed, maybe she took the advice of Brian Cox as Robert McKee in the film Adaptation:I'll tell you a secret. The last act makes a film. Wow them in the end, and you got a hit. You can have flaws, problems, but wow them in the end, and you've got a hit. Find an ending, but don't cheat, and don't you dare bring in a deus ex machina. Your characters must change, and the change must come from them. Do that, and you'll be fine.Right. In any event, the ending of the book was most dissatisfying. One wishes Sebold's agent had encouraged her to write a different ending ... or was this a different ending she was encouraged to write?

153,168761263,05/16/2011,4.0,"Already knowing the storylines in Alice Sebold’s The Lovely Bones, I chose to focus upon the vignette that actually opens the story while reading this wonderful book a second time. Inside the snow globe on my father’s desk, there was a penguin wearing a red-and-white-striped scarf. When I was little my father would pull me into his lap and reach for the snow globe. He would turn it over, letting all the snow collect on the top, then quickly invert it. The two us watched the snow fall gently around the penguin. The penguin was alone in there, I thought, and I worried about him. When I told my father this, he said, “Don’t worry, Susie; he has a nice life. He’s trapped in a perfect world.” And so is Susie Salmon in her heaven in the lower case. She is not ready to be in her perfect world after her neighbor brutally rapes and murders her. Her body is dismembered and totally concealed. She wants justice for Mr. Harvey and wants to be with her family, not heeding a warning that the living should be left alone. Susie watches her family self destruct because of her absence. Her father becomes obsessive with catching her killer, while her mother flees to the other side of the country. Her sister completely changes, while her little brother grows up in a very fractured family and probably feels Susie’s death more than the others. The botched Police investigation also frustrates Susie, perhaps prolonging her presence among her family and friends. Without characters like her Grandma, Ruth, and Ray and the influence of magical realism and fantasy, The Lovely Bones would be maudlin rather than hauntingly beautiful. Sebold’s use of a “body snatcher” scene did not appeal to me and I thought it to be disquieting as Sebold’s rush to tie remaining loose story arcs at the end of the novel. In my opinion,  The Lovely Bones is destined to become a modern classic and is a solid 4 star read. 		 ",7,0.1756,0.133,0.734,0.133,0.5124514374514375,NEGATIVE,0.9977
154,2216693234,12/17/2017,5.0,"5 out of 5 stars! ⭐ When you kill off your narrator in the first 10 pages of a novel and tell readers who the killer is you'd better have one compelling story up your sleeve. Alice Sebold does. The reading is an emotional ride, capable of bringing the reader to tears, anger, hope and love. We all want to believe that bad things do not happen to good people but secretly know that this is not always the case.  What immediately stands out about the book is its unflinching and dark premise, not unknown in books aimed at teens but uncommon. The event that shapes the book is covered immediately, so the following is not a spoiler:   Susie Salmon was fourteen when she was murdered on December 6, 1973. Her murderer was a man from her neighbourhood. From her place in heaven she watches the effect her murder has had on her suburban family as they try to cope with their grief. Over the course of these years both the reader and Susie get to watch her friends and siblings grow up, fall in love, do all the things she never had the chance to do herself. . . .  The opening chapters are hard-hitting, holding no punches and dealing with events almost dispassionately. And this is a great strength, the author makes no attempt to shout about awful what has happened is, how evil the perpetrator. It is a powerful book, thought-provoking and it evokes every parent's worst nightmare. In the end, what Sebold has accomplished is to find her own inventive way of expressing the universal alienation and powerlessness we all feel, trapped in our own small worlds apart from each other. More than that, she has convinced us that, through love and hope and generosity, these things can be overcome. 🌈📚👌🏻 “Sometimes the dreams that come true are the dreams you never even knew you had.” ― Alice Sebold, 'The Lovely Bones' ",7,0.7252,0.169,0.643,0.188,0.5707142857142857,POSITIVE,0.9999

167,82507688,12/29/2009,2.0,"Alice Sebold's The Lovely Bones is a book I picked up simply out of morbid curiosity. I was certain it was going to suck and I could then rip it to shreds. I have to admit, however, that though it was not a good book by any means, it didn't suck as badly as I expected. I can, however, identify three major problems with this book:1. Its overwhelming dullness.2. The gimmicky first-person omniscient narration.3. The ending.Dullness: Despite the subject matter (rape, murder, grief, romance), which really should have been interesting, this book was just boring. I blame this on the distance created by the narrative voice, which I will discuss in more depth later, and Sebold's tendency to have the narrator tell us about things instead of showing us the world. Oddly, this really significant problem highlights the book's best quality and the only thing I can give Sebold any real credit for. In the midst of the hokey plot, lack of a compelling protagonist, and the many other things I didn't like about the book, there were brief, shining moments of truth. Every now and then, Sebold's narrator would include a small detail about a character that revealed something sharp and honest about that person. This happened when the narrator stopped trying to explain the person and just showed us what was there, so it didn't happen often, but this quality is what made the book readable for me. Just when I'd start to get so bored and ready to give up (because what fun is reading a bad book that's just boringly bad?), there'd be this nugget of clarity and good writing to break through the dullness, and I'd keep on reading. Unfortunately, the rarity of these moments, no matter how good they were, just made the rest that much duller by comparison. Narrative Voice: The one thing that every person who writes about this book must mention is the fact that it's narrated by Susie Salmon, a raped and murdered 14-year-old girl who watches her family from heaven. According to many reviewers, this is something that makes Sebold's novel unique. The watching-from-heaven bit isn't unique to Sebold, though the first person omniscient perspective is certainly unusual. But there's a reason this perspective rarely gets used. In this case, the narrative voice, aside from being fairly dull, is completely inappropriate for a 14-year-old girl. It is exceedingly rare in the book to be able to believe that the person telling this story is really Susie Salmon and not Alice Sebold. This is exacerbated by the fact that she is constantly telling us what the people she watches think, feel, desire, and even dream. She even tells us what her rapist and murderer dreams about and reveals his memories. How does she know this? Sebold doesn't bother to explain. Heavenly magic, I guess. Furthermore, there are distinct reasons for choosing to write from a first person perspective and Sebold forsakes them all. The first of these is to develop a strong sense of the one character from whose perspective we see the world. But throughout, I don't feel like I know Susie even as well as I do the other characters in the book and this is supposed to be her story. This is partly because of the lack of a distinct 14-year-old girl voice and partly because of the additional omniscience itself, which takes the focus off of Susie, who's dead and, quite frankly, not doing anything interesting any more, and places it on the other living characters who are still doing things. The second reason to choose first person perspective is found in its limitations, which the omniscient narrative voice undoes. It makes the story more interesting to have information unfold as the narrator discovers it and to have limitations on what we are told, to have to put the story together on our own, just as the narrator does, and to have to evaluate the trustworthiness and reliability of the narrator. None of that applies here. Finally, this perspective is nothing more than a gimmick. It adds nothing to the understanding of Susie's family and friends that a more traditional third person omniscient perspective would--other than a weird sense of unease about how she knows what they're thinking and feeling. If Sebold wants to tell the story of Susie's family and how they deal with her death, it might be more compelling to just do so instead of adding the filter of Susie's occasional reflections on events from her vantage point in heaven. This actually goes beyond uneasy. It's downright creepy. Susie watches her family sleep, she watches them in their most private moments (both alone and with others), she reads their minds. She knows more about them than she would ever know living and, quite likely, more than any of them would really want her to know. (No girl--living or dead--should have sexual experiences vicariously through her mother and her sister.) What's more, these people have no choice in the matter and so her desire to know about them is less a nice way for her to care about them, protect them, and try to heal herself (as Sebold seems to want us to see it) and more a violation of their privacy. This lack of consent and total disregard for boundaries makes Susie's watching less that of a guardian angel and more that of a stalker. The Ending: There is little logic in this book. It is, after all, about a wish-fulfillment heaven and stalker ghosts. However, even novels that take the fantastic as their starting point require some internal logic in order to work. The Lovely Bones does not have that. In the end, for no reason and with no explanation, Susie is able to fall from heaven into the body of one of her friends and have sex with her old crush. Somehow (don't ask me how) he recognizes her soul in her friend's body with having to be told. And the friend whose body was stolen is inexplicably happy about all of this. At this point, logic--even the logic of heaven and flying souls and wish-fulfillment fantasies--goes out the window. Furthermore, this particular fantasy moment is (once again) extraordinarily creepy. Again there are issues of consent. Although Susie's friend Ruth, whose body she borrows, seems okay with it when she comes back from her visit to heaven (where she's quite famous, by the way), there was no asking of permission beforehand, no indication that either Susie or Sebold understands how wrong it is to just take and use another human being's body for sex. And even if there had been consent, this act--sex with her junior high sweetheart, whom she only kissed once before her death and who is now several years older than either of them were when she died--is what enables her healing and her moving on. Ah, the healing power of creepy sex.A lot of people love this book. I don't really understand why. I guess, like the cultural obsession with Twilight, it's something I won't really understand. It doesn't bother me (too much) that so many people love these books when there are so many truly great books being overlooked; people will read and enjoy what they will read and enjoy and their literary tastes are really no concern of mine. It does concern me, though, that both of these books feature distinctly stalkerish behavior presented as love.

174,48628108,03/08/2009,1.0,"Susie Salmon is murdered when she is fourteen years old. In The Lovely Bones, by Alice Sebold, Susie tells us her story and the stories of her friends, family and even her murderer as she looks down on them all from Heaven. The end result is a devastating depiction of pain and suffering. Consequently, this is not an easy book to read. The murder itself is appalling, and the aftermaths are painful to witness.
Wimp.
Excuse me?
Remember that article in the April 20, 2009 issue of Newsweek? It was called,” Why Is It a Sin to Read for Fun?” It put forward the idea that reading for fun is fine, as long as it leads a reader to more edifying texts: “…at some point reading should stop being a pleasurable diversion, and start being work.” How else are you going to grow?
I mostly agree with that. I did force myself to finish the book after all, even though I wasn’t enjoying it. But I’m still trying to decide if this book was edifying. Regardless, I don’t think the writing was particularly great.
Examples, please.
“Her heart, like an ingredient in a recipe, was reduced,” or “She asked for coffee and toast in a restaurant and buttered it with her tears,” or “Her pupils dilated, pulsing in and out like small, ferocious olives.”
The narrator was a fourteen-year old. How great a writer were you at that age?
Um…let’s move on, shall we? I have some problems with Susie’s Heaven. I won’t spoil the book for anyone by divulging details, but Susie’s Heaven and Susie’s attitudes toward it seemed contrived and often artificial (like a poorly conceived gimmick designed to draw in readers).For one thing, Susie was bored in Heaven. What kind of Heaven is that? Also, Susie seemed to have very little interest in her afterlife. For example, God or a higher being is never in evidence, but not once does Susie (or anyone else) ask about His/Her/Its existence. I’m not saying the book had to dwell on the big philosophical questions. A few brief sentences (“You’ll find out when you’re ready,” or “We don’t know!”) would have sufficed. Ignoring The Big Questions made Heaven feel unauthentic.
First, everyone has a different idea of Heaven. Second, not everyone is as full of (annoying) questions as you are. Third, again, Susie is only fourteen.
Fair enough (although personally, I think most people are going to be asking about God when they die, even if they’re young). Look, I realize that a lot of people love this book. I don’t have any good reasons for disliking it; it’s just not my cup of cocoa. And there you have it.Note: This book is rated R for murder, language, pre-marital sex and post-mortem sex (not necrophilia, but still...)",6,0.9854,0.091,0.759,0.151,0.513888888888889,NEGATIVE,1.0
175,1736754463,10/12/2016,4.0,"Susie, a 14 year old girl, has been killed raped and butchered by her neighbor. While her body has been dumped in a sinkhole where it can never be found, her soul is omnipresent, watching everyone from her Heaven as they carve their way through the plight of her unexpected death and she herself comes to term with it.I’ve read plenty of books where people die - but their death comes in the latter pages. This was the first one that started with a death and went on to describe its aftermath – which in itself makes this book noteworthy. shows how people deal with death in their own ways. The harsh reality is never going to change- Sophie is dead. All they can do is find some other thing to obscure that fact, make it less painful, render it bearable. Now whether they find their salvation in the outburst of revenge, poetry or in ‘merciful adultery’, that’s up to them. It’s painful to see how much damage a single death can inflict - how people shatter, bringing down their families with them. As for Mr Harvey, I think no possible combination of words stringed together can represent how much I abhor him. What makes it worse is that he is not even a fictional character. People like Mr Harvey are as real as you and me - evil disguised as man.I admire Susie so much – she was so brave to see her loved ones fall apart and watched them as they glued the broken pieces back together with love, family and friendship. She followed them in their search for the truth that anchored them back to reality. They all grew in some way or the other from the loss, eventually embracing the past. Except for the soul exchange and the subsequent love making (I hope this doesn’t count as a spoiler), nothing seemed forced. The entire story was so realistic it was as if I was watching my own family grapple with my death. Death knows no man made boundaries – it affects people the same way even if they live half way across the globe.This book is about the importance of life, and the effects of death. It’s about people - how they fall and how they resurrect themselves. It’s about change – which is neither good nor bad – but it simply is there. It’s about holding on and letting go.I can very well imagine why this book receives such mixed reviews- it is slow paced at times and the topic it deals with isn't particularly 'pleasant'.

When Susie Salmon was 14 yrs old she fell prey to a serial killer, still living under the radar of the law though he's committed numerous murders in addition to hers.Though, hopefully, few of us have had to deal with this in our own families, many of us have had to deal with the death of a close family member, and it is on this level I thoroughly connected with the novel. The stages of grief and how it can make or break a family is shown through Susie's eyes, who desperately wants to comfort her family, and is thereby unable to move on- as is her family.It's not all sadness, there are some humorously touching moments and even a bit of the paranormal as Susie makes contact with a love she was just beginning to explore when her life was cut short on earth.My one problem with the book was the ending. We know early on who the killer is- though Sebold made an effort to obscure him with a comment about everyone being suspect- as happens in most murder investigations. After she makes this comment, she reveals the killer, beyond a shadow of a doubt! I was scratching my head on that one. So, knowing the killer, we naturally want the man to be discovered by the end of the book and burned at the stake. He does get found out- in a way- but for me justice was not really served to my satisfaction. (Although it was for Susie!)Because of the ending, I'm giving this one a 4 out of 5.

197,1268546016,04/30/2015,5.0,"‘The Lovely Bones’ was the 2002 novel by Alice Sebold. When ‘The Lovely Bones’ came out it was an instant bestseller and one of those word-of-mouth books that seemed to be everywhere. I read this book when I was 15, and I hated it. I remember hating it, quite vividly – getting to the last page and wanting to chuck it across the room I was so disappointed. I even remember that my hating stemmed from a belief that there wasn’t enough “justice” in the book (which, I know, is a very 15-year-old thing to think) and being frustrated by the magic realism elements, particularly around a scene towards the end, which involves a “spectral possession” of sorts. So why did I revisit this book that I hated? A couple of reasons – like that I recently picked up a debut novel called ‘Everything I never Told You’ by Celeste Ng that reminded me of ‘The Lovely Bones’. They’re two very different books, but they share a core plot about the death of a young girl and the repercussions on the family … Ng’s opening line even reminded me of Sebold for cutting to the very heart of the matter: Lydia is dead. But they don’t know this yet. Compared to Sebold’s:My name is Salmon, like the fish. First name: Susie. I was fourteen when I was murdered on December 6, 1973. I really loved Celeste Ng’s book, so started to wonder if I’d likewise enjoy ‘The Lovely Bones’ upon re-reading.Then I stumbled across another book with a similar premise again. ‘Boo’ by Neil Smith, the blurb for which goes: “When Oliver 'Boo' Dalrymple wakes up in heaven, the eighth-grade science geek thinks he died of a heart defect at his school. But soon after arriving in this hereafter reserved for dead thirteen-year-olds, Boo discovers he’s a 'gommer', a kid who was murdered.” This also intrigued me, and again got me wondering if I should revisit ‘The Lovely Bones’. And, finally, I do believe that sometimes you can read a good book at the wrong time. Whether because you’re not in the right headspace, or you’re just not open to the enjoyment … there are a myriad of reasons why, some of which were highlighted for me in re-reading ‘The Lovely Bones’. Upon re-reading this now, as a 27-year-old feminist (and not the 15-year-old who thought “feminism” was synonymous with “lesbianism” and scared of such implications) something that struck me in ‘The Lovely Bones’ was Sebold’s focus on male violence against women. She wrote a very grotesque and frightening rape scene that’s all the more powerful because it is no-holds-barred horrifying. I now know that Sebold’s 1999 memoir ‘Lucky’ is based around her being brutally beaten and raped when she was 18-years-old, and how that one event transformed her entire life. Susie’s rape and death at the hands of Mr. Harvey occurs in the opening chapter – it’s quite a visceral punch to reader’s guts, but apart from being a very real depiction of an event that happens with far too much frequency in our society, the horror of that moment really propels Susie’s vengeance throughout the rest of the book. Sebold’s focus on male violence against women – sadly, Mr. Harvey’s character could have been inspired by countless men – is by no means subtle, it’s a powerful point she makes again and again. I don’t know what my reaction to this aspect of the story was as a fairly sheltered 15-year-old (probably along the lines of “that would never happen to me,”) but when I started re-reading this, the news was reporting on the terribly tragic death of 17-year-old Masa Vukotic, who had been randomly stabbed to death while out walking close to her home – in broad daylight. As I write this review, the news is focused on Ms. Vukotic again, this time because another teenage girl was recently sexually assaulted by a gang of men while walking home by herself … to which the local mayor responded; ""I always have encouraged women not to walk alone, to have someone with them at all times, because that in itself is an invitation for someone to take advantage of you.” This reminded the public that after Ms. Vukotic’s murder, a Homicide Squad Detective said; ""I suggest to people, particularly females, they shouldn't be alone in parks - I'm sorry to say that, that is the case.” There is a second storyline in the book about a boy Susie had a crush on – Ray Singh, and a strange girl called Ruth Connors who Susie “touched” as she was leaving earth, so becomes inextricably linked to her in death. I was very anti-fantasy as a teenager, and had yet to discover the joys of magical realism (not until I read Isabel Allende in Year 12 would I be schooled), so this aspect of the book always frustrated me … the flights of fantasy in heaven I could live with, but Susie’s spectral connection to Ruth and her clinging to the boy she wanted left me cold. Upon re-reading I’m still not entirely convinced of Ruth’s role in the book – but I loved that Ray remains in Susie’s sights. Again, it’s a heartbreaking facet to the age and way in which she was murdered that she still clings to the fantasy of Ray, like he’s a poster of a famous pop-star hanging on her wall – forever unattainable. I also appreciated Ray’s background as a British-Indian, which initially brings a touch of racial prejudice to the case, which certainly still resonates. I also really loved the Salmon family, particularly that Susie’s parents handle her murder in very understandable if destructive ways. The person who really keeps it together is Susie’s younger sister, Lindsey – a strong character who initially frustrated me for all the ways she gets to live when Susie doesn’t. But a big realisation upon re-reading this book 12 years later is that ‘The Lovely Bones’ isn’t really about Susie – it’s about her family. If I felt frustrated by the injustices in the book, or Lindsey’s getting to live when Susie doesn’t – well, that’s kinda the whole point. Susie is our narrator, but she’s barely a character in the traditional sense. She is a bystander to the life she didn’t get to live;At fourteen my sister sailed away from me into a place I'd never been. In the walls of my sex there was horror and blood, in the walls of hers there were windows.I cried buckets re-reading this book. It’s a real testament to Sebold’s deft hand that in a story so full of sorrow, the moment she wrung the most tears from me was one of profound joy: At Evensong one night, while Holly played her sax and Mrs. Bethel Utemeyer joined in, I saw him: Holiday, racing past a fluffy white Samoyed. He had lived to a ripe old age on Earth and slept at my father’s feet after my mother left, never wanting to let him out of his sight. He had stood with Buckley while he built his fort and had been the only one permitted on the porch while Lindsey and Samuel kissed. And in the last few years of his life, every Sunday morning, Grandma Lynn had made him a skillet-sized peanut butter pancake, which she would place flat on the floor, never tiring of watching him try to pick it up with his snout. I waited for him to sniff me out, anxious to know if here, on the other side, I would still be the little girl he had slept beside.

198,2993195731,10/01/2019,3.0,"The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold is a completely unique book. It is the story of Susie Salmon, a 14-year old girl who is raped, murdered and dismembered by a neighbor. Susie was walking home from school and is convinced by her murderer to make a detour. She never makes it home. And sadly, her body is not recovered and her parents never know what happened to her. Even worse, the perpetrator is not caught.But none of that is a unique story. The part of this book that is different from all the others is the fact that Susie is telling the story from heaven. Susie is the protagonist. It is her absence that moves the story forward. It may be the only book I have read where the protagonist isn't actually present. Susie is part of the past. She is gone. But it is still completely her story.Susie looks down from heaven and tells us what she sees. She talks about the boy she once kissed, and her sister who puts herself in danger to gather evidence, and her dad who destroys the ships he built with Susie's help. She talks about the detective who is at a standstill. And her mother who is sinking into a depression. We see how all of them navigate their grief and attempt to move on.  Time passes, and those left behind quietly grieve and grow. And at the same time we also see Susie attempt to move on and leave her life behind.The book is brutally sad. But so very emotional and compassionate. The book was Sebold's debut novel and she did a very good job allowing me to know the characters.I did not like the ending. It felt rushed, and too perfect. It felt a bit like Sebold had written this entire novel and then got to the end and had no idea what to do with it. So, she tied the package with a bow and called it good. It felt too neat. It felt like Sebold wanted to provide some relief to the sadness. But this book didn't need that answer. It should be sad. There is no happy ending when a 14 year old child is murdered. This family is forever changed. I wish that Sebold had found a more subtle, nuanced, quiet, and sad way to end the book.******Please consider following me on my FB book blog:https://www.facebook.com/Kelly-Hunsak...and on Bookstagram:www.instagram.com/kelly_hunsaker_reads",6,-0.9662,0.152,0.739,0.109,0.560329861111111,NEGATIVE,0.7786

It was so much fun so I am definitely slightly bias when reviewing this due to the experience it has given me. This novel follows the perspective of Susie Salmon who is a murder victim and is now a soul (no other word for it??) who, in her heaven, watches her family and friends deal with her death. There are multiple triggers for this book so make sure you are aware of that before you get into it, if you're thinking of picking it up.So... thoughts. I think this book was interesting. It opened up a world of new thinking for me. Not only in what 'after death' could look like but also how people react to death differently. It made me question character's actions as well as consider why the author, Sebold, made things be the way she did. If you asked me why only the 4 stars, it's really hard to answer. Although I think this is a book I will remember for a long long time, I think there was just something stopping me from being fully invested in it. Also, Susie, when you had the time... why didn't you give Ray more VERBAL information instead!?Overall, I think this is a thought provoking book that is worth a read if you're in the mood for a serious and hard hitting contemporary (mature YA audience recommended at the least).",5,-0.6648,0.101,0.811,0.088,0.4054040404040403,POSITIVE,0.9433

Stellar movie and a fantastic novel. Also, creepy as hell and I will never be leaving my house again. Lol.I read this book slower than I do most books but that wasn't because it was boring. I'm gonna be straight up, it was because it was creepy and even daylight didn't feel safe enough haha. Sebold's writing was so atmospheric and gripping that I was invested from the first few pages. She was detailed and graphic when necessary, she emphasized emotion over detail when that was required, she had this insanity planned out explicitly and the characters were too dimensional to feel comfortable with. I was both freaked out and utterly intrigued. The Lovely Bones is a murder that will haunt your thoughts. Filled with ordinary life, ordinary people, and one case that shatters it all, it'll have you pondering horror, coincidence, grief, anger, and desperation with a morbid intrigue into how it all plays out. Chilling, intricately crafted, exquisitely written, this is a novel that will watch you from its shelf.Read my FULL review here: https://pooledink.com/2018/07/25/the-...",5,-0.9796,0.212,0.679,0.109,0.6154761904761904,POSITIVE,0.9997
203,1921874732,08/30/2018,3.0,"I should've hated this book. It has everything that usually turns me off of a novel: a character-driven meandering story with a basically non-existent plot. Susie is brutally murdered, and then nothing happens. Yet, The Lovely Bones touched me in a way few books do.This is a novel about sorrow. It's about barely being able to get out of bed. It's about the world continuing to churn and churn around you, no matter how much it feels like everything should be still. If I had read this book even just three years ago, yeah, I probably would've hated it. But the older I get, the more grief seeps into my life. Sometimes it doesn't need a body to take hold - sometimes it's the way the light hits something, and suddenly you're filled to bursting with a loss you can't yet name.Watching all the people learning to continue living in the wake of Susie's death hit close to home for me. I've never had a death like hers in my life, but this book isn't really about her death, not really. It's about the living. It's about what comes after, and how the people left behind bear it. I see flashes of that yawning void of grief in my parents. I see it in myself, after surviving a depression so intense I thought it would kill me. This book made those experiences tangible for me, instead of a great unknowable something.There was one thing I absolutely despise about this novel, however: the end. Having Susie possess Ruth's body in order to fulfill her desire to be with Ray just felt gross and out-of-place to me. Like I said before, The Lovely Bones isn't really about Susie. Her character frames the narrative, but it's not her story. Her sex scene with Ray makes it about her, and disturbs the rules established about the nature of our world by literally bringing her back to life, if only for an afternoon. It was so absolutely unnecessary.But other than that, this book meant something to me. I don't know if I'll ever reread it again, despite my high rating. I feel more that this book came to me in a time that I needed it without knowing I did, and it won't be right if I tried to pick it up again.",5,-0.9598,0.132,0.772,0.096,0.4942135642135641,NEGATIVE,1.0
204,2144463705,10/23/2017,3.0,"Brilliant concept. The opening chapters are as thrilling as they are horrific. A little girl walking home from school through a cornfield is suckered into an underground bunker built by a serial rapist and killer. She never gets to go home and the only clue of her whereabouts is the bone from her elbow a dog brings home. The rest of the novel is told by the protagonist in heaven looking down from above wondering how her family will fare and if her killer will be discovered.After a great beginning, the pace slows. It's a difficult book to write. We know the killer, so this is not a murder mystery. The killer cannot be convicted too soon or the novel would be over. We are trapped in the POV of a person removed from everyone who is involved in the plot. She can only observe (until the end of the novel where even the fantasy of a heavenly narrator is strained). So, what is this book? Kind of a waiting around for her murderer to get discovered. A lot of the book does feel like waiting.Things do happen. Her dad is her hero but he's cut short in his effort to pin the murder on the murderer. And certainly, there's the reunification of her mom and dad that evolves over the course of the story. But after miles of pages, the resolution of the story comes out of nowhere at the end of a paragraph. Add to that fact that a lot of the book is summation of what's going on rather than an in-the-moment account, and I was puzzled; this good book could have been so much better. Where were the editors?This was Sebold's first novel and the conceit of the story was terrific if imperfectly carried out. It definitely made me want to explore one of her later novels.",8,0.8937,0.103,0.755,0.142,0.6171825396825397,NEGATIVE,0.9981

I know this took me forever to read, and I know I read two other books instead of finishing this one, but I seriously loved this with all my heart. Each individual soul is just so pure and beautiful, and I felt so emotionally attached to each of them. It was so easy to emphasize with Susie, her sister, her brother, her friends, her parents- one could clearly see their vulnerability and the depth of their sorrow through every moment of this story. I loved reading through Susie’s perspective, and her innocent narration of the characters’ feelings, actions, and perceptions of their world. It’s like reading through omniscient third person, where the “third person” also has emotions and a part to play. Though some events were a bit difficult to understand (and to be perfectly honest, I did skim over some long descriptions), this style of perspective is one that is unique and critical to the aura of this book. I’m fairly satisfied with how this ended and hope the very best to the living :)edit: taking down the rating to 4ish after thinking about the book a bit more after the sadness faded and realizing how some moments just didn’t actually sit well with me- major major major spoiler alert: (view spoiler)[ this was something I really didn’t think much about once I came to the end of this book, but after reading other reviews and rereading a section, I just realized how the whole situation with Susie taking Ruth’s body and doing... that with Ray is slightly concerning? Like she could’ve been telling him who killed her and actual important stuff, and instead she does... that? In ruth’s body that too? Just a bit awkward- ignoring that (and pretending that just wasn’t included) this was an amazing book :)  (hide spoiler)]",5,0.9963,0.081,0.688,0.231,0.6048232323232323,POSITIVE,0.9997
206,18347677,03/21/2008,5.0,"Watch out for your neighbors! Why? Well, that’s because you don’t want to end up dead in heaven, like how Susie Salmon did. Who’s Susie Salmon? She’s a 14 years old teenage girl from the book, The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold. Unfortunate, she was raped and killed by someone she never expected. Someone who seems just like any other ordinary people, except more quiet and mysterious. Alone, watching each of her family members change and grow up was not easy for Susie. She felt lonely and wanted to be with everyone she loves, desperately.	If Susie was able to let go of all the people on Earth, meaning stop watching them everyday, she’ll be able to see her dead relatives and not be so lonely. It will also mean that the burden inside her can slowly fade away. 	This book is superior, totally fascinating! I can easily connect myself to Susie, since we’re both teenagers. Same age too! Think about yourself watching your family from somewhere faraway and couldn’t do anything to help them. Wouldn’t you feel useless? Well, I certainly do. Alice Sebold is a creative author that made the main character of the book so important, even though she’s dead already. She can also make the reader feel uneasy when he/she put down the book. It is very rare to have a main character that is dead and this is the first time where I read a book about a main character that is like that from the very start of the book.	I recommend The Lovely Bones to anyone—from teenagers to adults. After reading this book, I suddenly realize having my family around me is extremely important. Not everyone notice that, therefore everyone should read this book. This is a book that tells a story, which can happen in reality to anyone. Also, you might find some unexpected “gold” in it, which might help you throughout your life.",4,-0.4084,0.135,0.716,0.149,0.5693290882244368,POSITIVE,0.996
207,2111984480,02/14/2018,4.0,"Without at all intending for this to sound like an insult, The Lovely Bones is like a mix of My Sister’s Keeper and If I Stay. It is touching, intimate, and profound. I have never read a book which gave me so many goosebumps or made me tear up as many times as The Lovely Bones did. Absolutely chilling; haunting. Though I loved this story—I thought the plot unique, flowing, and very emotional—the writing itself did not astound me. In fact, at times the writing was almost too overdone, making it choppy, confusing, and occasionally taking away the immersion. However, it wasn’t so bad as to make me dislike the book because of it. I thought that the story was very well paced, with the appropriate information revealed at due times. One thought of mine is that the end—the question of justice for Susie and her family—left little closure, despite the healing we see throughout the book. At first this bugged me a bit, but after some thought I find this reflective of the Salmon’s struggle with losing Susie; they healed with no real closure, so it makes sense that the reader is left without closure as well. The Lovely Bones is an absolute beauty and a tear-jerker. This book hurt, and it comforted, and it scared me, thinking what would happen to me if I lost my 14-year-old sister. I love this book because what it evokes is real and it is powerful. “I could never have imagined a blessing greater to me than the physical safety of my sister that day. As I walked back from the gazebo I shivered with the fear that had held me, the possibility of her loss on earth not just to my father, my mother, Buckley, and Samuel, but, selfishly, the loss of her on earth to me.”",5,0.3256,0.14,0.725,0.135,0.5279017857142858,POSITIVE,0.9985

Susie Salmon had that same wish.Susie was only fourteen when she was raped and murdered by a neighbor, Mr. Harvey. But this book is not all about her death and who did it and how it happened. We find out right in the beginning. This novel is about how Susie’s death was just a pebble in the pond.Alice Sebold takes on the lives of everyone around Susie Salmon. From family, to crushes, to her friends she had and the friends she never knew she had. The way Sebold writes out what happens to each of them, makes us feel as if we are living with them. As if, like Susie, we are looking down upon them from heaven. The heaven that is the most perfect place. Not hers, but also, our perfect world.We see a family that was as close as any can be, break up into separate paths. Friendships formed that would have otherwise been left untouched.

I think it’s one of those where most of the fuss about it comes from the writing style, and in my case, I didn’t really like it. In fact, it read almost like translated fiction, which kind of weirded me out. I actually checked the front to see whether a translator was listed, but no dice. It turns out it’s not translated, it’s just a little weird.Then there’s the ending, which honestly just infuriated me and made me wish I’d not stuck with it. I don’t think I would have if it hadn’t been a buddy read. As is, I don’t really have too much to say about this and I don’t really know what I’ll have to talk about with her.

Her parents and sister are at least real in their reactions. Some shut down, some look for answers and some almost trip off the crazy scale. Instead we get an almost monotone monologue from Susie that only becomes more emotional near the end. Then we have a possession scene gone bad. I won't bother describing it for two reasons. One is that it's pathetic and two is that it would be a spoiler. There was so much potential in Sebold's writing at the start that I literally felt cheated by the rest of the book. The only saving grace being a Father that was written so well and so heartrendingly that it made finishing the book a little more satisfying. Let's not forget the Mother. A lot may not have liked her reaction but it was a true one.

I still found it an emotional read; I just found certain parts less believable with my adult brain.I’m not going to dive too deep.

He was 14, and they kissed once. ✔ Young and naïve Jac, was totally down with the “Ruth possession” so Suzie could have sex with Ray, but adult Jac is a smidge disturbed. It felt so unfair to Ruth, and wasn’t really explained. Are we to assume Ruth was ok with it? Or God? I re-read the chapters twice, and don’t see either (ray or ruth) having one discussion about it. Adult Jac HATES this part, because in a way, Ruth was raped, and it’s justified because Suzie has a sad story and they “made love”. It didn't work for me. It was too rushed to be memorable, and confusing. It wasn’t needed… let Suzie find her closure another way.

It was highly recommended to me by several people at that time and of course I couldn't resist the hype. But then never got around to actually reading it - until now due to a challenge.Since I expected the solving of the crime to be the focus of attention, I was a bit disappointed after the first 100 pages. I even got a bit bored, because during that time the book got really slow. But then I adjusted to the fact that this book is rather a story about how a family copes with the grief of losing a child, and I got interested again in the doings and well-beings of Jack, Abigail, Lindsey, Buck and all their friends. I was especially glad that Lindseys boyfriend Sam stuck around, along with his brother Hal, and that they both became even friends to her little brother Buck. The outstanding characteristic of this book is clearly that the narrator is the dead girl herself, talking to us from her heaven (apparently each dead person has his/her own heaven). Apart from that it is a fairly normal family drama including a terrible crime. This reminded me a bit of ""We were the Mulvaneys"" by Joyce Carol Oates, where a whole (wealthy & respected) family falls apart after the daughter gets raped by the son of a family friend. Since I have also read ""Lucky"" by Alice Sebold I know that she writes from own experience and that the topic of rape is dear to her heart.

246,2783312198,04/25/2019,5.0,"This is a beautiful and compelling novel about a girl named Susie who is already in heaven; trapped in a perfect strange new place. She looks down at the earth and tells us a stunning and mysterious story of her loved ones and her killer as a spirited voice of a fourteen-year-old.One of the themes in the book is running away from reality. This occurred a lot on the mother. She had committed adultery because of ""her rage, her loss, her despair,"" and ""she needed Len to drive her dead daughter out."" She held on to him as if on the other side of his kiss there will be a new life. A life that didn't have her daughter murdered. A life that didn't have her husband injured and in a hospital. A life that only has happiness and hope. ""All her energy was against the house,"" but all her husband's energy was inside of it. He knew over the past few years she was pulling away from the family. Slowly drifting away. But she was only granted her most temporal wish: ""To find a doorway out of her ruined heart, in merciful adultery."" This happens to a lot of people right now too. It doesn't always have to be family death though, it could be any kind of stress in life. People try to forget and avoid their problems by smoking and drinking alcohol. But it only is temporary. Running away will only make things worse. Instead, turn toward reality, embrace your life as it is, and do what will make the best of it. The theme of acceptance is introduced again when the mother ran away from home: ""She saw the waves behind the girl child and how beautiful and intoxicating they were."" They could sweep up so softly and remove her from the beach. All the people, not even a mother, would be able to save her if the waves came up. No one could chase after her, but she would drown in a moment. This emphasizes that sometimes in life, things can happen very suddenly and we can't stop it; so we can only control the controllable. You never know when something happens, so we must cherish our memories and happy moments. Another theme in the novel is in life, we can't depend on human beings, or else we wouldn't know how to live anymore without them. When Susie died, although it was a very tragic event, her parents fell apart; leading to the separation of both of them. After 9 years, her father was still holding on to Susie's death. When Buckley, Susie's brother who was now 13 years old, decided to reclaim the garden their mother had once kept; and took the box of clothes from the basement to make stakes for his tomato plants, but the father did not allow him to use them. Susie says, ""Just near Buckley's ears and on the tips of his cheeks and chin, he was a little orange somehow, a little red."" Then he asked angrily, ""Why can't I use them?"" It stated that those words landed in his father's back like a fist. ""You have to choose. It's not fair,"" her brother said. But his father held on to Susie's clothes like holding on to his life. Like every part of him depended on it. He loved all of his children, but he couldn't afford to experience the pain of losing any. The situation made him have a heart attack, and he ended up in the hospital again. Susie says, ""My little brother's greatest fear was that the one person who meant so much to him would go away."" Buckley and Susie both wanted his father to himself, and their father wanted both Buckley and Susie to be with him forever. The dead child and the living, both wanted the same thing. To please them both was impossible. To please their father was impossible. That's why you can never hold on to someone forever; that's just greed and selfishness. When people rely upon someone or even something too much, without them, they would collapse.The last theme is that even when a lot of things doesn't go the way you expect it to be, it happens for a reason. Grandma Lynn, Dad, Mom, Lindsey, Samuel, Buckley. These were the people that had grown so much around the absence of Susie.""The connections-sometimes tenuous sometimes made at a great cost, but often magnificent-that happened after I was gone,"" the author writes in the perspective of Susie. She began to see things in a way that let her hold the world without herself in it. The events of her death created were merely the bones of a body that would become whole at some unpredictable time in the time to come. She said at the end of the book while watching her family celebrate the marriage announcement for Samual and Lindsey, ""The price of what I came to see as this miraculous body had been my life.""",4,0.1519,0.108,0.777,0.114,0.5713173893501762,POSITIVE,0.9966
247,1753804984,09/10/2016,1.0,"Okay, let me be perfectly frank: I gave this a low rating purely from my own enjoyment of it. The writing didn't exactly click with me, and I found the plot a little on the boring side, so it wasn't a very fun read. But my rating isn't a fair summary of the book, since it was an extremely unique and emotional piece of writing whether I enjoyed it or not. I can't say I'd recommend it, since there are contemporaries that I've liked much more, but I wouldn't discourage anyone from giving it a try.Why didn't it work for me? Well, you'd think a story from the viewpoint of a girl named Susie, who's died and gone to heaven, would be extremely interesting. But actually, dead people watching down on their relatives got really boring after a few chapters. Susie didn't add much to the narrative, and I found myself longing for the story from her sister Lindsey's point of view. So, Susie's dead. She's been raped and murdered by a quiet neighborhood man named Mr. Harvey, and her elbow is found in a pool of blood in the cornfield where she was killed. After Susie's soul rises to heaven, she watches the rest of her family and Mr. Harvey as their lives progress after losing her, and learns more about them than she ever though possible.Lindsey had to recover after her oldest sister Susie's elbow was found in a cornfield, and she was assumed dead. How the hell do you deal with something like that? If the story had focused on her journey, it would've been more intense and engaging, but instead it centered on Susie's soul, which has risen to heaven.What's heaven like?Um... She lives with a random girl who I can't be bothered to remember the name of? There were a few weird antique streetlights, and some old lady, but honestly, heaven wasn't memorable. There was barely any mention of it. If the author had a point to prove through showing us that the afterlife exists, why wasn't there more focus on it? Also, considering that heaven is primarily a part of Christian religion, why was there no real mention of Susie's religion or beliefs? You're telling me she went to heaven in full control of her soul, and she didn't question why she was there or what was coming next?Apparently not. Instead, there was some weird shit where she exchanged souls with a girl named Ruth for a few hours and had sex with her eighth grade boyfriend.What. The. Fuck.Also, her murderer Mr. Harvey had no real use to the plot. He did a few more fucked-up things, met up with his batshit crazy mom, and didn't add anything else to the theme or story after killing Susie. He was such an interesting character, I wish we could've read more about him, but the entire plot around him was weirdly vague and meaningless.So, yeah. I didn't love it.

It talks about how her family deals with their death and how they grow up with that mark on themselves. It also talks about her killer and what happens to him. When it comes to this book I have mixed feelings. I liked it at first but as time went on I slowly started to unlike it. It was good that it was in a sense realistic, all but one scene. The good parts of the book where when they were talking about the murder and when they found clues about it.At first it seemed like and interesting concept and idea, but as the book progresses it started to slow down. It started as a fast paced book with a lot of actions and scenes, but as it progresses it took a lot of times for things to happened. After the first few chapters of interesting things, the book takes a dramatic slow down and it is just not enough interesting. There were some good parts in between, but it was mostly unnecessary boring things. At first I liked the concept of heaven and how she could see the Earth, but as the book went on heaven scenes became boring and pointless. The heaven scenes became almost irrelevant to the book, making them les enjoyable. Also, I thought that this is interesting because families would pass thought stuff like this and I thought it would be like a reference to families. It became evident that this wasn't the case when (view spoiler)[Susie comes back from heaven to have sex with ray. Even thought this part was important to the book, it took away the effect that this could be happening to a family and it lost all of its credibility.  (hide spoiler)]. Apart from this, it was pretty realistic. When they talked about the murder it was pretty interesting. The suspense, drama, and gore made you want to read more to see what happened.These were the a parts that made the book enjoyable. The book was pretty crazy and it had some scenes that made you wanna close your eyes and stop. It is very descriptive and uses sex a lot, even when its not needed.A thing I really like about the book is that it makes you hat characters. It makes you want to go into the book and punch them in the face. My favorite quote was ""nothing is certain."" This is because it is true, nothing is ever certain in life. your life can completely change in a second. This really makes you think about what could happen. This book starts really good. It starts as a fast actioned novel about a murder and the aftermath, but by the end it is not like this. The theme itself changes and it goes away from the murder.In itself i would rate the book as mediocre, and unless you got time leftover i wouldn't recommend to read it.Emily's Review",4,0.9963,0.078,0.738,0.184,0.538345091122869,NEGATIVE,0.9998

I tolerated the gimmick, the overwriting, the intrusive narration for the first half of the book because Sebold returned often enough to the search for Susie's killer that I was tricked into thinking that THE STORY WOULD BE RESOLVED. I was like, ""It's a detective story! A really drawn out, sentimental detective story but hey! I'm willing to watch grief-stricken family members from heaven if this MOTHERFUCKER IS GOING TO GET WHAT'S COMING TO HIM.But nooooooooooooooooooooo!After Harvey splits, then Susie's mother, the plot slowed down so much I started skimming. I began to seriously have my doubts as the narrative meandered and became pointlessly sentimental. The super thin, undeveloped you-have-to-let-go-of-your-loved-ones-before-they-can-let-go-of-you subplot; the super boring, unimaginative version of heaven that Susie is trapped in; the first-person teenage girl voice all but abandoned for the flavorless-omniscient-plus-Susie-hot-sauce (""from heaven I saw [insert narration here]""). People's eyes being compared to olives. All of these I was willing to tolerate because I thought, surely, that Sebold would not be so brazen as to deny Susie's family the closure of finding her remains and/or catching her killer.Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.Here's what I got instead: More sentimental drivel.More descriptions of people having feelings.Another rape.Spoiler alert: The rape = the resolution.?!??![Oh? Did you not catch that? Susie's spirit has transcended this mortal plane, and her only eternal wish, the one that will bring her to ultimate closure after she was raped and murdered, is non-consensual, body-snatching sex with the awkward boy she kind-of liked when she was 14.

THIS is why the concept of your ""contract with the reader"" is so damn important. THIS is why, if you want to write a wandering book about grief and loss and teenage rape and *whatever*, you do not begin your novel with a murder and a focused search for a killer.

The boys do not pinch our backsides or tell us we smelled. Our textbooks are Seventeen and Glamour and Vogue. Heaven is the best place… but when you are forced to be there, Heaven could be the worst place.Susie Salmon is raped, murdered, and thrown into a sinkhole by a psychopath. She is forced to be a spectator in Heaven. She has no desire to explore Heaven, and all the thing she does is watching living people in Earth. She watches her beloved ones growing up while the fourteen-year-old girl stays the same. Susie watches how the living people trying to overcome their loss of her. And while she watches them, Susie herself is trying to accept her death. The message is clear: we can survive anything, because God has a plan in everything, and never gives us more than we can bear.Susie is the kind of character who can make you feel a pity toward her. But Susie doesn’t ask or want your pity. She’s a complex girl despite her young age. She doesn’t try to impress you by mourning her loss of life. She acts as mature as she can, though there are times you will find her egoistic thoughts. And when you are raped and murdered… don’t you at least deserve a selfish moment for yourself?Though I think this book sometimes a bit unrealistic, I thought the fantasy elements in the novel were melancholy and stunning. You may find this book terrible because of the unrealistic story, but I personally find this book as a lovely and worth reading. Best books are always either loved or hated.

But that day it rolled right off her tongue. “I’m Holly,” she said. Because she wanted no trace of an accent in her heaven, she had none.I stared at her black hair. It was shiny like the promises in magazines. “How long have you been here?” I asked.“Three days.”“Me too.”I sat down on the swing next to her and twisted my body around and around to tie up the chains.

I actually believe that the way the mystery was introduced is pretty clever, and indeed some of the meaning giving in the novel is quite accurate and useful.The obvious theme from the book is love and the struggle to keep the family together. The hole book creates a clear picture of death and its aftermath and how it murders just that particular person but a hole family.The characters are extremely rich and that's pretty sweet too.In an overall,the book is okay, it's not bad but it's definitely not something I would recommend to anyone or ever call as a “must read”.Still, the idea Alice Sebold tried and express in the book was pretty clear but in some way confusing and managed somewhat wrongly.Personally I believe it's just a book and there doesn't exist a single book which is not worth reading.",4,0.9967,0.077,0.697,0.226,0.5737351190476191,NEGATIVE,1.0
253,1884326256,11/19/2019,1.0,"I do not understand why I picked up this book in the first place. When I found out that the story would be told by a girl, Susie Salmon, from heaven, I thought that I would get something new to read. Of course, I was wrong. As hard-hitting and sadly truthful as this book is, I still feel that it is pointless to read it. Susie Salmon, at fourteen years, is raped and killed by a psychopathic neighbour. As she begins to trail the life of her loved ones on Earth, she witnesses her family go through trials, ordeals and indelible struggles her murder has entailed. Her family is torn apart by the eternal gruesomeness that shrouds their lives as they are forced to live everyday with the thought of their precious family member gone, and her murderer absconding. Initially, I thought that this was going to be a murder-mystery. But as I read further, I realised the story had no direction. I cannot even fathom the pain and sorrow families go through when they find their dear ones victimised by the same, rotten wantonness of which they get a glimpse in the newspapers every day, the despair and helplessness that engulf them, the fear that inhibits them. The subject in itself is horrifying, and even awakening, but I think a better story could have been weaved around it. All that this book does is drone upon the feelings of the family members after the death of the protagonist. Most of it is just describing their feelings and thoughts in the moment. I think two-third of the book is filled with inordinate records how the characters cope with Susie’s murder. That’s all. The story moves at pace slower than a snail’s, and there is really nothing to expect. I found it a collection of ramblings, and every time I picked up this book, I couldn’t help but worry about the time I was wasting on reading it, which could have been used to read something substantial, or useful. I am not saying that I don’t empathise with the characters or find the subject useless. I just wish that the story had a direction or a purpose, or the characters were more prudent and responsible. I have learned not to trust a book based on its cover/title/blurb. This is one useful lesson this book taught me.",4,-0.9763,0.152,0.768,0.08,0.4395979020979021,NEGATIVE,1.0
254,59170241,06/10/2009,4.0,"I have always been a fan of murder-mystery-drama books, Dennis Lehane being my favorite master of this genre. In reading the Lovely Bones, it was such an interesting perspective to have the narrator be the victim, Susie Salmon, to know 'who-done-it' from the very start, and to watch the deceased navigate through the author's take on 'heaven' while observing all that was left behind.I liked that Sebold took on the task of letting us watch a child watch the devastation take hold of her family, and that she was not allowed to intervene. There were no signals etched into steamy mirrors from the after-life (save for one scene that you'll have to have your own take on), which made me like it more instead of less because it made it more plausible, If that's what you're looking for. The dysfunction in the adult relationships paired with the perfection in the adolescent ones may have been simple naivate on the part of Susie, or it may have been just the purity and lack of baggage that allowed them to flourish the way they did.I was determined to read this book before I saw the movie, because I always get more out of the movie knowing what they left out. I doubt, for example, they'll provide as much back-story of George Harvey and his dysfunctional child-hood. Though it's not hard to deduce that a serial killer probably didn't have a perfect beginning.The title stems from the following passage; ""These were the lovely bones that had grown around my absence: the connections — sometimes tenuous, sometimes made at great cost, but often magnificent — that happened after I was gone. And I began to see things in a way that let me hold the world without me in it. The events my death brought were merely the bones of a body that would become whole at some unpredictable time in the future. The price of what I came to see as this miraculous lifeless body had been my life.""I was really excited to see the Mark Wahlberg will be playing Jack Salmon.

I will conclude my opinion as soon as I finish it. Which is hope would be very soon. I recommned it to all.April 30, 2010Okay, so I've finished reading this book late into the night. To add to my previous review which i wrote when I'd started with this book, i would say that I am rather disappointed. In the ending chapters, the story seem to lose the depth. Scenes change rather abruptly. Thought-flow is very thick and cuts at sharp angles which makes you feel lost. We seem to know the peripheral characters like Ray Sing, Ruth, Samuel, Hal, Ruana Sing, but they are too essential to the plot and must have been introduced more thoroughly as the story made its progress. There's no depth in the relation between Susie and Ray Sing. No intensity in Ray Sing's feelings about Susie and one day they end up making love out of nowhere like die-hard lovers.When Susie's mother Abigail left home her suffering could have been authored more elaborately and deeply being a mother character. It is implied in Susie's narration as a statement of fact that Abigail copes with the tragedy by sleeping with Len and by leaving home. Without the direct narration the reader could not establish why Abigail is doing things.George Harvey, the antagonist, is reduced to a peripheral character in the end and dies rather inconsequentially. George Harvey is the cause, he is the trigger whose actions launches the plot. His demise lacks drama without a brilliant build up to it. Harvey's death with an icicle reminded me of a Michael Jackson song:Susie's got your number...And Susie ain't your friendLook who got you under...With 7 inches in.lol.I have a hard time figuring out WHO IS THE HERO?

I was intrigued by Susie's heaven, intrigued by how the family was dealing with her death. The prose was interesting, the descriptions a bit different to usual -- sometimes too much so, like when a girl's eyes are described as ""ferocious olives"".There are very few surprises, with this book. That's obvious from the second sentence: ""I was fourteen when I was murdered on December 6, 1973."" I'm not sure what you'd say the plot was about: I guess it's about a murdered girl watching her family deal with her death, and slowly beginning to deal with it herself.The characters are interesting. Abigail reminds me of a woman I read about in some other book, when I was little: she gave up what she wanted to be a mother and a wife. I think I liked Abigail better of the two. She ran away from it, and then she came back and tried to work through it.I'm not sure what I think of the subplot between Ruth and Ray. It's interesting, and Ruth is an interesting character, but parts of it -- near the end -- kinda creeped me out.

The most major problem is the protagonist's possession of a young woman who is engaged to a young man the dead protagonist once fancied. One insightful reader/reviewer likened the possession scene to a rape. If you think about it, a spirit possessing a human's body is the ultimate form of rape, and I don't think Sebold ever considered this angle when penning The Lovely Bones. The possession scene sours the general milk of humanity vibe that is the Lovely Bones.

On the other hand, it’s not as poignant as I thought it would be. The narrator ponders her brief life and missed opportunities as she watches her loved ones with a sort of wistful, detached compassion, but I still found myself getting a bit impatient for the end.

290,2026641280,09/10/2017,3.0,"“Murderers are not monsters, they're men. And that's the most frightening thing about them.”The Lovely Bones is about tragedy and how it affects the family in the long run. If you are expecting a crime mystery, don´t even read this book - the narrator is the murdered girl and we basically know every detail of the crime right from the beginning. BUT if you like psychological and almost philosophical reads, you might really really like this. I am more of a mystery kind of reader, but I still enjoed it, though sometimes, especially towards the end, it was very very slow, even for my taste (and I have nothing against the slow plot). The book is told from the POV of the Susie, who was raped and murdered when she was 14. She is looking from her heaven at the earth and her family and tells the story of grief and life taken unexpectedly. These parts I really liked. I did not like the whole ""heaven"" thing, the whole idea as it is presented in the book seemed too weird for me, especially in contrast to very realistic portrayal of events on the earth.Another thing about this book (if you couldn´t guess from the description) - it is really sad. And not even in the obvious way, it just have this general feeling of sadness for the world and for all the families who lost someone, even if that someone only left them (not necessarily died). You will feel that deep feeling of missing someone, even if you don´t really miss anybody. There is also a theme of frustration - of being misunderstood, of being forgotten, of not being believed (father and his suspicion about Mr. Harvey) etc... which needs to be let go in order to move on. I really liked this part, this lack of other form of satisfaction, only way out was to let go. Which was the perfect ending, but maybe a little bit anticlimactic. Which is, honestly, very realistic.Overall I liked this book, but it was different than I expected. 3,5/5*",3,-0.9703,0.158,0.738,0.105,0.5760012210012211,NEGATIVE,0.854
291,85554118,01/18/2010,2.0,"I must admit, I read this book because I saw the movie. Aside from a few well done scenes, the movie was oh so very bad, and almost universally panned by critics. I'd heard that the book was a best-selling novel, that the movie had omitted certain key details of the main character's murder (that she had been raped before her murder and that she was dismembered). While investigating further differences between the novel and film, I discovered that the author herself had been raped, and thought of all people to depict a rape, she was qualified. I resented the film for omitting that detail-- they could have hinted at rape without showing it, and I resolved to read the novel.I must say, after having read this book, I was surprised at all the critical acclaim. I was surprised at the best-seller status. But I guess after the debacle that is Twilight, nothing should surprise me. I will grant that the book is well-written at least, unlike the Twilight series. The story begins with the rape and murder of 14 year-old Susie Salmon and is narrated by her from heaven. The treatment of the family's grief and how each member deals or does not deal with the aftermath is well done. Even the narration of the novel by the deceased Susie was fine. Although I would have been interested in how Susie processed the events that happened to her, we learn that she will never grow or evolve from this point because we do that in life, not in heaven. And thus, the treatment of Susie in her heaven was inconsistent to the point of bad, and thus brought the rest of the novel down with it.At some times, the afterlife for Susie is described as the Inbetween, at other times it is called heaven, or her personal heaven. The loneliness, longing, jealousy and all other feelings Susie feels while there would have been easier to accept if the novel explored the notion that the afterlife was not really heaven, but something else entirely. But the Inbetween is apparently a minor stage of heaven, and as Susie's understanding progresses, she will make it to the main heaven, or something like that. But, don't misunderstand, the Inbetween is still part of heaven. So all of Susie's earthly wants and loneliness seem incongruent with anything called ""heaven."" Had the author never called it heaven, this mystery afterlife may have been easier to swallow. But even if one were to accept that ""heaven"" doesn't necessarily mean happy and without want, as most people would assume of such a place, then within the boundaries of the heaven described by the author, there are inconsistencies and disturbing events within this heaven. Susie never grows up, never will mature, according to the rules of heaven. So she will be forever 14. One of the things she wanted when she was 14 was to kiss a boy again that she had only kissed once. Somehow, she gets the opportunity to leave heaven, possess a former acquaintance, and revisit this boy. At the time of her death, she wanted only to kiss the boy again. When she revisits this boy, who is now a man, she asks him to make love to her. What?? If she doesn't mature in heaven, then where the heck does this newfound desire come from? It is true that many rape victims want a positive sexual experience following such a violation, but in Susie's case, she was murdered moments after her rape, and according to her heaven's rules, would never get to process her attack enough to desire tender love making. That was only my first issue with this event. My other issue is that Susie is forever 14, when she possesses this woman to sleep with her former crush, she is still 14, but he is now 22. TWENTY-TWO and sleeping with a 14 year old. That bothered me. It was painted as romantic and lovely, but it was still a child with a man. That was number two.Number three was that SUSIE WAS INHABITING ANOTHER WOMAN'S BODY. Since that other woman could not give her consent to anything, in essence, Susie raped this woman. Yes. Child Susie left heaven to sleep with a man she only ever wanted to kiss when he was a boy, and in doing so raped a woman with whom she never was very close to in life.Once a novel enters the realm of ridiculousness, it is really very hard for me to give it a second chance. That was just ridiculous. Perhaps if I had known nothing about the book, and it was an utterly new notion to me as a plot device, I may have liked it better. With the film's previews, this will now be an impossibility. At best, the posthumous narration prevented the book from being too dark to want to continue with. The descriptions of heaven were unnecessary and simply weren't explored enough to merit their inclusion in the book. The family's grief was well fleshed out, but we all recognize grief, we all know it. If heaven is to be described, really describe it or don't. The random tidbits that don't make any sense don't lend to the book but detract from it. Heaven almost needed to be explored more than the family's grief because it was something the readers are unfamiliar with. Without it, the Susie in heaven came off as gimmicky to anyone for whom the book's premise is not new.And I can't say it enough, that whole possession chapter could have been withdrawn in entirety from the book. It would have made it 10 times better. But the final nail in the coffin was the final sentence of this book: ""I wish you all a long and happy life."" It came off like Tiny Tim's ""God bless us, every one."" Sebold may be a decent writer, but she's no Dickens. It read like cheese addled cheesiness. Particularly because this sentiment from Susie came AFTER wishing her father would die young so that she could have him with her in heaven. And no argument can be made that she matured to that statement, because she's in a perpetual 14 year old state in her heaven. It was a cloying end to a novel that showed promise, but got tangled in its own gimmicks.",3,0.9977,0.12,0.695,0.185,0.4980934136106551,NEGATIVE,0.9999
