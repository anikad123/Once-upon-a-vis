0,217861118,10/01/2011,4.0,"4.25This was the first Sophie Kinsella book I ever read and it will remain my favourite. My mum actually picked this up for me, because she liked the blurb on the back. She would never read this sort of book; she is into China Meavile, Dan Simmons and Stephen King. Not the sort of stuff I read... At first, I was hesitant, but I started reading this in the car on the way home and it was addictive. I just could not stop; this book is romantic, moving with just the right amount of funny (it had a few of those major laugh out loud, cover mouth with fist moments). Overall, it was a really good read.Characters: 9/10All just hilarious, even the ones I hated had some really funny lines. And the way Samantha talks about them. Priceless.Writing: 7/10It’s chick-lit for goodness sake. It was easy to read and took no brain cells whatsoever.  Plot: 9/10Interesting, quite original, moves at the perfect pace with the perfect twists along the way. It has an ending that you would expect but not expect at the same time.Does that make sense?

2,1794000507,10/25/2016,4.0,"At first, the concept was so ridiculous, I wasn't sure I would even like the book. But Sophie Kinsella skillfully made it seem plausible. The story of a stressed-out lawyer, stripped of her job and accidentally ending up in the unlikely position of a housekeeper for a nouveau riche couple at a country estate, was very entertaining. In “The Undomestic Goddess”, Kinsella obviously spent some quality time studying not only international finance, but corporate law and commercial cooking as well . I also bet that she looked into some really excellent scams, and spent a bit of time with some professional housekeepers. Few professors could have made the subject understandable much less as engrossing and enjoyable as Ms. Kinsella has. Samantha, a whiz kid corporate lawyer -- when faced with making coffee, toast and eggs Benedict -- is totally flummoxed. Poor girl! I giggled at her sallies into the laundry room, baking catastrophes, bed making disasters.... the situation is glorious! I just love it when the know-it-all gets her comeuppance. It can only make for a hilarious tale as she embarks on her new journey that leads to love, self-discovery, and peace.The first half was fairly obnoxious. I don't really know why I kept reading, but I'm glad I did. The second half, once Samantha began to get a little bit of control in her life, became quite enjoyable. Of course, when your weekends and evenings are suddenly free, romance can’t be far behind. In ""Northanger Abbey"", Jane Austen quoted Samuel Richardson’s straight forward romancing rule: ""It must be very improper that a young lady should dream of a gentleman before the gentleman is first known to have dreamt of her."" Samantha, of course in true Catherine Morland fashion, fails to follows Austen's very sensible advice much to the benefit of the story. Kinsella seems to imply that just being a woman is a pretty good deal, and being a woman who has attracted the love of a decent man is really a great deal! The story could be a bit extreme, and there is little reality to how this could happen. But I don’t really care! The characters are rich and warm, and I want to meet them in real life. I did enjoy this book very much. I found myself chuckling and saying ""Oh no!"" at all the right places. It’s a light read which we all need from time to time. I was a bit disappointed with the ending, but it wasn't anything major. I just had a different vision of what she might have done. But otherwise I thought it was a good read, and brings you back to recognize what is important in life.",65,0.9987,0.052,0.705,0.243,0.5132227739580681,POSITIVE,0.6714
3,4486778506,01/22/2022,2.0,"Over achieving high powered lawyer Sam has a spectacular fall from grace and in the calamitous tines that ensues, ends up being sort of accidently hired as a housekeeper… there's just the slight problem that she has no idea how to cook, clean, iron etc. A typical 'chic-lit' Noughties read with the added bonus of Kinsella's superior plotting and good instinct for comedy.This is my third Kinsella read in as many months and I feel her formula of taking romantic comedy tropes and adding solid story lines, modern professional women and some great humour works for me; although the downside for me is all the banal romance and will they-won't they stuff that took so many pages of this book. 5 out of 12.2022 read",65,0.9779,0.047,0.727,0.226,0.4722916666666666,POSITIVE,0.6146
4,272053234,02/03/2012,3.0,"After reading several books by Kinsella, the only major complaint I have is that the endings are extremely unsatisfying. She builds up the character development and story so, so well, only to have it all end just shy of the perfect HEA. The first thought I usually have after finishing her books is, ""Wait, what? That's it?"" More than in Kinsella's other novels, this factor is impossible to ignore in The Undomestic Goddess. Samantha comes a long way from being a lawyer-zombie to a content housekeeper, but that change isn't really explored as much as I would have expected. It's like as soon as SK decided she'd placed her characters exactly where she wanted, she lost all interest in finishing their story properly.In addition, Nathaniel should have played a bigger role in the book. Honestly, I felt a little cheated by the ""romance"". All the hints are there, but most of the scenes between the two MCs are simply skimmed over and told in retrospect. Overall, I liked reading The Undomestic Goddess, but I would have enjoyed it a lot more if there had been more story and less narration. This book doesn't leave any lasting impression, but it's still a fun read as long as you keep your hopes low.2.75/5 starsFor more reviews, visit my blog.",59,0.9821,0.05,0.786,0.164,0.4706709956709956,NEGATIVE,1.0
5,1292877993,05/29/2015,2.0,"1.5 stars - SpoilersThe worst Kinsella book I've read so far, it wasn't totally awful but it was pretty bad. The story was even more far-fetched and the main character even more daft than the other Kinsella heroines combined. The heroine (Samantha) was meant to be an Oxbridge educated lawyer with years of experience in the best law firm in the country, yet somehow she read more like a grade A idiot. I don't know why authors bother giving their main characters high IQ's and super smart careers when they can only portray them as complete thickos who can barely string a sentence together. -Really liked Trish and Eddie Geiger, they were such fun characters. I loved the way they bossed Samantha about and how they interacted with each other, they were pretty hilarious. I also quite liked Nathaniel, he was a normal, down to earth sort of guy instead of the usual rich, brooding, millionaire love interest.-How on earth do you accidentally become a housekeeper? Samantha lost her job at her law firm and took a random train to the middle of nowhere, she then knocked on a random house and acted weird and somehow that magically landed her a housekeeper job in a fancy mansion with a millionaire couple. Yea, right. She also got to stay in said mansion overnight after a two minute interview in which she acted like a nutter. Yea, because that seems likely.-Why would Samantha run away from her job? Sure, she thought she made a huge mistake costing her firm fifty million quid, but she was supposed to be a highly trained professional with years of education and training, and who worked well under high pressure and was ultra responsible and had a brilliant mind and work ethic. Yet she ran away like some sort of scared naive wet behind the ears idiot. Why would someone so hard working and responsible just ditch everything at the first sign of trouble? Why wouldn't she question everything? Why wouldn't she stay to investigate and defend herself? She worked all her life to be a top tier lawyer so why wouldn't she stay and fight for her career and reputation? It was all so nonsensical.-For a high flying lawyer Samantha sure was an idiot and a half. She couldn't follow basic recipes and cooking instructions without turning the kitchen into a bloody war zone. She even struggled with slicing bread and was unable to make a jam sandwich and hard boiled eggs (the silly cow put them in the microwave?!). She didn't even know how to iron without burning everything or wipe surfaces without making things worse. It was beyond ridiculous. Yes, not everyone knows how to cook well or do certain chores, but who the hell can't boil an egg or make a jam sandwich or wipe a surface?! I'm guessing Samantha's incompetence was meant to be funny or cute or something, but it was none of those things, it was plain stupid.-How was it Samantha was so unable to hold simple conversations? A top shot lawyer should at the very least be able to hold moderately intelligent conversations. Yet half the time Samantha just stuttered and mumbled and muttered her way through things. Also, when she found out she'd been set up at work and came across suspicious evidence that pointed to another colleague (Arnold) committing fraud, the silly cow couldn't confront him or make a convincing argument against him without looking like a demented psycho dumbo loser. She was meant to be a genius lawyer who regularly talked her way through all sorts of tricky situations and dealings yet when she confronted Arnold all she was capable of doing was stomping her feet and pouting, she did nothing to defend her reputation, she just talked rubbish. It didn't even occur to her to bring up the fact that Arnold had strong family connections to the company that took that 50 million. Ugh, she was the most unconvincing lawyer character in the fictional world ever. -Why was Samantha always yelling or mumbling or pouting? Would an experienced, professional lawyer really talk like that? I swear Samantha came across more like a belligerent child than anything else.-According to The Undomestic Goddess women can't have a glittering career and a fulfilling personal life at the same time. It's either one or the other. -So Samantha gave up her career and a chance of a lifetime to be a partner in a top law firm all so she could run off to Cornwall with a guy she'd known for a few months? I mean, she only worked her whole bloody life to achieve that level of success, it was her one ambition and dream but all that got thrown out the window because she was in lurve, and working as a lawyer was just too gosh darn difficult for her tiny woman brain. Ugh.If it hadn't been for the secondary characters, I don't think I would have been able to finish this. Even for a chick lit book, it was beyond ridiculous.

6,223052262,10/13/2011,4.0,"This story is about a 20-something, workaholic lawyer named Samantha. Sam leaves her job after making a huge mistake that costs her firm millions of dollars. She has put her whole life into this job, trying to become partner, and now it's over. She has a major meltdown, and ends up miles from home in the middle of nowhere working as a maid to a family that doesn't know anything about her true identity. She also doesn't know anything at all about being a maid as you can probably guess by the title. This makes for an interesting hilarious ride. At one point she has no idea how to use an iron and tells her boss that she can't figure it out because she's ""far more used to working with a Nimbus 2000"" These little comments pop up everywhere making the book fly by and making you really root for this poor girl who hasn't got a clue. A bit predictable, but I don't read her books thinking I'm going to be digging into a literary masterpiece. The romance was cute, but there really wasn't much of it. Nothing but fun and laughter all the way through. Sam was an extremely fun character to read about. She's funny, smart, and can really think quick on her feet. She shows genuine signs of maturity and growth throughout this quick read.I really liked how the ultimate message was delivered, though. In the end Sam has to take a look at her life and really figure out what is important, and what isn't. Perhaps you are putting too much effort into something that gives nothing back. This was my first book from Sophie Kinsella, but I will definitely read more of her books. Her humor is fresh, and if you go into this book solely expecting a light-hearted, fun read I think you will enjoy it.Recommended to all of Sohpie Kinsella's fans, and all chick-lit lovers.

9,2543469750,09/27/2018,5.0,"The Undomestic Goddess by Sophie Kinsella is a standalone contemporary romance that is typical of the author's style, quite humorous and a bit over the top. Samantha Sweeting is a lawyer who knows nothing other than her job. Working every day of the week for seven years trying to make partner Samantha strives for perfection.One day though just as she is about to be named a partner in the firm Samantha comes across a paper on her desk that did not get filed in time costing a client 50 million. Samantha doesn't make mistakes but this time she did and she doesn't know how to face the consequences.Needing time to think Samantha jumps on the nearest train and heads away from the fallout that is sure to come from her costly error. Not knowing where she's ended up Samantha knocks on the nearest door and finds herself mistaken for someone applying for the job as housekeeper. Instead of correcting the mistake Samantha stays on until she hears word from her job.I have to admit the believability factor on this one is pretty low with a high powered attorney ending up cooking and cleaning but that's also what makes it so much fun. Very much a comedy of errors from the one mistake it snowballs into so much more that you can't help but chuckle and laugh along. The story then becomes a romance and looks at just what could/should or would make someone happy. A fun read from start to finish.For more reviews please visit https://carriesbookreviews.com/",40,0.9714,0.088,0.753,0.159,0.4959150326797386,POSITIVE,0.9576

I can expect no less from  Sophie Kinsella.I came across a lot of negative reviews about this book claiming it was very predictable and so on. I mean, come on, this is a fiction, it doesn't have to actually be realistic. We, readers, often read to escape reality, to go through an entertaining adventure to shake off the daily stress we're put through. So I truly (and that's my own opinion) don't mind it being predictable or even unrealistic at times. I could even relate to it (and to Samantha) in many ways, especially when speaking of the daily pressure of work and how you have to be constantly at disposal, having no private life and no time for yourself. I could also relate to abandoning something you've always dreamed of just for the sake of your peace of mind. Yes, peace of mind is priceless!!Anyway, this is a perfect beach read. It has all the ingredients for an enjoyable experience; a lot of plot twists, funny moments, and a good deal of romance.",30,0.9773,0.091,0.702,0.207,0.6035984848484849,POSITIVE,1.0

The ones with Anna Karenina under their arms on the streets and a quote by Oscar Wilde on their yearbook who know Shakespeare's sonnets by heart. Not that there's anything wrong with any of those, but there is when a snob firmly believes there's nothing to look for in literature nowadays. Or when a snob believes a genre is deemed more worthy than the other.I decided to start my review this way because there are the people who do not deem contemporary fiction as 'real literature' or 'worthy'. I love Sophie Kinsella. I read her because it is light, it brings my mood up and makes me feel absolutely joyful for the characters. And to enjoy literature which isn't a classic is nothing to be ashamed of. To read 'chick lit' (a term I have problems with based on sexism but nevertheless) is nothing to be ashamed of, either.SOPHIE KINSELLA IS HILARIOUS. This book just proves it, once again! A super stressed lawyer makes a mistake that makes her company lose millions so she hops on the first train she sees and arrives at an unknown destination.

Since then, I haven't found the time to read her sequels, but recently, I picked up ""The Undomestic Goddess"" from the library and started reading. Much to my surprise, I found her main characters to be quite similar; they're both smart women with flighty thoughts who are put into extraordinary circumstances and come out better than anyone could have imagined. Akin to Bridget Jones and all her wobbly bits. As entertaining as this book was, it bordered on the antagonizing that everything so conveniently fell in Samantha Sweeting's lap. She just happens to have a photographic memory, she just happens to be friends with a Lord and Lady, she just happens to find employment (and did ya ever wonder what happened to the real housekeeper who was supposed to show for the interview??), she just happens to learn how to cook in a couple weeks... that right there was the biggest leap for me! Anyway, this will probably make a good romantic comedy movie. I actually read it like a screenplay. If it is turned into a movie, I'd probably go see it with the right cast.

I haven't tried the shopaholic series but I've read her three books following that series which are, Remember Me?, Can You Keep a Secret? and The Undomestic Goddess. All her characters are witty. They are also serious parts but with the way she writes and the way her characters think are very light. There's also a mixture of romance in her books which gives her all the more reason to be my favorite author. Samantha Sweeting is a workaholic. She was trained by her lawyer mother to be a great lawyer and because of that she dedicated herself in that career. She can't do anything else other than what she's good at which is to find loop holes and anomalies in other people's statements and legalities.

The romance was also not the strongest suit in this book? It was suddenly a mess for me.With that said, while I haven't enjoyed the last part of this book, some might still enjoy this one.

But I have heard some good things about her and also didn't mind the couple books that I've already read. And The Undomestic Goddess didn't do much for me. Samantha Sweeting, London's hot-shot lawyer, with busy lifestyle, very hardworking and expected to be the youngest to make partner in her firm. Everything is looking great as she's getting what she's worked for all her adult life including some teen years. Just then she's made the biggest mistake of her career and runs away from London and her career rather than facing all her colleagues, employers and ends up in the countryside (I love the countryside) and is mistaken as a housekeeper. Since she's always had her domestic chores done for her, therefore she doesn't have a clue how to do any domestic chores, let alone do what is required of her as a housekeeper. It started out great and funny even though there were some parts where I was thinking, what the heck? She's a lawyer and she doesn't know how to operate a washing machine. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that simple a thing. Apparently it does. But fine, whatever.I still kept on enjoying this thinking it's okay these things are supposed to be funny and cute (not to me) but overall it's funny but when she says no to her career which she's worked for all her life just to keep working as a housekeeper, it all went downhill for me. I just didn't want to read anymore but kept on reading thinking may be she'll somehow have it all and my predictions will not be right. Nope, didn't happen. She just throws away her career and chooses love which is amazing but can't we career women have it all? Why is it always depicted in the books for us to make a choice between this and that? I mean this is very annoying. I'm so furious at the ending that I couldn't even enjoy Samantha getting her love life back. Not to mention all that tug and pull play at the end, which annoyed me further. It was going to be a 4 stars read for me until she throws away all her life's hard work, it's 2 stars from me now.2 stars",20,0.96,0.063,0.828,0.109,0.5353339947089947,NEGATIVE,1.0

So Haley recommended I read this book, which is exactly what I need. Although I had a few problems with this book, I enjoyed it immensely.The undomestic Goddess follows a 29 year old Lawyer named Samantha, who from the age of 12 was so focused on her career and going to the next level, she forgot how to live. Samantha is a workaholic, a perfectionist, so used to never making mistakes that when she does she takes the first train she sees without caring where it’s heading, and ends up as a domestic worker. And from there the story unravels. This is the type of book you’d throw a blind eye at all the flaws just for the sheer pleasure of reading it. I enjoyed the slight humour and characterization in this book. And although I found it a bit unrealistic that a 29 year-old living alone doesn’t even know what’s a vacuum cleaner, I still laughed when she was trying to adapt into her new job as a housekeeper. I have only read Sophie Kinsella’s finding Audrey, which I loved. And hopefully, this isn’t my last read by her. I’d recommend this book to anyone wanting to read something light and sweet, or is in a reading slump. And although I felt it dragged a bit in the middle I couldn’t put it down.",20,0.9877,0.048,0.766,0.186,0.4532218739115291,POSITIVE,0.9983
22,936284446,03/02/2021,4.0,"This is a delectable humorous jaunt if you need a light read. It reads quickly and is a fun time. As with previous Sophie Kinsella novels, it gets a bit serious at the end, and drastically the female MC ends up compromising for the male. Samantha is hopeless at domestic duties, and her struggles are hilarious. I find this novel to be timely for many current women who are expected to know how to conduct many domestic duties without being taught by anyone. I know that I am hopeless at many of them myself, such as sewing on a button. To be fair, I know my grandmother and mother taught me when I was young, but I honestly would rather have someone else do it for me at this point. Enter the services industry...I loved Samantha even if sometimes I wanted her to have more confidence in herself. Iris was probably my overall favorite character, and I wish to take cooking lessons from her myself. One of my favorite excerpts from Samantha's schedule when she thinks she can plan like Mary PoppinsThe original plan for making the bed was 9:30-9:36""9:36 Fuck. I cannot make this bed.

The main reason I enjoyed this book so much is probably because I can totally relate to Samantha. She is a lawyer and workaholic. She thinks that she will be happy after reaching the next step on the career ladder and all her hard work and sacrifices will pay off. Only while working so hard towards her goal, she fails to enjoy her life. A series of events finally forces her to stop and take a long hard look at her life and evaluate what is really important.Of course, predictably there is romance and happily ever after, but aside from that I think this book has a great life message.",19,0.946,0.058,0.784,0.158,0.6075396825396825,POSITIVE,0.9971

28,1199190537,02/12/2015,4.0,"3.5 Stars :0)Not a laugh-out-loud type of funny novel for me, but this was surprisingly alot of fun...There were a couple plot points that were a bit out there for me but it didn't really bother me too much. Once the story started going and I got to know these characters more, I fell in love. A couple times I would look up from the novel and be surprised I was still sitting in the living-room and not at the Geiger's Inn. The pages fly by really fast but the story never suffers for it.Samantha's mother... yeesh, talk about pressure. If that had been my mother, I would have fled the day I turned 18 and not looked back. I felt bad for Samantha in a way, growing up with that type of family. Well meaning but not close at all. She almost convinced herself I think that she was fine with it, but never quite succeeded.As for Samantha's freak out, her flight response would be probly be what my mind would have done, I don't blame her for wanting to get away.Trish/Eddie/Nathaniel/Iris... LOVED them! Trish was exasperating sometimes but she was endearing. Her 'meddling', to her, came from a good place... Eddie we didn't get to know as well, but it was fun to watch him and Trish interact.Nathaniel - <3! Book boyfriend! Nothing I didn't love about him :) I did appreciate that Miss Kinsella didn't go the route of when Samantha reveals who she is, with Nathaniel storming off and refusing to listen to her. Loved the fact he was understanding with Samantha.One character I was indifferent to but later on when his true colors came out, I wanted to kick him in the balls. Self-centered, arrogant prick! Another guy who seemed like a hard person, actually came to Samantha's rescue, so to speak. He got a few respect points in that situation.The ending I thought was perfect, not rushed at all like some of the same genre. It didn't wrap everything up in a neat bow but it left me with a smile on my face.Charming, sweet, humorous with some irritating moments (mostly due to certain characters I wanted to Gibbs!Smack)... a nice addition for the chick lit genre.Wouldn't mind seeing more of these two :)",17,0.9983,0.069,0.666,0.265,0.5599937343358397,POSITIVE,0.9847
29,1656078630,06/01/2016,3.0,"Unlike Sophie Kinsella's Shopaholic series, Undomestic Goddess features a much less ditzy woman front and centre in this very light yet original book. Although a bit dated- written in 2006- with its Blackberry devices for texting, computers for email and cell phones for calls only, the story is filled with the typical Kinsella contentious creatures as well as those truly most admirable who either trip up our heroine Arden or offer her safe haven. I needed a flight of fancy after reading a number of more sombre books, one which could carry me along with the vaguest of attention yet still be enjoyable. Somehow I'd missed this cute little tale of the high powered London lawyer who makes a first error in her stellar career, which results in the devastation of her reputation and losing her esteemed place in a top ranking firm. In a daze, Arden hops on public transit only to become lost in a bucolic village and impulsively asks a resident for a glass of water and aspirin. Of course, this is the moment that the Shakespearian ploy of mistaken identity begins to cast it's delightful spell. After accepting the strong headache pills from the house owner Trish, Arden cavalierly interviews for the position of housekeeper which she didn't know about and would never have considered but for her terrible day. She impresses her probable clients with fabrications of Cordon Bleu cooking, expertise on management and cleaning a house, doing laundry and even ironing- none of which she knows anything about. The escapades which follow are great fun, lawyer life comes back to haunt her and the story finishes on a satisfying and very upbeat note. Lots of action, interaction, a bit of silliness and a whole bunch of nice made The Undomestic Goddess the right kind of friend for a day.

35,754065318,11/01/2013,5.0,"A great summer readFans of Sophie Kinsella will not be disappointed with ‘The Undometstic Goddess’. An easy read, this comical story had me laughing out loud along the way finishing with a satisfying happy and romantic ending for all. I would recommend this as one you pack in your suitcase: not only is it set in the summer but the satisfying ending is perfect for reading by the pool.Samantha Sweeting is a workaholic and in the opening chapters readers witness how obsessed she is with her career and aspirations of becoming a partner in the successful law firm she works in. Her inability to switch off during a reluctant pamper session had me cracking up and I found Kinsella’s descriptions familiar from my own observations of typical city workers. The narrow-mindedness towards life meant that Samantha just couldn’t recognise she was giving up so much for a goal that would not be the reward she really wanted.So when she begins as a housekeeper in a small village in the country where nobody recognises her, I found myself waiting for the penny to drop with her employers. But the Geigers aren’t quite clued up and Samantha manages to blag her way into becoming their housekeeper, even though she has no idea how to cook, clean or do anything domesticated.The Geigers are such comical characters and Samantha’s observations really make you chuckle. For example, when Eddie is reading through a suspect contract, Samantha is desperate to tell him he is making a mistake but at the same time she fears showing she is more than just a housekeeper. The lengths she goes to are entertaining but at the same time I found myself wishing she would reveal her identity and get the recognition she deserves.As Samantha adjusts to her new life (which allows time off from work – quite a novelty for her!), she finds herself becoming attracted to the Giegers gardner, Nathaniel. This romance is charming and sweet and you know that this is where Samantha should be. But when she discovers he has a hatred of lawyers, you are left wondering what will happen when he learns the truth about Samantha?This is a great read and entertaining every step of the way. One you can easily dip in and out of, I found myself liking Samantha more and more, and found I could relate to her in so many ways! If you have read other Kinsella books then don’t pass this one over. If not, then I definitely urge you to give this a go – I’m sure all of us have been flummoxed by domestic chores at some stage!",12,0.994,0.077,0.749,0.174,0.6507630654369784,POSITIVE,0.9997

This novel follows Sophie Kinsella's typical format, although this protagonist is much smarter than any of her other lead characters. This book follows a character named Samantha, who is a hot shot lawyer for one of the most prestigious law firms in London. She works from morning until night seven days a week and doesn't ever spend any time for herself and never cooks herself any meals. She has a housekeeper because she definitely doesn't have time for mundane activities such as hoovering, as she can earn up to £500 an hour, so why on earth would she waste time cleaning? Samantha doesn't ever bother to clean her desk at work either, it is organised mess that she thrives from. She wants nothing more from life than to achieve a partnership at the firm and to potentially end up in a relationship with a colleague named Guy. Then one day, her messy desk comes back to bite her from behind and leads to her making a massive career error. Unable to face the consequences of her actions, she runs away and ends up at a house and accepting a housekeeper position without even fully realising what she is doing. From there we follow Samantha as she struggles with her new life.This book sent me on a rollercoaster of emotions, I laughed out loud, I cried several tears and I can honestly say I felt the stress Samantha was under. I feel this is some of Sophie Kinsella's best writing, and at this point I have read most of her work.I loved the vast amount of characters in this book, especially Nathaniel, who is the gardener at the house she runs away to. It was a joy seeing characters interact and watching various different relationships be built. I particularly enjoyed the role that Nathaniel's mum played, as she essentially became the mother figure to Samantha that her own mum had never been.There are just so many messages hidden between the lines of this seemingly lighthearted contemporary romance. This is so much more than just some entertainment, you learn that life is what you make of it, and how working yourself into the ground isn't always what you need. Money really isn't everything, and meanwhile no one is too smart to do a specific job. In this day and age, people find it so easy to look down on someone just because their job isn't some high flying career. Samantha is an example that sometimes you need to follow your heart, not your bank account.I absolutely adored this novel, and it would be amazing if there could be some sort of sequel one day. If you have enjoyed Sophie's other novels then you will definitely enjoy this one, meanwhile if you have never picked up a book by her before, this is a great place to start.

But then it gets a bit tiresome, the quick learning, the big love next door, the constant predictability and the ""unbelievableness"" of it all. I mean come on, life isn't that easy, people don't take strangers in without a thought, no one can learn to cook in 2 days, gardeners aren't (most of them) sexy and rich, and worse than all, nobody cares about contract attornies..not lawyers, not clients, and certainly not people magazines.All in all, far from condemning the book, I'd even recommend it as an easy, no-thinking, funny read.

Samantha had everything I wanted, the star-studded career I dream of -- and she threw it away to work as a housekeeper.

51,67928181,08/18/2009,5.0,"It’s well known that I love Sophie Kinsella. All of her Shopaholic books are great as well as her stand-alone novels. I wasn’t planning to re-read The Undomestic Goddess but I read the first page and found it so funny I decided to carry on reading.It tells the story of Samantha Sweeting, a lawyer about to make partner at her firm, Carter Spink. One day, whilst tidying up her desk she realises she’s made a huge, career-altering mistake and panics. She leaves the office, finds herself in Paddington Station, takes a train and finds herself in the middle of nowhere. She stops at a house to ask for some water and is mistaken for an interviewee for a housekeeping position. She takes the job but there’s only one problem – Samantha is no Domestic Goddess…This is the second time I’ve read The Undomestic Goddess and I found it just as funny the second time around as I did the first. That’s the one thing you can count on with Sophie’s novels – they’re going to be amusing.It’s told in the first person so we get to know all of Samantha’s thoughts and at the beginning of the novel you can feel how fast-paced her life is and you find yourself reading quicker. The first-person view also allows you to see how Samantha’s life changes and slows down when she meets the Geigers.I liked Samantha and I loved that she was so dedicated to her job, she had no idea how to work a toaster or the washing machine. It shows that just because someone has an IQ of 158 it doesn’t mean they can work simple appliances! Reading about Samantha’s struggles during the first few days of her job was hilarious and I could see all of the situations she got herself into. I also like how salvation came and Nathaniel’s mother showed Samantha that she could bake a cake and iron clothes. And that, when she puts her mind to it, Samantha could do whatever she liked.I thought Nathaniel was well written and loved how amusing he found Samantha. I thought they got on well together. I found the Geigers amusing – all the demands they ask of Samantha and how impressed they were that she was English. They were completely bonkers but I loved them anyway! As I mentioned, Nathaniel’s mother, Iris, helped Samantha with her cooking skills and domestic skills. I loved the scenes between Samantha and Iris, they were sweet.One of my favourite parts of the story – and of any story – was when Samantha pulled herself together over her error that cost her her job. I love when any heroine of any story goes out to find out the truth and realises, actually, there might be more to it than meets the eye. I loved how Samantha defended herself and tried to explain herself and, in the end, was given a chance to exonerate herself.The Undomestic Goddess is definitely a favourite of mine. The story wasn’t really about Samantha’s job but the chance in Samantha as the novel wore on and I felt Sophie Kinsella wrote that brilliantly and realistically. Sophie is undoubtedly one of the best chick lit writers out there, because I have yet to read one of her novels I haven’t enjoyed!Rating: 5/5",8,0.9986,0.042,0.76,0.198,0.5388939763939765,POSITIVE,0.9996

In her new life she's much calmer, happier, healthier and has a life. When the two worlds collide I was desperate that she didn't go backwards to the old life. I agree with her going back to clear her name though. Clear your name and leave Samantha. Then whatever you do don't lose Nathaniel. It was hilarious when in the pub it mentiones him not liking lawyers. He's still ten of the other guy in Samantha's life. Slimy Guy who only wants to know her when she's considered successful. I love how Samantha discovers it's not what you do and how it looks good. Its how it makes you feel. A lawyer, a housemaid, anything that makes her happy not miserable.

There are numerous plot twists and Kinsella does a good job of keeping the reader turning the page. While I figured out the main plot twist early on, there were other plot twists I didn't see coming. One thing I didn't expect this book to be about was feminism, which is addressed briefly and as a background theme, but in a way that exposes some hypocrisy among people who say they support a woman's right to do what she wants with her life just as long as what she chooses isn't domestic work.I knocked off one star for the cringe-worthy and drawn-out sex scene, and for the ""just meh"" ending.

At the first problem our ""smart"" heroine run away and fail to deal with her problems. She lie, lie and lie. How on earth could she be a top lawyer and also be such an airhead and failure? If you want to write about an intelligent female protagonist, then make her smart and astute! Samantha's actions sounded silly and stupid. She's a top legal mind but she never thinks to work out some sort of suitable arrangement?

Also, far fetched books are pretty much okay for me, cuz well, it's fiction, but this one...lol, it was ridiculously unrealistic and preposterous.Too absurd. But still, I liked reading it.It's certainly not the best work of the author.

87,1660524399,06/06/2016,3.0,"A light and fluffy yet predictable story. I thought the MC Samantha was fairly well developed. But there were times that I found her actions quite unbelievable and irritating. I did enjoy the overall precise of the book about following your dreams and finding a balance to life. However, sometimes I felt that so much of the story was centered around Samantha getting used to her new job and letting go of her past that the romance which was crucial to the plot got overlooked. I felt Nathaniel 's character was completely sidelined and the lack of interactions between the characters left their relationship to come across as very wanting and unsatisfactory. I also felt throughout reading the book that some of the MC's decisions were very selfish when it came to someone she claimed to care about so deeply. It is a wonder the book ended the way it did honestly.Overall, I would recommend this story if you are looking for a quick summer read.",5,0.8532,0.058,0.83,0.112,0.5002164502164502,NEGATIVE,1.0
