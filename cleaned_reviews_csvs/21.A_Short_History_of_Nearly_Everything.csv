0,7355592,10/06/2007,3.0,"Okay, so here's my Bill Bryson story. I was in The Gladstone, a public house not too far from this very keyboard, with my friend Yvonne, who will remain nameless. We had been imbibing more than freely. A guy approached our table and asked me in a sly surreptitious manner if I was him. Him who? Was I Bill Bryson? Now it is true that I bear a very slight resemblancebut you could also say that about Bjorn from Abbaand a zillion other white guys with beards and gently rounded fizzogs. Anyway, without missing a beat I said yes, I was him. So the guy immediately asked me if I'd sign two of his books, and before I could say ""Come on mate, I'm not actually American, can't you bleedin well tell?"" he had zapped out of the pub. Only to zap straight back with two hardbacks of Bill's deathless works. What could I do? He opened them up reverentially and told me one would be for him and one for his mother. Friends, I signed them - ""Best wishes, your friend Bill Bryson"". He was so grateful, so very very pleased. We drank up and got the hell out of there. I look back on this disgraceful incident and shudder. That's the last time I'm impersonating a famous author.Short note on the book in question:There was no way our Bill could write a gently humorous book about the history of all of science without sounding like a fairly smirky know-it-all, so that's what he does sound like, which can be just a trifle wearing. LOTS of good info in here, but it's like being forced to live on Indian takeaways and nothing else, great for a while and then GET ME A SANDWICH! Or like being stuck on a long airplane ride with a very garrolous and opinionated fellow who thinks he is the very model of the modern travelling companion, regaling you with insightful and humourous anecdotes by the bucketful while you're wondering if it would be so bad if you faked a heart attack and you could whisper to the flight attendant ""I'm okay really but GET ME AWAY FROM THIS GUY!""",410,-0.831,0.093,0.803,0.104,0.4686936936936937,NEGATIVE,0.9985
1,79495680,11/30/2009,4.0,"What I learned from this book (in no particular order)1.	Phosphor was accidentally discovered when a scientist tried to turn human urine into gold. The similarity in color seemed to have been a factor in his conviction that this was possible. Like, duh. I’m no scientist, but shouldn’t it be obvious enough?2.	“In the early 1800s there arose in England a fashion for inhaling nitrous oxide, or laughing gas, after it was discovered that its use ‘ was attended by a highly pleasurable thrilling’. For the next half- century it would be the drug of choice for young people.” How groovy is that? 3.	If you are an average-sized adult, you contain within you enough potential energy to explode with the force of THIRTY very large hydrogen bombs. Assuming, that is, that you KNOW how to actually do this and REALLY want to make a point. Talk about a monstrous temper tantrum.4.	We are each so atomically numerous and so vigorously recycled at death that some of our atoms probably belonged to Shakespeare, Genghis Khan or any other historical figure. But no, you are NOT Elvis or Marilyn Monroe; it takes quite a while for their atoms to get recycled.5.	When you sit in a chair, you are not actually sitting there, but levitating above it at the height of a hundredth millions of a centimeter. Throw away those yoga mats, your ARE already levitating without knowing it.6.	The atomic particles that we now know as Quarks were almost named Partons, after you know who. The image of Ms. Parton with her, uh, cosmic mammaries bouncing around the atomic nuclei is VERY unsettling.Thankfully, that scientist guy changed his mind.7.	The indigestible parts of a giant squid, in particular their beaks, accumulate in sperm whales’ stomachs into ambergris, which is used as a fixative in perfumes. The next time you spray on Chanel No. 5, you’re dowsing yourself in the distillate of unseen sea monsters. * Note to self: must throw away sea monster perfume collection*8.	The ‘maidenhair’ in maidenhair moss does NOT refer to the hair on the maiden’s head.BUT SERIOUSLY,this is a fascinating, accessible book on the history of the natural sciences, covering topics as diverse as cosmology, quantum physics, paleontology, chemistry and other subjects that have bedeviled a science dolt like me through high school and beyond. Yes, it’s true, I failed BOTH chemistry and physics in high school. I can't judge how accurate Mr. Bryson represents the sciences in this book, but it surely beats being bogged down in A Brief History of Time and their ilk.

2,448075462,11/03/2012,4.0,"A Short History of Nearly Everything, Bill BrysonA Short History of Nearly Everything by American author Bill Bryson is a popular science book that explains some areas of science, using easily accessible language that appeals more so to the general public than many other books dedicated to the subject. Bryson describes graphically and in layperson's terms the size of the universe and that of atoms and subatomic particles. He then explores the history of geology and biology and traces life from its first appearance to today's modern humans, placing emphasis on the development of the modern Homo sapiens. Furthermore, he discusses the possibility of the Earth being struck by a meteorite and reflects on human capabilities of spotting a meteor before it impacts the Earth, and the extensive damage that such an event would cause. ...عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «تاریخچه تقریبا همه چیز»؛ «شرح مختصری از همه چیز»؛ «علم و سرگذشت آن»؛ نویسنده: بیل برایسون؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز ششم ماه جولای سال 2005میلادیعنوان: تاریخچه تقریبا همه چیز؛ نویسنده: بیل برایسون؛ مترجم: محمدتقی فرامرزی؛ تهران، مازیار، 1384، در 615ص، شابک 9645676487؛ موضوع: علوم به زبان ساده از نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده 21معنوان: شرح مختصری از همه چیز؛ نویسنده: بیل برایسون؛ مترجم: محمود زنجانی؛ تهران، دایره المعارف ایرانشناسی، 1388، در 512ص، شابک9786005204155؛عنوان: علم و سرگذشت آن؛ نویسنده: بیل برایسون؛ مترجم: مجید عمیق؛ تهران، مهراب قلم کتابهای مهتاب، 1390، در 171ص، شابک9786001033636؛نویسنده درباره ی موضوعاتی گوناگون، از «مهبانگ» گرفته، تا «مکانیک کوانتوم»، و از «تکامل»، تا «زمین شناسی»، به بحث میپردازند؛ ایشان در کتابشان از راه ماجراهای «کاشفان» و «دانشمندان» موضوعات علمی را، به بحث میگذارد؛ ایشان در این کتاب کوشش میکنند برخلاف درسنامه های علمی، که به نظر ایشان، شوقی برای دانستن، در خوانشگران برنمیانگیزند، چرا که هیچگاه به چراها، چگونه ها و چه هنگام ها، در مورد اکتشافات علمی نمیپردازند، ایشان توانسه اند موضوعات علمی را به شکلی جذاب ارائه دهندنقل از متن: (نمیدانستم «پروتون» یا «پروتئین» چیست، «کوارک» را از «کواسار» تشخیص نمیدادم، نمیدانستم زمینشناسها چگونه میتوانند نگاهی به یک لایه از توده سنگ دیواره ی یک دره بیندازند، و عمر آن را تشخیص دهند، حقیقتاً هیچ چیز نمیدانستم؛ یک اشتیاق آرام و خارق العاده، برای یاد گرفتن، و دانستن برخی نکات، درباره ی این موضوعات، و دریافتن اینکه تا کنون چند نفر توانسته اند از آنها سر درآورند، آرام آرام بر وجودم چیره شد؛ این همواره بزرگترین شگفتی زندگی ام بوده است ـ دانشمندان چگونه از مسائل سر درمیآورند...)؛ پایان نقل؛تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 11/08/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 29/06/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی",205,0.4588,0.013,0.967,0.02,0.3908333333333332,POSITIVE,0.9984
3,5229394,08/28/2007,4.0,"Bryson's dead serious: this is a history of pretty much everything there is -- the planet, the solar system, the universe -- as well as a history of how we've come to know as much as we do. A book on science written by a non-scientist, this a perfect bridge between the humanities and the natural sciences. A course in the history of science should be mandatory for every teenager, and this should be the textbook.Yes, it's a big, chunky book. No, it can't be trimmed down any further: when you're addressing cosmology, earth science, ecology and zoology, with healthy doses of chemistry and physics, plus the historical development of each, you're going to end up with a doorstop of a text, no matter how smoothly written. The wonder of Bryson's writing is that the reader doesn't get lost in these sweeping surveys. When name-dropping, Bryson always gives a short description of the person in question; if mentioned earlier in the book, he drops in a quick reminder to the reader. This is fabulously effective at giving the names some context, not to mention a little personality.And indeed, isn't that what science education needs most: more humanity and less intimidation? Those science-phobes out there who freely admit their near-complete ignorance of the subject should do themselves a favor and buy a copy of this book. No, don't get it from your library. There's so much here you'll want to have a copy on hand to refer to later.To those nerds in the audience -- myself included -- don't think your degrees mean you can pass this one over. As hyper-specialized as science has become, it's refreshing as hell to step back and take a look at things with new eyes. While there's not a lot here I haven't encountered before, there's a lot of information about how our current theories were developed that I didn't know.(Also? It's heartening to read about the social ineptitude, blind spots, and how utterly incompetent many of these scientist were in other aspects of life.

7,492413417,01/02/2013,4.0,"It's easy to nitpick A Short History of Nearly Everything. Bryson, by his own cheerful admission anything but a scientist, makes a fair number of mistakes. He says that all living creatures contain hox genes; he omits Alexander Friedmann and George Gamow from his description of how the Big Bang theory was developed; when talking about Darwin and Paley, he doesn't seem to be aware that Natural Theology was one of Darwin's favorite books and had a huge influence on him. Those are just a few of the glitches I happened to notice. I'm sure a real expert would have spotted many more.But so what? The author is incredibly entertaining, and I came across dozens of great stories from the history of science. He has done a fantastic job of tracking down details that you won't find in the other books! Continuing with Darwin, everyone's heard about the evolution debate between T.H. Huxley and Samuel Wilberforce; this was the dozenth time I'd seen Huxley's contemptuous reply to Wilberforce's question about whether he claimed descent from a monkey though his grandmother or his grandfather. But I'd never before read that Lady Brewster fainted, or that one of Darwin's Beagle colleagues wandered through the crowd, holding a Bible aloft and shouting ""the Book, the Book!"" Similarly, everyone tells you that Newton only published the Principia after Halley persuaded him to do it. But I hadn't heard that Newton intentionally made it as difficult as possible to read because he didn't want amateurs bothering him, or that Halley's reward was to be told by the Royal Society that since they could no longer afford to pay his salary in pounds sterling, he would instead be given remaindered copies of The History of Fishes. And there were numerous other stories I'd never seen at all. If you don't find plenty here to amuse and instruct, you're either encyclopedically well-read in all branches of science or you have no interest in it whatsoever.",138,0.9884,0.053,0.804,0.144,0.5878968253968254,NEGATIVE,0.6817
8,1143714298,12/27/2014,4.0,"A Short History of Nearly Everything is Bill Bryson's summation of life, the universe, and everything, a nice little easy-reading science book containing an overview of things every earthling should be aware of.As I've repeatedly mentioned over the years, every time one of the casual-readers tells me I have to read something, like Harry Potter or the DaVinci Code, I dig my feet in deeper and resolve to never read it. This is one of the occasions I should have shaved a decade off of my stubbornness and caved in right away.Bryson covers a wide range of topics, from the formation of the universe to the evolution of man for our apelike forebears, and all points in between. Atoms? Cells? These are just stops along the enlightenment highway that Bill Bryson has paved! He touches upon quantum physics, geology, the size of our solar system, the year without a summer, and other topics innumerable.The writing style is so accessible that I have to think I'd be some kind of scientists if my high school and college text books were written by Bill Bryson. His easy, breezy style makes even the most complicated topics easier to digest.It's not often that I come away from a book having felt like I learned something new, criminal techniques from my usual reads excepted.

9,7620310,10/12/2007,5.0,"This is one of the most enjoyable books I have ever read. There, I said itBryson's book combines the best qualities of science writers like Attenborough, Diamond, Durrell, and Wilson; presenting the information with the wit he is most known for. It is an amazing achievement to condense the entire base of human scientific knowledge into 478 pages, but Bryson has done it. I completely agree with Tim Flannery, who writes on the jacket that ""all schools would be better places if it were the core science reader on the curriculum."" I certainly would have gained much if I had read it when I was 15.This is one of the few books that has truly challenged what I had previously held to be conventional wisdom (at least in my own mind). Two main changes have come about: 1. I had always been jealous of the ""true"" zoologists, such as Audubon and Darwin, who were around when the world was as yet unexplored, and discovering a species was as simple as being the first to walk into a patch of forest. I left science because the idea of being tied to a sterile lab held no interest for me. However, after reading Bryson's vignettes of early scientific/zoological exploration (much of which was both comic and tragic), I realize that those days weren't quite as idyllic as I had imagined. 2. Bryson does a ""good"" job of scaring the hell out of you by showing just how precarious our daily existence really is. I probably shouldn't say this, but it puts such problems as global climate change into context when you read how an eruption of the supervolcano beneath Yellowstone National Park would wipe out most of the life on earth in a painfully slow manner; especially when Bryson describes how this eruption is overdue by 30, 000 years by historical average.Combined with those two new impressions, I am left with the following conclusions, and a slightly rearranged outlook on life.First off, it is clear that science benefits from a large degree of serendipity. We as a species/civilization have been lucky to have some truly great minds working on deciphering the way our world works. Some of these are household names [Newton, Halley, Einstein], some are not [Henry Cavendish, Rosalind Franklin]. However, as with everything that us humans put our hands on, this endeavor wasn't perfect. Egregious mistakes, pathological lying, childlike rivalries and tantrums - they all occurred. On balance, whether they helped or hurt the effort isn't clear. But what is clear is that our present level of understanding was by no means assured.Secondly, the fact that life is so tenuous makes one a little more philosophical. Since I've finished the chapter about Yellowstone and similar catastrophic threats, I find myself asking ""what if today is the day?"" It can be rough when you get on the bus at the end of a particularly annoying workday, when the disagreements were petty and you didn't get much done, and think ""is that what I did on the last day of my life?""Thankfully, that attitude only lasted for a short while, until I was able to reframe it in a more productive way. Now I tell myself not to worry about big problems that might happen in the future, because I know that we will be hit by a meteor, we will experience a supervolcano eruption. It's best to just enjoy every day, doing what you really know to be what it is that you want to do. Does that mean that I won't recycle anymore, that I will leave the tap running while I brush my teeth? No! Because doing things to reduce my impact makes me feel good, that I'm thinking about society's needs - not just my own. It's what I want to do.So, in an incredible way (that even Bill Bryson probably didn't predict) this book can really change your life.",98,0.9247,0.099,0.779,0.122,0.4318761595547308,POSITIVE,0.9996
10,1921362676,02/27/2017,5.0,"I was never any good at science. At the grammar school I attended we were shepherded into laboratories for lessons on physics, chemistry and biology. These were scary places; I’d never been anywhere like this before. The physics lab had gas taps and Bunsen burners and the walls were filled with incomprehensible charts. The chemistry lab held rows of specimen jars, more gas taps and burners and an underlying smell of something unpleasant and vaguely dangerous. The biology lab displayed pictures and diagrams of human body parts and there were constant rumours of creature dissections and other nasty things to come. Beyond the physical fears it was clear that each subject had its own language. I was fluent in none of them. I ceased study on all of these subjects at the earliest opportunity.But I left school feeling that I’d missed out on part of my core education. And I had. So I’d had my eye on this book for some time. I’ve long been a fan of Bryson’s insightful yet amusing take on the world. Surely his commentary of all things scientific couldn’t be too painful, could it? The book walks through just about every significant scientific discovery from the creation of the universe to the present day. Well, not quite the present day, given this book was published some fourteen years ago. But given the universe is currently thought to be some 13.7 billion years old, I’m comfortable it covers the mother lode.The list of sciences included is exhaustive, I spotted whole bunch but I’m also convinced I missed a few. My list comprises:AnthropologyAstronomyBotanyCosmologyChemistryEcologyGeologyHuman BiologyMeteorologyOceanographyPhysicsZoologyIt’s fascinating stuff – staggering, in fact. I’d heard of the Big Bang theory, of course, but I’d never delved into the detail of it. The explanation here is clear and concise - it’s still mind bending, but I was able to follow most of the explanation. There were some sections where the detail did become a little heavy – the account of plant life being categorised lumbered on interminably – but on the whole the pacing felt spot on. It’s also very well structured, with relevant topics being grouped together. It flowed well and told a compelling story.As I worked my way through this book, the thought that kept leaping to the fore was that these brilliant theories and discoveries came about largely as a result of scientists and non-scientists working something out via observation, association and calculation – the kicker being that nearly all of these milestone events predate computers, email and the internet. It’s incredible. In one example twenty years was spent on a calculation using pencil, paper and a slide rule. The same calculation could now be completed using a computer in a single day. Yes, because of its publication date there are a few recent finds that aren’t included - confirmation of the existence of the Higgs boson particle in 2012 is one example – but I really don’t think it missed out too much of any significance. For anyone looking for a comprehensive but easy to follow history of scientific discovery, from the very beginning, look no further. I can’t recommend this book highly enough.",93,0.9835,0.05,0.847,0.103,0.4961346266901821,POSITIVE,0.8536

I am flabbergasted that this has such consistently high reviews...Three problems with this tripe: 1. falsity of the science (most blatantly around cosmology, but not limited to any one field) and misunderstanding of scientific principles;2. a focus more on ""biography"" rather than on real ""history"";3. trivial worthlessness of the information.Number 1 is briefly chronicled below. Within just the first 20 pages or so, there are ridiculous factual errors and misrepresentations of scientific knowledge. Even in 2003 when the book was published, these errors would have been unforgivable. Where the bloody hell were the editors?! Apparently the author came out later to mention his ""lack of scientific chops,"" or the like. How can a book about the history of science fuck up the science?!Number 2 is just downright sad. Apparently the author felt that if he could spend about a page per scientist, he would make the material more interesting. No, man, I want science and history, not abbreviated and hackneyed biography. He doesn't even move smoothly between people... it's just a meandering of random scientific endeavors, somewhat brought into chronology.Number 3 is a difficult criticism, because with this kind of book, it is hard to get away from misc. trivia. And I'll even acknowledge that I learned a lot of trivia... and that the book does a great job of showing us just how much we don't know. But as I reached page 360 and realized (for the fifth or so time) that this was info that I could get in a quick google search, I just couldn't do it anymore. What a gods awful waste. What's more disappointing than the book though, is the overwhelming praise the book has gotten. I don't even want to sell this book back, but throw it away (and I thought I would never say something like that)!

Max Planck (1858-1947) was a German theoretical physicist whose work on quantum theory won him the Nobel Prize in physics in 1918. Max Planck had to deal with many tragedies in his life. His beloved first wife, Marie, died at a young age in 1909, probably from TBC. They had four children (with his second wife Magda he had a fifth child Hermann). During the first world war, his son Erwin was taken prisoner by the French in 1914, while his other son Karl was killed in action at Verdun. His daughter Grete died in 1917 while giving birth to her first child, and two years later her twin sister Emma died the same way, after having married Grete's widower. In February 1944 his home in Berlin was completely destroyed by an air raid, annihilating all his scientific records and correspondence. In 1945, Erwin was sentenced to death by the Nazi Volksgerichtshof and executed, because of his participation in the failed attempt to assassinate Hitler in july 1944. His death destroyed much of Max Planck's will to live.Tragic2. Doctor Thomas Midgley Jr. (1889 – 1944) was an American mechanical engineer and chemist. He was a key figure in a team of chemists that developed the lead additive to gasoline (TEL) as well as some of the first CFCs. His work led to the release of large quantities of lead into the atmosphere as a result of the large-scale combustion of leaded gasoline all over the world. Thomas Midgley Jr. died three decades before the ozone-depleting and greenhouse gas effects of CFCs in the atmosphere became widely known. Bill Bryson remarked that Midgley possessed ""an instinct for the regrettable that was almost uncanny"". In 1940, at the age of 51, Midgley contracted poliomyelitis, which left him severely disabled. This led him to devise an elaborate system of strings and pulleys to help others lift him from bed. This system was the eventual cause of his own death when he was entangled in the ropes of this device and died of strangulation at the age of 55. Horrible3. Gideon Mantell (1790 – 1852) was an English obstetrician, geologist and paleontologist. He and his wife discovered several large teeth of an Iguanodon in 1822, but they were dismissed as belonging to a fish or mammal or rhinoceros, by other scientist. Mantell was mocked by his peers, and especially sir Richard Owen (the coiner of the word ""dinosaur"") made his life a hell. Mantell became financially destitute and his wife left him in 1839. His son emigrated to New Zealand that same year, and his daughter died in 1840. In 1841 Mantell was the victim of a terrible carriage accident in London. Somehow he fell from his seat, became entangled in the reins and was dragged across the ground. Mantell suffered a debilitating spinal injury. He became bent, crippled and in constant pain. Richard Owen took advantage from this and tried to ruin Mantell's reputation as an important contributor to the science of paleontology. In fact, Owen even transferred claim of a number of discoveries from Mantell to himself. Mantell could no longer bear the pain of his spine and the burden of Owen’s hatred and on 10 November 1852, Mantell took an overdose of opium and later lapsed into a coma. He died that afternoon. An anonymous obituary appeared shortly afterwards in the Literary Gazette, which denigrated Mantell’s achievements and claimed his scientific work was no more than mediocre at best – although anonymous, the style of the obituary quickly identified it as coming from Owen’s pen. Then, as a final act of indignity, Owen had a section of Mantell's spine removed and displayed his pickled spine in a jar in his museum. Dreadful4. Alfred Wegener (1880-1930) was a German polar reseacher, geophysicist and meteorologist. Today he is most remembered as the originator of the theory of continental drift by hypothesizing in 1912 that the continents are slowly drifting around the Earth. Wegener's fourth and last Greenland expedition was in 1930. The 14 participants under his leadership were to establish three permanent stations from which the thickness of the Greenland ice sheet could be measured and year-round Arctic weather observations made. Success depended on enough provisions being transferred from West camp to Eismitte (""mid-ice"") for two men to winter there, and this was a factor in the decision that led to his death. On 24 September, although the route markers were by now largely buried under snow, Wegener set out with thirteen Greenlanders and his meteorologist Fritz Loewe to supply the camp by dog sled. During the journey, the temperature reached −60 °C (−76 °F) and Loewe's toes became so frostbitten they had to be amputated with a penknife without anesthetic. Twelve of the Greenlanders returned to West camp. On 19 October the remaining three members of the expedition reached Eismitte. There being only enough supplies for three at Eismitte, Wegener and Rasmus Villumsen took two dog sleds and made for West camp. They took no food for the dogs and killed them one by one to feed the rest until they could run only one sled. While Villumsen rode the sled, Wegener had to use skis, but they never reached the camp: Wegener died and Villumsen was never seen again. Wegener died probably of a heart attack (Bill Bryson wrote he froze to death). Villumsen buried Wegener’s body in the snow and marked the grave with skis. Villumsen then resumed his journey, but did not complete it. His body was never found. In May 1931, after a search, Kurt Wegener discovered his brother’s grave. He and other expedition members built a pyramid-shaped mausoleum in the ice and snow, and Alfred Wegener’s body was laid to rest in it. The mausoleum has now, with the passing of time, been buried under Greenland’s ice and snow.Terrible5. Edwin Hubble (1889-1953) was an American astronomer who is known for playing a vital role in the development of extragalactic astronomy. What became of Edwin Hubble after his death at his home on the 28th of September 1953, is a mystery. The whereabouts of his body were known only to his widow. It is not known whether he was buried or cremated or where his remains now lie. This secret his widow took to her own grave. His wife who adored him, devoted years of her life to writing an almost mythical account of her husband's life, much of which is evidently false.Creepy9/10",54,-0.9994,0.152,0.796,0.052,0.3837696239503468,POSITIVE,0.9953
16,3334189470,07/27/2020,4.0,"What I appreciated most about this book is that it recognizes the lesser-known pioneers of our time. To be more precise, the book in large part, introduces and acknowledges some of the barely known Western scientists (along with the famous ones) that researched, discovered, and in part laid out the foundation for modern astronomy, geology, paleontology, chemistry, physics, biology, but never received the deserved recognition!The author answers the questions, how and with whom, we arrived at the scientific knowledge we know today, and what those results are. The book very briefly discusses the evolution of the cosmos and our planetary system and in more details the evolution of planet Earth and its living organisms. We also see that the field of science, like in any other field of profession, is full of greed, deceit, and bitterness.As far as the title and content of the book is concerned, I have my remarks. The book is called A Short History of Nearly Everything and it only covers science and scientists. Not what I expected.Also, not introducing and discussing, in a history of science book, the Mesopotamian, ancient Egyptians and Greeks, Mesoamerican civilization, the Islamic Golden Age period, and others, deprives the reader from seeing and grasping the whole picture of the chronological development of the study of the physical and natural world. Lastly, all the short stories revolve around Western European and North American scientists. Which I personally love and appreciate. For example, as far as Asia is concerned, the author dedicated space within the book to inform us that Tokyo could be expecting a devastating earthquake, and the Asian shark finning cruel practice brings in their restaurants up to $100+ per bowl of shark fin soup. But, no mention of Asian scientists, and their achievements.Therefore, in general the content of the book can be viewed as US-Eurocentric, which in return presents the reader with a short-sighted view of the history of science, all wrapped up in an ambiguous title.Not to end on a negative note, Bryson is an enjoyable storyteller and the many short stories, along with the science lessons, nicely flow together. Bryson is not a scientist, but he did a fine job.(3.5/5)",55,-0.5093,0.083,0.837,0.08,0.4374107142857143,NEGATIVE,0.9984

20,99160686,04/19/2010,5.0,"First off, this is a huge departure from Bryson's breezy, excellent travel logs. Secondly, this book should be read with some frequency. It is so densely packed with valuable insight, and sound bites of discovery that you could not possibly absorb it all with one pass. This is my second time reading it and I plan on doing it again next year. The organizational structure is a wonderful series of loosely connected cameos covering several essential and enlightened discoveries of man. As an added bonus, the book actually attempts to pay off on the cheeky title. Bryson's light, common man’s writing style “scats” from universal, to global, to biological with a loosely constructed cause and effect outline. His books (thankfully, including this one) are all peppered with wit and charm and a heavy snatch of sarcasm. Further and maybe more importantly, he has the good sense to skip over heavy deep dives into mathematics, theories or anything at an ivy graduate level. I love this guy. I feel like he wrote this book for me and I hope he writes 10 more just like this. 10/4/07I abhor cliches, but in honor of Bryson's incredible achievement I'll indulge in one. I might very well choose ""A Short History"" as the ONE book I'd choose over all others ...if ...I was stranded on the proverbial desert island. Bryson has created a true encyclopedic kaleidoscope.

21,104887037,05/30/2010,5.0,"This is an immensely readable book with a truly monumental amount of information. While reading it, one might wish to remember all its content, but it's written in a way allowing the reader to pick up the volume and start reading at any point, according to his interests, though Bryson relays all subjects in captivating and available way, with a big dose of humor.This is a weighty book - 600 pages - but Bryson's not joking. He really tries to cover everything, from the beginning of the universe and the nature of our solar system and planet, through biological evolution of our species and the effects of us being here, both on nature and other creatures. Needless to say, he does an extremely good job of captivating the reader's attention from the first page and has no difficulty laying out complex concepts in a way that every reader will understand. Also, aside from all the facts, the book is also full of trivia and anecdotes about the experiments and the scientists who performed them. In the introduction, Bryson recalls his childhood and remembers how he was fascinated by the image of a cross-section of our planet, but at the same time put down by the nature of the book that contained it. The dry presentation of the facts, that were accompanied only by a set of exercies to test the gained knowledge, puzzled him. How did these people know how our planet looks from the inside? And who exactly were they?In his book, he accomplishes an important thing, one of the most important things - he presents the data while at the same time never letting go of the terribly exciting feeling of discovery, and presenting information about the discoverers themselves. It's obvious that he did a lot of research, but it's also obvious that these things fascinated him, and he grabs the reader's hand and runs headlong into the unexplored. And it is a world full of wonders.If schoolteachers shared Bryson's joy and flair we might have ended up with a whole lot more of biologists, physicists, chemists and geologists.

In high school, I had to work harder in my biology and chemistry classes, whereas English, history and social studies always came more easily to me.Bill Bryson's ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"" is a good overview of all the science classes I didn't take (or don't remember) in college. It's like Intro to Physics, Chemistry, Geology and Astronomy all in one wonderfully droll book. Since I read very few books about science, this was an enjoyable departure for me.Here is how the book begins: ""Welcome. And congratulations. I am delighted that you could make it. Getting here wasn't easy, I know. In fact, I suspect it was a little tougher than you realize. To begin with, for you to be here now trillions of drifting atoms had somehow to assemble in an intricate and curiously obliging manner to create you. It's an arrangement so specialized and particular that it has never been tried before and will only exist this once. For the next many years (we hope) these tiny particles will uncomplainingly engage in all the billions of deft, co-operative efforts necessary to keep you intact and let you experience this supremely agreeable but generally under-appreciated state known as existence.""Some of my favorite sections were about the Big Bang, the debate about the age of the universe, plate tectonics, Darwin's research, and the extinction of different species. After sharing various stories of how humans have killed off who-knows-how-many species, Bryson interjects: ""I mention all this to make the point that if you were designing an organism to look after life in our lonely cosmos, to monitor where it is going and keep a record of where it has been, you wouldn't choose human beings for the job."" Sadly true, but also worth a HA!I listened to this on CD read by the author, and if you've been following my reviews for a while, you'll know that I have a brain crush on Bryson and his narration. Seriously, I wish I could invite him over for tea and scones and just listen to him read all afternoon. (Bryson is from my home state of Iowa, but he's lived in England for so long that he's adopted a charming accent. It's adorable.) I was also able to look through a copy of the special illustrated edition, which includes dozens of photographs and prints. If you can find it, I highly recommend reading the illustrated edition.""A Short History"" was first published in 2003, and at the time, it was a big change from Bryson's previous travelogues. Since then, Bryson seems to have abandoned travel books and has been writing on different topics in history, such as the wonderful ""At Home"", ""Shakespeare"" and ""One Summer: America 1927."" While I enjoy his wry, humorous takes on history, I do miss his travel writing. If you're reading this, Bryson, please, take a trip somewhere. Have an adventure.

24,2557610734,11/05/2018,3.0,"“…Inevitably owe at least as much to supposition as to science.”“A Short History of Nearly Everything” is in a word fascinating…mostly. I found this text the most interesting when Bill Bryson turned his attention to the personalities in the science world as opposed to lots of the science itself. He is more comfortable writing on that human angle subject and it shows.For a book that deals with nonfiction (in as much as science is fact, this text makes clear that much science is really nothing more than conjecture) one section that will keep you on the edge of your seat is Part IV, called “Dangerous Planet”. Do not read it before bed, you will have bad dreams. It’s all about the cataclysmic ways the Earth can create (this is not induced by humans, just natural cycles) another extinction level event. At one point the text says about the planet, “For all the instability, it’s mostly remarkably and amazingly tranquil.” Understatement!Although Mr. Bryson appropriately does not explore or accept or reject the idea of a Creator (that is not the realm of science anyway) and after reading this book the myriad of improbable, impossible and /or unexplainable intricacies of the universe, nature on earth and life itself have only deepened my belief in a Creator who put all these processes in motion. As this quote from page 172 says, “We live in a universe whose age we can’t quite compute, surrounded by stars whose distances we don’t altogether know, filled with matter we can’t identify, operating in conformance with physical laws whose properties we don’t truly understand.” There is still so much (most things actually) that science cannot even begin to understand, but too often it is presented as fact. I am irritated that when I was in school it was presented in this infallible (and intellectually dishonest) manner. Bill Bryson mostly avoids that arrogance. This quote appears in some form continuously throughout the text, “In short, we don’t quite know where we came from.” If this book makes one thing abundantly clear, it is that science knows very little, and can prove nothing about the origins of anything! That astounds me! The quote I used as the title for this review is the recurrent theme of this text. As one scientist in the text states. “You can trust the studies well enough, generally speaking. What you can’t trust are the sweeping conclusion that people often attach to them.”Overall, I liked “A Short History of Nearly Everything”; some parts of it are immensely readable. Science and a bit of history thrown in is always interesting. However, by the last 100 pages or so I was more than ready for the book to be finished. I read it; I was intrigued, learned a lot.

26,2319501754,03/07/2018,5.0,"If instead of the eyelids down the corners, the mouth go up, the non-fiction book rocksPlease note that I put the original German text at the end of this review. Just if you might be interested.Being able to portray the most bone-drenched topics with so much humor, wit and charm is a masterpiece and testifies to the talent of the actual travel writer with satirical potential.As the title says, you get an excursion across world and science history delivered, which seeks in this form unparalleled and puts the emphasis on the scientific disciplines. One has heard everything before or even an approximate idea in the back of the head, only surprisingly by the well visualizable representations, in this case, much more aspects stick than with, decorated with epochs changing pictograms, timetable diagram from the school lessons. Much of the readability is based on Bryson's successful effort to portray, in any somewhat theoretical and difficult to understand the area, closeness to, in the broadest sense, protagonists that would have been expected in this form and quality instead in fiction. Moreover, this is his special secret ingredient, which unfortunately is so infinitely challenging to produce. Undoubtedly many ingenious, but literary average scientists and potential non-fiction authors shy away from creating their work for this reason. Even in still unearthly earthly epics or purely theoretical explanations, Bryson manages to fill the object of contemplation with such a life that the possibilities of association and vividness arouse sympathy for flagellates, quanta and primordial soup.Also, the fun increases along with the evolution to the preliminary result of the quirky scientist. What ingenious people have to offer in terms of creative behavioral potential in addition to their actual talent, drives on average talented and socially unobtrusive contemporaries double blush in the face. Ordinary in thought and behavior rather than eccentric and brilliant, what injustice.Be it particular preferences, social anxiety, misanthropic tendencies, peculiar experimental arrangements or neurotic inclinations, geniuses were at all times outlandish contemporaries. Thus, the already given entertainment value potentates with the talent of the author and lead by the way by the essential points of the history of science. Theorems, theories, doctrines, anachronisms and paradigm shifts take hold, and the highlights include the clash of two equal opponents, in this case, scientists.To what soap-naughty malice people of the mind can be capable of being astonished at given the stereotype of the laboratory-wearing loner. Moreover, with what arguments, tactics and gambles its theses underpinned and in return competing explanations of their right to exist are removed, belongs to the everlasting byproducts of research. Where the current state of affairs does not seem as entertaining as the debates of bygone days, as one imagines in modern times. However, the current state of knowledge and the concomitant, at all times rock-solid certainty about its correctness and existence, will in future provide similar cheerfulness as the view into the supposedly primitive past.Just the fact that so many profoundly changing inventions were made purely by chance due to unexpected results of unintentional experiments illustrates the pool of knowledge in the face of the water planet of ignorance.The only shortcoming is the occasional misstatement of numbers. However, because quite a few scientific points and periods have shifted, reduced or increased remarkably, one can confidently turn a blind eye to this.Wenn statt den Augenlidern nach unten die Mundwinkel nach oben gehen, rockt das SachbuchMit so viel Witz, Esprit und Charme die knochentrockensten Themen darstellen zu können stellt eine Meisterleistung dar und zeugt vom Talent des eigentlichen Reiseschriftsteller mit satirischem Potential.Wie der Titel sagt bekommt man eine Exkursion quer durch Welt- und Wissenschaftsgeschichte geliefert, die in dieser Form seinesgleichen sucht und den Schwerpunkt auf die naturwissenschaftlichen Disziplinen legt. Man hat alles schon einmal gehört oder noch eine ungefähre Vorstellung im Hinterkopf, nur erstaunlicherweise bleiben durch die gut visualisierbaren Darstellungen in diesem Fall wesentlich mehr Aspekte haften als beim, mit nach Epochen wechselnden Piktogrammen geschmückten, Zeittafeldiagramm aus dem Schulunterricht. Ein großer Teil der Lesbarkeit fußt auf der erfolgreichen Bemühung Brysons, in jedem eigentlich noch so theoretischen und schwer verständlichen Bereich eine Nähe zu den, im weitesten Sinne, Protagonisten herzustellen, die man in dieser Form und Qualität eher in der Belletristik erwartet hätte. Und das ist seine spezielle geheime Zutat, die leider so unendlich schwer herzustellen ist und sicher viele geniale, aber literarisch durchschnittliche Wissenschaftler und potentielle Sachbuchautoren davor zurückschrecken lässt, ein eigenes Werk zu kreieren.Selbst in noch menschenleeren Erdepochen oder rein theoretischen Ausführungen gelingt es Bryson, den Gegenstand der Betrachtung derart mit Leben zu füllen, dass die Assoziationsmöglichkeiten und Anschaulichkeit regelrecht Sympathie wecken für Geißeltierchen, Quanten und Ursuppe.Und der Spaß steigert sich mitsamt der Evolution bis zum vorläufigen Endresultat des schrulligen Wissenschaftlers. Was geniale Menschen an verhaltenskreativen Potential zusätzlich zu ihrer eigentlichen Begabung zu bieten haben, treibt durchschnittlich talentierten und sozial unauffälligen Zeitgenossen doppelte Schamesröte ins Gesicht. Normal im Denken und Verhalten statt exzentrisch und brillant, welch Ungerechtigkeit.Seien es besondere Vorlieben, Sozialängste, misanthropische Tendenzen, eigentümliche Versuchsanordnungen oder neurotische Neigungen, Genies waren zu allen Zeiten eigentümliche Zeitgenossen. So potenziert sich der schon vorgegebene Unterhaltungswert mit dem Talent des Autors und führt so nebenbei durch die wesentlichsten Punkte der Wissenschaftsgeschichte. Theorien, Lehrmeinungen, Anachronismen und Paradigmenwechsel geben sich die Klinke in die Hand und zu den Höhepunkten gehören die Aufeinandertreffen zweier ebenbürtiger Gegner, in diesem Fall Wissenschaftler. Zu welch seifenopernhafter Bosheit Menschen des Geistes fähig sein können verblüfft angesichts des Stereotypes vom laborkitteltragenden Einzelgänger. Und mit welch Argumenten, Taktiken und Winkelzügen die eigenen Thesen untermauert und im Gegenzug konkurrierende Erklärungsansätze ihrer Existenzberechtigung enthoben werden, gehört zu den immerwährenden Nebenerscheinungen der Forschung. Wobei der aktuelle Stand der Dinge nicht so unterhaltsam anmutet wie die Debatten vergangener Tage, da man sich in modernen Zeiten wähnt. Aber der aktuelle Wissensstand und die damit einhergehende, zu allen Zeiten felsenfeste Gewissheit über dessen Richtigkeit und Bestand, werden in Zukunft für ähnliche Heiterkeit sorgen, wie der Blick in die vermeintlich primitive Vergangenheit. Gerade dass so viele, tiefgreifende Veränderungen mit sich bringende, Erfindungen rein zufällig aufgrund unerwarteter Ergebnisse von unbeabsichtigten Experimenten gemacht wurden, veranschaulicht den Tümpel der Erkenntnis angesichts des Wasserplanetens des Unwissens.Als einzigen Mangel kann man gelegentlich falsche Zahlenangaben anführen.

27,3976710261,06/01/2021,5.0,"There is something just fluid, melodic and soothing about how Bill Bryson covers the gamut of scientific disciplines in an chaste way. This is like a story that one would come to think nature crafted herself. In “A Short History of Nearly Everything” we slowly learn about chemistry, anthropology, botany, taxonomy, paleontology along with zoology, biology, and physics. Humor is added in the mix for retention and the quirkiness of a reverend named Evan having a knack to discern supernovas. Of the many regalements of historical figures and the idiosyncrasies of Sir Issac Newton like inserting a bodkin (needle) into his eyeball, one comes to learn that poisoning (self-induced) was involved as these symptoms could be commonly associated with Mercury poisoning. Chemists have a hard time at it, as they are surrounded by toxins and use poisons not always on themselves (but on those they know and claim to love). Another case is Madame Curie and the subsequently terminal effects of her research.  ""When the poet Paul Valery once asked Albert Einstein if he kept a notebook to record his ideas, Einstein looked at him with mild but genuine surprise. Oh, that's not necessary,"" he replied . It's so seldom I have one.""---Bill Bryson Surely one of the most indelible tales is that of Henry Cavendish. He was so averse to human interaction that he corresponded with his housekeeper via letter. Though he was awarded the Copley Medal and was indeed a most substantial Chemist/Physicist---regarded for his discovery of hydrogen and measuring the density of the earth. Those familiar to him, knew he disliked humans and naturally they were forbidden to speak, look or even touch him. Zwicky can attest to this modus operandi.Truly a delightful read. Erudite use of humor that paints a lucid picture instructing in a method opposite to the red hot iron poker way, and brings a soft, feathery method of erudition that is quite efficacious and preferred as a cooler teaching paradigm. Seems to be such a text of meritorious accord that it was awarded the Aventis Prize for Best General Science Book of the year. This book came highly recommended.

30,2028939941,12/23/2019,5.0,"This book is as much about discovery and good journalism as it is about science. The author, Bill Bryson, takes us through a history of science in the most personal way possible. Our starting point is his starting point: How exactly did we come to have the knowledge we have of the world around us?In addition to introducing us to the ideas that shape the way we see the world, the author also takes us into the adventure of science. He takes into the hardships and heartaches, the often petty, ego-driven personalities that move our knowledge forward. He takes us into the lives of great scientists both remembered and forgotten. He takes us into the messiness of the debates that have driven scientific conversations. He takes us out into the field where he interviews people working on scientific problems today. He takes us into the realm of the infinitely vast universe, into the infinitely small universe of atoms, into the ancient past, and gives us a sense of the science that may be yet to come. And in doing so, we get a sense of how precarious our own existence is and the miracle that we have become aware of so much of the universe around us. For this reason, I would recommend this book both to those who are looking for an interesting introduction to science and to those who are looking for a book that will help them marvel at their own existence.

An attempt to cram everything and the kitchen sink into a work intended for the general reader is surely a recipe for failure—or so one might think. Bryson marshals science, history, and philosophy to present a big-picture understanding of our universe from past to present. Extraneous details are filtered out, and mysteries left unexamined, yet it somehow feels complete. Not unlike a film editor who can cut down 24 hours of production material into a feature-length film, he manages to pack a world of wonder and insight into an accessible and entertaining, though relatively lengthy (544-page) tome. Bryson's preoccupation is less with the rote repetition of facts (though there is that, too) than with conveying just how it is we know what we know. He takes us behind the curtain for a more intimate look at the process of discovery and the strokes of genius essential to that process.Lengthy and mildly scatterbrained it might be, ASHONE is a pure literary delight. The author's excitement and enthusiasm for the subject matter drip from every page. The sheer joy he receives from learning little gems he missed in high school or being reintroduced to information forgotten long ago is intoxicating. He meets with a wonderful cast of men and women to highlight the personalities behind the stories of discovery. Lone geniuses are a rarity in any field, and science is no exception. Bryson scratches below the surface to meet the individuals who played prominent roles yet went unrecognized.In taking the long view, Bryson engages some of science's toughest questions. Everything from the Big Bang to man's (relatively terse) evolutionary past is presented here, with a nod to some of the more eminent and intriguing figures from each field. I particularly appreciated that after a concept was explained, he immediately followed up with the most obvious question in response. It really helps the lay reader navigate these complex topics.Bryson spends a good amount of time on natural disasters, describing the assorted ways they shaped the history of our planet. His frequently humorous analogies help you understand their sheer scale and the havoc left in their wake. Ice ages, earthquakes, supervolcanoes, and pandemics are each showcased in breathtaking detail in some of the most harrowing events on planetary record. Given all the chaos that has besieged our planet, it becomes soberingly clear by the book's end that we humans—or any life for that matter—are incredibly lucky to be here. In light of all that can go wrong and has gone wrong, it's remarkable there is any life left to comment on the tragedy and storied disarray. I commend Bryson for demonstrating how truly diminutive our time here on Earth is relative to the universe's imponderably vast history.Bryson should also be applauded for pointing out places where our inquiry has hit a brick wall or those areas that remain imperfectly understood. The fact that we have accumulated such vast storehouses of knowledge over the last few centuries does not mean there are no mysteries left to explore. Indeed, dozens of questions both big and small remain unanswered, and new discoveries have a tendency to open up several more. We can both be proud about what we have uncovered to date and humble about the many uncharted possibilities that surely await us.Fast and Loose with ScienceThere are a few caveats, however, with respect to some of the finer details. In one place he describes particles with ""spin"" as actually rotating about an axis (they are not). This erroneous conception of elementary particles dates back to the 1920s, when George Uhlenbeck and Samuel Goudsmit interpreted the motion of electrons as self-rotation around their own axis. A few years later, Paul Dirac pointed out that electrons could not be spinning according to the rules of orbital angular momentum because the rate at which their surface would have to be spinning (to produce the magnitude of the magnetic moment) would have to exceed the speed of light, which would violate the special theory of relativity.In another place Bryson says that quantum entanglement is a violation of relativity (it is not). Relativity tells us that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light, and this applies even to things with zero mass, such as information or other electromagnetic radiation. Entanglement says that measuring a particle in one place can instantly affect a particle somewhere else. However, this effect is constrained by the cosmic speed limit. On p. 42 of his book 
What Is Relativity?
, Jeffrey Bennett responds to this notion:""However, while laboratory experiments suggest that this instantaneous effect can really happen, current understanding of physics tells us that it cannot be used to transmit any useful information from one place to the other; indeed, if you were at the location of the first particle and wanted to confirm that the second had been affected, you'd need to receive a signal from its location, and that signal could not travel faster than light.""Bryson also claims that the production of black holes within particle accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider could destroy the world, when in fact, these microscopic black holes would disintegrate in nanoseconds thanks to Hawking radiation. On p. 154 of the same book, Bennett also debunks this largely media-driven fear:""Some physicists have indeed proposed scenarios in which such micro black holes could be produced in the Large Hadron Collider, but even if they are right, there's nothing to worry about. The reason is that while the LHC can generate particles from greater concentrations of energy than any other machine that humans have ever built, nature routinely makes such particles. Some of those particles must occasionally rain down on Earth, so if they were dangerous, we would have suffered the consequences long ago.In case you are wondering how a micro black hole could be ""safe,"" the most likely answer has to do with a process called Hawking radiation...Hawking showed that the laws of quantum physics imply that black holes can gradually ""evaporate"" in the sense of having their masses decrease, even while nothing ever escapes from within their event horizons. The rate of evaporation depends on a black hole's mass, with lower-mass black holes evaporating much more rapidly. The result is that while the evaporation rate would be negligible for black holes with star-like masses or greater, micro black holes would evaporate in a fraction of a second, long before they could do any damage.""He may have consulted with experts, but the manuscript could have benefited from additional fact-checking. That said, although the book was published in 2003, there is little that is out of date as of this writing—the confirmed interbreeding between Neanderthals and Denisovans being one notable discovery of late that adds greater texture to the stories recounted here. I also feel there could (and should) have been a greater emphasis on climate change; Bryson seemed to skirt over it whenever a related topic arose, and it's not clear whether this was intentional.Closing ThoughtsThe content in ASHONE is something I think everyone should know and be exposed to, and it's hard to imagine the material presented with greater alacrity than it is here. The passion and unbridled enthusiasm on display frequently approaches Sagan-esque proportions, in a style redolent of the signature series Cosmos, which is about the highest praise a work in this genre could hope to achieve. Though I found a few errors—and suspect the average grad student in one of a number of the subjects covered could spot a handful more—the book is nevertheless a praiseworthy stab at science writing for the layperson. Bryson set an ambitious task for himself and ultimately delivered a lively, accessible, and mostly scientifically faithful, albeit cursory, proem to the history of the universe as we know it today.“Even now as a species, we are almost preposterously vulnerable in the wild. Nearly every large animal you can care to name is stronger, faster and toothier than us. Faced with attack, modern humans have only two advantages. We have a good brain, with which we can devise strategies, and we have hands with which we can fling or brandish hurtful objects. We are the only creature that can harm at a distance. We can thus afford to be physically vulnerable.” (p. 447)Note: This review is republished from my official website.",24,0.995,0.051,0.858,0.09,0.4631668040464337,POSITIVE,0.9999

33,41257780,12/29/2008,5.0,"Third review, March 5, 2019.Has it really been nearly 9 years since I re-read this? No. But I guess it has. A Short History of Nearly Everything is one of those formative books that has stuck with me for a long, long time.I have little to add to this review. I thought I had lots to say, but re-reading my review from 2010 below … I already said it there. I was going to talk about Bryson’s repetitive phrasing, praise how he explains how much we don’t know, and remark on how good this book is at just … luxuriating in the knowledge we have.I will add that I think this book, by and large, holds up even 15 years on. Our scientific knowledge certainly has advanced since then. Some of the mysteries that Bryson mentions here have been solved—while others have deepened. Moreover, reading this now with a more critical eye than I did in 2010, I’ll acknowledge there’s a pinch of Western gaze going on here. At one point, in the last chapter, Bryson comments how it was such a shame that the Chinese were grinding up bones for medicines instead of studying the bones to learn more about our past. Hello, casual racism. It might seem like I’m nitpicking now, especially considering how Bryson wryly highlights the racism and sexism of our past, but that’s exactly why I don’t want to let him slide on something like that.That being said, for the most part this book remains just so damn energizing. It inspires me to think big, to think about and marvel at the incredible world we inhabit. I honestly haven’t craved any of Bryson’s other works—I liked one, didn’t like the other, and have a few more on my to-read list but can’t be bothered to jump on them. But there’s something about the way he writes about this stuff, about this history of science, that just works for me. If it doesn’t work for you, I get it, this book will be a bit plodding and boring. But if it works for you … oh, wow, will it ever work for you.Read Ben from 2010’s opinions to find out why!Second reading review, May 7, 2010.I cannot recommend this book enough. No word of hyperbole: this is a book that everyone should read. Bill Bryson takes the span of human existence and produced a popular history of science that's both accurate and moving. A Short History of Nearly Everything is a celebration of science, but it also evokes the sense of wonder about the universe that science makes available to us. And, almost inevitably, it underscores how much we still have yet to learn about our world.Throughout history, one of the common arguments against the expansion of science has been something to the effect of ""science removes the mystery"" of the universe. Well, yes, that's kind of the point. But what opponents to scientific investigation usually mean to say, explicitly or not, is that because we know more about the universe, somehow that makes the universe less wonderful. Somehow a universe of quarks and gluons is less romantic than a universe powered by God. Thus, the argument goes, we shouldn't get too serious about this science stuff—it's depressing.My response: Are you on crack?I have just as much trouble fathoming how opponents of science find science depressing and nihilistic as they have trouble fathoming how I find science awesome. It seems self-evident to me that science is wonderful, that it is truly the most appropriate vehicle we have for appreciating our existence. But maybe that's just me, and obviously it's not everyone. So what A Short History of Nearly Everything does is level the playing field, extend the olive branch, if you will. Just as this review isn't an anti-religion diatribe, A Short History barely mentions religion. It doesn't talk about Galileo's persecution by the Church or the rise of creationism and intelligent design in the United States. Bryson and his book are above that. They reaffirm a sentiment I already have, and one I hope you share, either prior to or after reading this book.Science is fucking awesome.Sure, one can't understand every scientific concept that one comes across. But that's to be expected. Wave-particle duality is tricky stuff. Just as anyone can become a good handyman with some common sense and little experience, anyone can learn a little bit about quantum mechanics—but if you want to build a quantum house, you'll need many years of experience under your belt.Even we amateurs, however, can appreciate how cool it is that, for example, our bodies are made of stardust. The heavier elements, of which we are mostly composed, were forged in the crucibles of supernovae light-years away. We're here because some star died for us, and all the atoms managed to travel to Planet Earth. We're here because the Sun pumps out photons that heat our atmosphere, so we don't freeze, and the ozone layer reflects some of the photons away, so we don't fry. Our existence is temporal and transitory and tentative. But we do exist. And regardless of one's stance toward religion, this simple fact is a miracle.So science can give us miracles too. What Bryson does is take bits and pieces of science, put them in a historical context, and show us the miracles they contain. The result is an appreciation and a better understanding of how the world works.This is a rather long book—my edition is over 400 pages—and I have to admit it took me a longer time to re-read it than I had anticipated. It's worth the time. Every section is informative and interesting. Although I have a soft spot for physics, the chapters on relativity and quantum mechanics aren't my favourite—perhaps because I've already learned about the concepts elsewhere, so it felt a little redundant. Instead, I really enjoyed reading about the rise of geology, chemistry, and taxonomy. From this book I've learned that fossilization is a risky business; there's way more species hiding everywhere on and underneath the planet than we'll probably ever find; and if I happen to still be alive in a few thousand years, I should probably get volcano insurance.Even while educating us, Bryson emphasizes how much we don't know. Sometimes the media likes to portray science or scientific theories as ""complete"" when they are anything but. Perhaps here is where that niggling nihilism starts to rear its head for some people, for Bryson makes it clear that with some things, we probably just can't know, at least not in a timely fashion. On the macroscopic level, once we get out to about the range of Pluto, the distances are so vast as to be almost insurmountable. On the microscopic level, Planck and Heisenberg ensured there would always be a little uncertainty. But I'm OK with that. Preserves the mystery, after all. And provides yet more challenges.Our ignorance also carries with it a sense of helplessness. We aren't very good at tracking near-Earth objects, for instance, which means if an asteroid does strike us sometime in the near future, we probably won't see it until it hits the atmosphere. Then it will be too late. And even if we did, we don't have the capability to destroy or divert it. Still, lifting the veil of ignorance on one's ignorance is essential to improving one's ability to think critically about science. Who knows: maybe A Short History will inspire some kid to go into astronomy or engineering and invent better asteroid detection equipment.The upshot of this—as Bryson likes to put it, because his writing style is peppered with repeated phrases like this—is that Bryson presents both the good and the bad of science. As much as science is wonderful, it's also a human enterprise, and we humans are notoriously fallible instruments. Scientists are not immune—indeed, practically prone—to taking credit for another person's work; Bryson is quick to interject anecdotes about the personalities, quirks, and flaws of the persons of interest in the book.On that note, I wish I kind of had some sort of fact-checking utility for this book. Of course there are references and a bibliography, and Bryson claims in the acknowledgements that various reputable experts have reviewed the material. As much as I love A Short History, however, it is popular science and prone to simplification. So take the anecdotal parts with a grain of salt—for example, contrary to what Bryson claims, NASA didn't destroy the plans for the Saturn V lander (the real problem is trying to find enough reliable vintage parts to construct the thing).Overall the quality of A Short History of Nearly Everything is just so brilliant that I can't condemn Bryson for his enthusiasm. And I still have several adjectives left, so I can also say that this book is fabulous and stupendous, and you should definitely buy a copy or hold up your local library until it produces one. And if you don't have a local library, you should construct a doomsday device and hold the Earth hostage until such an edifice is constructed in a town near you. Got it? Good.It's a book worth reading and a book worth remembering; A Short History of Nearly Everything is science and history wrapped in a nutshell of wonder.First review.I cannot recommend this book enough to people.Bill Bryson manages to convey a technically detailed history of the planet while maintaining a readable, comprehensible writing style. His tone is engaging, and his tales are captivating--I particularly enjoyed the discussions on physics and on the development of archaeology and the theory of evolution.A Short History of Nearly Everything is to books what Bill Nye the Science Guy is to television. This is a book for science lovers and a book for those who swore they'd never take a science class again. I'm a fairly intelligent person; I learned a lot from this book, but at the same time I was already at least acquainted with much of the material it presents. However, that did not stop me from having, ""whoa!"" moments throughout the book, moments of realization at how complex and wonderful our universe is--and how special it is that we, humans, can strive to understand such a phenomenon.

34,7648017,10/12/2007,3.0,"Don’t let the 3 star rating mislead you. This was an awesome book and I’m certain others will think more highly of it. It is a great introduction for those not into the biography of the universe and the history of science. However, if you watch the Science Channel, History Channel, PBS, etc., then you’ll already know much of what’s covered. It is the true ""Once upon a time. . ."" story. As someone with an interest in all things science, I was still impressed with the witty style of the writing and use of analogies to drive home various points. It’s a very entertaining listen and the narrator does an excellent job in reading it.The most salient point of the book for me was the human paradox of how we are changing the world through our presence but at the same time how precarious our existence on it is. A favorite quote from the book for me is, “All life is one, is one of the most profound true statements there is.” Think about this, for you to get where you are today, all of your ancestors had to survive long enough to find someone willing to pair up. Not an easy task surviving disease, war, or just being eaten. One break in the chain, one moment sooner or later in the conception process anywhere along the line and you don’t exist. It’s a miracle you’re here. And yet you are despite the odds against it. Just when you think you were meant to be here, you have to remember we could all be wiped out by a meteor strike at any moment.Humans have been apart of only 0.0001% of Earth’s history and yet we have been chosen. As the author states, “We are the least there is. We may be all there is. We are the living universe’s supreme achievement and its worst nightmare simultaneously.” One last quote to end with comes from Edward O. Wilson in his book,  The Diversity of Live, “One planet, one experiment.""",22,0.96,0.046,0.846,0.107,0.6216581632653062,POSITIVE,0.9997

No wonder, the study becomes repetitive and fails to ignite the passion in us to go further in time. Few of us dare to pursue the study of science. And those who take it, they do not because it interests them, but it promises to give a good job. Very few of us really study science because it amuses us.Bill Bryson blames this lack of interest in science to our school days, “It was as if [the textbook writer] wanted to keep the good stuff secret by making all of it soberly unfathomable.”Probably that was the reason why he came with such a wonderful rough guide to science ‘A Short History of Nearly Everything’. As if a chef decorating your plate with the sweetest creams carefully chosen from all parts of the world leaving you to wonder what to order more.The book takes you from the gargantuan stars to subatomic particles in a matter of few pages. The journey form 10 raised to the power of 100 to 10 degraded to the power of -100 takes less than a minute. Traversing haphazardly from Cosmos to Bacteria, from Big Bang to Genetics,the book leaves the reader open mouthed. The book covers almost all branches of science, Space, Earth, Environmental, Life, Chemistry and Physics introducing us to the pioneers of each field.One moment you will be lost in the cosmos. Next moment you will find yourself measuring the size of earth. You will burn in the fire below the earth’s surface before traveling backwards to the ice age. The book doesn’t claim to explain all. Neither it promises to elucidate the solved/unsolved mysteries. It just takes us in a time machine through all corners of world showing who is getting awestruck at that time by a sudden discovery of something unimaginable. Einstein, Newton, Hubble, Bohr, Avogadro, Planck, Maxwell, Darwin, Feynman. Along with their idiosyncrasies, it describes briefly the lives and wonders of the greatest personalities in the history of science in such fervour that you would gasp for more.Being a gifted travelogue writer, Bill Bryson describes each occurring in such adroitness that not a single chapter will bore you. For example – instead of the text-bookish – ‘a million years ago in the world came the first human being,’ he writes, ‘if you fly backwards traveling one year per second it takes you half an hour to reach Christ’s birth and three weeks to reach the start of human race.’Those who are in that mode of academics where they have to decide what to take up for their higher studies, should read this one and the path will be clear.Bill Bryson shares his delight with such passion that I am sure it will rejuvenate your interest in science.

The author touches on subjects ranging from astronomy, to physics, to geology, to anthropology, etc., and walks through how thought developed in each of those fields from at times as far back as the 1600s. The book is really a history book and not a science book so if you are looking to learn the hows and whys of subjects, this is not for you.

40,2329535901,03/29/2018,4.0,"This is a wonderful overview of, well, exactly what the title depicts!There is a degree of story-telling that Bryson utilises that makes the narrative smooth and easy to follow. In fact, the novel reminds me of those great teachers you may of had at school where they would be explaining the material they were supposed to be teaching you but would go off on a tangent about something else before looping back to the aforementioned topic. Bryson does this throughout the novel and combined with his narration and satire, it's all so entertaining!I love the primary conception of the novel: '...I was on a long flight across the Pacific, staring idly out the window at moonlit ocean, when it occurred to me with a certain uncomfortable forcefulness that I didn't know the first thing about the only planet I was ever going to live on.'If that statement hit you as hard as it hit me, I would strongly suggest reading this book. His own objective to write this book was to understand himself so do not fret if you are put off simply because you are not acquainted with scientific texts. At the end of the day, the prose considered in this book pretty much affects everyone. Just a basic understanding of atoms, weather, water dipolarity and glacier ice layers I think is a very minimal basis of scientific knowledge to be understood - and really, it's fascinating! I would definitely recommend this to someone who is studying or planning to study science at A Level/Level 3 to get a good basis for their further studies. I learnt while studying classics that authors (like Bronte and Austen) would utilise the tool of letters so that the reader could be exposed to another set of narrative for better plot development. Bryson is on the same journey as the reader - just a normal guy of next to no predisposition of scientific background simply enquiring about the basics. He uses small intervals where he repeats his inquisitive conversations with scientists and specialists in certain fields to explain certain matters that he would find too difficult. This just makes it feel you're on this big, long journey with Bryson and his guests as tour guides. I have a couple of criticisms though. At the beginning of the novel, there some beautiful drawings depicting a timeline of the Earth's history and even a little drawing of the Earth's layers in the introduction. However, there are plenty more verbal descriptions of pretty sublime and profound matters but no diagrams to aid them. Of course, you could just Google it and find something like what you're reading but a wider use of diagrams, pictures or drawings would supplement this novel perfectly and increase the understanding even further. Also, I found Bryson to be quite repetitive when there was no need which made it a little tiresome. However, this book is the best introduction to our planet that ever graced the modern book world (in my opinion and all those who recommended it to me).

Well, if like most people you find textbooks mind-numbingly dull or haven’t read a science book since high school, you probably would not do what Bill Bryson did. He has taken it upon himself to basically teach himself about these subjects, and then write an entire book in an approachable and humorous style that will keep you entertained and…wait for it…actually interested in science again. It’s an ambitious project and we should be very grateful for him making the effort.This book is a conversational primer on all the Big Topics:1) the origin of space, time, and universe (The Big Bang)2) the possibility of alien life in the universe and whether we will ever encounter it3) how all the big scientific discoveries occurred in history and who made them (turns out brilliant scientists are often eccentric, frequently secretive and paranoid, have petty rivalries, and even when they do reveal their findings, are generally derided or ignored)4) the origins of organic life, single and multi-celled5) the proliferation of animal and plant species6) the long process of developing sentience7) the very contentious debate over how primates eventually evolved into Neanderthals and Homo Erectus, and where this happened first - Africa or Asia.Separately, he also dives deep into the microscopic world, with a fascinating review of the basics of chemistry, subatomic particles, neutrons, quarks, etc. Much like Carl Sagan and Neil De Grasse Tyson, he is skilled at making big scientific concepts clearer, even if they remain extremely hypothetical and abstract, like quantum mechanics and string theory etc. This is all the more impressive as he is not a scientist like they are, and is best known for his whimsical travel books. I also discovered he had been chancellor at Durham University in England from 2005 to 2011, so he’s got a fascinating life path.Having been a lifelong reader of SF, I myself go through periods where I feel like I really need to know more about the origins of Life, The Universe, and Everything. In the past, this meant reading a number of books on quantum physics and evolution, such as:1) A Briefer History of Time and The Grand Design - Stephen Hawking2) A Universe from Nothing - Lawrence Krauss3) The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution - Richard Dawkins4) The Third Chimpanzee: The Evolution and Future of the Human Animal - Jared DiamondThis time, I’ve been inspired to tackle two books on quantum physics and String Theory that are notoriously difficult:1) The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory - Brian Greene2) Parallel Worlds: A Journey Through Creation, Higher Dimensions, and the Future of the Cosmos - Michio KakuWish me luck!",17,0.9952,0.022,0.839,0.139,0.4749190476190476,POSITIVE,0.9992

Having said that, since I've only started on audiobooks about 2-years back, perhaps it's not such a bad thing, because I believe with all my heart that I enjoyed this much more with the superb narration.Firstly, A Short History of Nearly Everything is a title which is ambitious by any measure. Really? Nearly everything? Bill Bryson sure did a nifty job at creating this riveting read which I can describe alternately, though not perfectly, as 'A layman's summary of leading scientific thoughts, discoveries and events that shaped our understanding of the planet Earth as well as the life which resides therein.' And the truth is that even now, we are still pretty far from truly understanding or knowing very much. Bryson's writing style can be described as eloquently delightful. A topic such as this can easily be dry in its rendition, instead Bryson has injected an insouciant dry sense of humour therein. He also has a way of putting together the most amusing or incredibly apt yet elegant descriptions. An example which I loved was how he described a person who was tall, thin and not very nice as 'a lanky assemblage of shortcomings.'The audio narration was delivered with such deadpan flair that combined with the author's style it made for many hours of great entertainment. I've caught myself laughing aloud so many times that passersby must have thought me a bit mad. I particularly appreciated the real life analogies that helped to explain scientific measurements which were either infinitesimally too small or too large for the every day person to comprehend. The flow of the narrative from one scientific branch to another was almost seamless and it was written in a manner that actually makes the title of the book relevant. In short, this book was both enlightening and enjoyable. I highly recommend this to anyone who has even a little interest in science.",20,0.9964,0.025,0.767,0.208,0.6094449531949533,POSITIVE,0.9998

47,252130428,12/28/2011,5.0,"A sign that a book is really, really, really gripping you is when you find yourself talking to people about it. And by ‘talking to people about it’, I don’t just mean recommending that they read it, but actually spouting out things you’ve read in its pages, developing arguments from what you’ve learnt and generally just crow-barring whole tracts of knowledge into conversations which, left to their own devices, would have happily meandered elsewhere.Such a book is Bill Bryson’s ‘A Short History of Everything’.For the last week or so I’ve been reading it I’ve felt a little like E.L.Wisty, talking in Peter Cook’s boring, nasal voice about this marvellous book I’ve read and how it contains all these interesting facts.This is a book which tries, and for the most part succeeds, in making very complex areas of science meaningful to a layman such as I. So we have the creation of the universe, the vastness of space, the dawn of life, the changing environments of our planet, the development of life, various extinctions and the complex evolution of man. It’s incredibly illuminating stuff, an array of complex theories broken down and put into reach of those of us who don’t have PHDs (although I’m only slightly more au fait with quantum physics than I was before I started reading that section – but then there are quantum physicists who freely admit they don’t properly understand it.) Bryson grabs the attention by turning it almost into a history lesson of discoveries , so we have thumbnail sketches of Darwin, Halley, Einstein and other great pioneers – many of whom I’d never heard of. That combined with Bryson’s eye for the outstandingly curious, then this ends up as constantly amusing and astounding read.Now if you’ll excuse me I’m off to bother some passers-by, I’m in possession of some facts that they might find very interesting.",15,0.988,0.04,0.816,0.144,0.5456231231231232,POSITIVE,0.9922

To be honest, I enjoyed the asides on the scientists more than the science itself, but that didn't stop me enjoying reading all the bits about the Big Bang, early life forms and quarks. It also gave me an understanding of how random and unpredictable life really is, and how little mutations can lead to massive changes. Impressive stuff.

54,3460409344,07/24/2020,5.0,"Bill Bryson is a versatile and engaging writer with a knack for introducing humor into even the driest of topics. His work A Short History of Nearly Everything is a perfect example of this. In this book, which I listened to over the course of a whole month (mainly when I was out running), he tackled the scientific history of - well quite a lot of stuff or as he put it - nearly everything. Of course that's not possible but he really did cover so many topics and he made them not only interesting but comprehensible to me in a way no other text book or science teacher has managed to do previously. As a layperson who invested three years of his life gathering information, researching and compiling this book, it was obvious he was acutely aware of the potential for the content to be out of the grasp of a non-scientific reader. So not only did he make it completely readable but entertaining too. I loved the way he would throw a fact out there - one that could so easily be ignored - and then made it relevant. There's too many examples to quote them all but he managed to put things clearly into perspective. For example something that was described as being 190 kilometre's deep at first mention sounded significant but he'd put it into context by explaining that if the earth was reduced to the size of a standard globe of the world, the 190km would only be as thick as one or two layers of lacquer. Time and again he'd bring the reader (listener) into focus with reality checks like these which - for me at least - would cause an ahhaa or oh wow type response. Regardless of whether unveiling facts about the Big Bang theory, the periodic table of elements, planets, proteins, paleontology, genetics, evolution and the history of the human race or any of the multitude of other topics discussed my mind was regularly awestruck. Just as regularly he tickled my funny bone and I'd have a bit of a chuckle to myself (at the risk of looking like a bit of a loony running and laughing to myself). This book is one of the few I could share with my partner as he too was enlightened and engaged by the content. A couple of times we'd pluck a random chapter to listen to on a lengthy drive and it would hold us both captivated. I can see myself doing this again and again over time.

I had no idea there were so many competing theories.All in all, for the right reader, I can see why this book is beloved. It delivers on the promise of its title.

In this work, he attempted to cover the history of all science (cosmology, physics, geology, chemistry, oceanography, paleontology, biology, etc.) He takes an especially anglo-centric view, including stories of many British scientists and scientific societies. One of his principal information resources was Richard Fortey, of the University of Cambridge and the Natural History Museum in London, who he quotes directly. A significant amount of the material in this book can also be found in Fortey’s Life: A Natural History of the First Four Billion Years of Life on Earth.I learned almost no actual science by listening to this, as it is at a very introductory level. However, many of the personal anecdotes of scientists, and the identities of some lesser-known British researchers were new to me. Unfortunately, beyond just giving an introductory perspective, he glosses over inflationary cosmology to the point of inaccuracy.

As humans, we are mere increments—each of us a musty archive of adjustments, adaptations, modifications, and providential tinkerings stretching back 3.8 billion years. Remarkably, we are even quite closely related to fruit and vegetables. About half the chemical functions that take place in a banana are fundamentally the same as the chemical functions that take place in you.  It cannot be said too often: all life is one. That is, and I suspect will forever prove to be, the most profound true statement there is.If this book has a lesson, it is that we are awfully lucky to be here—and by “we” I mean every living thing. To attain any kind of life in this universe of ours appears to be quite an achievement. As humans we are doubly lucky, of course: We enjoy not only the privilege of existence but also the singular ability to appreciate it and even, in a multitude of ways, to make it better. It is a talent we have only barely begun to grasp.  We have arrived at this position of eminence in a stunningly short time. Behaviorally modern human beings—that is, people who can speak and make art and organize complex activities—have existed for only about 0.0001 percent of Earth’s history. But surviving for even that little while has required a nearly endless string of good fortune.  We really are at the beginning of it all. The trick, of course, is to make sure we never find the end.

But it is informative (and extensively researched), engaging, entertaining, humorous, and awe-inspiring, all at once as Bryson takes us through the universe as it began to what it is today—from much of what lies out there in the skies (that we know of) to our own planet, and what lies on its surface and in its depths (not just its topography and features but also life, plant and animal, fungi and insects, and many others that live or have lived on its land and in its waters). And all of this is explored through the contributions of various scholars and scientists, professionals and amateurs highlighting human intelligence on the one hand, and on the other, perhaps what might be our obstinacy and unwillingness to catch on to new ideas when first proposed or findings when first reached, and far worse, our tendency to mindlessly destroy our planet and only realise what it is we are doing when or just before it is too late. It was interesting to see that not only is the universe a mysterious place, but a lot about our own home—the Earth—remains so too as does life itself, of which we have a rather limited understanding (not only how it came about but also in what forms it may take, what is needed for it to exist, and how much of it (and of how many kinds) there might possibly be on the planet even now). I hadn’t realised that our (human) ancestors had walked this earth for quite as long and quite so long ago as they had. One comes away from the book with feelings of wonder, awe, and curiosity (plus a lot of anger at our own kind for the senseless destruction they have caused and are causing—something I had read in one of Crichton’s(?) books, a character who wonders whether humans are here simply to destroy all there is, kept coming to mind) but most of all, with the satisfaction and pleasure of having read a thoroughly good read.",7,0.867,0.081,0.809,0.11,0.5796758166076347,POSITIVE,0.9999

As a lover of history, a student of history and an avid reader of historical non-fiction I have a strong preference for information taking precedent over the history of the people who discovered that information. Seriously, I couldn't care less about the first five Brits who tried to make a go of it discovering dinosaur bones - just tell me about the damn bones. Bill Bryson doesn't so much write ""about"" science as he writes ""around"" it. I've never read a book about science with... so little science. A more appropriate title for this book would have been ""A Long Winded and Tedious History of Mostly Apocryphal Stories About Great Scientists."" But perhaps that was too long to fit onto the cover? Bryson packs more information about these scientists' love lives and professional squabbles into the book than he does anything of educational value. It is clear that an immense amount of research went into this; it is also clear that not nearly enough thought was given to communicating the themes and ideas he wanted to. Most every topic was glanced over sparingly, described with weak and inapt analogy, and left behind leaving me to wonder if that's really the best he thought he could do.",7,0.9662,0.054,0.809,0.137,0.4827777777777777,NEGATIVE,1.0

80,3280669041,01/08/2021,5.0,"•	The book is a very dense and vast in its content, the style of writing of Bill Bryson is lucid, uniquely written book, full of humor although one do not normally associate humor with non-fiction book, there are lots of good thing to talk about this book, beside all these the book is meticulously covers the history of nearly everything, its horizon is as far as the big bang and as near as the DNA in our body, and nearly all of the things that are in between those two most distant things the universe or the big bang and the DNA, are almost covered in this book. Bill Bryson is a very unique author, the most intricates and complex concepts of biology, physics or chemistry such as Atom, DNA, Special theory of relativity, or gravity and etcetera, are very eloquently presented in the book with the analogies, which has made science very easy and fun to understand, precisely this is the very reason The Guardian has said about this book, “ It’s hard to imagine a better rough guide to science”. •	The book starts with a bang, and that bang (not that of the big bang) continues till the very last page of the book, it first of all start from our universe, in the very first pages it unfold upon us the vastness of the universe the ludicrous, monumental reach of our universe. Universe is very vast as we all know that, but its vastness is beyond our imagination, the stars we see from the earth are nothing but a mirage, take a telescope of few inches and you would be looking at somewhere in the figure of hundred stars, raise the inches and you would be looking stars in the thousands, with only 16 inches telescope one would not be looking at the stars but at the galaxies, only 6 thousands odds stars are visible from bare eyes, and those too in the southern hemisphere you could look at the sky clearly because very few people live in that region compare to the northern hemisphere where almost all of the continents are except Australia. If we collect numbers of grains from whole of the earth beaches still there would be more numbers of stars in the universe, in one galaxy just as our own milky way galaxy, there are billions of billions of stars, and imagine there are billions of those galaxies in the universe. •	The book reduce our ignorance to significantly, it unfolds the mysteries of universe, how the universe came into being, and how our own planets earth came into existence and then how (this is a big How) in this vast universe the life was only possible in the planet earth, what were the causes that made this plant Earth very susceptible for life, why not the life begin in other planets, what were those chemicals that were so essential for the functioning of the life and how our planet acquired those. It says that the life giving chemicals such as Oxygen, nitrogen, carbon were required the energy that was equivalent the energy released from the big bang, but at the time of the big bang these elements were not produced, the big bang produced gaseous elements that weren’t appropriate for the life, because it produced light gases such as Helium, Nitrogen and Lithium, those were not essential for the life or our own being. Then how the elements that were very essential for life such as carbon and iron came into being, if not with big bang then how, to forge these elements one requires the same amount of energy that produced by the big bang as discussed earlier. Was there another big bang then? And the answer to it is the supernova. •	We wouldn’t be here without the supernova, the answer to the mysterious question of how life started is in supernova, the stars lives or burn for billions of years, but when it dies it explode, and thus this explosion generates huge amount of energy, this very explosion is called supernova, and at about 4.6 billion years ago, a supernova occurred it produced gas and dust some 24 billion kilometers across the space, virtually the 99 percent of mass of the solar system went to make the sun, and the remaining floated material joined by electro static force, this was the moment of the formation of our solar system and planet, in next 200 million years the earth formed, an object of the size of the mars at about 4.4 billion year ago crashed into the earth, blow out enough material from the Earth to form the Moon, as the years passed earth started to form an atmosphere mostly carbon dioxide, methane and Sulphur, not the life sustaining elements but were important because carbon dioxide is a powerful greenhouse gas, it was not a bad thing because at that time the sun was still dimmer, had there was no greenhouse gas effect earth would have been frozen permanently. Next 500 million years earth was pelted and bombarded with debris, comets and meteorites, which brought water to fill the oceans, and the component that were at the heart of the life formation. The environment was very hostile, some tiny bag of chemicals twitched back then and became animated, and the life on the planet was on its way.•	I would not stretch in depth now the things that are further discussed in the books, otherwise it would be very long. Moving on everything was set now, universe was there, and the solar system and the earth was formed, and the life was started also started, now the book discusses earth, it tells us physical an chemical properties of our planets, how the distance from our planet to sun, and the place of our planet in universe was calculated, it talks about the size of earth, its mass, the gravitation force, how the value of the gravity was calculated, and most importantly it discussed the Newtonian and Einsteinian physics, the laws of the newton and its practical importance has been discussed, it provide us with the knowledge that how newton work out his laws an how they were used for the finding and calculations of very important worldly matters. It really shocked me that when that Cavendish worked out the mass of thee earth without even leaving his house, and it was so accurate. Einstein has been discussed in depth because of his importance, Einstein published 5 papers in 1905, three of them were very significant. First one of them was on the photo electric effects, the findings of these papers was very important as it explained the nature of light, it won him the noble prize among other things it also helped to make television, his second paper was on the behavior of small particles under suspension, it proved the existence of atoms which was a big question at that times. His third paper virtually changed the world, it was on the Special Theory of relativity. •	The special theory of relativity was very essential, the equation of the theory is E=mc2 , it states that mass and energy has an equivalence, ther are the two forms of the same thing, energy is liberated matter and matter is energy waiting to happen. The equation is saying that there is huge amount of energy bound up in every material thing.Among much else Einstein theory explained how radiation worked, since very long the problem that troubled the scientist was the age of the universe, the Stars and our planet. The fact that stars could burn for billions of years without running out of its fuels startled scientist, this was never accepted wholly, there were the school of thoughts, the ideas of that school of thought was that our universe and our planet are very recent phenomena, it was not possible for stars to burn themselves for billions of years and couldn’t run our of their fuel. Einstein theory gave the scientist luxury of billions of years, his theory explained all of this that how the big object could burn themselves for billion of years without racing through their energy.•	Moving on to the next stage, the book discussed from top of the skies to the deepest point of oceans, the marina trench, it talked about our troposphere, the clouds, the formation of land or continent, the mountains, and rocks. It also enlightened us about the existence of life in oceans, the whopping number of species lived in the ocean, firstly the life was only under the water, then it came out of the water. The others things that are discussed are the early life on our planet, that how through fossils we discovered the different species, the existence of dinosaurs and its extinct some 65 million years ago. •	In the last phase the book moved on to humans, it discussed the cell, the very molecule which is at the heart of our life, the chromosomes, the nucleus of the cell the DNA, is well discussed. Chromosomes contain the complete set of instruction to make and maintain us, and are made of long strand of little wonder chemical DNA, the most extraordinary molecule on earth as it has been said. It meticulously unfolds the mystery of DNA, how biologist reached to the point of DNA, how it was discovered and so on. The only purpose of DNA is to copy itself, it would do no other function than just to replicate itself, the protein and DNA are very essential for life, the DNA is in the nucleus, and the life functions outside of the nucleus, and its outside it protein, the communication between DNA and protein was very mysterious, because language of both is different, doesn’t speak the same language, you can say that one speak Hindi then other speak the Spanish, so this mystery was also solved with the discovery of RNA, as RNA is the very cell that do the job of meditator between DNA and protein, it takes the information from DNA and transfer it to the protein in the form that protein understand. We are beholding ten thousand trillion cells, almost every one of them hold 2 yards of densely compacted DNA. If all our DNA is woven into a single fine strand, there would be enough of it to stretch it from the earth to the moon and back to earth, not once or twice but again and again. It is calculated that we may have as much as 20 Billion kilometers of DNA bundle up inside us. The DNA is one of the most non-reactive, chemically inert molecules in the world, this is the very reason that in the murder investigation, it can be recovered from long dried blood or semen and is coaxed from the ancient bones of Neandertals Further it discusses the genes, it is the instruction to make protein. All organism are the slaves to their genes, this is the reason that salmon and spiders and other type of creatures are prepared to die in the process of mating. The desire to breed to disperse one’s genes is the most powerful impulse in the nature, from the evolutionary point of view, sex is really just a reward mechanism to encourage us just to pass on our genetic material. To quote Sherwin B. Nuland here, “Empire fall, ids explode, great symphonies are written, and behind all of it is a single instinct that demands satisfaction”, Most of the DNA is not devoted to us but to itself: we are a machine to the benefit of it, not it for us, in other words life wants to be and DNA is what makes it soConclusion: I would conclude that this is one of the very informative and knowledgeable book that I have ever read, the most of the things I get to learn from the book were very new, and the author has done a brilliant job, he has eloquently presented all of the information, in every way my journey with this book was great one, where ever it took me I really enjoyed it, whether it was in the space, ocean, sky, land, or in the most distant of the stars to the most closest of the thing in us the DNA, although my journey with the book is over, but it is just started with its author, Bill Bryson.

83,3473528916,08/01/2020,3.0,"The universe is an amazingly fickle and eventful place, and our existence within itis a wonder. If a long and unimaginably complex sequence of events stretching back 4.6billion years or so hadn’t played out in a particular manner at particular times—if, to take justone obvious instance, the dinosaurs hadn’t been wiped out by a meteor when they were—youmight well be six inches long, with whiskers and a tail, and reading this in a burrow.So Bryson named this book ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"" and it is really the most accurate name and description for it. He talks briefly about the basics of physics, biology, and some chemistry and mentioned theories of how our universe was established, water, air, and our human bodies and how we are affected and affect all those elements, atoms, Nucleus, DNA and birds, and many other topics. Most importantly, it included environmental awareness.This book wasn't comprehensive to the above-mentioned topics in any way but it gave some new and beneficial tips on them and some points were quite complicated. I enjoyed reading more about biological facts maybe because I love biology more than physics. Bryson talked about the topics through how each scientist viewed and worked on it and that part about scientists was so boring.Below are some of the information that I found interesting:(view spoiler)[-Even at the speed of light, it would take seven hours to get to Pluto. - The average distance between stars out there is 20million million miles- An analysis of a strand of Newton’s hair in the 1970s found itcontained mercury—an element of interest to alchemists, hatters, and thermometer-makersbut almost no one else—at a concentration some forty times the natural level. It is perhapslittle wonder that he had trouble remembering to rise in the morning.- The current best estimate for Earth’s weight is 5.9725 billion trillion metric tons.- Einstein’s papers attracted little notice. Having just solved several of the deepest mysteries of the universe, Einstein applied for a job as a university lecturer and was rejected, and then as a high school teacher and was rejected there as well. So he went back to his job as an examiner third class, but of course he kept thinking. He hadn’t even come close to finishing yet.- The most common types of earthquakes are those where two plates meet, as in Californiaalong the San Andreas Fault. As the plates push against each other, pressures build up untilone or the other gives way. - water is about 1,300 times heavier than air.- The Moon’s steady gravitational influence keeps the Earth spinning at the right speed and angle to provide the sort of stability necessary for the long and successful development of life. We now believe, as you will recall from anearlier chapter, that about 4.5 billion years ago a Mars-sized object slammed into Earth,blowing out enough material to create the Moon from the debris.- Without the atmosphere, Earth would be a lifeless ball of ice with an average temperature of minus 60 degrees Fahrenheit. In addition, the atmosphere absorbs or deflects incoming swarms of cosmic rays, charged particles, ultraviolet rays.- The Sun is ninety-three million miles away. To move a couple of thousand feet closer to it is like taking one step closer to a bushfire in Australia when you are standing in Ohio. When you feel the sun warm on your back on a summer’s day, it’s really excited atoms you feel. The higher you climb, the fewer molecules there are, and so the fewer collisions between them.- The oceans are not one uniform mass of water. Their differences in temperature, salinity,depth, density, and so on have huge effects on how they move heat around, which in turnaffects climate. The Atlantic, for instance, is saltier than the Pacific, and a good thing too. Thesaltier water is the denser it is, and dense water sinks. Without its extra burden of salt.- The seas do one other great favor for us. They soak up tremendous volumes of carbon andprovide a means for it to be safely locked away. - Deprived of water, the human body rapidly falls apart. Within days, the lips vanish “as if amputated, the gums blacken, the nose withers to half its length, and the skin so contracts around the eyes as to prevent blinking. - In extreme situations, dehydration will lead to seizures, unconsciousness, and brain damage.- The scariest, most out-of-control bacterial disorder of the moment is a disease callednecrotizing fasciitis in which bacteria essentially eat the victim from the inside out, devouringinternal tissue and leaving behind a pulpy, noxious residue. Patients often come in withcomparatively mild complaints—a skin rash and fever typically—but then dramaticallydeteriorate. When they are opened up it is often found that they are simply being consumed.The only treatment is what is known as “radical excisional surgery”—cutting out every bit ofinfected area. Seventy percent of victims die; many of the rest are left terribly disfigured. Thesource of the infection is a mundane family of bacteria called Group A Streptococcus, whichnormally do no more than cause strep throat.

85,735054745,10/05/2013,5.0,"Every year, I include a book that will challenge my left brain functions. This year it was Bill Bryson’s “A Short History of Nearly Everything.” I have never read any of Bill Bryson’s books before even though he is considered one of North America’s most popular writers of non-fiction. His publishers relish the fact that his name sells books, possibly the greatest competitive advantage in the book making business.“A Short History of Nearly Everything” attempts to tell the story of our universe from the very beginning. Bill Bryson covers a great deal of ground, using a master storytelling style that keeps the reader interested from page one, or track one, if you are listening to the audio book as I did. Listening to his softly modulated, welcoming voice added to the appeal. It reminded me of sitting around a campfire listening to the legends of old.Bill Bryson has a knack of targeting his audience, arguably one of the reasons he is so successful. The story of the universe is not an easy subject, nor is the science behind it. In fact, it can be rather intimidating. Never fear, the complexities have been removed so that the narrative unfolds gently, without complicated equations or complex jargon. Instead, Bill Bryson gives us historical anecdotes about the people who contributed to the collective learning.My overall impression was that Bill Bryson was the intermediary, even a translator, between the scientific community and the rest of us who want to expand our knowledge at a leisurely pace. I was amused, however, by his subtle way of letting the reader know that he was an invited guest to the elite scientific community. But then, who can blame him for being excited about conversing with the biggest names in science.Bill Bryson sparked my interest in looking back in to narratives of science and philosophy in more detail. He reminds us that we do indeed “stand on the shoulders of giants.“When the poet Paul Valery once asked Albert Einstein if he kept a notebook to record his ideas, Einstein looked at him with mild but genuine surprise.”Oh, that’s not necessary,” he replied. “It’s so seldom I have one.” Bill Bryson, A Short History of Nearly Everythinghttps://ontheroadbookclub.com/2013/05...",8,0.9497,0.018,0.896,0.085,0.5215053763440861,POSITIVE,0.9944
86,12174805,01/10/2008,5.0,"I really love this book. I really think you should read it.I must admit that I'm somewhat biased; I was already a fan of Bryson's work, and I am generally interested in the sciences. Perhaps as a function of that, I believe this to be my favorite of his books (so far).It's hard for me not to talk to people about the things I read in this book. I mean, it's all so completely interesting to me that I think it should be discussed at all times, in addition to the fact that I don't think people realize a lot of the things discussed therein.I read excerpts to my sixth graders, most of whom sigh in response to my enthusiasm, when related topics arise in class, particularly Science and Social Studies (Pompeii is always good for a volcano digression), but I really can't imagine any grown individual of reasonable intellect and range of interests to find this book lacking.And yes, I'm willing to contend that some aspects may be overlooked, or others perhaps exaggerated, but come on: Bryson never claimed to be a scientist. Science is imperfect itself, so who can really harp on someone who's just trying to put a little spunk into what many consider unreasonably drab or unappealing material? If anything, any hiccups in accuracy catalyze debate and arguments, which, inevitably, elevates scientific discourse. Even our failures lead to progress.I consider this book to have been somewhat eye-opening with respect to the cursory science education many of us get (save but for scientists, and those pursuing that area of Academia). I mean, take it from me, one who teaches sixth grade science: the curriculum isn't all that exciting at times, and if you only paid attention as much as most of my students, this book goes a lot farther in teaching you where exactly we live, and how unlikely it is that you're reading this right now.(Those probabilistic assertions being made, I might point you to John Allen Paulos's ""Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and Its Consequences"" for a similarly eye-opening treatment of mathematics. At the very least, you'll get to wow your friends by calculating the rate at which human hair grows in miles per hour.)",6,0.9346,0.06,0.836,0.104,0.5320680272108843,POSITIVE,0.9983
87,8776125,11/06/2007,4.0,"I found the title of this work somewhat misleading. Perhaps it should have been called A History of the Natural Sciences or maybe even A Short History of Natural History. Nevertheless, science books often do not sell well so I am sure the idea in titling the book A Short History of Nearly Everything was to attract more of a broad readership. The book itself isn't awful but certainly reads like a survey work. In other words, you won't learn complicated how-tos of scientific methodology but you will get a good general idea of a lot of different topics. Some of the things discussed are the origin of the universe, the solar system, the arising of life, and of course man himself or homo sapiens. I found it slightly paradoxical that Bryson spends a good portion of the book building up this almost supernatural-like awe in the reader for the amazing position we find ourselves in of being alive and also of the magical wonder of the universe itself. It's enough to make even the most staunched atheist have reverence. In fact, I could see an atheist while reading the book saying that's God doing that! However, towards the end of the book Bryson seems to take the counter view that we are ultimately doomed to extinction and with continued acts of stuipidity will be just another blip on the evolutionary scale. Despite this the book reads okay for the most part but is interspersed with relative periods of dryness. However, it's difficult to talk about things like algae and lichens and keep everyone interested at all times. Nevertheless, a pretty good read recommended if you keep in mind that it's a survey book that will help you do well on trivial pursuit but is not going to give you the know-how to usurp the current model of the universe. 3.5 out of 5 stars.

For example: an engineer figures out a physics problem, or a school janitor figures out a geology problem.If someone makes a bold scientific discovery, they are first dismissed and ridiculed, then when their ideas are finally accepted, they are attributed to the wrong person.There are many many many underappreciated, forgotten scientists in the history of mankind.Clair Patterson is one of them, and he is also my new hero. Thanks to him, and his tireless battle with big corporations (how many scientists are also politcal activists? not many) we don't all have to die of lead poisoning. He has been totally forgotten by history.There are many possible scenarios for us homo sapiens to not have made it here today. Just any one factor being slightly different would make it impossible for us to live here. We are very lucky.There are an equal amount of possible scenarios that we will not be here much longer (asteroids, volcanos, ice ages, not to mention human causes like atomic war).Many times the same things that cause mass destruction are the things that allow us to be alive in the first place. Volcanoes cause many deaths, but at the same time, without them we would still be in an ice age. A huge asteroid could destroy us all, but yet without them, the dinosaurs would never have gone extinct, which means we would never have come around in the first place.Every generation thinks it knows everything, or is at the brink of knowing everything. Every generation has been seriously wrong up to now about almost everything. There is still a LOT that we don't know. Especially about the really miniscule and the really huge. But also about our own histories.We are such a small part of everything, and when we go we will only be a blip, we will not be missed. We can't even comprehend how inconsequential we are. Humans are a blight on this earth. Everything we touch goes extinct. We put all kinds of chemicals in the earth. We overtax all earth's resources. We really are like a virus, leeching onto the earth. When humans go extinct it will be our own fault, but also a very healthy turn of events for the earth and all that live on it. Only then would the earth begin its recovery from us.

Bryson takes you through the history of scientific discovery and explains what we know about our planet and how we discovered it. I learned as much about Cosmology, Geology, Paleontology, Cellular Biology, Quantum Physics, Zoology, Chemistry etc in this book as i have in any of the various science classes I have taken throughout my life. This book will inspire in you awe and wonder; awe at the brilliance of modern science and discovery, and wonder at how far we still have to go. If you spent any time with me while I was reading this book, you will also know that it is full of curious, amazing facts. Here are just a few of many:-Every atom you possess has almost certainly passed through several stars and has been part of millions of organisms on its way to becoming you. It has been suggested that a significant number of our atoms, up to a billion for each of us - probably once belonged to Shakespeare, A billion more each came from Buddha and Genghis Khan and Beethoven and any other historical figure you can name. -There is enough salt in the sea to bury every bit of land on the planet to a depth of about 150m.-The indigestible parts of a giant squid, in particular their beaks, accumulate in sperm whales’ stomachs into ambergris, which is used as a fixative in perfumes. The next time you spray on Chanel No. 5, you’re dowsing yourself in the distillate of unseen sea monsters.-Fossils are incredibly improbable: it is estimated that only one bone in a billion ever becomes fossilized. Most of what lived on earth has left no record at all. It is estimated that less than one species in a thousand has made it into the fossil record. -A typical solar flare, something that we wouldn't even notice on earth - will release the energy equivalent of a billion hydrogen bombs and fling into space 100 billion tonnes of murderous high-energy particles.-In the 1960s, geologists studying Yellowstone National Park were searching for the volcano that gave the park so much volcanic activity. After NASA began testing high altitude cameras, it was discovered that the entire park - 65km across - was the crater of an ancient supervolcano. Its largest past eruption was 1,000-2,000 times more explosive than Mt. St. Helens, exploding with the energy of 500,000 to 1,000,000 Hiroshima nuclear bombs. This supervolcano is 30,000 years overdue for an eruption.This book was a blast to read, and gave me an incredible appreciation for the wonder of creation and the massive odds life has overcome in order to exist as it does today.",5,0.9769,0.018,0.901,0.08,0.5287896825396825,POSITIVE,0.9416

It shows the reader many of the holes that there are in this theory but in the end just accepts it for the established scientific dogma that it is. As I have mentioned before in my reviews, after having read Harun Yahya's brilliant dispelling of the evolutionary theory, I no longer believe that evolution is a viable scientific argument.In the end, I truly enjoyed the book for the wealth of knowledge that it contains, and recommend it for anyone trying to get a better understanding of ""A Short History of Nearly Everything We Think We Know"".

It just occurred to Bryson that he didn’t know much about our planet, so he decided to do some research and write a book about it. He spent the next few years reading scientific books and journals, talking to different scientists, and visiting different places. Not to downplay the hard work that he put into this book, but he must have had an immense amount of fun doing it. It must be nice to be able to do that. This book a great read on both science and its history. It’s not a summary of the entire human knowledge, as some have suggested, but a very interesting collection nonetheless. The good thing about Bryson is that he’s a great writer, but he’s not a scientist. He doesn’t have any theories of his own to promote, or any favorites when there are competing theories. Therefore, he doesn’t mind telling us how scant the evidence for a particular theory is, even if it happens to be the prevailing theory. A good example is the lack of fossil records of our ancestors. Other books written by scientists give you the impression that we have truckloads of fossil records outlining our evolutionary path in detail, whereas in fact we only have a few bones here and there. Bryson doesn’t also mind telling us how little we know about some issues. A good example is the changes in our plant’s climate. It’s an extremely complicated system, and we basically have no clue about it, but the issue has become hugely political and fashionable, and people talk about it with the certainty of 2x2=4.",6,0.992,0.028,0.82,0.152,0.5136904761904761,POSITIVE,0.9997

This is a history more than a science book, which is right in the title, I know, but in the introduction, he says he set out to discover what scientists know, like how much the Earth weighs, and how they figured that out, but mostly what we get is who figured it out and when. The science is watered down, but the stories of scientific achievement (backstabbing and all) make up for it, and Bryson does a fair job of recalling figures from previous chapters when they pop up again in a totally different context, and they do that a lot. Scientists used to get around. Bryson also goes out of his way to identify questions we don't have answers to yet; always an important part of science -- knowing what we don't know. Because this is Bryson it can be laugh out loud funny at times, but read this for the scientists, not the science. Three stars.

And Bill Bryson writes for people like me. Easy to read, fun, and makes you feel smarter!Instead of writing about the book, I’ll just paste the parts I enjoyed, I usually make notes if something interests me in a book, and these are my notes,Astronomy:“The distance from the surface of Earth to the center is 3,959 miles, which isn’t so very far. It has been calculated that if you sunk a well to the center and dropped a brick into it, it would take only forty-five minutes for it to hit the bottom (though at that point it would be weightless since all the Earth’s gravity would be above and around it rather than beneath it). Our own attempts to penetrate toward the middle have been modest indeed. One or two South African gold mines reach to a depth of two miles, but most mines on Earth go no more than about a quarter of a mile beneath the surface. If the planet were an apple, we wouldn’t yet have broken through the skin. Indeed, we haven’t even come close.”“The eventual result was the inflation theory, which holds that a fraction of a moment after the dawn of creation, the universe underwent a sudden dramatic expansion. It inflated—in effect ran away with itself, doubling in size every 10-34seconds. The whole episode may have lasted no more than 10-30seconds—that’s one million million million million millionths of a second—but it changed the universe from something you could hold in your hand to something at least 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times bigger. Inflation theory explains the ripples and eddies that make our universe possible.”“The core of a neutron star is so dense that a single spoonful of matter from it would weigh 200 billion pounds.”“Astronomers today believe there are perhaps 140 billion galaxies in the visible universe. That’s a huge number, much bigger than merely saying it would lead you to suppose. If galaxies were frozen peas, it would be enough to fill a large auditorium—the old Boston Garden, say, or the Royal Albert Hall.”“Such are the distances, in fact, that it isn’t possible, in any practical terms, to draw the solar system to scale. Even if you added lots of fold-out pages to your textbooks or used a really long sheet of poster paper, you wouldn’t come close. On a diagram of the solar system to scale, with Earth reduced to about the diameter of a pea, Jupiter would be over a thousand feet away and Pluto would be a mile and a half distant (and about the size of a bacterium, so you wouldn’t be able to see it anyway). On the same scale, Proxima Centauri, our nearest star, would be almost ten thousand miles away. Even if you shrank down everything so that Jupiter was as small as the period at the end of this sentence, and Pluto was no bigger than a molecule, Pluto would still be over thirty-five feet away.”“Where would your head be if it were no longer in the universe? What would you find beyond? The answer, disappointingly, is that you can never get to the edge of the universe. That’s not because it would take too long to get there—though of course it would—but because even if you traveled outward and outward in a straight line, indefinitely and pugnaciously, you would never arrive at an outer boundary. Instead, you would come back to where you began (at which point, presumably, you would rather lose heart in the exercise and give up).”Geology:“Four years later, Soviet scientists decided to try their luck on dry land. They chose a spot on Russia’s Kola Peninsula, near the Finnish border, and set to work with the hope of drilling to a depth of fifteen kilometers. The work proved harder than expected, but the Soviets were commendably persistent. When at last they gave up, nineteen years later, they had drilled to a depth of 12,262 meters, or about 7.6 miles. Bearing in mind that the crust of the Earth represents only about 0.3 percent of the planet’s volume and that the Kola hole had not cut even one-third of the way through the crust, we can hardly claim to have conquered the interior.”Biology:“You may not feel outstandingly robust, but if you are an average-sized adult you will contain within your modest frame no less than 7 x 1018joules of potential energy—enough to explode with the force of thirty very large hydrogen bombs, assuming you knew how to liberate it and really wished to make a point. Everything has this kind of energy trapped within it. We’re just not very good at getting it out. Even a uranium bomb—the most energetic thing we have produced yet—releases less than 1 percent of the energy it could release if only we were more cunning.”“…if an atom were expanded to the size of a cathedral, the nucleus would be only about the size of a fly—but a fly many thousands of times heavier than the cathedral.”“If you are in good health and averagely diligent about hygiene, you will have a herd of about one trillion bacteria grazing on your fleshy plains—about a hundred thousand of them on every square centimeter of skin. They are there to dine off the ten billion or so flakes of skin you shed every day, plus all the tasty oils and fortifying minerals that seep out from every pore and fissure.”“IT STARTS WITH a single cell. The first cell splits to become two and the two become four and so on. After just forty-seven doublings, you have ten thousand trillion (10,000,000,000,000,000) cells in your body and are ready to spring forth as a human being.”“Every cell in nature is a thing of wonder. Even the simplest are far beyond the limits of human ingenuity. To build the most basic yeast cell, for example, you would have to miniaturize about the same number of components as are found in a Boeing 777 jetliner and fit them into a sphere just five microns across; then somehow you would have to persuade that sphere to reproduce.But yeast cells are as nothing compared with human cells, which are not just more varied and complicated, but vastly more fascinating because of their complex interactions.”“The good news is that the individual components of your brain cells are constantly renewed so that, as with the liver cells, no part of them is actually likely to be more than about a month old. Indeed, it has been suggested that there isn’t a single bit of any of us—not so much as a stray molecule—that was part of us nine years ago.”“DNA exists for just one reason—to create more DNA—and you have a lot of it inside you: about six feet of it squeezed into almost every cell. Each length of DNA comprises some 3.2 billion letters of coding, enough to provide 103,480,000,000possible combinations, “guaranteed to be unique against all conceivable odds,” in the words of Christian de Duve. That’s a lot of possibility—a one followed by more than three billion zeroes. “It would take more than five thousand average-size books just to print that figure,” notes de Duve. Look at yourself in the mirror and reflect upon the fact that you are beholding ten thousand trillion cells, and that almost every one of them holds two yards of densely compacted DNA, and you begin to appreciate just how much of this stuff you carry around with you. If all your DNA were woven into a single fine strand, there would be enough of it to stretch from the Earth to the Moon and back not once or twice but again and again. Altogether, according to one calculation, you may have as much as twenty million kilometers of DNA bundled up inside you.”Physics:“Rather,” as Timothy Ferris explains, “the negatively charged fields of the two balls repel each other . . . were it not for their electrical charges they could, like galaxies, pass right through each other unscathed.” When you sit in a chair, you are not actually sitting there, but levitating above it at a height of one angstrom (a hundred millionth of a centimeter), your electrons and its electrons implacably opposed to any closer intimacy.Animal Science:“According to one estimate, there could be as many as thirty million species of animals living in the sea”Scientists:Isaac Newton ""... built his own laboratory, the first at Cambridge, but then engaged in the most bizarre experiments. Once he inserted a bodkin—a long needle of the sort used for sewing leather—into his eye socket and rubbed it around “betwixt my eye and the bone as near to [the] backside of my eye as I could” just to see what would happen.""""Henry Edward Crampton spent fifty years, from 1906 to his death in 1956, quietly studying a genus of land snails in Polynesia called Partula. Over and over, year after year, Crampton measured to the tiniest degree—to eight decimal places—the whorls and arcs and gentle curves of numberless Partula, compiling the results into fastidiously detailed tables. A single line of text in a Crampton table could represent weeks of measurement and calculation.""""Born in 1821, Croll grew up poor, and his formal education lasted only to the age of thirteen. He worked at a variety of jobs—as a carpenter, insurance salesman, keeper of a temperance hotel—before taking a position as a janitor at Anderson’s (now the University of Strathclyde) in Glasgow. By somehow inducing his brother to do much of his work, he was able to pass many quiet evenings in the university library teaching himself physics, mechanics, astronomy, hydrostatics, and the other fashionable sciences of the day, and gradually began to produce a string of papers, with a particular emphasis on the motions of Earth and their effect on climate.Happily this was precisely the sort of repetitive toil that suited Milankovitch’s temperament. For the next twenty years, even while on vacation, he worked ceaselessly with pencil and slide rule computing the tables of his cycles—work that now could be completed in a day or two with a computer.""",3,0.9615,0.04,0.907,0.054,0.4442885632885633,NEGATIVE,0.9891
135,1167183301,01/13/2015,4.0,"Maybe this is silly, but I thought this was going to be a history book. You know, because of the title. I figured maybe a chapter or two covering the formation of the solar system, the origins of life, the dinosaurs and evolution to humans, then the rest of the book would cover highlights of human history. I thought this would be a nice complement to Cosmos which I read last year. But this seems to be trying to be a science book, covering the same ground as Cosmos. And, well, if given a choice between Sagan and Bryson ... I'm going with Sagan. And I already read - and loved - that book. So I started off a little unhappy with this book. But it grew on me!!!This is, in a way, a history book, but it is The History of Scientific Discoveries, not the history of key human events. The History of Science goes something like this: This well-off gentlemen stumbled upon these sixteen different and well-known things [equations, chemical elements, dinosaur bones, whathaveyou ...], but you've never heard of him because he never got credit for any of it; he also spent a lot of time in this ridiculous pursuit [making himself invisible, turning urine into gold, proving the earth is only 6000 years old, etc]! There is a lesson to be learned in this book, well, several lessons: 1. Even if you don't know what you're doing, you could still do something really awesome, 2. If you do the awesome thing, a lot of people still may not believe you, and 3. You may or may not get credit for The Awesome Thing. Sometimes you don't get credit, but people still realize you were great, so they name an Unrelated Thing after you. Also, it helps to be rich. And male. And white (preferably British).I also learned that scientists come up with funny acronyms! (WIMPs for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, MACHOs for MAssive Compact Halo Objects, SHRIMP for Sensitive High Resolution Ion Micro Probe, and SLiME for subsurface lithoautotrophic microbial ecosystems.) The focus of the book moves from:* How was the universe created?* How did people figure out how large Earth is?* How did people figure out how old Earth is?* Einstein! (A category of his own, really)* How did people figure out that the Universe is really quite vast (I won't say we've figured out exactly how big it is, because we haven't)?* How did people figure out stuff about atoms? (Stuff that they are STILL figuring out)* How did people start looking at things smaller than atoms and things larger than galaxies?* How did people figure out how the continents and Earth's crust were formed?* How likely is it that people will spot an asteroid on a collision course with Earth?* How much do scientists know about the inside of the Earth? (aka: earthquakes and volcanoes, oh my!)* How narrow is the niche in which life can exist?* What have scientists learned about the atmosphere and weather?* How are scientists learning about the ocean?* What do scientists know about the beginnings of life on Earth?* All About Bacteria! And Viruses! And other microbes that might kill you!* What have we learned about ancient life and evolution from studying fossils?* What's the deal with extinction?* How much, or how little, do we know about the species living on Earth?* How much, or how little, do we know about our own cells?* Darwin and Mendel and the development of the theory of evolution.* How did scientists learn about chromosomes and genes and DNA?* How did scientists learn about the Ice Age?* What have scientists learned from the human fossil records they have discovered?Bryson does have a talent for making this all extremely entertaining. He amassed an enormous amount of information, and then - amazingly- figured out how to organize all of it into a reasonable and readable order. He has a talent for finding the funniest and quirkiest quotes and tidbits, about, well, everything.Although I was initially REALLY irritated by Bryson's ""aw shucks, math is hard"" tone (and, in fact, I concluded: this is a science book for people who hate science, but still want to be a little knowledgeable. If you don't hate science, avoid this book.) I was finally won over by the numerous fascinating interjections about the various scientists. People who hated each other, people who made silly assumptions, people who married other's exes, people who made amazing discoveries but were ignored, people who were egotistical blowhards .... On and on. It is the curiously human element that makes history so fascinating. Bryson did his homework, and he is brilliant at distilling that one amazing nugget of information.The nuggets are endless! Here is a random smattering, from the pages of highlights I made in my Kindle edition:
Looking for supernovae is mostly a matter of not finding them. From 1980 to 1996 he averaged two discoveries a year.**Because gravity holds planets in orbit and makes falling objects land with a bang, we tend to think of it as a powerful force, but it is not really. It is only powerful in a kind of collective sense, when one massive object, like the Sun, holds on to another massive object, like the Earth. At an elemental level gravity is extraordinarily unrobust. Each time you pick up a book from a table or a dime from the floor you effortlessly overcome the combined gravitational exertion of an entire planet.**Right up to the closing years of the eighteenth century (and in Priestley’s case a little beyond) scientists everywhere searched for, and sometimes believed they had actually found, things that just weren’t there: vitiated airs, dephlogisticated marine acids, phloxes, calxes, terraqueous exhalations, and, above all, phlogiston, the substance that was thought to be the active agent in combustion. Somewhere in all this, it was thought, there also resided a mysterious élan vital, the force that brought inanimate objects to life. No one knew where this ethereal essence lay, but two things seemed probable: that you could enliven it with a jolt of electricity (a notion Mary Shelley exploited to full effect in her novel Frankenstein) and that it existed in some substances but not others, which is why we ended up with two branches of chemistry: organic (for those substances that were thought to have it) and inorganic (for those that did not).**Count von Rumford, who, despite the grandeur of his title, began life in Woburn, Massachusetts, in 1753 as plain Benjamin Thompson. Thompson was dashing and ambitious, “handsome in feature and figure,” occasionally courageous and exceedingly bright, but untroubled by anything so inconveniencing as a scruple. At nineteen he married a rich widow fourteen years his senior, but at the outbreak of revolution in the colonies he unwisely sided with the loyalists, for a time spying on their behalf. In the fateful year of 1776, facing arrest “for lukewarmness in the cause of liberty,” he abandoned his wife and child and fled just ahead of a mob of anti-Royalists armed with buckets of hot tar, bags of feathers, and an earnest desire to adorn him with both.**Physicists are notoriously scornful of scientists from other fields. When the wife of the great Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli left him for a chemist, he was staggered with disbelief. “Had she taken a bullfighter I would have understood,” he remarked in wonder to a friend. “But a chemist …” It was a feeling Rutherford would have understood. “All science is either physics or stamp collecting,” he once said**it wasn’t merely different from anything we knew, but different from anything ever imagined. “Because atomic behavior is so unlike ordinary experience,” Richard Feynman once observed, “it is very difficult to get used to and it appears peculiar and mysterious to everyone, both to the novice and to the experienced physicist.” ... Bohr was struck by a solution and dashed off his famous paper. Called “On the Constitutions of Atoms and Molecules,” the paper explained how electrons could keep from falling into the nucleus by suggesting that they could occupy only certain well-defined orbits. According to the new theory, an electron moving between orbits would disappear from one and reappear instantaneously in another without visiting the space between. This idea—the famous “quantum leap”—is of course utterly strange, but it was too good not to be true.**Heisenberg, when asked how one could envision an atom, replied: “Don’t try.”**Gell-Mann took the name [quark] from a line in Finnegans Wake: “Three quarks for Muster Mark!”**Lead poisons us because we were never exposed to it until we began to fashion it into food vessels and pipes for plumbing. (Not incidentally, lead’s symbol is Pb, for the Latin plumbum, the source word for our modern plumbing.)**We are actually getting worse at some matters of hygiene. Dr. Maunder believes that the move toward low-temperature washing machine detergents has encouraged bugs to proliferate. As he puts it: “If you wash lousy clothing at low temperatures, all you get is cleaner lice.”**In the most literal way, cells also vary in liveliness. Your skin cells are all dead. It’s a somewhat galling notion to reflect that every inch of your surface is deceased.**Altogether, some twenty types of hominid are recognized in the literature today. Unfortunately, almost no two experts recognize the same twenty.**Homo Erectus was “the velociraptor of its day,” according to Alan Walker of Penn State University and one of the world’s leading authorities. If you were to look one in the eyes, it might appear superficially to be human, but “you wouldn’t connect. You’d be prey.” According to Walker, it had the body of an adult human but the brain of a baby.
I could keep going, but you get the idea ...Not only are there golden nuggets of quirky and fascinating info, but Bryson is also fantastic and telling us the etymology of so many scientific words. I really appreciated this. I never knew, for example, that molecule is from the Latin for “little mass”.One recurring and possibly odd thought I keep having: this would be a great reference for a novelist. If you are writing Regency or Victorian romances in England and your hero and/or heroine is a scientist or inventor, this is a treasure trove describing the state of science in the day, along with fun and quirky personal details about various scientists that could be worked into your story. If you are writing a post-apocalyptic story (""Ashfall,"" for example) this is rich with details on the various natural calamities that could befall the planet.This book fulfilled the ""self-improvement"" prompt in the 2016 Popsugar Ultimate Reading Challenge (because learning more about history is self-improvement for me!)",3,0.9992,0.063,0.81,0.127,0.5886736166328002,NEGATIVE,0.9929
136,1979726569,07/27/2017,5.0,"Actual Rating : 4.75 What Bryson has done, effortlessly and excellently , in this book was to carve a worthy read out of the most soporific of subjects and most tedious of topics. In this book, the author painstakingly tries to give a simplified history of science and i must say, for the most part, did a decent job at it.He ensured (or did his best to ensure) that we did not have to wade through pages worth of intellectual jargon. Although there were some parts that such complexities could not be helped such as on the subject of atomic structures. It was far too esoteric such that any further simplification would be done at the expense of crucial details. My advice is to coast through this section as fast as possible unless of course you have a filial relationship with J.J. Thompson.This is one book that never gets old. I easily could go back fifty pages and would feel like I were reading for the first time. Because with this book, the least of my concerns were details like Lord Rutherford's failed marriage, the multitude of geysers in Yellowstone National park or how unlucky an individual Max Planck was. What consistently arrested my attention was how brilliantly Bill marvelled at putting words together. Many times in the book, I literally had to stop and utter words like ""Damn!"", ""WOW!"" and some rather inappropriate interjections in raw admiration of Bill's prowess.That said, I think the book could have been shorter. Bill could have could saved us some redundant details in the anthropological section of the book. I found this part quite difficult to read because it was basically paragraph after paragraph of direct quotations from scientists. It certainly did not help that i was being bombarded with long and weird scientific names of the pre-existing species. The author's signature analogies and uncommon wit were essentially non-existent in this section and i was for a moment exposed to the horrifying reality of the scientific world; thus giving a rather sad impression that the latter parts of this book might have been rushed. But honestly, if you are ever interested in reading two books on scientific history distilled with humour and intellectual elegance, grab this book.

Read, with me, the following sentence:Proteins loop and coil and crinkle into shapes that are at once extravagant and complex. They are more like furiously mangled coat hangers than folded towels.Does this sentence fill you with the joy of a well-chosen metaphor? Or does it seem reductive, condescending, and also a little bit wrong?If you are the former type, you'll love this book. The book's magic doesn't extend to its title, which bears almost no relation to its contents. This isn't a story of nearly everything; it's really the story of science and how we came to know what we know about the big questions: where we came from, what we're made of, how much the earth weighs, and so on. And really, the story is a lot more about the scientists than the science: their squabbles, their eccentricities, the fierce competitions, the years of patient calculation, the recluses, the credit-takers, the frauds, the deluded, the hopeful, and, of course, the true geniuses. If you are the latter type, you will find this book disappointing. While Bryson has done great research, this book is almost twenty years old, Bryson is not himself a scientist, and some of the information presented as fact is now outdated or just plain incorrect. For example, he describes quantum entanglement in such way that it's implied you could use it to communicate faster than light, which (as far as we know) isn't possible.Or take this quote:It may not look it, but all the glass on Earth is flowing downward under the relentless drag of gravity. Remove a pane of really old glass from the window of a European cathedral and it will be noticeably thicker at the bottom than at the top.This is just wrong. Glass isn't a fluid, and the thicker bottoms of some cathedrals is just because they didn't have the technology to make perfectly even panes in the old days.

Wow, typing it all out like that really makes me wonder where did I or my education go wrong.

This book is so important for building a science frame work so you have something solid to hang your knowledge on. You get the full story, from how people even began studying certain fields and how advancement has progressed. The penultimate chapter on human evolution was especially wonderful because after I finished it I got an alert on my NPR news app that they had found the oldest fossilized ancient human bones outside of Africa ever, leading some to believe that we left africa 100,000 years earlier then previously thought.

I never did physics or chemistry at school and although I had heard of lots of the things Bryson undertakes to explain I have never understood them in any depth.

Although slightly out of date since it was first published 13 years ago, the book is still relevant and still as funny, making sure that, if there ever is an updated edition, I will make sure to read it again. It also served as a nice reminder of all the things that my high school education covered. One thing that made a big impression on me was the reoccurring note of how many things we still actually don't know and might never find out.

But what does it mean? “In simplest terms, what the equation says is that mass and energy have an equivalence. They are two forms of the same thing; energy is liberated matter; matter is energy waiting to happen.” Beautiful!Where do we come from? “For the first 99.99999 percent of our history as organisms, we were in the same ancestral line as chimpanzees. Virtually nothing is known about the prehistory of chimpanzees, but whatever they were, we were.”In fact, we’ve still got a lot of chimp in us. Homo sapiens is a “creature that is still 98.4 percent genetically indistinguishable from the modern chimpanzee. There is more difference between a zebra and a horse or between a dolphin and a porpoise than there is between you and the furry creatures your distant ancestors left behind when they set out to take over the world.”Yes, Bryson is quotable and readable, and I highly recommend this book if the many subject matters from the Big Bang to the start of civilization interest you.Paul Levine

Science textbooks, science teachers, science classes....For me, it was all, as Bryson writes in the book's introduction, ""...as if (they) wanted to keep the good stuff secret by making all of it soberly unfathomable.""  For the science hater (and, I suspect, for the science lover), this is a  singularly wonderful book. Bryson makes Einstein and Darwin, Dalton and Rutherford seem like cool dudes.  He talks about big subjects like the expanding universe, plate tectonics, the human genome, and Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle the way other people talk about baseball. Highly recommended.  Some of my favorite quotes from the book:  From the introduction: ""Welcome. And congratulations. I am delighted that you could make it. Getting here wasn't easy, I know.

146,318497460,04/24/2012,5.0,"The title of this book, ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"", makes it seem to be a history book. I was never able to guess correctly that it is a popular science book until I stumbled upon the reviews of this book at Amazon. The first question that arose in my mind was how can one give a historical scientific account of everything in the universe in 600 odd pages. That too when the author of this book, Bill Bryson, is more of a travel book writer than a scientist or researcher in any specific area of science. I was a bit skeptical whether he would be able to do justice for science in such an ambitious effort. I had no option but to read the entire book to figure out the truth.As title of the book promises, Bryson covers the history of nearly every significant scientific breakthrough in the world. This book is more of a celebration of the efforts of the great scientists who invested their life in their quest to explore the truths hidden behind nature. After completing the book, I am amazed by the amount of research Bryson would have carried out to produce a masterpiece like this. As Bryson himself admits, he was put off by the rote learning prevalent in almost all of the schools which discourages students from questioning different aspects of life. Bryson makes sure that there is not even a single equation in the whole book and explains every concept intuitively. Ironically, he does not include history of mathematicians in this book.The best thing about this book is that Bryson gives credit where it is due. Even those scientists who have been ignored by popular textbooks over the years feature in this book. As with the case of the discovery of helical DNA structure, Rosalind Franklin was not given her due in the discovery. The male dominant society during that time led her towards hiding most of her research findings. This was exploited by others such as Crick and Watson. Unfortunately, she was not able to share the Nobel prize with others due to her untimely death. Other interesting facts include the competition by paleontologists for claims over the discovery of dinosaur fossils. The politics played by envious and cunning Richard Owen who troubled sincere efforts of Gideon Mantell through sheer bureaucracy can never be found in any standard text book.Bryson spends quite a lot of the book pages on geology - study of earth. His narration of the stunning history behind the Yellowstone national park in the US exposes one how volcanic eruptions can even create vast plateaus. Most of the visitors to the park are still unaware that they are standing on a big plateau having seismic dangers. Even the Deccan plateau in India is supposedly formed as a result of volcanic eruption millions of years back. Bryson's treatment of the classification of earth's layers as we dig deep from its surface provide scientific evidence for such volcanic eruptions. Bryson also explains why banging of a meteor on the earth's surface lead to the radical change in earth's atmosphere and thereby causing the extinction of the Dinosaurs.I was amazed by the sufferings undertaken by the scientists in their ventures to unearth the world's mysteries. Bryson gives a thorough account on the emergence of Homo Sapiens from their ancestors such as Homo Habilis, Homo Erectus, and Neandertals. These chapters of the book are similar to that of the Carl Sagan's classic, ""The Dragons of Eden"". The contradictory theories of the emergence of human beings through fossil studies make one feel how much more truths are still lying hidden behind this planet. Bryson also rues how the different acts of human beings are responsible directly or indirectly behind the extinction of different species and the spoiling of earth's atmosphere.The main purpose of this book is to encourage rational thinking by introducing the readers to delve into the lives of great scientists. The areas covered is very vast comprising of physics, chemistry, ecology, geology, zoology, botany, etc. All these areas are treated with the core objective of understanding the world we live. Each scientific concept has been presented in such a way that even a person with meager scientific exposure can appreciate and enjoy this book. The important observation is that Bryson succeeds in his daring effort to popularize science to a great extent. Bryson has the incredible art of capturing the attention of the readers second only to another great science writer - Simon Singh.This book is filled with too much significant information that it was hard to remember everything once I completed it. I felt a sense of deep satisfaction, though. I feel one should read this book many a times for gaining the complete treasure of knowledge. This book is a must read for all of us to have an intuitive understanding of almost every aspect of science. I, in fact, regret not being exposed to such a great book in my school days. On the contrary, it is always better late than never. I am very happy that I got a chance to read this book at least now. I hope almost every reader of this book will feel the same.I would recommend ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"" very strongly to any student who is either interested or disinterested in science. Interested students would get motivated more, disinterested ones would start developing interest towards science. That is the magic behind this book and Bill Bryson deserves to be credited for churning out such a wonderful masterpiece. This book is a must read for people of all ages who want to make themselves more skeptical and rational. I would rate this book one of the pinnacles of popular science writing, which certainly has to be relished.",3,0.9993,0.059,0.762,0.179,0.5485200302343158,NEGATIVE,0.6481
