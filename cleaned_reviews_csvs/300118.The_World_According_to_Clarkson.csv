0,2247628928,02/20/2018,3.0,"This book was a collection of around 3 years worth of articles by Jeremy Clarkson for a Newspaper in UK. And many of the articles are from continuous weeks. Clarkson is a funny guy and it shows in his observations but seeing how the articles were originally written between 2001 and 2003 and I read the book in 2018, it was already quite dated but still fun enough to read and finish.I liked it but since it's not a book in the traditional sense I could only finish couple of chapters at a time. If you wanna read some funny thought pieces go for this. Or go for some other book but keep on reading.People who don't read generally ask me my reasons for reading. Simply put I just love reading and so to that end I have made it my motto to just Keep on Reading. I love to read everything except for Self Help books but even those once in a while. I read almost all the genre but YA, Fantasy, Biographies are the most. My favorite series is, of course, Harry Potter but then there are many more books that I just adore.

The only difference's a matter of subtlety.Since it hence follows that finding anything Clarkson says publically to be insightful is more or less the same thing as deriving your political views from the lyrics Seth Putnam wrote for his band Anal Cunt, how does a book entirely consisting of Mr. Clarkson's alleged opinions read?Not how I expected it to, that's for certain. Most of it basically comes across as the written-down rants of some drunken bar patron on various topics, but there's also assorted humourous anecdotes from working at the BBC and his usual ""make sarcastic comments about ugly sports cars by referring to national stereotypes about the countries they're made in"" shtick. Then, occasionally he'll suddenly write something that even I find to have some seriously worthwhile insight in it, and even stylish writing. The piece on his stay in Basque Country, for example, develops a ""Hunter Thompson for dummies"" feel. I don't know how he does it.The funniest thing about the book, though is something that I'm not even sure is intentional: At least a third, possibly even a half, of the articles concerned things nobody outside of Britain has likely ever heard of or will even ever want to care about... which makes the title decidedly ironic.

6,989220463,07/07/2014,3.0,"From Top Gear's most entertaining presenter, this book collects a bunch of short pieces Jeremy Clarkson wrote for the paper.As an Ugly American, or at least an Average-Looking American, I'll say that there are definitely a lot of references I didn't really understand. I don't blame the book for that. I mean, we're talking about London cultural references from 2001. Even the U.S. equivalents probably wouldn't make a ton of sense to people around here. If I compared a politician from 2001 to Limp Bizkit, well, let's just not even take it any further.I wonder if Americans really are so bad about learning other cultures. Or, to put it differently, is this one of the few cases where it's not so much our fault?Consider:A Forbes article from 2013 pointed out that the U.S. is the only ""Advanced"" economy in the world that does not have any mandated paid vacation. Additionally, U.S. law does not enforce any holiday vacation while other ""advanced"" economies mandate between 5 and 13, these in addition to the required paid holidays.Apparently there are also 5 countries that pay HIGHER wages for vacation days to help offset expenses incurred while traveling. Consider Also:When it comes to sheer size, it's no small feat just to get across the U.S. In fact, if you lay Texas over Europe, you'll cover parts of France, Belgium, The Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, Austria, Italy, and just a bit of Poland for good measure.Texas is a big-ass state, but it's only 8-10% of the entire U.S. landmass, depending on whether you count Alaska and Hawaii. I'm not trying to use the old argument that other countries are too far away. I don't know why they built Spain way the hell over there, but what's a fella to do?What I am trying to say is that, culturally, your traveling miles go a lot further in Europe than they do in the U.S. You can make your way to a lot of very different spots with their own, much older cultures while actually putting far fewer miles under your belt.Consider Finally: The Dollar is about .75 Euros. It's been this way or worse since I've been old enough to travel on my own.I'm not suggesting that any one of these factors should prevent Americans from exploring the world. When you consider, as is done in some of the book's last essays, how much easier travel has become with the rise of the jet engine, there's not much excuse....except when one considers that the average American is dealing with all three of these factors, at best. I feel pretty strongly that most of the people I know, most of whom are Americans AT LEAST as ugly as I am, would be happy to visit places outside the U.S. for extended periods. Given the opportunity, many, many would go. But I have to say, it limits the desire to learn about a culture when you'll only read about it in books and see brief glimpses on TV. It's tough to learn French when you figure you'll maybe get to Paris for four days sometime in your life. Or, [shudder] Canada.I feel The System, The Man, The Whatever It Is in America really lends itself to jumping on a plane for a few hours, spending two days a couple states away, somewhere that has beaches if you don't have those, or somewhere that has nice beaches if you have suck beaches, and then coming back after a long weekend. Anyway, for better or worse, Top Gear is my primary exposure to European culture at this point in my life. God help us all.",2,0.9588,0.058,0.851,0.091,0.4792351598173515,NEGATIVE,0.9976
7,2390302675,05/23/2018,4.0,"3.5 stars for The World According to Clarkson. I must say, reading this book took me what felt like a very long time to finish! I was shocked (and slightly disheartened) to find that it was only around 320 pages long (reading it on a Kindle meant I was totally oblivious to the page count). This book is, in a nutshell, a series of entries written by Clarkson which discuss his views on certain aspects of life! The reason I read this is because I watched the 20th anniversary of Millionaire hosted by Clarkson, and after absolutely LOVING it (and him!), it provoked me to buy one of his books. It is not a book I would typically read with my tastes but I thought I would give it a go nonetheless. Personally, I think my reactions to this book fall into three different stages!Stage 1I STARTED it and I began to really, really enjoy it. Jeremy Clarkson, whilst controversial, is an absolutely hilarious man and his honesty is incredibly contagious. A lot of his opinions I would completely NOT agree with but one can still read them knowing that they are in jest! Some other things he says, however, are (admittedly) 100% true and would do the world some good to be said. If nothing else, Clarkson encourages the reader go through life with open honesty.Additionally, the comedy levels in this are off the scale. Some chapters had me laughing less often than others...but those that WERE really funny had me guffawing. If you are in need of some light relief, this will be the book for you!Stage 2I was getting on for halfway through and I started to get a little bit bored. Even despite my disappointment at realising my ten days of reading were in fact only for a 320 page book, I still think this was too long. For me, it ended up getting a bit repetitive: NOT to the extent that I wasn’t enjoying the book anymore; just to the point where there would be some chapters I would only glance at. This doesn’t mean the book was any harder work! I was just chuckling and loving the chapters I did really enjoy, and skimming through the ones I didn’t.Stage 3Then RIGHT at the end (I had about another 25% to go), I decided to just go ahead and finish it so I skimmed through to the end. For this book, do not be afraid to skim through some parts! A lot of this book is full of wit and very worth it; however, whenever Jeremy Clarkson started talking about politics (for example), I completely zoned out. This isn’t particularly the fault of the book because, in general, there are few things which interest me less than politics; but it is undeniable that certain parts of this book were a lot LESS interesting than other parts. I will admit that getting to the end did require some pushing through as I felt that it had been going on for long enough. If this book had been shorter, I would have appreciated the GOOD chapters even more and been able to look on the book as a whole with a fresher, more positive light. There was a SMALL element of it getting all too much the same by the end.Yet I shall not be ending this review on a negative because I DID enjoy this book and I do think it has a lot of merit! Here are a few of my favourite quotes:(This is about people giving directions.)“...some launch immediately into a bunch of militaristic directions, involving clear, concise hand signals and bushy-topped trees at nine o’ clock. But that’s no help because you won’t be listening. It is a known medical fact, and it has been so since the dawn of time, that a man will hear the first word and then shut down.”“Why do I need to have a man poke about in my mouth with a sharpened screwdriver when I know that my teeth will last about 50,000 years longer than the rest of me?Nobody dies of tooth decay. It’s always some other part of the body that gives up, but despite this we don’t go to the doctor twice a year demanding a full service. Come on, doc, there’s nothing obviously wrong but I want you to examine every single bit of me minutely. I want X-rays and then I want to see your hygienist, who will spray jets of ice-cold grit up my backside.No, we go to the doctor only when something is wrong and that’s how it should be at the dentist.”“...there’s no such thing as an accident these days. If you trip over a paving stone or eat a dodgy piece of meat, there will be an enquiry, someone will be culpable, and steps will be taken to ensure it doesn’t happen again....Nobody is allowed to die either. George Carman QC, for instance, pegged out at the age of 71, which is not a bad innings. But oh no. His death has been chalked up to cancer as though it might have been avoided if he’d not eaten cheese and broccoli.” That above one, in particular, is very true! I have seen examples of this in my life before and I am sure many others have too.“The human being is programmed to take risks. Had our ancestors spent their days sitting around in caves, not daring to go outside, we’d still be there now....Telling us that speed kills and asking us to slow down is a bit like asking us to ignore gravity.”In other words, half of these precautions people set are pointless. Live life without worrying! Life’s too short to worry about the health defects of cheese and broccoli (quoting back the other point).“I have just finished a book by Philip Roth...it’s almost as though Roth rang the publishers and asked: ‘How long would you like my next novel to be?’ And when they said 250 pages, he said ‘Oh good, I’ve finished.’”In short, this is a brilliantly funny book which can teach you a lot of stuff to apply in life (and a lot of stuff NOT to apply in life!). My advice upon reading this book would be a) separate his jokes from what he ACTUALLY means, and b) don’t be afraid to skim through the marginally more uninteresting parts. Overall, however, thumbs up to this! Absolutely fantastic.",0,0.9983,0.075,0.775,0.15,0.471144657523162,NEGATIVE,0.9996

I was between the ages of 5 and 8 at that time and therefore unaware of the current affairs - appauling, I know. That meant that I didn't know about a lot of the events & happenings that were referenced and ended up a little lost at times2. Attitudes were different. The way he talked about certain things didn't sit right with me in the 2020 landscape. For example; suggesting that Britain wasn't sure about it's identity anymore because of the growing number of Mosques, referring to heterosexual sex between a man and a woman as 'proper sex' and describing graduates from Brunel as 'brown and yellow faces'. In addition to this, he enjoyed discussing women's appearances, the size of their breasts or them being 'too fat' for certain clothing items.Most of the time, in the present, I quite like Jeremy Clarkson. So please don't think I've picked up this book just to criticise and complain about him. There were some points when I found his articles funny. I even find him funny in the present day, however you cannot get away from the fact that he is an upper middle class, rich, white male with some very stereotypical views.I won't be picking up the rest of his books - mostly because I don't like the format.

And apparently a lot is wrong, with a lot of the world, which makes for some entertaining reading. The Top Gear team travels plenty around the world, so Clarkson is well-placed to share some handy hints- if asked to stop on the border between Switzerland and Austria, one should always stop, because ""I have no idea what  'Achtung'  means, except that it usually precedes a bout of gunfire followed by many years of digging tunnels.""As befits newspaper columns, even the chapter titles are catchy (""Men, You Have Nothing to FEAR But Acronyms"") and the fixed length of the columns means that this is a perfect bedside book.
