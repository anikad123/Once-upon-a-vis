0,2200677739,06/17/2020,2.0,"This wasn’t really my cup of tea. Think I’ll stick to Joanne Harris’ thrillers in future. It was ok. That pretty much sums up my feelings toward this book. There were parts I liked - mainly the side characters like Armande, and her grandson Luc. I liked Josephine and her storyline. I didn’t particularly like either of the main characters and there was so much pettiness that is just wasn’t enjoyable and i found myself rushing just to finish. Vianne Rocher and her daughter Anouk have just moved to a small town and opened up a chocolate shop on the first week of Lent in a strong Catholic community. Naturally feathers are ruffled and a lot of the locals give Vianne a wide berth. However there are some that make it their business to give their opinion on Vianne and her way of living. Mainly the Priest and some of his more devout believers. Vianne doesn’t go to church, as is her right, but this doesn’t sit well with the community. At the same time she is quite open about her disregard for the others beliefs. I can see where both sides were coming from, and it made the whole thing uncomfortable. The priest is in the wrong, he sees Vianne as a threat to his congregation, he acts in a way he believes is right - but often frequently doubts his own path. Vianne is also pretty disrespectful. She has every right to live her life as she chooses and not be spoken down to because of it, but surely so do the believers? Unless they are being cruel of course, then they need standing up to. I don’t know, it wasn’t enjoyable and I read for enjoyment. I couldn’t relate to either side really - there were two major extremes shown. Plenty of good themes in here, but I would be lying if I said I’d recommend it. ",72,0.8074,0.079,0.8,0.12,0.5137159137159139,NEGATIVE,0.9995

2,1420635636,10/19/2015,4.0,"""Lansquenet-sous-Tannes, two hundred souls at most, no more than a blip on the fast road between Toulouse and Bordeaux. Blink once, and it's gone. One main street, a double row of dun-colored half-timbered houses leaning secretively together, a few laterals running parallel like the tines of a bent fork. A church, aggressively whitewashed, in a square of little shops. Farms scattered across the watchful land."" Magical and scrumptious, Chocolat is a thrilling delight for the senses. When Vianne Rocher and her imaginative daughter, Anouk, establish themselves and their chocolaterie in the small, French-Catholic town of Lansquenet, they are met with guarded curiosity and veiled hostility. As Vianne slowly begins to attract the townspeople with her winning combination of tantalizing chocolate creations and her warm friendship and unprejudiced acceptance, she sparks the wrath of the self-righteous and judgmental priest, Père Reynaud. Determined to rid the town of both the river gypsies as well as the influence of Vianne Rocher, Père Reynaud readies himself and his church for the battle between what he considers good versus evil. But, there is something quite incongruous and disturbing in his convictions. He loathes the members of his congregation: ""Sheep are not the docile, pleasant creatures of the pastoral idyll. Any countryman will tell you that. They are sly, occasionally vicious, pathologically stupid."" He is arrogant and overly confident: ""When Vianne Rocher sees the power of the church - my influence over every single soul in the community - then she will know she has lost."" Can Vianne and Père Reynaud exist side by side in this small community?The story alternates between the first person narration of Vianne and Père Reynaud, allowing the reader to become quite intimate with the innermost thoughts of these complex characters. With vivid imagery, an entertaining and eccentric cast of secondary characters, and an engaging storyline, author Joanne Harris has created a novel which satisfies not only your senses, but also your intellect. Don't let the backdrop of exquisite chocolates and other heavenly concoctions fool you into thinking there is nothing more to this novel. With its underlying themes of moral perplexities, Chocolat contains more than meets the eye. Note to potential reader: Prior to opening the pages of this book, I highly recommend that you indulge and stock up on a plentiful supply of superior chocolates to be consumed while reading. A last minute search for a leftover Hershey bar or chocolate kiss will leave you a bit disappointed. ",59,0.9794,0.066,0.8,0.135,0.5769470899470899,POSITIVE,0.9936
3,34711819,10/07/2008,4.0,"When Vianne Roche blows into Lansquenet-Sous-Tannes, a sleepy French town, on the tail of carnival she brings with her a touch of witchcraft and huge gobs of humanity. Accompanied by her daughter, Anouk, her imaginary pet rabbit, and a wealth of knowledge not only of how to make the finest confections, but how to see into people’s souls, she is destined to stir things up. The darkness to her light is the local priest, Francis Reynaud, who makes it his business to try to rid the town of this impure non-believer, and spoil her planned chocolate festival. Vianne’s humanity proves decisive for many in the town, Josephine, who finds the strength to leave her abusive spouse. Gaillume eventually learns to let his sick dog Charley move on. Vianne befriends Amande, an elder practitioner of Vianne’s arts, who welcomes the travelers when they arrive and are rejected by the bigots of the town. She is less successful with the dark Muscat, wife beater and perpetrator of even darker crimes. Most chapters tell Vianne’s story, but some are told through the eyes of Reynaud, as he speaks of his fear, desires and crimes to his comatose predecessor. This is a clear battle between the warmth of a secular or at least non-Christian humanity against the cold disapproval of the church. Harris has made her demons quite dark, but allows a glimmer of humanity to peep through. We have a sense, at least, of why they may have fallen so far from the path of truth. Vianne is sometimes a bit too quick to judge, and if she does indeed become aware of that the fact that the author allows her a flaw or two adds to her humanity. The book was engaging, magical, both literally in its subject matter and in the beauty of its telling.

I loved Lansquenet, the characters, the lovely prose; everything! Basically the story looms around chocolates being an indulgence and a sin and the local priest seeing Vianne and her chocolate shop as the evil that has come to break the lent and prayers of the townsfolk. The descriptions will make you yearn for chocolates and hot chocolate drinks. That’s a guarantee because I don’t even love chocolates that much. I had unbearable cravings.Strengths:-Atmospheric (you might want to bathe in chocolates)-Magical (oh, Lovely)-Strong characters (all of them touched my heart. They were written to perfection)-Themes of religion, superstition, prejudice towards gypsies, the idea of Home to those who are always on the run etcI had forgotten how the book was and the movie had imprinted itself in my thoughts. I didn’t know (or rather remember) both the stories were different. OH MY GOd!! WHYYY? I kept screaming in my head, ‘’ Joanne, follow the movie. FOLLOW the movie.’’ But yeah, nothing happened. Don’t get me wrong. I LOVED the book. I kept reading searching for A’s party because it is one of the BEST scenes in the movie. Ah! It isn’t there in the book. Roux? I refuse to believe that the gypsy’s story turns out the way it does in the book. Movie please?The book is good, the movie is good too.

6,124335148,10/01/2010,2.0,"Let me start this review by saying I have never seen the film version of Chocolat. Therefore, I started reading this with no preconceived notions. (Well, no more than usual, anyway.)I liked Chocolat but there were several glaring annoyances that ruined it for me.I did not appreciate the ""chocolate lovers vs. churchgoers"" plot. Casting a priest in the role of the villain irritated me. (I echo the others who say this is overdone.) Even so, I think the priest could have been redeemed. If only he had worked through his guilt and developed a good sense of humour and humility. But, nooo... that would never do. Because religious figures can never have true faith. *rolls eyes*And the most unforgivable sin: I never really felt anything for the characters... No love or sympathy. Except maybe Guillaume. I liked him.Also, the moral of this book seemed to be: ""Indulge yourself! Do what feels right! (Even if you consequently die/get pregnant/shame yourself forever.)"" Yeah. I'm not really digging that moral.Yet, I could not dislike this book. It was strangely addicting. Reading it was like eating a confection you know is not very good when compared with something of a higher calibre, but you keep mindlessly eating it anyway though you're not sure why.Oh!

8,1966604799,01/14/2018,5.0,"Chocolat is a contemporary novel with a few fantasy elements. I really liked the setting, which is one of most beautiful and immersive settings I've read about lately. This is the second time I have read the book. It was worth rereading, but not amazing enough for me to read it a third time, most likely.The beginning: We came on the wind of the carnival. A warm wind for February, laden with the hot greasy scents of frying pancakes and sausages and powdery-sweet waffles cooked on the hot plate right there by the roadside, with the confetti sleeting down collars and cuffs and rolling in the gutters like an idiot antidote to winter. There is a febrile excitement in the crowds that line the narrow main street, necks craning to catch sight of the crêpe-covered char with its trailing ribbons and paper rosettes. Anouk watches, eyes wide, a yellow ribbon in one hand and a toy trumpet in the other, from between a shopping basket and a sad brown dog. We have seen carnivals before, she and I; a procession of two hundred and fifty of the decorated chars in Paris last Mardi Gras, a hundred and eighty in New York, two dozen marching bands in Vienna, clowns on stilts, the Grosses Tetes with their lolling papier-mâché heads, drum majorettes with batons spinning and sparkling. But at six the world retains a special luster. A wooden cart, hastily decorated with gilt and crêpe and scenes from fairy tales. A dragon's head on a shield, Rapunzel in a woolen wig, a mermaid with a cellophane tail, a gingerbread house all icing and gilded cardboard, a witch in the doorway, waggling extravagant green fingernails at a group of silent children... At six it is possible to perceive subtleties that a year later are already out of reach. The plot:Vianne Rocher and her daughter Anouk move to the French village of Lansquenet, where Vianne sets up a chocolaterie called La Céleste Praline. When the book opens, it is Mardi Gras. They arrive in town during the carnival. The shop is on the square opposite the church and clashes with the old-fashioned town's strict observation of Lent.Vianne is the main point-of-view character, but Pere Reynaud, the local priest, who has a vendetta against Vianne, gets some chapters from his point of view. I also enjoyed the secondary characters.The magic:The magic is understated, but it is a bigger deal in the book than the film. The main character knows what each character's favorite chocolates or sweets are as soon as she meets them, because she can read their thoughts. Tarot cards play a role, although they may or may not actually reveal the future. The antagonist: Reynaud is great, and I don't think he's a cartoon villain. This is a gray hats vs white hats type of conflict. The film made the mayor the antagonist instead, so if you have only seen the movie you might want to check out the book version. The ending: The ending is bittersweet, but not too sad, and it leaves a few loose ends. In contrast, the film comes closer to tying things up in a neat little bow. (Softening the impact of a bittersweet ending is not exactly new in film adaptations, so I really should have expected it. Stardust by Neil Gaiman comes to mind.)",28,0.893,0.074,0.831,0.095,0.4288460510682733,NEGATIVE,0.7546
9,786994849,12/10/2013,4.0,"I enjoyed reading this book very much. A little bit of magic, good people, bad people, gypsies, little songs in French, an imaginary friend, love, loss, mystery and more chocolate drink than I could have imagined. The names of the candies made my mouth water. The story made me laugh at things a little girl can say it made me cry over an old man and his old dog. It made me think about what it means to hear someone say that they had lived a good life and how they wanted that life to end on their own terms.I loved the little French town, Lansquenet-sous-Tannes, that Vianne and her daughter Anouk found themselves in after the carnival was over. She was there to open a little candy shop. She called it La Celeste Praline Chocolaterie Artisanale.There are two first person narrators of this story. One is Vianne and the other is the priest, Monsieur Renynauld. Vianne tells the story to us, the reader, and the Monsieur tells his to someone called only ""mon pere"". I liked it. It added a mystery to the story, that slowly unfolded.It was a good story.

I thought the book was anti-religious and anti-Catholic, specifically. I am not of the thought or feeling that anyone has to be religious by any means, people can believe what they want. But when those of different belief systems have to put down others to make themselves feel wise or superior (ie, refer to religious people as those who believe in fairy tales), it is counter productive to the message that we should all be accepting of others' differences (as I thought was a main theme of the book), and turns the author and main character into hypocrites.",22,0.7839,0.036,0.881,0.083,0.4459259259259259,NEGATIVE,1.0
13,52469514,04/13/2009,5.0,"""I believe that being happy is the only important thing. Happiness. Simple as a glass of chocolate or torturous as the heart. Bitter. Sweet. Alive.""If you've watched the movie from a few years back and you've only decided just now to pick up the book where the movie was based on, prepare to be surprised (although in what way exactly, I leave it to you). I can hardly believe that a novel so richly packed with meaning could be so relatively short. Harris' prose here is at its finest, as we follow the narratives of Vianne, the free-spirited chocolate-creating witch, and Reynaud, the guilt-stricken oppressive village priest. Young widow Vianne Roche's mouthwatering bonbons, steaming mugs of liqueur-laced cocoa and flaky cream-filled patisserie don't earn her a warm welcome from the stern prelate of Lansquenet-sous-Tannes. In Francis Reynaud's zeal to enforce strict Lenten vows of self-denial, he regards his sybaritic neighbor with suspicion and disdain. It is Lent, the priest has decreed abstinence, deprivation. Yet, Vianne's shop is a ""red-and-gold confection,"" her window a proliferation of truffles, pralines, candied fruits, hazelnut clusters, candied rose petals, all there to tempt Reynaud's parishioners. He sees it as a disgrace, a degradation of the faith, and eventually preaches against Vianne from his pulpit.Undaunted, Vianne garners support from the town's eccentrics, chiefly Armande Voizin, the oldest living resident, a self-professed sorceress who senses in Vianne a kindred spirit. A fun-loving band of river gypsies arrives, and a colorful pageant unfurls.Each narrative is uniquely told, with personality quirks inherent to each, and each narrative can be subtly imperfect - Reynaud slowly descends into madness, as does his precise narrative; Vianne's fear of weakness and displacement causes her to falsely claim that she never cries, causes her to state a yearning to move on which does not exist, and causes her to doubt her own importance to her lover Roux - creating a tantalizing problem for the reader: do we believe Vianne or do we believe Roux and his actions? The problem is - like Vianne's chocolates - delicate and bitter-sweet, with possibilities abounding on either side.Beautifully drawn characters become very real. My favorites were Anouk, Vianne's utterly delightful child (not to be without her imaginary rabbit friend, Pantoufle); Guillaume who comes out of his shell after the death of his beloved dog, Charly; and of course Mme. Armande Voizin who was reunited with her grandson even under the close scrutiny of her self-important daughter. I was most touched in a jarring way of the domestic conflict between Josephine Muscat and that of her husband. I cheered for her when she finally found the inner strength to leave him for good and live her own life. ""Places all have their characters, and returning to a city you've lived before is like coming home to an old friend. No, places do not lose their identity, however far one travels. It is the heart that begins to erode after a time.""A surprising yet fitting denouement caps this deftly told tale of lust, greed and love. Francophiles will be drawn to the evocative descriptions of daily village life, while gourmands revel in the mouth-watering descriptions of chocolate preparation. ""Chocolat"" is a heart warming and enjoyable story.

It was a story of substance with a touch of magical realism. The ""winds"" bring Vianne Rocher & her daughter to a tight small French community whose lives revolve around the church. Their insulated lives makes them suspicious of others especially those who did not adhere to the teachings of the church or participate in the services. The story eventually pits the priest against Vianne( the two voices in the novel), not quite ""good vs evil"" but a tense battle of wills of an intolerant man against a non-judgmental woman who seeks to bring happiness and pleasure through her Chocolaterie to the townspeople. The timing of the opening of her shop during Lent, a time of fasting, and reflection, sets the stage for that battle. There are some stock characters but they fit nicely into the plot and move the story forward. I got invested in the peeling back of their lives. And what about the chocolates? Although chocolate abounds and are delicious in the descriptions making one's mouth water, it really is just the backdrop as the layers of the story unfold.Vianne's philosophy could probably be summed up in the following quote:  I believe that being happy is the only important thing.

He thought it looked interesting so he settled down to watch, but promptly fell asleep. This is nothing new, but without me there to keep nudging him awake he missed the movie. After I teased him enough about that, I told him how I had the book and its sequel and that our chat made me want to re-read them both. I had to look up the name of the sequel and in doing that, I learned about the third and fourth titles that feature the same characters, so of course I had to order used copies of them and have a surprise binge read! It took me more time to read this book than I expected, but of course I was dealing with a most unusual and distracting week. Once I got to the point of turning off the live feeds and looking around to see the world was still intact, I did a happy dance and then immersed myself in the story of Vianne Rocher, her daughter Anouk, and the changes they bring to a small town in France.There are so many layers to this book. It is a story of a strong woman who has a different way of living her life. This fact creates fear in many people, especially those who approach life in a rigid, unforgiving manner. The local priest believes from the beginning that Vianne is an enemy of decency; he creates for himself the task of exposing her as the evil witch he believes her to be. But some of the people in the town allow themselves to become acquainted with Vianne. Many are afraid, and many others are suspicious merely because she is Not From There. But she is such a gentle, friendly soul.....and don't forget the chocolate! Just reading about the treats Vianne creates will drive a chocolate lover into raptures! And there is a grand dinner late in the book that rivals Babette's feast for luxuriousness.So we have a theme of The Other, which also includes the 'river people', those travelers who live on boats and don't feel the need for roots in any one spot. They live freely, and Vianne is like them, blowing in on one wind and out again on another. But will she stay in Lansquenet forever? Is it time to ignore the breezes that whisper about the need to move on? I imagine this is a question every rover faces at some point in their lives. Mother - daughter relationships, respect for the elderly, hypocrisy in organized religion (whether by those who preach it or those who pretend to live by its rules), and secrets that twist people tighter the longer they try to bury them, finding the courage to live your own life. These are a few other layers found in this rich book.

21,1359901666,08/10/2015,5.0,"Chocolat was exactly the kind of novel I needed at the moment. I discarded books left and right, I was in the mood for something literary and after re-watching the movie - I settled on this one. I decided to savor it as one would a piece of chocolate, slowly, letting it melt into my mouth so that I could absorb the flavor better.The book is similar to the movie and yet very different - surprisingly I like both in their own way. It was a beautiful novel, full of magic, luscious descriptions of chocolate and other confections, and human relationships. It was hard to remember that this novel is set in modern times and not back in the day. I think I prefer the movie villain as the book's villain is a bit too typical. Father Francis is everything I despise about the church and the reason I no longer go, a man convinced of his own piety and holiness while blaming everyone for their sins without actually attempting to save them. I especially can't forgive him for Josephine. The bastard knew what her husband did to her and yet he still pleaded for her to go back to him, until the husband shows his colors in public. How's leaving your extremely abusive husband breaking the sanctity of marriage, but beating your wife acceptable? And of course, everyone in town knows and no one does anything until it's almost too late. Sanctimonious assholes.The novel ends on a bittersweet note and yet there is a promise of good things to come.

The story itself concerns a single mother, Vianne Rocher, who comes with her six year old daughter to live in a small French village. She quickly opens a chocolaterie called 'La Celeste Praline' during Lent. Vianne herself is irreligious and gets into conflict with the village's priest, Father Renaud. He is a menacing presence throughout the book. Vianne is a free spirit whose mother raised her in a most unconventional way. Her mother was a believer in magic, tarot cards and spirits. Whether Vianne herself possesses some magical abilities is a question mark. To be sure, she is intuitive and sensitive. How she frees up many of the (repressed) villagers to lead happier lives becomes the crux of the story.French words and atmosphere permeate the novel.

38,1306197374,06/12/2015,3.0,"Food porn at its best, Chocolat is magical, mischievous and original… but not nearly as good as I remember it. Everything the novel falls short of is portrayed beautifully in the exquisite 2000 film adaptation. (And… Johnny Depp. Say no to that, I dare you!) Although the novel is immersive and atmospheric, the film enhances the ambience and narrative into a much more compelling piece. Joanne Harris' contemporary depiction was usurped in favour of a charming 60s setting - a pivotal decision, I think. Harris disclosed that she was warned the novel was “too old fashioned” to sell, and I completely agree on the old fashioned bit; I struggled to contextualise this. The language and the plot itself felt archaic and I was completely convinced it was set in the 1950s, maybe the 60s - until microwavable pizza (yeuch) made an appearance. On a more elemental level, the film adaptation also contextualises both Vianne herself and the magical realism. If you can contextualise magical realism, that is. In the novel, Vianne’s backstory is ambiguous and left conveniently hazy whereas the adaptation meant the notion of her lifestyle made some sense. Don’t get me wrong, I like a bit of ambiguity, but unless it’s Heathcliff, I need some background knowledge on a character.I also don’t appreciate how polarising this was: Catholicism vs. Paganism. The Church was very obviously made out to be the villain of the story whereas everybody else revered Vianne, if only for her optimism and whimsical morals. Why not live on every whim and desire, take every indulgence, succumb to every desire... Look, I’d love to, honey - but the world doesn’t work like that. Whereas the glorious, free-spirited, airy fairy Vianne is the stereotype of optimism, the straitlaced, controlling priest’s POV was very, very priest-y, almost laughably so. I felt like I was reading propaganda in that sense.But the prose is beautiful. I have never gotten so hot and bothered reading descriptions of chocolate and pastries. Oh my. The quality of Chocolat for me lies in the superficial - this is a sensuous piece that leaves the senses reeling.

I've owned at least 2 copies of the book, and was fortunate enough to see Joanne Harris speak at the Ottawa Writer's Festival in 2010, where she signed one of them for me.Anyway, having just finished George Simenon's brutal 'The Snow Was Dirty', I thought 'Chocolat' would be the perfect antidote, with it's powerful message of love, unity, and compassion, all wrapped up in a delicious chocolate coated swirl. However, I conveniently forgot about the less desirable elements of the story: domestic abuse, the intolerance of the catholic priest (who views pretty much everything and everyone as an affront to himself and his religion), the petty close-minded villagers who use their religion as a means of subjugating others, and the ongoing destructive discrimination against the gypsies.Every story obviously needs conflict and Chocolat is no exception, but I found it surprisingly stressful in several places. Although I hasten to add that's more about my mental state right now as we endure Pandemic Year 2. There were a few times where it was reminiscent of watching something scary as a kid, and peeking out at the television from behind the safety of a cushion (I'm looking at you old Doctor Who!). Unfortunately, reading doesn't exactly lend itself to that approach ;) Long story short, Chocolat is a beautiful and wonderfully written tale. The book overflows with memorable characters, and I dare anyone to read it and NOT fall in love with Vianne Rocher. I firmly believe most people's lives would benefit by having someone like her in them. There are lots of uplifting and lovely moments to counteract the small minded bigotry and intolerance, and it's both heartwarming and life-affirming.

There is a febrile excitement in the crowds that line the narrow main street, necks craning to catch sight of the crêpe-covered char with its trailing ribbons and paper rosettes.""  And so is Lansquenet-sous-Tannes ' greeting to Vianne Roucher and her daughter, Anouk. She dares to open her Chocolat boutique right across from Père Reyaund's Church.

I see the struggle between Vianne and Reyaund as a conflict between those in Power and those the Powerful govern. Reyaund has imprinted HIS values and morals upon those dwelling in Lansquenet. And like the Powerful elite, he shows disdain for his flock. He doesn't know them, but yet HE knows what's best for them. Catholicism and his position as country priest just gives him the cover to do so. I loved the magic and magical transformations of the many characters that Vianne touched with her sweet confections.

On reread, I suspect a good part of the reason why the movie version is set in the 1950s is that it's easier to buy a nobleman having that much power over his small town community than it is to accept a priest having that much power over his small town community in the late 1990s. It may also have something to do with the domestic violence that takes place in one subplot of the book and the prejudice towards the itinerant population. Just put a nice, 1950s glow on it, and the audience will say ""Oh, that's just how things were back then!"" and move on. In short, the book is absolutely incredible, and I love all of these characters.

It's vastly different to the film of the same name - quite why the film makers decided to take a story set in the late 1990s featuring a feud between Vianne and the local priest and instead set it in the 1950s as a feud between Vianne and the local nobleman/mayor is beyond me - and by ""different"", I mean ""better"". The characters are full of life, the setting is marvelous, and every character is hiding a secret of some description. As the story unfolds, the secrets are gradually revealed, adding depth and colour to the characters' lives. I love Harris' writing style, the way she manages to make the mundane seem rich and slightly fantastical. So yeah. Go read it. Just don't expect it to be like the film...",6,0.9888,0.052,0.797,0.152,0.4998958333333333,POSITIVE,0.9999
49,674540780,07/22/2013,5.0,"This book falls somewhere between 5 stars and an eternal firmament of them. It is definitely the best book I've read this year, and I am only sorry that it has taken so many years to discover it. I saw the film a number of years ago and much as I liked it, I would have to say the book is better, if incredibly different. Don't expect quite the light hearted sense of the cinematic version, however, because you will be disappointed.In the film, Vianne's antagonist is the mayor; in the book, he is the village priest -- which creates a much more complex and layered exploration of the nature of personal freedom and religious choice than is evident in the film. Having been born, washed and baked in the RC faith, I recognized Vianne's struggle for what it was: not a repudiation of the faith, but a wider acceptance of the world, within a personal realm of belief. Once we start discounting other faiths, other belief systems, other races, the world deteriorates into chaos. If we allow ourselves to embrace the ""other"", then suddenly the world opens an infinite realm of possibilities. Harris handles this topic with incredible perspicuity and lucidity -- so beautifully managed, in fact, that she quite takes my breath away at times with her insight and wisdom.Quite apart from her sagacity on religion, the book is pure magic. It's a fairy tale, a fable, a morality play all in one. It delivers everything, including the (metaphorical) cherry on top. Harris's words are as delicious as all the mouth watering confections that she allows Vianne to create and I rolled each sentence around in my head with the same enjoyment as any of the villagers experienced her confections!",6,0.992,0.031,0.79,0.179,0.5408333333333333,POSITIVE,1.0

The descriptions of the chocolate shop were enchanting, making the reader thirst for the wonderful chocolate and imagine the creations in front of them. The background and descriptions of the French town were very well done, and created an atmosphere.Vianne Rocher’s journey through the book was well paced, each hurdle she encountered with was met with courage. Strong friendships were formed in the chocolate shop, and as Vianne became more familiar with the locals, they supported one another with warmth and kindness. My few criticisms, which knocked one star from my review were the characters, yet believable individually, were hard to keep track of as there were so many.

It's an entrancing book: I didn't used to want to admit I'd read it, with its sensuality and femininity and the barely-there magic, but I now admit to it gladly -- I've read almost all of Joanne Harris' output, and I love the way she writes. There's something moreish about it, no matter what she's writing about. A lot of her stories have a similar sort of narrative arc; I wouldn't read too many of them back to back. But it's a comforting warm world to come to, with the domestic and yet magical delights of food front and centre, when you need somewhere.I actually read it this time with an astonishing amount of sympathy for Reynaud, perhaps prompted by the knowledge that there is now a third book in which he crops up again. I'm looking forward to reading that, either over the next few days or in July, when I'm (blech) recovering from my operation.

Vianne and her young daughter, Anouk, move to Lansquenet hoping to find themselves a permanent home. However, instead they find a criticizing community in which anything not considered normal is outcast. Chocolat, by Joanne Harris, occurs during the course of Lent and ends on Easter Sunday. The town’s priest, Francis Reynaud, refers to Vianne as his enemy, a witch, and as a bad influence on the residents of Lansquenet. Conflict between Reynaud and Rocher arises when she schedules a chocolate festival for Easter Day. Along the way Vianne is constantly unintentionally contradicting Reynaud by telling people that you should do what makes you happy, as a opposed to following the laws of the church. Joanne Harris, the author of Chocolat, has written many others books, such as Runemarks, Sleep, Pale Sister, Five Quarters of the Orange, The Evil Seed, and The Lollipop Shoes. 	There were several components that I enjoyed while reading the novel. The characterization, descriptions, and humor were among these components. The characterizations and descriptions make you feel like a real resident of Lansquenet. The descriptions greatly captivate the reader’s attention, especially when Vianne Rocher’s delectable sweets are described, or the lavish parties celebrated by Vianne Rocher, Armande Voizin, (the eldest, and most mischievous member of the community), the river gypsies, and other Lansquenet residents. Harris’s characterizations leave the reader feeling a sense of friendship and even love for the various characters of the novel. Even the distasteful acts of Reynaud, who is resented by the majority of the town, makes the reader yearn even more to understand him. Also, the mother daughter humor, the sly remarks from Armande, and the ironic ending of the novel add to its humorous entertainment. One thing that I disliked was the usage of French in parts of the story. Many of the recipes Vianne makes along with some words, names and phrases made portions of the novel difficult to understand. Overall there is only one main weakness in the novel. The element that I thought was especially weak is the general repetition. Chapters where Francis Reynaud is the narrator always discuss similar ideas and situations: his disapproval toward Vianne, Armande, and the river gypsies, his one-sided conversations with his previous priest, who is now in a comma, and his continuation of decreasing all pleasure in his life in order to live out the Lenten vow. The repetition of these things made the novel mildly boring during the middle. Harris could have added in more story lines from the characters’ lives to give the monotonous parts more excitement. By the end of the book you don’t want the book to be over, because that’s when the majority of the action occurs. I felt like the novel really puts you into the lives of the people of Lansquenet by showing repetition and routine. However, more action throughout the novel would have made this a much more entertaining read. Chocolat is a charming, humorous, entertaining tale about keeping, and mending basic human relationships, especially in times of struggle and grief. The conflict of religion versus happiness is also a main theme in the novel. The author does an incredible job with characterization, and description. Despite its weakness of redundancy, the novel is magical and fun to read, as well as presents key themes that play a role in everyday life. Anyone who enjoys reading books mixed with romance, comedy, and drama, will love this novel. It will widen your beliefs as well as your pallet!

60,2725458681,03/12/2019,5.0,"It's taken me twenty years to get around to reading Chocolat by Joanne Harris, and now that I've finished it I'm determined not to leave it as long to read the rest of the series.The story follows chocolatier Vianne Rocher as she arrives in the small Catholic town of Lansquenet with her daughter, Anouk, and sets about opening and running a chocolaterie during the period of Lent. At first the locals are cautious and in some cases even hostile towards Vianne, but slowly they begin to frequent her shop, much to the chagrin of the local priest, Père Francis Reynaud. Enflaming Père Reynauld's anger even further is the arrival of a group of river gypsies, who the locals see as trouble but who are openly welcomed by Vianne and the town's matriarch, Armande Voizin.The narrative alternates between Vianne and Reynaud's points of view, and quickly establishes the conflict between the staid rigidity of Reynaud's religious beliefs and Vianne's more whimsical openness. The Père sees Vianne and her chocolaterie as a force of evil, invading and corrupting his flock and his town, while Vianne herself simply wants to settle down with her daughter and spread a little happiness.There's a fair amount of magic in this book, but it's a subtle magic, a magic of the heart and the soul. Vianne is able to read her customers, identifying their favourite confection with almost absolute perfection. Through the narrative we learn that her mother was a card reader, constantly in fear of a shadowy figure known simply as the Black Man. This fear resulted in Vianne and her mother being constantly in motion, never staying in one place for long. Even after the death of her mother Vianne has felt the need to keep moving, dragging her daughter along behind her despite a desire to eventually settle down.Secrets also play a large part in the narrative. Père Reynauld's secrets darken his religious fervour and guide his conflict with Vianne. Then there's the mystery of Vianne's past, a subtle suggestion that perhaps her mother may have stolen a child and made that child her own. The townsfolk have their own secrets, some shameful, some upsetting. As Vianne gains the trust and friendship of the town some of those secrets are brought to the fore, bringing conflicts with them.Finally, this is a book about letting go. Letting go of the child you cherish, letting go of your preconceptions, letting go of anger and hatred. It's about letting those we love make their own decisions and forgiving those who hurt us, whether by choice or accident. And it's about letting go of those we love when it's their time to move on.It's a long time since I saw the movie so I can't make any sort of reasonable judgement between the two. What can I say with certainty is that this is a book full of emotion and one I will carry with me for a long time. A solid five stars.",5,-0.9847,0.143,0.759,0.098,0.4902695105820107,POSITIVE,0.9998

When they arrive at the village of Lansquenet, Vianne is travel-worn and weary of heart. She longs to finally stop moving and settle down, to give her daughter the gift of carefree childhood. Luckily for her, she opens a small chocolate shop and the village folk seems to love it.But there are other forces at play: the people who see Vianne as a threat to what Lansquenet stands for.

Vianne can barely grasp the reality of it all, but her chocolate shop has managed to ruffle some very powerful feathers - of people who will stop at nothing to make her dreams come crashing down.Will Vianne be able to survive the ruthlessness of another village, another community? Or will she crumple under pressure and her little chocolate shop will go up in flames in front of her eyes? Read on to know more. But if I'm 100% honest,  Chocolat  isn’t a book that you read.

The village carnival was in full swing ready for lent. Vianne Rocher and her daughter Anouk (thats what they were calling themselves this time), along with Anouk’s imaginary rabbit friend Pantoufle, arrived to join in the celebrations.The village was so small that if you blinked you could miss it. It was located somewhere between Toulouse and Bordeaux. In the heart of the village stood the bright whitewashed building of the village church, Saint Jérôme. The church priest was Father Francis Reynaud.Anouk desperately wanted to stay in the village and Vianne gave in to her demand. She leased the old empty bakery facing the church, which would become ‘La Céleste Praline’ chocolate boutique. Vianne made all the chocolates for her boutique by hand, with a special something added. With the ability to know the desires and secrets of the towns folk and the knowledge of which chocolates would be her customers favourite before they did, some might of called her a witch.Opening a chocolate shop at the start of lent gave Monsieur Reynaud enough evidence to deem Vianne and her daughter evil. He didn’t like outsiders coming to his village and especially those that didn’t attend church. Reynaud decided that he wanted her gone from his town, in fact he didn’t just want her gone but needed her to go. If it meant using underhand tactics to drive her out of the village then so be it, and he had lots of loyal parishioners who would help him. He didn’t however expect Vianne to fight back. A fight between good and evil was fought, but which side was evil really standing on?ReviewJoanne has managed to create a novel that doesn’t feel right being placed in one particularly genre. The book is very thought provoking and you not only get to read the battle between Vianne and Reynaud, but also get to feel the tension that is created in the book between Christianity and Paganism.Vianne is a mysterious woman, with an air of magic surrounding her. Her love for others shines right off the page and you get the sense that she is running from something and that she and Anouk move from place to place. She never opens up fully to anyone about who she is and where they have come from.The book is captivating and unique. It draws you right in to the heart of the story and into the tiny french village with its vivid scenery, colours, smells and even the taste of the chocolates that Vianne makes. There are a lot of diverse characters throughout the book, each with their own personal story to tell. The narrative is told from both Vianne and Reynaud’s opposing views, which gives you an insight in to each side of their story.This was the first book by Joanne Harris that I had read and it captivated me and truly had me absorbed in the plot. I could feel Vianne’s warmness towards others, even those who opposed her. She is a wonderfully created character, and different from most protagonists.

71,1873100460,02/28/2017,5.0,"What a wonderful story.When Vianne Rocher and her daughter Anouk arrive in a small town in France, the rest of the town goes into panic mode. While mother and daughter hope to have finally found a place to call home, the priest and a subset of his congregation are working on moving these two out of town.Vianne opens a chocolate shop at the very beginning of Lent, and it might as well have been a declaration of war against Pere Reynaud. Apparently, no one should indulge during such a time of year. But there is so much more to this story than this fight between Vianne and this priest.Harris brings into question the idea of tolerance: when is tolerance necessary, and what should never be tolerated? When the river gypsies come swinging into town soon after, Vianne notices it's not just her that the town has a problem with. Even with a growing list of clientele, she still faces intolerance from the priest and his groupies. When she refuses to discriminate against the river gypsies, she faces a larger group that does not find her tolerable. Some of this even has an effect on her daughter, whose friends are forbidden to play with her. Even when one of the wives of the town is suspected of being a domestic violence victim, tolerance is called on again. Should she continue tolerating this?This is not a book about Pagans, Catholics, or even chocolate. This is a story of real life situations that we face everyday. In the news there's always stories of hate crimes and discrimination, nothing majorly different from what is happening in this book except for the affiliations of the characters. It may not be the burning of a cross or destroying a cemetery, but it is all there in this book.Besides the real life messages that came out of reading this, I really fell in love with all the characters. I wanted to learn more about Vianne's mother and her rituals. Armande reminded me of my grandmother, stubborn as an ox. Even the way Vianne describes her regulars reminds me of the way we see all of our neighbors in passing. We know most of their stories, but nothing of the emotional weight they carry. There were even times the priest and his followers actually got me so angry, I had to remind myself it's just a book.I really loved this story for everything that it was.

72,3330169301,09/19/2020,4.0,"“We came on the wind of the carnival.” From these very first words, you just know this story will be enchanting. The writing itself wraps you in a warm blanket of poetic charm and eloquence. If I learned anything at all from this book, it is that I am a gypsy/traveler at heart. I have now located the source of my emptiness, the void I cannot fill, my dream of becoming a liberated adventurer and fulfilling my wanderlust. I love a good book with a strong independent female lead, and Chocolat does not disappoint in this aspect. Vianne Rocher meets these qualifications and more. She is free-spirited, open minded, rebellious, ambitious, intuitive, and fearless. I admire her qualities as I see many of them in myself and know them all too well. Though the plot of the story isn’t complex, you get the pleasure of being a part of the development of many of the other characters which uncovers some hidden life lessons. The story mainly balances itself on the fundamentals of temptation/self-indulgence versus abstinence from sin/faith-based restrictions. It also swirls along the concepts of prejudice, the challenges of old age, and even abusive relationships. Hands down though, my absolute favorite character would have to be Armande Voizin. I aspire to be just like her if I live to be her age, strong-minded and strong-willed. She reminds us all that life is too short to waste on meaningless encounters while starving yourself of the many pleasures of life. Apparently, this is the first book of a small series; however, the ending was pleasurable and satisfying enough that I perhaps will not go on to read the other books in the series. This story left me with just the right amount of yearning that was cured by the closure of the last words. Though, I plan to keep the door open for the other books in case I change my mind. However, I do plan on watching the movie again as it has been many years since I first saw it. From what I recall, the movie leads the story in a more romantic way straight into the arms of Johnny Depp but also captures the whimsical characteristics the book so wonderfully blesses us with. One thing I regret the most is not having some quality chocolates nearby while reading this book! So, I highly, highly recommend you plan accordingly! The descriptions of the chocolates leave your mouth watering as you imagine the velvety lusciousness. I had strong cravings for chocolate the entire time!",4,0.9893,0.046,0.813,0.141,0.4960463232912211,POSITIVE,0.9999

Very enjoyable
I really enjoyed reading this book and I'm giving it a 3 1/2 score in the best possible way. As soon as I discovered that one of my favorite movies was a book, I knew I wanted to read it. It was just a matter of finding it on one of my frequent book jaunts, ravishing the clearance wracks at my favorite discount stores. As she rang me out one of the sweet little sales associates commented that this book was one of her favorites and I would enjoy it. I told her how I loved the movie and asked is the ""Johnny Depp"" character was in there. She said, ""..he's in there."" I should have known. Let me first clarify. If you think you've seen the movie and you either don't need to read the book or that they would twin with maybe just a little more elaboration in the book version, I'll say umm... No you still need to read the book. I'm glad I did. Hollywood being Hollywood did glam the movie version up a bit and so the book is quite different. Of course there is more backstory about Vianne and Anouks lives pre arrival into the village. There's more an ere of gypsies and a hint of the good witchery (if that makes sense). There is a dispute over good vs. evil with the most unlikely candidates. And the lovely Roux of the movie is someone all together different in the book. The are all different I'd say. They maybe should have given the precursor that this is a movie based on the book. If you have no knowledge of either book nor movie, here are a few thoughts. This is a delightful book about the gypsy spirit of traveling the world on the waves of the wind. It's about finding happiness. Overcoming ones fears. Learning to be strong. It's abut learning to enjoy the senses and pleasures of life. Oh, did I mention all this through the most decadent, luxurious, mouthwatering chocolate. Come to her shop and Vianne will intuitively give you your favorite and magically it will change your life. I do recommend this to readers of fiction of all types. It's good lite read. Good solid 3 1/2. I will read more books by this author. I really did enjoy it.**Update** I don't own a copy of the movie but looking at clips online. It's all wrong. The book is modern, the movie the 40's or 50's. There is no spinning plate. ",4,0.9759,0.038,0.837,0.125,0.6127131782945737,POSITIVE,0.965

Now that I finally read it, I found the book is just as delicious. Although there are some small deviations in the story line, i.e. revealing the secrets of Monsignor Reynaud and Vianne’s past, the book succeeds in magically enchanting the senses: smell (“wood smoke curling in the air”), touch (“cool hands on forehead…curls tickling my face”), vision (“the greening light at dawn” and Annouk’s red rain coat), sound (the carillon do-si-do-mi-sol), and of course the taste of glossy chocolate! This book fulfilled my expectations of a guilty pleasure read.Favourite quotes:Headscarves and berets are the colour of the hair beneath, brown, black or grey. Faces are lined like last summer's apples, eyes pushed into wrinkled flesh like marbles into old dough. A few children, flying colours of red and lime-green and yellow, seem like a different race. As the char advances ponderously along the street behind the old tractor which pulls it, a large woman with a square, unhappy face clutches a tartan coat about her shoulders and shouts something in the half-comprehensible local dialect"" “At such times I feel I could die for love of her, my little stranger, my heart swelling dangerously so that the only release is to run too, my red coat flapping around my shoulders like wings, my hair a comet’s tail in the patchy blue sky.”""My walk was unsteady as I made my way back to the vestry, and I caught a number of people looking at me strangely. I must be more careful. Gossip abounds in Lansquenet.""""In the pale grey-green of the dawn they looked like war refugees, white-faced, sullenly tying the last remains of their floating circus into bundles. What was garish and magical-tawdry last night is now merely drab, scorched of its glamour. A smell of burning and oil hangs in the mist. A sound of flapping canvas, the hacking of early-morning engines. Few even bother to look at me, going about their business with tight mouths and narrowed eyes.

I've been meaning to read this book for years now, well, since after I watched the film adaptation for the 1st time. And yes, I lost count how many times I watched it... and I can't blame all on Johnny Depp,ahaha.Anyway, it was indeed time to read it, because usually, the book is always a whole lot better than the movie. And in many accounts that happened here, except the romantic part of it. But the story in overral? I enjoyed much more the book!So from page one, I was sucked in to an enchanting world, deliciously magic and atmospheric. Oh and did I mentioned all the chocolate?

*sigh* I lost count the times I was drooling in the pages...the way it's all described, it's an experience in itself. It alludes to all our scents and we can easily grasp the effect of Vianne's magic on her friends/clients.In many ways, I thought the story had lot more depth than in the film, a lot more heart and a lot more mystic. Not so caught up in ""Mayan references"", the story had an even more mysterious magic...and Vianne's story with her mother even more intriguing.Still, I confess I'm still a bit upset of how Roux is different in it and his relationship with Vianne.Another dramatic change it's of Vianne's ""nemesis"", who is in fact Le curé, and it did made a lot more sense to me, than the mayor of the town. It was more dramatic, more intense...I could easily see it happen in another small town, even in my own country, where the church still have such a strong hold in the people.To sum it up,it was a delicious read that made me crave chocolate like a maniac!

76,36671598,11/01/2008,2.0,"I hate to be negative but there was so much in this book that irritated me and spoiled what could have been an excellent tale so I’ll get what I didn’t like out of the way first.What I didn't like.1. The endless description. I love a book with well-written colour and light and this was very well written indeed, but there was WAY too much of it; needlessly, endlessly dragged out so I found myself skipping whole paragraphs searching for the end of it all so I could get back to what the characters were actually meant to be doing and saying.2. The hyper-conscious, witchy, Allende-esque femininity of it all - I am WOOMAN, I am deep and dark and mysterious and full of sooper-seekrit mystic stuff and that - The kind of stuff that never fails to irritate me in any work of fiction.3. It felt very Mary Sueish; Vianne as a super-souped-up, ‘this is who I want to be’ version of the author which I found annoying.4. The smug ending was rubbish; it felt rushed, badly-worked out and just wrong. Pere Reynaud was a shit, but a damaged shit and he deserved better than that.What I did like. I enjoyed the second half of the book much more than the first. It took me 2 weeks to get through the first half, only four days to make it through the second. A plot does eventually emerge out of the primeval mud of over-conscious sensuality and description and I found (to my surprise) that I did want to know what was going to happen to these characters (I could have cared less for the first dozen chapters). In the second half, the style settles down and we got enough of that rich, descriptive lilt to give the story real depth and substance without being too much. If the same tone was consistent throughout I’d be giving this book 3 or 4 stars – but it wasn’t, so I’m not.",4,0.9743,0.077,0.78,0.143,0.4448966408268734,NEGATIVE,1.0

The book on the other hand, is extremely intolerant. It takes a lot to make me uncomfortable, but I was shocked. If you thought the movie was a little harsh on Catholics (I didn’t, but some people did), the book really throws the Catholic church down the stairs. The movie is about unity and acceptance between people who are all good at heart. The book is very different, very polarizing. At no point do we see the priest or staunch Catholics perpetrate any good in this book. They are clear villains. But Vianne, the witch who has opened a chocolate shop during lent, does nothing but good to everyone around her, eventually showing the church the error of its ways. She can literally do no wrong because she is all about love and acceptance (Why deny yourself anything? Why offer things up for lent? Why not live every whim and desire?) and the Catholics are all about denial, hatred and selfishness. Puh-lease. When an author writes something in such a polarizing way, about two real-life religions, I feel like I'm reading propaganda. I can handle criticism of existing religions, but this was a beating of one and a glorification of the other under the guise of storytelling. The author has a right to write what she wants, but I won’t be reading any more of her books.

The story is about Vianne Rocher and her daughter starting anew in a small town. Unfortunately, the priest, Father Reynaud, in the town isn't terribly amenable to strangers in general (an understatement) and especially strangers that don't attend church. This tension sets up the whole story, with very sympathetic Vianne on one side and the-villian-you-love-to-hate on the other. The book is also populated with a number of supporting characters, each of whom is interesting and a bit quirky in their own way.My favorite aspect of the book was Harris' prose - - easy to read, but loaded with wonderfully rendered detail. And when that detail is about my favorite food of all time, chocolate, believe me, I was loving it. She described food with real love, and I ate it up!On the negative side (for me), the story has a bit of a fairy tale quality to it in that Reynaud isn't very multi-dimensional (he's bad), and Vianne has some kind of never exactly explained magical powers that allow her to know things about others. I liked the book in spite of those quibbles, but not because of them.

I found the novel to be a powerful telling of the old ways of Europe before Christianity and how the church feared the pagan ways and made them out to be evil. One part the director kept from the novel about the chocolate festival was the chocolate centrepiece of the goddess holding a sheaf of corn which in the novel makes perfect sense but in the movie, no sense at all.

89,114692030,08/01/2010,2.0,"An older review:It happens every year like clockwork. Exactly five weeks after the first day of school, my doorbell rings.Standing there on my front porch is an adorable little boy or girl holding a lunchpail-sized cardboard box, its handle soggy with nervous sweat. Stacked inside are bars of chocolate. The little urchin takes a deep breath, stares straight ahead in the region of my navel, and launches into a rehearsed speech: “Good-evening-sir-I’m-raising-money-for-my-school-by-selling-candy-bars-these-candy-bars-are-called-the-world’s-best-chocolates-would-you-like-to-buy-one-and-help-me-earn-prizes?”I smile, pat the tike on the head, and fork over five dollars for one candy bar (anything to help that kid win a Nintendo game system). I peel back the foil wrapping, inhale the cocoa aroma, take a bite…then spit it out. Blech! It’s like sinking my teeth into a stick of dietary margarine. Bland, chalky, bittersweet—the five-dollar candy bar isn’t worth the calories.I always end up giving the rest of “the world’s best chocolate” to my daughter, but even she makes those double-blech faces.I tell you this story to give you some idea of how I felt after reading Joanne Harris’ novel Chocolat. It’s got a nice foil wrapping and purports to bear a high literary price tag, but don’t be fooled—it’s nothing but empty calories.The story (which, incidentally, is forthcoming as a movie from Miramax Films) is one of those treacly sentimental fables that give all their characters signposts to carry around while cheerleading Big Messages like “Everyone has a dream, believe in yours” and “In the end, good hearts overcome bad people.”Chocolat (and, no, I’m not forgetting the “e”—it’s the French spelling of the word) is a magical realism novel which, unfortunately, has little of either. Stick with One Hundred Years of Solitude or that other cocoa-flavored novel, Like Water For Chocolate if that’s what you’re after.Harris certainly sets up an interesting conflict in her 306-page novel. An unmarried woman, Vianne Rocher, and her six-year-old daughter move to the tiny French town of Lansquenet to open up a chocolate shop. Unfortunately, it’s the Lenten season and the faithful folks of Lansquenet know they should resist the sinful pleasures of marzipan, candied pralines, truffles and (quelle horreur!) Nipples of Venus.But the townspeople can resist neither the charms of Vianne Rocher nor her sensuously good confections. It soon turns into a sweet holy war: Church vs. Chocolate. To the consternation of the parish priest, Pere Reynaud, the chocolate shop becomes a hubbub of activity—a place for gossips to congregate and a refuge for those seeking shelter from the cruelties of other cold-hearted citizens.When the earthy, free-spirited Vianne decides to hold a pagan Chocolate Festival on Easter Day, the righteous indignation of Pere Reynaud is whipped to a creamy frenzy. Vianne claims she does nothing more than “sell dreams, small comforts, sweet harmless temptations.” To the priest, however, the idea of a chocolate shop setting up business during “the traditional season of self-denial” is “deliberately perverse.” Pere Reynaud, it seems, has some definite sweet-tooth issues he needs to work out in therapy (or confession).Did I mention that the chocolaterie is located directly across the town square from the church? Subtlety is not Harris’ strong suit.What does work best in the novel is Harris’ ability to deliver rich, nougaty descriptions of the chocolate-making process. The author’s biography mentions the fact that she was raised in a sweetshop similar to the one here. She does a marvelous job of recreating the smells and tastes of warm chocolate. Here’s one instance, describing a particularly ornate window display:It is an amazement of riches, glace fruits and marzipan flowers and mountains of loose chocolates of all shapes and colors, and rabbits, ducks, hens, chicks, lambs, gazing out at me with merry-grave chocolate eyes like the terra-cotta armies of ancient China, and above it all a statue of a woman, graceful brown arms holding a sheaf of chocolate wheat, hair rippling. The detail is beautifully rendered, the hair added in a darker grade of chocolate, the eyes brushed on in white. The smell of chocolate is overwhelming, the rich fleshly scent of it that drags down the throat in an exquisite trail of sweetness.It’s hard to read that and not swoon. Diabetics are forewarned to proceed with caution through these pages.Unfortunately, Harris’ delicious syntax gets melted by some poor plot choices. There’s a parade of characters so large and shallow that it’s nearly impossible to form a bond with any of them except Vianne and Pere Reynaud. Most of the others all come from that Hollywood stock of Charming Eccentrics. Perhaps that’s why Miramax scooped up Chocolat—it’s got all those odd folks left over from films like Enchanted April, The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain and Il Postino.The novel is also hampered by shifts in verb tense which are unnecessary and distracting. There’s a sex scene late in the third act which is equally unnecessary and distracting. In fact, there’s so much cleverness and conceit pulling me out of the novel that I wished Ms. Harris had just relaxed, letting herself melt into the fable without forcing me to gag on those emotional stereotypes. It all became too cute and sweet for my tastes.I’m sure there are people who will really like Chocolat. I’m sure there will be readers who exclaim, “This would be perfect for Oprah!” I’m sure there will be those generous critics who compare her to Hawthorne, Hugo and other authors who wrote great fiction of moral and spiritual conflict. As for me, I found it as hard to swallow as an overpriced candy bar.So, this year when my doorbell rings, I won’t answer it.

But with all her kindness, she can be remarkably cruel. She enjoys making Father Reynaud uncomfortable and counts it as a victory every time she does something he disapproves of. Don’t get me wrong, he is not a nice man by any measure. He feels superior to his parishioners and likes the power he has over them. He likes to hold power over himself, too, priding himself on being as devout and sober as possible. He values regulations over love or compassion, which in my opinion is at odds with the Christian faith. When Joséphine Muscat leaves her abusive husband, he wants her to go back to him because of their marriage, while there is no reason to assume that the husband will ever be anything but a brute. Still, I don’t think you need to attack and ridicule the faith of the entire village to address the problems within it. Someone as free-spirited and open-minded as Vianne claims to be must see the good things faith and devotion can bring: hope, love, comfort, community. Instead, she sabotages church life and doesn’t stop until Father Reynaud is utterly humiliated.(...)The story’s criticism of the way Father Reynaud’s wields excessive social control over this little village is fair, he deserved to fall from his pedestal. The priest takes advantage of his holy position to exercise a disproportionate amount of power. But the book would have been better if there was some kind of redemption for the priest, showing that some compassion and joy could bring new life to a once strong but now rigid faith. After all, he is just a man, probably the only educated man in his village. It’s not so strange that he feels lonely or that he, as time passed, has started to look down upon his neighbours. He follows de traditions of the priests before him, especially looking up to his direct predecessor, who led the parish when Reynaud was a boy in the village himself. Perhaps all he needs is someone to challenge him to be better. But the story doesn’t give him a second chance. This is only part of the review written by the lovely Jo.

95,1952791505,03/28/2017,5.0,"2021: What a busy time. I've hardly been reading anything at all because of so many changes in my life - the wind is certainly blowing, and sometimes nearly blowing me away. But I kept my annual commitment to re-read Chocolat and I am so very glad I did. It is like visiting an old friend where I can just sit back and listen and let them tell me all about themselves over again. I wasn't as attentive to any one part of the story, but just felt a warm comforting hug from reading this book I know so well again. 2020: This year I re-read Chocolat as the world completely upended as part of the global COVID-19 pandemic. I was much more attentive to the patterns of community and connection in this story. As humans we crave and require connection, and those connections are shifting. So food, and sharing food, instead of sharing physical space, is one way that we as humans are connecting currently. 2019: As a discipline through Lent I decided to re-read Chocolat by following the days of the entries in the book. This made the reading much more intentional than I usually practice. Because I've been re-reading this so many times I often zoom through quickly. This time, stretching it out over nearly 50 days helped me to note different portions of the story and realize some of the time lapses or rapidity of some activity. Still appreciated this book as a part of my annual Lenten practice. 2018: This is not the year for re-reading for me. Like Pride and Prejudice, this didn't pack the enjoyment that it has in other years. Still, it is certainly one of my favorite books ever - and re-reading, combined with re-watching the movie each year, is a wonderful discipline. 2017: This year's reading of Chocolate flew by as I read it on a spring break service trip to Houston, TX. Reading it was like visiting an old friend - I knew all of the tones and themes that would develop in the conversation, but I wasn't sure what would strike me the most about our time together this time around. This reading, I felt more empathy with the priest character who struggles to offer guidance to his congregation. Though he is miss-guided in his need to control the movement of the spirit and of the future, I can be sympathetic to his desire to see people invest in their faith more. This year I am also more anxious to re-read the two other books in the trilogy. 2015: I try to re-read Chocolat each year at Lent, and this year I finished it on Ash Wednesday, which felt appropriate. I've loved the film since it came out, and when I stumbled upon the book while re-shelving fiction at the Gale Borden library in Elgin, IL, I eagerly took it home and devoured it like a delicious bar of European chocolate. It is so different from the film in tone and plot. Yet the film captures the important sense that I pick up from the book; the only way to find true happiness is to know, accept and connect deeply to one another as humans. Harris writes characters that are enchanting, and I've found this to ring true through every one of her works. This year I've recommended Chocolat to our Society of Heroines book group, and am so glad for the enthusiastic interest it has sparked among a wide variety of my friends. This is certainly an old favorite that I've re-read, and will re-read many times over.",3,0.9991,0.027,0.762,0.21,0.5389321789321788,POSITIVE,0.994
96,16646030,02/28/2008,4.0,"The first is Chocolat by Joanne Harris. This book was given to me by Rebecca at our book club Christmas party book exchange. I was very excited to get it because I have been wanting to read it for a long time. I am a Francophile (I think that's the word) I love all things French. I took French in High School and at BYU. I have always wanted to go to France. I like French food. You get the idea. This book was a great armchair travel book. It takes place in a small village in France. It is filled with quirky, colorful, beret-wearing characters. The main character is a woman named Vianne. She and her small daughter come to a small rural village to start a new life. She opens a chocolate shop, charms the villagers, and ends up setting herself at odds with the local priest of the Catholic Church. He feels that she is decadence personified to say the least. Oh--did I mention that Vianne might have magical powers?? The plot thickens...or should I say the chocolate thickens!! Do not read this book if you are trying to lose weight. You will CRAVE chocolate!! Chocolate is truly the main character of this book. Thank goodness I read it when I was sick and nauseous. But even that didn't stop the chocolate craving. I roused myself from my sick bed and staggered into the kitchen to scarf down some Valentines candy. Did it taste good? No! Did I feel worse? Yes! But I was powerless against the subliminal--ok maybe not subliminal--very overt message to EAT CHOCOLATE NOW!! This was a book that left me warm and cozy. I felt like I had gone on a small jaunt to France and interacted with the local color.There were just a couple of things that I didn't like. There were three different story lines that I felt would've been really interesting to explore and would've given the book a few interesting twists. These story lines were mentioned and then dropped. That was too bad. But all in all I rate it Good. Actually VERY GOOD! A twist or turn would've given it an Excellent rating. But I really liked the book and recommend it to anyone who loves France, chocolate, and cozy reads. Thanks Rebecca!P.S. I have never seen the movie so I don't know how it compares.",3,0.994,0.05,0.778,0.172,0.4904308160974829,POSITIVE,0.6207
97,1498639153,01/06/2016,4.0,"Yes, I like Joanne Harris's work. It seems a shame that this book didn't have some tempting recipes at the end for those of us who drooled over Vianne's chocolate treats. ""Mmmmm."" ""What's forbidden always tastes better anyway,"" declared Armande, wiping froth from her mouth in satisfaction. ""But this""--she sipped again, greedily--""this is better than anything I remember, even from childhood. I bet there are ten thousand calories in here. More.""There is much to like here. Vianne is sort of an enchantress, provocative and a bit daring, but she uses her powers to make people happy. I would like to read more about her and her daughter, Anouk. But, Armande was my favorite character. I loved Armande's wit and her sassiness, and her determination to live life on her own terms, as well as (view spoiler)[how to spend her last birthday. (hide spoiler)].I could quibble with a few things. I really felt like this story should have taken place in the 1950's, or maybe the 60's. I'm not quite convinced that a priest would be threatened by a Chocolate Festival in more recent times. That said, I love the underlying essence of the story. You only live once, and a few pleasures along the way make life truly enjoyable. ",3,0.9941,0.045,0.704,0.251,0.496031746031746,POSITIVE,0.9983
98,56852651,05/21/2009,3.0,"Reading this book was a challenge because every time Harris began describing all of the various confections that her heroine, Vianne Rocher, was concocting like some alchemist of cacao, I had to put the book down and procure some sweets. Fortunately our friend works at a French patisserie and was able to help abate this impulse quite nicely.The main crux of the story surrounds the conflict between Vianne, daughter of a gypsy, ardent pagan and free-thinker, and the acetic priest of a small town. There's much back-and-forth about the holiness of austerity versus the sensual delight of living, which grows old very quickly. However, the descriptions of the food are so resplendent that I felt somewhat illicit in imagining them. This book is delicious through and through, though like the confections with which Vianne makes her living, you feel a little sick to your stomach if you binge too quickly on it.",3,0.9735,0.032,0.791,0.177,0.482454648526077,POSITIVE,0.9766

In most ways this is a normal book about people; their single mindedness, their self importance and their struggles to comprehend life outside their own bubbles. When Vivienne and her daughter come to town she brings a fresh breath of air, attitude and a way for people to come together - chocolate! The magic in this book is not just in the spices in the air or tastes on the tongue, but in the way that people learn to understand and live with each other, through simple shared delights. A pleasure to read and a book I would suggest to anyone who needs a little comfort in their lives.

But it did not. Although the story is not exactly the same, it definitely gives the same feels and made me realise how good the movie adaptation is.I really enjoyed reading this book. The story is bittersweet, like some of the chocolates in Vianne’s chocolaterie. It is told from two perspectives, Vianne’s, as she moves into a small French village, and Reynaud’s. Reynaud is the village priest, who objects to all Vianne stands for in his mind.The author portrays the people of the village and their emotions wonderfully well and I could really feel the atmosphere of this small village.I loved it and I will definitely be looking for more books by this author.",3,0.9872,0.036,0.725,0.239,0.4131578947368421,POSITIVE,0.9988

Selected by my book group - I thought how bad can a novel set in France and involving Chocolate really be ? The answer is dreadful. Dull, flat monotonous prose, achingly two dimensional characters - the almost comically villainous priest a counterpoint to the slightly magical, chocolate making, tarot reading, vision of loveliness that is the main character....The experience of reading this was like eating a marshmallow - airy, insubstantial and utterly forgettable.
