3,463025464,11/25/2012,5.0,"I last read this book when I was 14 years old, given that I'm almost 32 now, I have a whole new perspective on it. Despite the fact that I gave this book 5 stars previously, I have to admit that it didn't grow on me until this, my second read. Confession time: I didn't like Remus or Sirius.*Khanh ducks as rotten fruit and eggs are thrown her way*OK, OK, I'M SORRY! I've since changed my mind! Notice that I used the past tense.Obviously, there will be spoilers for the book below, for the 1.5 of you who haven't read this yet.I can't even recall why this book wasn't memorable to me. All I remembered was that Sirius - and what happened to him - was terrible, but he's like meh to me; I just never connected with him as a character. Remus was a werewolf and I've never liked werewolves. The Marauders in general were just a bunch of rowdy teenaged boys, and having been the target for teasing from rowdy, rude teenaged boys in my youth, I just didn't care for the way they were portrayed. And I was right, somewhat, James, et al weren't perfect. They bullied Snape, they were little shitheads. Yes, eventually they became productive, admirable members of society, but I just didn't like them at first.I guess this is one of those books that just takes time to grow on you.This is the last Harry Potter book in which Harry is a child. Before his life - and this series - was visited by the spectre of death. I'm not talking about the long-ago deaths of James and Lily, of course Harry has experienced deaths before, but it was distant. I'm talking about the future deaths where Harry lost people he actually remembered, and respected, and loved. That's what I mean when I say that this is the last book in which Harry is a child, because as hard as his life was until now, he still had his innocence.Children believe that their heroes are unerring. One of the rites of passage to adulthood is the realization that heroes fall, like everyone else.
Harry stared up into the grave face and felt as though the ground beneath him was falling sharply away. He had grown used to the idea that Dumbledore could solve anything. He had expected Dumbledore to pull some amazing solution out of the air. But no … their last hope was gone.
I know that everyone loves Sirius, but for some reason, he didn't click for me when I was 14. This time around, I could understand his character more. I could relate to his desperation, his frustration, and the hope that kept him alive all those excruciating years in Azkaban.
‘I don’t know how I did it,’ he said slowly. ‘I think the only reason I never lost my mind is that I knew I was innocent. That wasn’t a happy thought, so the Dementors couldn’t suck it out of me … but it kept me sane.
I think for me, it took maturity and the experience of loss and frustration, well, life itself, in order to appreciate the hardship that Harry and Sirius and Remus went through. Previously, this was a magical Cinderella-like tale about a boy in a room under the stairs. With this book, the story became twisted, and it became something more.Read this review and more @ The Book Eaters",564,-0.6713,0.134,0.75,0.116,0.5348606601731601,NEGATIVE,0.9991

8,149600779,02/21/2011,5.0,"It's a rainy Sunday. It's colder than it should be this time of the year, so I'm drinking a delicious cup of coffee and I'm browsing my Goodreads shelves only to realise that I haven't written a Harry Potter review. Not a single one. So, I decided to start with the first Harry Potter book I ever read, the one that took me to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and made me believe that magic is something tangible.

“I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.” 

I was 16 years old, and I had just started my english classes in order to pass my Proficiency examinations. My teacher told me that the best way to delve into a foreign language and familiarize with it is to read books written in it, so she gave me the third instalment of Harry Potter. (Little did she know that she unleashed a beast who now reads almost exclusively in english). Before I tell you about my experience, I need to make a confession. It was my choice to stay away from J.K. Rowling's books until that moment. I wanted to swim against the current, and I thought that Harry Potter was too ""mainstream"" for my taste. And the foolish little me was proud of this decision. But when my teacher gave me this old, used copy, something inside me cracked. I knew the basics about the story, about the orphan kid who goes to a school for wizards and fights the ugly, evil dude who doesn't have a nose. But page by page, I came to understand with awe that the wizard who finds trouble even when he doesn't want to offers more than that; he opened a portal to a world where I longed to be fervently. I stayed up late at night, with a faint light just enough to make out the sentences, and I cheered for Gryffindor's Quidditch team, I flied with Firebolt and I kept wondering what my patronus would be (according to Pottermore it's a brown mastiff, which is oddly fitting). I casted spells (but never Avada Kedavra, you shouldn't play with this shit) and tasted butterbeer in Hogsmeade, and just like that, my life had changed irrevocably. I was a Potterhead. And I was proud of that. (my mum wasn't though, especially when I asked for a wand).

“Happiness can be found, even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light.”

There is a reason why J.K. Rowling is the fairy god-mother to millions of children (and adults) worldwide. Friendship, love, hope, they're present in her books even in the most desperate times, when Evil seems undefeatable, when no escape is visible. She encourages and empowers, shows that everything is possible, that strength and courage can be found within, when you have someone to hold your hand. Harry was a kid who was deprived of love yet he was capable of loving, it took him years but he finally found a place to belong, to feel safe and cared. Ron, with his witty lines and his constant presence, Hermione, my personal favorite, with her intelligence and compassion, they managed to enchant my prejudiced heart, and even now, years later, I'm still under their spell. I think I will always be.

“Don't let the muggles get you down.”

I'm still waiting for my Hogwarts letter, and secretly hope that Dobby is the one to blame. I still caress with affection the spines of my Harry Potter books (meanwhile I bought them all and finished the entire series in a week and a half) and laugh at Harry Potter jokes. And I know, and it's imprinted in my soul, that I'll never be a muggle again.",407,0.9912,0.053,0.832,0.115,0.5580834803057025,NEGATIVE,0.9912
9,2048866442,07/04/2017,5.0,"“Happiness can be found, even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light.”As it seems my Harry Potter reviews don’t always start with a Dumbledore quote but always end up being “My thoughts about this book” reviews as well. For a series like HP that’s been read by so many people this might be the best solution though. And because the books get longer and longer and because I don’t share my friend Jayson’s amazing and remarkable ability to describe a book in one significant sentence, I’m afraid you’ll have to bear with quite a lot of my thoughts. *lol*1.) ”It’s one of the basic rules of breeding,” she said. “You see it all the time with dogs. If there’s something wrong with the bitch, there’ll be something wrong with the pup-“Aunt Marge is such a horrible person!!! If you ask me she’s really lucky that Harry is such a precious cinnamon roll and only made her a big bubble gum. *lol* The audacity to talk about his dead parents like that! No wonder Harry got so angry!! Aunt Marge can float to hell! 2.) ”I’ve already had some,” said Harry. “Professor Lupin gave me some. He gave it to all of us.”“Did he, now?” said Madam Pomfrey approvingly. “So we’ve finally got a Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher who knows his remedies.”Lupin is the best DADA teacher they ever had and I love him so much! <333 His character is just great and I wish we would have seen even more of him. Unfortunately we weren’t blessed with all too many Lupin scenes. >_<3.) ”How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter,” Snape said suddenly, his eyes glinting. “He, too, was exceedingly arrogant. A small amount of talent on the Quidditch pitch made him think he was a cut above the rest of us, too. Strutting around the place with his friends and admirers… the resemblance between you is uncanny.”And speaking of the best teacher we come directly to the worst! Snape is such a horrible teacher I can’t even! I said it once and I’ll say it again: He's cruel, he's a bully, he takes delight in instilling fear in his students. And he verbally and emotionally abuses them. His personal vendetta against Harry who never ever did anything to him except of looking like his dead father is just crazy! Movie Snape is way nicer than the one in the books and I'm sorry but if you ask me #SnapeCan'tBeRedeemed""!!4.) ”They’ve got a new captain and Seeker, Cedric Diggory-“Angelina, Alicia and Katie suddenly giggled.“What?” said Wood, frowning at this light-hearted behaviour.“He’s that tall, good-looking one, isn’t he?” said Angelina.It’s the third book and Cedric Diggory and Cho Chang are already mentioned! Also did anyone notice that they are both introduced as Seekers as well? ;-) So we have all the main players for book 4! Harry, Draco, Cho and Cedric! XD (On a side note: Considering the giggling girls Robert Pattinson truly is a good cast! *lol*) 5.) ”You asked us a question and she knows the answer! Why ask if you don’t want to be told?”Ron never ceases to amaze me! He’s such a shy guy but boy does he become a lion when he defends the people he cares about! <3 6.) ”Dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth. They infest the darkest, filthiest places, they glory in decay and despair, they drain peace, hope and happiness out of the air around them. Even Muggles feel their presence, though they can’t see them. Get too near a Dementor and every good feeling, every happy memory, will be sucked out of you.”The Dementor’s Kiss reminded me of one of my rp characters that died through one. Ahh the good old roleplay times. *lol* Anyway, moving on! I was always intrigued by the idea of Dementors and even after so many years their existence and mystery still didn’t lose its appeal! They are really fascinating creatures and even though I never want to meet one I still can’t help but take an interest in them. =) Certainly one of the best things about this book! 7.) ”Mr Moony presents his compliments to Professor Snape, and begs him to keep his abnormally large nose out of other people’s business.”The first mention of the Marauder’s Map! “The Prisoner of Azkaban” is certainly one of those main books that build the foundation for everything that’s yet to come. And it’s already way darker than its predecessors. Bless Fred and George for handing Harry the map! Heaven knows he’ll have good use for it in the years to come. ;-P8.) ”They’re dead,” he told himself sternly. “They’re dead, and listening to echoes of them won’t bring them back.”It always kills me to read about how Harry struggles with the knowledge - or rather the lack of knowledge - about his parents. My heart bleeds for him whenever they are mentioned. I mean jeez, he’d endure a Dementor just to hear their voices. T_T9.) “She’s got her heart in the right place, Hermione has, an’ you two not talkin’ to her –“ Is it just me or is this actually a reoccurring theme? Since book one there always seem to be sections in which they don’t talk to each other because something gets in their way. And if my memory serves me right things are going to continue in this vein. XD 10.) ”She had slapped Malfoy around the face with all the strength she could muster. Malfoy staggered.”Once again I want to point out that I’m a pacifist! The way Hermione dished out that slap was pretty spectacular though! *lol* Guess she took Mr. Weasley as an example. Haha! Sound advice for parents: You better don’t slap mean people in front of your kids! ;-P Also is it just me or did anyone else notice the irony of the situation? A person like Hermione, a person that values words, resorted to actions because she realized words won’t get her far with a Malfoy. *lol* 11.) ”THIRTY-ZERO! TAKE THAT, YOU DIRTY, CHEATING-““Jordan, if you can’t commentate in an unbiased way-!”“I’m telling it like it is, Professor!”Jordan’s Quidditch commentary is legit one of the best things about the series! Well and the matches themselves of course. XD Plus McGonagall swearing like a trooper because the Slytherin team was playing so foul is one of the best things ever! Haha! Especially because she obviously tried to keep everything objective and neutral at first. *lol*11.) (view spoiler)[”I’m not doing this for you, I’m doing it because I don’t reckon my dad would’ve wanted his best friends to become killers – just for you.”Harry is a far better person than many others would have been! Even after everything Wormtail did he still didn’t allow Sirius and Lupin to kill him. He would have had every reason to let them finish him off yet he thought of the consequences for his father’s best friends first. Aside from that I still believe that Harry would have never allowed them to kill him because he knows it’s not right. If he proved anything to us by now, then it’s that he’s a very righteous and compassionate person. (hide spoiler)]12.) (view spoiler)[”I don’t want a bond with Pettigrew!” said Harry. “He betrayed my parents!”“This is magic at its deepest, its most impenetrable, Harry. But trust me… the time may come when you will be very glad you saved Pettigrew’s life.”Once again the foreshadowing!!! Rowling is a master at this discipline! XD (hide spoiler)]I can’t wait to read “The Goblet of Fire”! Not just because it’s one of my favourite HP books but also because I want to find out which other details I missed the first time around! It will get dark now and I’m so ready for it!!! <3_________________I’m on a Harry Potter roll this year!So now that Christmas is coming closer with every passing day it’s about time to dive into one of my favourites! =)I always liked “The Prisoner of Azkaban”! Not only because the kids have grown so much but also because it marks the beginning of the series getting all “Sirius”. *lol* (Sorry, I couldn’t help it. XD)But honestly, there are so many awesome things that happen in this book and there are so many new characters that are introduced, it’s just amazing! <3Happy reading! I’m sure I’ll have a good time!",345,0.9996,0.105,0.683,0.213,0.5993120958769813,NEGATIVE,0.987

It’s like living never ending mercury retrograde! You don’t want to start a new thing, you have to go back to your past or you have to deal with your unfinished businesses.  Of course this is not a book from my TBR or DNF list. I’ve read it very same day it has been released: 16 freaking years ago when I was still hot, dump, in my silly 20’s . The year I finished it, I flipped my bird to my managers at the workplace and quitted for chasing my writing dreams. (It was not entertaining, sunshine and rainbow story, there is so much rebellion, pain, fight, humiliation but freedom never comes without dues to pay!) And after devouring this book in one day( because I locked myself at my childhood room. Yes, I was single! It was easier to isolate yourself!) and I decided that’s my all time favorite Harry Potter book (I know there were more to come but my life was changing and my three musketeers’ lives were also going different directions. They were finally growing up, just like me!)  Sirius Black has a special place in my heart and at the beginning he escaped from Azkaban and we think he was after Harry to kill him. This book faces Harry’s past trauma about his family, his guilt feelings, night terror, his self insecurities and sometimes we think his inner demons were more terrifying than the outside world’s vicious, dangerous avengers coming after him. And at the end, Harry and Sirius’s special relationship always melts my heart and fills my eyes in tears. I always find this is one of the most meaningful and genuine relationships JKR formed between two characters.  And we also see the growing pains of two main characters: Ron always loyal, likable, witty and Hermione is passionate, intelligent but also kind-hearted. Maybe this is the best part of their story because after this book, everything gets bleaker, darker and more violent! My dear three musketeers’ lives will never be the same. I read this book 16 years by locking myself in my room and as a de je vu or reenactment of my younger and dumber self, I reread my favorite HP book. I smiled, entertained, cried, jumped, horrified again! And I felt good and gave my five gazillion stars over and over again!

Just when I thought the second one was more detailed compared to the first. Prisoner of Azkaban is much more complex, having a lengthier plot, more descriptive characters and environs, but still not lacking in any way. It makes the first two feel like short stories. I'm going to stop saying this is 'The Best' until I'm done with the series, for, right now it feels like it'll keep getting better till the series end. (So, it goes without saying, it's 'The Best So Far.')""The consequences of our actions are always so complicated, so diverse, that predicting the future is a very difficult business""Though the first two books were quite wonderful, the build-up for events seemed much better in this third book. The occurring of events seemed much less transparent, and manages to keep the reader well in suspense right till the end. The plot feels to be moving more in-line with the core of series - towards a bit darker side - as the first two had already laid a strong foundation. And the world of magic keeps expanding, with a lot of interesting elements being added to it! I hope I'm not getting ahead of myself when I say, this is becoming one of my favorite book series of all time.""I know how to use a fellytone now""",317,0.9933,0.032,0.781,0.187,0.5181643625192012,NEGATIVE,0.9018
12,1820639312,11/24/2016,5.0,"ENGLISH (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban) / ITALIANO«Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways.For one thing, he hated the summer holidays more than any other time of year. For another, he really wanted to do his homework but was forced to do it in secret, in the dead of night. And he also happened to be a wizard»Sirius Black's escape from Azkaban prison is on every wizard's lips. Not even the dreaded guards of the prison, the Dementors, managed to keep in a cage the wicked wizard, who probably want to meet again his master, Voldemort. But to do that, firstly he must kill Harry Potter, the only one capable to stand up to Voldemort... Meanwhile, the new school year is about to start at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and Harry, Ron and hermione will become acquainted with two new professors...Compared to the previous, the third volume of the series is the one that is richer in twists and turns. I'm reading the saga of Harry Potter to my daughter, when in the evening she goes to bed, and in this ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" a little tragedy happened. When we got to ""The kiss of the dementor"" chapter, just hearing the title my daughter (6 years old) was so upset by what it might happen that she required that I read that chapter alone, and just then telling her what was going on by omitting the scary details. Apart from this hiccup, the reading was neat and clean. It is evident that the playful and carefree tones of the first two adventures give way to dark colors. After all harry is growing up, and its way of seeing things is supposed to change as well. Rowling takes us in the maturation process of the most famous little wizard of the world using the same plot device of the previous volumes: the teachings of Headmaster Dumbledore, the clashes with Malfoy, the bickering with Hermione, the conflicts with Professor Snape. I do not know if in the near future I will continue to read to my daughter the Harry Potter saga, or if I will wait she grows enough to read it alone to avoid upsetting her again. Never mind. I will go on because now it is not possible for me to stop reading, with the pleasant awareness that there is no healthier addiction of this one. ""Get high"" yourself too.Vote: 10




«Harry Potter era un ragazzo insolito sotto molti punti di vista. Prima di tutto, odiava le vacanze estive più di qualunque altro periodo dell'anno. Poi voleva davvero fare i compiti, ma era costretto a studiare di nascosto, nel cuore della notte. E per giunta era un mago»La fuga di Sirius Black dalla prigione di Azkaban è sulla bocca di tutti i maghi. Nemmeno i temuti guardiani del carcere, i Dissennatori, sono riusciti a tenere in gabbia il malvagio stregone, che si dice voglia riunirsi al suo padrone, Voldemort. Per farlo però dovrà prima eliminare Harry Potter, l'unico che fino ad ora è stato in grado di tenere testa a Voldemort... Nel frattempo, alla scuola di magia e stregoneria di Hogwarts sta per cominciare il nuovo anno scolastico, ed Harry, Ron ed Hermione faranno la conoscenza di due nuovi professori...Rispetto ai due precedenti, il terzo volume della serie è quello più ricco di colpi di scena, e di conseguenza quello con il ritmo più serrato. Sto leggendo la saga di Harry Potter a mia figlia quando la sera va a letto, ed in questo ""Harry Potter e il Prigioniero di Azkaban"" è successa una piccola tragedia. Arrivati al capitolo ""il bacio del dissennatore"", al solo sentire il titolo mia figlia (6 anni) è rimasta così turbata da quello che sarebbe potuto accadere che ha preteso che lo leggessi io da solo, e che le raccontassi quello che succedeva omettendo i particolari spaventosi. A parte questo intoppo, la lettura è continuata liscia. E' evidente che i toni giocosi e spensierati delle prime due avventure lasciano il posto a sfumature a tratti cupe e goticheggianti. D'altronde Harry sta crescendo, e si suppone che cambi anche il suo modo di vedere le cose. La Rowling ci accompagna nel processo di maturazione del maghetto più famoso del mondo utilizzando gli stessi espedienti narrativi usati negli altri volumi: gli insegnamenti di Silente, gli scontri con Malfoy, i battibecchi con Hermione, i conflitti con Piton. Non so se nell'immediato futuro continuerò a leggere a mia figlia la saga di Harry Potter, o se aspetterò che cresca abbastanza da essere in grado di leggerseli da sola per evitare adesso di turbarla. Non importa. Io andrò avanti perchè per me non è più possibile fermarmi, con la piacevole consapevolezza che non esiste dipendenza più salutare di questa.

The book follows Harry Potter, a young wizard, in his third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

20,1556460511,02/21/2016,5.0,"Time. The things we could accomplish if we had extra time on our hands. Just this week I mentioned to people that I have been running on fumes with all the things I had to get done. If only I had a few extra hours in my week to take a nap or rest with a book. Thankfully, we have a leap year, providing our busy lives with a full extra day to get those things done that may have been pushed to the back burner. Whether it’s catching up on sleep, reading, or chores, a leap year creates the impression that there is indeed an extra day to accomplish those things that may have been pushed to the wayside. Despite this, adults rarely have the time to go back and savor favorite books, but, in 2020 a group of us in Retro Chapter Chicks have decided to take the time to reread Harry Potter in all its glory. I find it appropriate that on a day where we can enjoy extra time, that I curled up with my favorite book in the series, one that indeed tests the limit of place and time. A mass murderer has escaped from prison. The news is so important that it even made the Muggle news. Even Muggles who detest magic like the Dursleys are on high alert. For Harry Potter, a wizard about to enter his third year at Hogwarts, it is just another summer vacation. Although famous and living up to his name during his first two years at school, at the Dursleys he is treated like less than human. His living conditions have advanced from a cupboard under the stairs to a room with bars on the window and a flap on the door for which to receive stone cold meals. Even though Aunt Petunia is Harry’s blood relative, she also treats him like vermin. Things couldn’t get any worse until Uncle Vernon’s sister Marge arrives for a weeklong visit, and she believes that Harry is worthless and ungrateful to his family. What Marge fails to realize is that this so called family wishes that Harry did not exist. Harry’s true family is thicker than blood and bound by magic: his Hogwarts family. Each summer, life at Dursleys grows unbearable and Marge’s treatment of Harry puts things over the top. In a fit of teenage emotions, Harry causes Marge to blow up, and then he leaves the Dursleys home, for what he thinks is hopefully for good this time. Normally use of magic outside of school is grounds for expulsion from school, but, with a murderer named Sirius Black on the loose, the Minister of Magic himself has bent the rules in Harry’s favor. Minister Cornelius Fudge believes that Black is a dark wizard and servant of Lord Voldemort, and, in his eyes, the safest place for Harry is at Hogwarts under the watchful eyes of Albus Dumbledore. Harry gets a reprieve and is allowed to spend three weeks of his summer vacation away from the Dursleys and will indeed get to return to Hogwarts to continue his magical education. With the addition of Black to the storyline, the stories only get darker. Readers find out that he is the first ever prisoner to escape from Azkaban prison located in the middle of the sea and guarded by dementors, creatures so foul that they suck the happy memories from all those around them. Fudge is convinced that Black is after Harry and has stationed dementors outside of Hogwarts, much to Dumbledore’s chagrin. As long as Dumbledore is headmaster, dementors will not be allowed inside the castle because he foresees that these horrid creatures are allied with Voldemort. Black was able to outsmart them, and all of England is on high alert. It is against this backdrop and protection that Harry returns to Hogwarts. Third year students have more responsibilities and more freedoms. They are allowed to visit the village of Hogsmeade provided a parent or guardian signed a form; the Dursleys did not. Yet, they also have enough magical training to sign up for extra classes. Harry, Ron, and Hermoine enroll in Divination and Care of Magical Creatures, taught by none other than Hagrid. Hermoine also begins the study of Ancient Runes, Arithmancy, and Muggle Studies. Harry and Ron do not understand how anyone, even one as smart as Hermoine, could take that many classes. Some are at the same time as others, which makes it humanly impossible for her to attend two classes at once. The dialogue between Ron and Hermoine involving her class schedule speaks to growing relationship between the two, a relationship which neither is mature enough to recognize. Meanwhile, class work has gotten harder. Professor Snape loathes Harry more than ever, and the new Defense of the Dark Arts professor Lupin is an old friend of Harry’s father. Hagrid, while the nicest person around and Harry’s protector, is threatened by the Malfoys yet again, this time after Draco is scratched by a hippogriff named Buckbeak because he refused to pay attention in class. Buckbeak is threatened with execution, adding to the animosity between Harry and Draco, and only Hermoine, on top of her grueling class schedule, finds the time to assist Hagrid in his defense. All these storylines would make for an exciting tale, but inserting Lupin and Black and Harry’s anti-dementor training make this book the turning point in the entire series. The story progresses, and animals play a key role in plot development: Ron’s rat, Hermoine’s cat, and a large black dog. The three are infinitely linked to one another. Rowling reveals that Black was the Potters’ secret keeper and only him revealing their whereabouts would expose their location to Voldemort. He was supposedly in jail for murdering twelve innocent people plus a tag along named Peter Pettigrew. He is also Harry’s godfather. This information has Harry’s growing teenaged emotions on high. He is more determined than ever to defeat Voldemort and his legion of dark creatures and takes necessary precautions to guard himself against the darkness. Although teenaged pranks occur in this book, my favorite scenes are between Harry and Lupin and Black. Being able to interact with one of his parents’ closest friends, one really feels for Harry as an orphan and sees that he truly belongs in the wizarding world and not at the Dursleys. As Rowling will reveal much, much later, Dumbledore has his reasons for placing Harry there, but with each book it gets harder and harder for him to return, even if the presence of these Muggles is key to the plot line. Time, of course, plays a key role in the plot as well. Hermoine reveals that she has been using a time turner to get to her classes all year but promised not to tell anyone. Sirius turns out to be none other than the dog who has made an appearance throughout the book. He is innocent, yet the only people who believe him are Harry, Ron, Hermoine, and Professor Dumbledore. Lupin is indeed his closest friend and also a werewolf, and it is Pettigrew who is the servant of Lord Voldemort. This, Dumbledore explains to Harry, is magic at its deepest, most impenetrable moments and, in my opinion, the essence of the entire series. As Dumbledore points out time and again, it is one’s choices that determine one’s fate, not their abilities. For a few glorious moments Harry believes that he can live with Sirius and escape the Dursleys once and for all; it is the most touching moment, and the scene in the movie where the two of them are staring at Hogwarts castle has brought tears to my eyes on more than one occasion. Yet, this moment is indeed fleeting. The Ministry of Magic still believes that Sirius is a dark wizard and he is forced to flee on Buckbeak the innocent Hippogriff. Readers know that this moment is indeed fleeting because Harry and Sirius will eventually be reunited but for only a short amount of time. It makes for a necessary storyline later on but one that gets harder and harder to stomach with each passing reading. Pretending that I do not know what comes next; however, knowing that Sirius and Lupin reappear in future books is what has always had me excited at the end of this book, a crossroads between the end of Harry’s adolescence and the darker times that lurk on the horizon. Time. J.K. Rowling has shown us what can happen if well meaning witches and wizards are given just a few hours extra in their days. Most adults with busy lives wish they were afforded the opportunity to relive hours and minutes in order to accomplish even the most mundane tasks. The climax of this book has revealed how precious time is and to take advantage of what time we do have in order to live life to the fullest. This year’s leap day provided me with the opportunity to reread favorite books and get some much needed rest that I needed after a busy week. Even in this busy life that I lead, I have found the time to visit Harry Potter’s magical world yet again. As the plot moves deeper into Harry’s teenaged years, and, he and his friends are about to embark on fighting the forces of evil, it is obvious that they have left their childhood behind. It is the moments that mark the end of this book combined with the extra time afforded to us this year that show us just how precious the time we have is to us all. 5+ stars All time favorite book",245,0.9977,0.066,0.818,0.116,0.502129762129762,NEGATIVE,0.9909
21,14146684,01/31/2008,4.0,"Since pretty much everyone I know has read these books, I figure reviewing them is pretty pointless. But with the new book coming out in a couple of weeks, I have to go through them beginning to end. To make the reviews more entertaining, I will be doing them in a variety of unexpected formats. For this review, I will be writing as Crookshanks fan fiction.Crookshanks swished his tail back and forth as he crept up the stairs to the boys' bedrooms. He knew the rat wasn't what it was pretending to be, but all of his attempts to alert the humans to this fact had failed. ""I don't know why I even bother,"" he muttered to himself. ""I could get along fine without any of them. Let the rat do whatever it is it's trying to do. So long as Girl keeps feeding me and scratching my belly, I'll - hello, what's this?""He could smell the rat. Its scent was like nothing Crookshanks had ever smelled, and for all his time living in a magical pet shop, he'd smelled a lot. The rat did smell like a rat, yes, but there was also something else. Something... human. It was just like that big black dog he'd met on the grounds the other day. Every instinct in him had screamed to run away, but there was that smell. And even Crookshanks knew what they said about cats and curiosity. The dog had turned out to be more than just a dog, and it had convinced Crookshanks to help it. First order of business: retrieve a certain rat from the bedroom of the Red-Haired Boy.The Boy wasn't in, but the rat was. Crookshanks circled the bed a few times. This time, maybe, he would be able to get the damn thing. He tensed for a moment and then leapt onto the bed.By luck or skill, he was nearly on top of the thing when he landed. ""A-HA!"" he yowled. ""Gotcha!"" He pinned the rat under his sizable paw. ""Where you gonna run to now, ratty?"" he asked, sneering as best he could.The rat writhed in his grip. ""Please,"" it said. ""Just let me go. You don't know what will happen if you eat me, it would be a terrible mistake!""""A mistake, eh?"" the cat said. ""We'll see about that. I have a great big doggie friend who's just aching to get his jaws around you....""He barely had time to finish his sentence when the rat went mad. It squealed and bit and slashed with its paws. And then, against all of Crookshanks' previous experience - it grew! It nearly threw the cat off the bed as it became much more massive - its legs lengthened and its arms stretched until it had reached a human size and shape. Crookshanks goggled. Of all the things he'd expected from this rat, this wasn't it. The human grabbed at him, but Crookshanks was too fast. He jumped off the bed and shimmied under the wardrobe, where he could see but not be seen.The human looked around, breathing heavily. He was pale and thin, and still looked ratty. ""Think, Peter, think,"" he said. ""Gotta get out of here, but..."" He stopped, glanced at the wardrobe, and grimaced. ""You may just have given me my way out, cat,"" he said. And then he bit the ball of his hand.Blood dripped out, leaving spreading red blotches on the sheets. ""They'll think it was you,"" he said. ""They'll leave me for dead and I'll be free to rejoin my Lord."" He looked at the recently repaired curtains on Ron's bed. ""It's not safe here anymore."" He sucked at the wound to stop the bloodflow and then went to the window. Perched on the windowsill, he looked over at Crookshanks' hiding place. ""If I were human,"" he said, ""the fall would kill me. But as a rat...."" His body rippled and twisted and shrank, and then there was an old grey rat on the sill. Crookshanks was pretty sure it winked at him before leaping off.After a minute or two, Crookshanks wriggled out from under the wardrobe, his thoughts dark. The Red-Haired Boy was going to be angry, and so was the Girl. But more importantly, the Dog was going to be furious. It was barely holding on to its sanity as it was. Crookshanks shook his head. This was going to get worse before it would get better...",216,-0.9038,0.099,0.808,0.094,0.4779699374699376,NEGATIVE,0.9952

24,902895652,04/06/2014,5.0,"This is my favourite book in the Harry Potter series! It marks a distinct change in tone and a maturation of the writing. As the characters grew older, the challenges they faced became more dark and intense. The plot became murkier especially in regard to Sirius and his involvement (or lack thereof) in the murders of Potter’s parents. It all just got so much better. I think this is a large part of Rowling’s success. She could have fell into a trap and continuously wrote books like the first two, but instead she moved her story forward and let it grow. And her readers rejoice. This is also the first time the real threat to Harry is realised. Sure, we’ve seen Voldemort on the back of Professor Quirrel’s head and we saw an early Tom Riddle in the form of Horcorux diary type thing, but the dementors were an entirely different level of danger. The entire story felt less comic and less feel-good, for the first time it seemed like Harry Potter could actually die if he didn’t find his courage and repel them with his power. He owed much to Lupin here, a character who becomes slightly overlooked as the series progresses, but a hugely pivotal one in the development of Harry. And, for me, that’s why this one is the best because eit is the one where Harry truly found his confidence.    ",181,0.946,0.076,0.779,0.145,0.3990689865689865,POSITIVE,0.9999

I mean, can you imagine having sex with this man?Well, I have. Several times.

I love the first two books in this series, but I love them for their magical quality, their appeal to children, and their overall introduction to this world.But The Prisoner of Azkaban, at least for me, marks the shift into adolescence and the less tidy endings.And, of course, the introduction of Sirius Black and Remus Lupin to the plot.I loved rereading this third book the past two weeks with my middle child, and I can not get over this new set of the illustrated series by Jim Kay. I mean. . . I'm not sure I can imagine a reading experience more sublime. Can you?My two absolute highlights from this novel are:When Remus Lupin turns to Hermione Granger and says, “You're the cleverest witch of your age I've ever met, Hermione.” It's a shift from everyone poking fun of Hermione for being a teacher's pet or a “nerd” and acknowledging her as a force to be reckoned with.And Jim Kay's illustration of Harry summoning his first real Patronus. . . my God, I turned the page, and goosebumps ran down the entire length of my body. Then I cried like a child. My daughter, who was sitting next to me, wasn't exactly surprised (she's been around for the last two years of this horror called perimenopause), but she was like, “Mom, pull it together.”I couldn't help it. Damn it, I think I'd run back into a burning building to grab this book.Remus!",179,0.9863,0.072,0.773,0.155,0.440254820936639,NEGATIVE,0.6169

Second Read Review
THIS BOOK. IT WAS SO FUCKING WONDERFUL AND I CRIED. I have several things to say about this book, but first of all, I'm going to say that I love the Marauders, except Peter Pettigrew because he's a fucking a coward and he made Lily and James died! I hate him so much and when Sirius voice broke after he told Harry what truly happened that he was not their Secret Keeper, but it was Peter and then he found out that Lily and James died, I felt like my heart was cracking and I wanted to hug him and said to him that it was not his fault. Oh God, I just feel really sorry for Sirius. 
Remus Lupin is such a sweet character
He is honestly the best Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher! and he was also a caring and a sweet guy. He often smiled. He's smart, fun, and kind! he defended Neville when Snape bullied him or whatever that was because he kind of underestimated Neville and that was pretty mean, you know. I mean, yeah Neville might be reckless or that he often made mistakes, but seriously that was mean! he did not deserve it and I was so glad when Lupin defended him. This man was very amazing. so ... umm where do I find a guy like him in real life? he's such a sweet guy! OH! and one more thing, when Lupin was ill and he did not come to the class, but Snape came in the class instead ( I guess he was substituting this subject for a while because Lupin was ill) and he gave the students an assignment about werewolf so someone would realize his symptoms. UGH. SO WHAT IF HE'S A WEREWOLF? I mean, it would be okay if we put certain precautions. Basically, Lupin was just an amazing guy and I really like him. I am so sad that he resigned from teaching Defence Against the Dark Arts. He's the best teacher for this subject!  
Professor McGonagall and Professor Trelawney
One of the best scenes in this book for me is when Professor McGonagall and Professor Trelawney bickered. It was too funny ahahahahaha. Thank God, I was at home when I read this scene. I would surely get funny looks, if I laughed in public place. 


'If you must know, Minerva, I have seen that poor Professor Lupin will not be with us for very long. He seems aware, himself, that his time is short. He positively fled when I offered to crystal-gaze for him-''Imagine that,' said Professor McGonagall drily. 


HAHAHAHA I bursted out laughing when I read that part. That was just so funny.  
Hermione being disrespectful toward Professor Trelawney
Look, I really adore Hermione. She's smart, brave and such a devoted friend. She's honestly one of my inspirational characters that I adore very much. However, I did not like it when she was being disrespectful toward Professor Trelawney. It is okay, if she did not like the study or believe the study or whatever it was. It is totally okay. I also have some subjects that I do not like to study, but I never disrespect any teachers. So It just slightly annoyed me when Hermione being disrespectful toward Professor Trelawney 


Hermione snorted.'Well, honestly ... ""the fates have informed her"" ... who sets the exam? She does! What an amazing prediction!' she said, not troubling to keep her voice low. 


Indeed, I can see her point. I understand her. But still, it is not okay to say something like that. She did not even keep her voice low! That's just not okay at all in my opinion. Overall, I loved this book very much. I had a great adventure with it and my days felt so magical when I spent them by reading it. Thank you very much for reading and liking this review. I really appreciate it. I hope you all have a great day! bye!•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••

"" Welcome to the Knight Bus, emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard. Just stick out your wand, step on board and we can take you anywhere you want to go. ""
Harry Potter is a 13 year old boy now. He stays at his uncle's and aunt's house like he usually does for the whole summer. But this year is different, he can not control his anger anymore and he leaves his uncle's and aunt's house. There is also a man named Sirius Black, Mass-Murderer and follower of Lord Voldemort escaped from Azkaban. Most prisoners go mad withins weeks in Azkaban but this man doesn't and people say that he is coming after Harry and in Harry's first divination class, Professor Trelawney sees an omen of death in Harry's tea leaves and now, the school grounds are being Patrolled by DEMENTORS.My Opinion The cover of this book is so BEAUTIFUL! and the story was as amazing as the cover.I also found a new favorite character in this book and this person is Professor Lupin!! He is so cool and he is the best Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher I have ever met. because you know, all the Defence Against The Dark Arts teachers from the first book were not nice guys at all including that guy with useless ability. What's his name again?? LOCHART! GILDEROY LOCHART. I just remembered his name. Actually, where is he now? no one mentioned him and I hope I won't see him as a teacher in Hogwarts again. I still can't forgive him for what he was about to do with Ron and Harry in the second book. That guy is pathetic.I loved all the characters in this book and Fred and George weasley were so funny in this book. Percy is the last person I like. I don't hate him but I don't really like him too. He's so stritch about rules and sometimes he annoys me but not much. here is my favorite scene : 'How're we getting to King's Cross tomorrow, Dad?' asked Fred, as they tucked into a sumptuous chocolate pudding.'The Ministry's providing a couple of cars,' said Mr Weasley.  everyone looked up at him.'Why?' said Percy curiously.'it's because of you, Perce,' said George seriously. 'And there'll be little flags on the bonnets, with HB on them -''- for humungous Bighead,' said Fred. Everyone except Percy and Mrs Weasley snorted into their pudding. I laughed so hard in the middle of the night because of this. I wish I were there to see Percy's face when Fred and George said that. Oh! and I remembered I laughed so hard too when Ginny said he found out that Percy was kissing Penelope Clearwater, his girlfriend. I mean Percy is so stritch about rules and he always study, study, study, so the thought of Percy's having a girlfriend was never crossed my mind. But he was cool enough to get a girlfriend. *shrugs*I was so shocked when I found out that Sirius was innocent and the bad guy was Peter Pettigrew. how could he betray his own bestfriend?! I think he did it to save his own skin without thinking twice about his bestfriend's life. James and Lily Potter died because of him and how dare he to say that Sirius was the one who betrayed James Potter! this guy is more pathetic than Gilderoy and I was shocked when Harry told Lupin and Sirius not to kill him and put him in Azkaban instead. That moment I realised that Harry was so kind. this guy was the reason his parents died and he didn't want him to be killed. This book also have the best ending. the ending in this book made me grinning but don't get me wrong, the ending in the first and the second book were all great too but this ending was perfect. 'What's that?' he snarled, staring at the envelope Harry was still clutching in his hand. 'if it's another form for me to sign, you've got another -' 'it's not,' said Harry cheerfully. ' it's a letter from my godfather.' 'Godfather?' spluttered Uncle Vernon. 'you haven't got a godfather!.''Yes I hav,' said Harry brightly. 'He was my mum and dad's best friend. He's a convicted murderer, but he's broken out of wizard prison and he's on the run. He likes to keep in touch with me, though... keep up with my news... check I'm happy...'And grinning broadly at the look of horror on Uncle Vernon's face, Harry set off towards the station exit, Hedwig rattling along in front of him, for what looked like a much better summer than the last. Thank you guys for reading and liking my review. Hope you all have a great day!! ❤❤❤",164,0.9998,0.101,0.653,0.246,0.5666402116402117,POSITIVE,0.8534

32,1405697939,10/01/2015,4.0,"OKAY. This book was fantastic! I can't get over how everything just fell into place perfectly. Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite of the series so far which is actually a surprise since Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was my least favorite movie growing up.But reading and watching the movie truly is a different experience. Even though I've seen the movies repeatedly year after year, I was still on my toes while I was turning the pages of my book. It was like I was seeing all of this for the first time!I've really developed a deeper love, respect, and understanding for this series and the Wizarding world. I especially loved the fact that we actually got to learn about Remus Lupin and his backstory as a werewolf. I never would've learned any of this if I never decided to pick up these books.This series just gets better and better, and darker and darker. I can slowly see how Harry Potter is moving away from middle grade and into young adult. I'm really looking forward to how that shift becomes more prominent in the later books. Now next up is Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, which is my favorite movie of the series growing up!

34,1832898948,01/01/2017,4.0,"This - is my review of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.... It’s a great book - but not without its…problems….D’you get it? It’s because every goddamn sentence of this book contains either a dash or an ellipsis. (That’s one of the...problems….)https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...I’m debating whether to unleash the anti-Snape rant that’s been building up inside me for a decade now. I think I’ll wait until his supposedly redeeming backstory is revealed. What book is that in? Anyway, just his extensive presence in this book made the whole thing less fun for me.I feel about Snape the way Michael Scott feels about Toby. But I digress. My main thing with this book is that Rowling can be kind of...bad at fitting the parameters of the universe she created. That’s understandable, since it’s immense and so impressive, but there’s also little common sense things that get under my skin. (This would be under “general stupidity” if I hated this book - which I absolutely don’t.) I wanted to be having a great time, but instead I was caught up in the little mistakes.Some examples: There’s just no way McGonagall would have given Hermione the Time Turner. No way. I get the significance of the thing to the plot, and it’s a really creative and entertaining concept, but my girl Minerva would NEVER have handed that over. This is the woman who will shut any student down, take Harry Potter’s broom, deduct points from her own team, throw shade at Trelawney...what I’m saying is she’s a one hundred percent badass. And she’s a badass who exudes said badassery with the well-being of all Hogwarts students in mind. But I’m supposed to believe she put herself out there, petitioned the government, and presumably put in effort to convince her fellow faculty just so Hermione could take a purely overwhelming number of classes? Nah. She would have recognized it as unnecessary (Hermione never even gives a reason beyond ""wanting to"" for her overloaded schedule) and a huge pressure (workload's making a thirteen year old cry all the time and lose the ability to sleep). In other words, Minerva would have shut that shit down in a hot Texas minute.But wait - I have more examples! Lupin tells us that when he was at Hogwarts, they went through an INSANE amount of work to get him off the grounds when he ~underwent his transformation~. Keep in mind this whole thing is for one. Effing. Student. They put in a magic, violent tree (the infamous Whomping Willow), dig a tunnel that is presumably at least a mile or two long, and mess with (build?) a shack-like shelter. This is way, way, way too much to ensure that a single student can attend the school. But even suspending your disbelief there - why would you put a werewolf inside a WEAK, SHUT UP BUILDING to protect people? One, don’t put a rabid monstrous creature in a house, because two, he can break out of it and now the inhabitants of Hogsmeade are at risk. Also, putting in the Whomping Willow? Are you kidding me? It’s a danger to the students! And so is building a passageway in/out. There are so, so, so many more problems than solutions here.And here’s the most wild, laughable one for me. At the end, Sirius Black reveals that it was him - HIM! - who bought Harry Potter the Firebolt, hundreds-of-Galleons price tag and all. This is INSANE. Since Ron had earlier mentioned that it would have been impossible for Black to buy a broomstick, J.K. is so kind as to reveal how he did it in his letter to Harry. He says he sent Crookshanks (a f*cking cat) to the Owl Post, had him order the broomstick under Harry’s name, and had it charged to his own bank account at Gringotts. HAHAHAHA, WHAT?! You’re telling me a goddamn cat walked into a post office, conveyed the information that Harry Potter was ordering the most expensive broom on the market, and charged it to the most wanted man in Britain’s account without consequence? Like everyone was just like, yeah, okay, we didn’t really want to find him anyway? We won’t bring this up to the Ministry or Potter or anything? Jeeessssuuuuussss. Also, how did my guy have that much money in his account anyway? How is his account even open?Also, I know this is well-discussed, but there is just so much conflicting information about how many people attend Hogwarts. It drives me insane. I’ll never be satisfied with one answer, because there are always a million other pieces of evidence that conflict.The sheer confusion of the story relayed in the Shrieking Shack was also so confusing. Like, I get why there had to be a dozen f*cking pages of Black/Lupin begging the story to be told and Hermione/Ron/Harry essentially covering their ears and singing “Walking on Sunshine,” but they couldn’t at least have told the story with some semblance of organization once they finally got there? I mean, Jesus.On the other hand, characters. Hermione is still killin’ it - Time Turner, baby! And slaying those exams! But she did have less time with the squad (fighting) and a lot of scenes where it was just like, “Oh. Yeah. Hermione. Uh, she’s...doing homework over there.” Plus Neville was not really included, like, at all. But Lupin was introduced, and he’s one of my favorites! But Snape was here as hell and I hate him so much. But no Colin Creevey or Lockhart or Dobby! But Trelawney and Malfoy and Pansy. But Sirius! But mainly he was villain-ing it up. Oh well. It’s a real 50/50 in this one.Still, it was definitely enjoyable. Like, I read it in pretty much one sitting, and I haven’t done that in a whileeee. I missed doing it. And this was so, so much better than the second book. So this is so hard to rate! I am having a really hard time here, you guys. And my absolute favorite aspect of these books - which was missing in the second volume - was one hundred percent present and accounted for. I’m talking a look into the world, baby! We get Hogsmeade, we get an entire fortnight of Diagon Alley, we get a bunch of discussion of the school and the classes. Even the bad parts, like Azkaban. Ugh! I could read a series’ worth of books just on the world, I swear.So, bottom line: In some ways I liked this as much as the first, but it definitely had more problems. I am looking forward to continuing my reread, and hopin’ I find just as much of the world and even more of the good characters.

I love the Knight Bus and Stan’s accent even though it’s not so easy to read. The Dursley are hideous and well written. I enjoy the Boggart chapter a lot and the Marauder’s map is awesome. I compare the read to the movie a lot in this book and I must say, the actors acted very well to how the book is written, especially Snape and Malfoy’s sneers! I absolutely love Fred and George. The twins and their speech are always makes me smile.This book is told in the third person point of view, following Harry Potter as he gets ready for his third year back at Hogwarts. His summer at home with his aunt Petunia’s family is as horrible as ever. There is a new teacher for Defense Against the Dark Arts. This year Harry learns about the notorious jail breaker, Sirius Black. This book also introduces the soul sucking Dementors, who are guards for the Azkaban prison. The Dementors comes to Hogwarts to protect Harry and hope to catch Sirius Black. The concern is that Sirius Black is hunting for Harry Potter, but what surprises Harry most was when he learns who Sirius Black truly was!A well written book, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a go-to pick me up kind of read. I first read this series in 2008-2009. I remember loving it. I have seen all the movies. I started re-reading the series last year, 2017. This year, 2018, I continue on re-reading the series. I think I love it more now than reading it during my first time because I have the movies to help me imagine how the story goes. The actors, both heroes and villains played their parts in the movies very well. I love the magic, 4 houses, Quidditch game, class lessons, actions and adventures with Harry and friends, and the writing. I love the illustration at each chapter headings. The writing just pull me in and I could never put it down. I love this series and I highly recommend everyone to read it soon!Pro: actions & adventures, friendships, mystery, suspense, humor, magical world, couldn’t put down, fast paced, page turner, easy to read, illustrationsCon: noneI rate it 5 stars!***Disclaimer: I’m reading books I own for a change..xoxo, Jasmine at www.howusefulitis.wordpress.com for more details",143,0.9965,0.055,0.743,0.202,0.5149012855831038,POSITIVE,0.9978

Rowling decided that Harry's life was way too easy' - narrated by James; text by James; jokes by James... or not....It is said that one year, said Harry Potter woke up with an unpleasing relative on his head. And, being the angsty preteen that he was, he blew her up. Of course, actions have consequences ladies and gentlemen. So, Harry was forced to leave the shelter of his humble abode. Just when he thought he was now alone in the wild, he raised his wand (like he did countless times before, but let's just pretend that we don't see that) and a magic automobile appeared and carried him in Wonderland!But Wonderl... I mean Hogwarts was changed. Great perils lurked outside the ancient walls. A terror from the darkened past.

44,2194018204,11/24/2017,5.0,"Another re-read of my most Favorite Dark, clever part of the Series,The Wizarding World expanding, Mysterious Dangerous Prisoner Escaped, A Step in Coming of Age, A Trick with Time...Cat, Rat & Dog.It's where the plot thickens, growing with you to be the Best Series of All Time.PS : I know I sound dramatic, Professor Sybill Trelawney's exaggeration...but I really can't help it.PS 2 : Great portrait for her, also can't help to show it earlier than I should..So, let's see, again as Book One Illustrated Edition Review, Chapter by Chapter review, of how great and perfectly, cleverly this novel written with some small details and fun points you may missed...But before Chapter one... a very clever illustration of Azkaban is introduced Cinematically in every page before the novel start....which keep the Starting of the books itself as mysterious and dark as this part of the series itself.
*** Chapter One ***A History of Magic
Every new book in the series there's a brief ""Previously on Harry Potter"" inserted brilliantly unnoticed to help you catch up... like brief History of the series between lines.And Did you read the ‘History of Magic’ brief essay Harry was writing here? A funny, 
Real
 study on burning witches in the middle ages But from the Wizarding World prospective..You really should check out Harry Potter : A History of Magic, on the Real Life Wizarding World through Ages..And see this cool Broomstick-Care kit… how geekly detailed (written and illustrated) is that.
*** Chapter Two ***Living Hell with the Dursley
Yeah I know Harry is a real “Hot Head” kind of guy… but I just love how he keep obeying the rules of the Dursley… he's too good with them as much as he can, not such a bad example as many bluenoses say..In previous chapter he was studying in the middle of the night under the sheet !! in the dark !! Well, that's count for something.Yet Aunt Marge has a Large mouth indeed… she deserves what happened to her.. I mean with all her Dog, Bitch and puppy talks.So it was just 
Aunt Marge Large Mistake
.... but this large illustration just got too far.., kinda childish.
*** Chapter Three ***Wizarding World Public Transport
And it goes Anywhere, Everywhere..except underwater..it's still just a Bus.. But I love in this chapter the turn of feelings,Of How Harry from thinking he's already an outlaw, a fugitive and will live as outcast..(“I'm Nevil Longbottom”?!! man, Harry got what it takes to be one Haha) to be greeted this warning, forgiving greeting from The Minister for Magic himself… solving everything..What a Night ! And The Knight Bus itself before, What a Ride!.. I still wished for more illustrations though, specially for the bus.
*** Chapter Four ***Living in Diagon Alley
Living in the Wizards motel, Studing outside, in a table at Ice Cream shop in sunny days with a help of its kind owner…Catching up with the new Wizardry World new items in sales..(Broomsticks, the Cars of the Wizardry World)...God I'm in love with that Chapter..Again, aside the Wizarding Pet shop, more Illustration of the Alley needed..

*** Chapter Five ***The Guardians of Azkaban

The whole time so far they mentioned they just called so, The Guards of Azkaban… but in this chapter they finally have a name...and a horrible shape..That was a part of the
 little mystery
 that has been built up, and you peel the cover of it bit by bit.Dark cloaked figures that “Float”... only their claws of hands visible.. how creepy is that..Wonder how their face looks like? All in good time..all in good time..And then..it's the first time we first see the carts that delivers the students from the station to Hogwarts...how it is invisibly pulled? Wait till Book Five, which is Book Three Symmetry Twin.
*** Chapter Six ***Trelawney and Hagrid
Why we never noticed this hard-to-miss-
stylish
 teacher before in previous years?Well.. She answers that right when you first meet her,.. she isn't that socialising with her colleagues and attend feasts and meals in the Great Hall...for her Inner Sight of course, thought that was obvious.And Hagrid..Our New Teacher...what a job man… BUT a tricky-to-deal-with creatures in the first class? Come on..I love Hippogriffs, I do, but not that fast man.

*** Chapter Seven ***Bad Teacher, Good Teacher

From Snape class… the worst kind of teachers…Bullying, favoritism..etcTo the fun class of Lupin.. caring, activity teaching..etc.But let's take a look at the Boggart here… it lurks in the dark places (that can be under bed, in a closet opend a bit.. etc) and it transform to whatever your mind thinks scary… isn't it simply the boogyman theory. You always don't know what's in the darkest corners but you know it's your worst nightmare..I really love this concept, explains a mysterious common fear into something magical, something from this well crafted Wizardry World.
*** Chapter Eight ***Moving Portraits
Always wondered since the first book; when they're going to make a real, better use of them?Here was the answer -and trust me, more useful uses in later books.
*** Chapter Nine ***Open Page 394
A new mystery thrown… where's Lupin.. and what's Snape is doing to him??God, If we can read the clues as plain as Hermione did when she opend page Three Hundred Ninety Four..
*** Chapter Ten ***The Marauders
Well, I'm not talking just about the Map here..  (though I needed BIGGER illustrated page of it, may be folded one as DA in book one).. BUT I'm talking about that we didn't know back when we overheard the conversation in the Three Broomsticks, of the story of how Black killed Pettigrew after betraying James Potter, THAT was actually about
 Three of the Four Marauders
…
*** Chapter Eleven ***F.R.I.E.N.D.S. and Betrayal.
This two chapters are mostly about that.Friendship and betrayal, sometimes you don't know who will betrayed who...as the case of Sirius Black story and the secret keeper story of the previous chapter..Burt sometimes what a friend may call a betrayal, can be just a good intentions deed… On 'Hermione snitching about the Firebolt' I'm talking about..Oh, and in the same chapter;
 Thirteen dine on one table on Christmas eve
….. talk about 
Friends and Betraying
 symbols… (and I needed this scene illustrated so much... it's a Betrayal to not be included)
*** Chapter Twelve ***Expecto Patrounam
Or,
 The importance of keeping Happy Memories in hand
 ….my Patrounas is a cat, thought that was obvious :)
***Chapter Thirteen***Quidditch never been more exciting.
They didn't have a complete Quidditch season in both Book One and Book Two.. did you noticed so? Or even cared with everything going on every end of the previous two years? I don't think so. (-I had to look it up online why Gryffindor didn't won for 9 years, it was 7 in the first book, and I find out that the Internet already full with that question -and good answer seekers :)-)But it's Oliver Wood, our beloved Gryffindor Quidditch Captain’s last year in Hogwarts , so it matters now.And with the Grim Defeat few chapters ago, this chapter with Gryffindor Vs Ravenclaw was really exciting.Till the cliffhanger end.Oh forget, did you noticed that Cho Chang a year older than Harry?
*** Chapter Fourteen ***“Your father did something Snape could never forgive.”“What?”“He saved his life.”
-Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone
Since Book One ever wondered how? Sure we did…Here's a finally, 2 years later, a glimpse of how did Harry’s Father saved Snape’s life… yet still Snape isn't grateful as you might think.
*** Chapter Fifteen ***The Quidditch really Matter in this book.
Guess I already told you so....it is since the first game of the year..First time to behold the Cup.. (only later in book 5 will do again, oh the Symmetry.)
*** Chapter Sixteen ***Exams
I always love the ""Exams"" chapter in every book, though it's mostly hasty , just summing up all the exams... so I always wish to have more of it.Trelawney makes her second accurate prediction… but we don't know that yet, only later in this book..Oh and you'll never know what was her first untill much later in Book Five (again, which is Book Three Symmetry Twin.)Oh... and here we say Goodbye -maybe- to Buckbeak.But....that what was the trigger to the Climax of the book..
*** Chapter Seventeen ***Cat, Rat and Dog
Look, no matter how exciting the re-reads of Harry Potter.. I can't never forget the chill I got first time I read this couple of chapters..This CLIMAX, this Jigsaw of a story where all the puzzle pieces fall in one epic, breath-holding, breathtaking at the same time, clever, mystery revealing Chapters..It all starts with ; 
Cat, Rat and Dog
(I'm just in love with the naming of this one)That continues in;
*** Chapter Eighteen ***Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs.
The Marauders, Their past story that full of twists.. and the mystery of The Prisoner is clearing now..Still there was more questions but Snape crashed into the present as he did in the past.But everything get cleared when we learn The True-..
*** Chapter Nineteen ***..-Servant of Lord Voldemort
God, A huge revelation that back to the Night when Harry’s parents got betrayed and killed.., and how Harry got his ride in the motorcycle with Hagrid is finally shown in full and clear in the story…(Oh yes, Black been mentioned from the very early beginning..remember?
“Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,”said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. “Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I’ve got him, sir.”-Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone)And the Climax chapters end tragically wrong with..-
*** Chapter Twenty ***-..Dark Night despite the Full Moon.
Very dark chapter indeed.Now, take a breath..Remember back when we first read these chapters made us thought that Crockshanks might be Harry’s Father? God, that was wild.(I remember many theories that kept growing till before the release of book 7 that he's actually alive.)Also now we get it that the Sneakoscope , that Harry got at the beginning of this book as a present from Ron, wasn't malfunctioned after all..(Scrabbers was there..dah!)Well, I'd do anything to get a Time Machine so I'd go back and read this mystery all over again with the same excitement and awe I felt with every twist.But why buy a complicated Time Machine when we have…-
*** Chapter Twenty One ***-..Hermione’s Secret , The Time Turner.
Here where you re-read the Climax of the novel, but in 'Back in Time' mode.. and they didn't change anything... everything already happened!I loved the little perfect rules Rowling did for this twist..Technically they didn't change fate… nothing happened have been changed. I just love that.I always love the Time stories..(and this beautiful illustration)But sure it's a tricky plot.And Rowling herself regretted doing it later cause always fans -probably herself too, even the characters in her Wizardry World- would ask What If we used a Time Turner for this or that…She tried in Book Five (symmetry twin) to close the matter of Time Turners..but not until The Cursed Child that it closed once and for all.Well, I believe that's why I will always appreciate it no matter how the hates it get from many fans.
*** Chapter Twenty Two (The Last) ***Symmetry
And always the last Chapter symmetrically with the first..These little things from every Chapter even the first must be concluded here..Sometimes last chapters makes me widely smile.. or have teary eyes -as in the next book- but mostly smile..Remember that the Dursley already watched Black in the news?Ron is Pet-less….after the whole Cat/Rat struggle the whole year..The Grindylow's empty cage,Oh and who send the Firebolt -I know it's obvious when it's a re-readers or those who watched the movie, or those who read with extra Hermione-care..(By the way, why it never thought by anyone that it could be Professor McGonagall again as she got him Nimbus 2000 in book one?)Well, always last chapter is this one where all the little pieces come together… and Harry is off to the Muggle world with the Dursley with happier thoughts…This time we have a line that will make us on fire for book Four…The World Cup for Quidditch is coming this summer..See you there Harry..Mohammed ArabeyThe Illustrated Edition ReadFrom 24 Nov. 2017To 7 Dec. 2017This Review made for the love of the series, the creative, inspiring work it's done in this series, and for the love of all the fellow Potterheads ❤❤❤",118,0.9986,0.079,0.797,0.124,0.5058679392502918,POSITIVE,0.9971

47,1786075472,10/16/2016,4.0,"The Harry Potter books are a bit of a puzzle. The series started to get into print only twenty years ago. It was initially intended, despite the massive page count of these novels, as a young boy’s read. Today, it’s already the best-selling book series in human history (half a billion copies sold to date), the most translated literary work and, as a result, one of the most read piece of literature in the world, just behind the Bible and neck and neck with Don Quixote (1605). Why is that? I kept asking myself while reading The Prisoner of Azkaban…This third instalment in the series is indeed an excellent sample of Bildungsroman. As in The Philosopher's Stone and The Chamber of Secrets, we follow the adventures of a young orphan boy who lives, during summer, in South East England, with his cruel foster parents (a parody of Victor Hugo’s Thénardiers or Dickens’s Murdstones). We also know from the first book — and just from general knowledge — that Harry Potter has magical powers. As the school year begins, he joins his two friends, Ron and Hermione, and goes to Hogwarts, a boarding school for young wizards and witches. The different classes alternate, held by a rather flamboyant staff (Dumbledore, McGonagall, Snape, Hagrid, etc.). There’s a Quidditch — magical team sport — championship going on, where Harry is a crucial element (a bit too much of that stuff to my mind). There’s the nasty foolish brat (Malfoy and his gang), with whom he has to struggle. But above all else, there’s a mystery plot going on, that involves Harry and the evil forces the archenemy (Voldemort and his gang) is marshalling against him. Many plot twists and mythological tropes later, and right at the end of the school year, the mystery is lifted (as in Agatha Christie’s novels), and Harry and his friends are victorious.This brief (spoiler-free) summary calls for a couple of comments that might shed some light on a few of the reason why the Harry Potter books kindle so much enthusiasm for so many readers:The setting contributes to a strange sense of realism. The world-building is extensive, but unlike most fantasy novels, set in wholly imaginary worlds, J.K. Rowling manages to structure the surroundings of her books as an in-between. It's a world where people can seamlessly go back and forth between the mundane (Dursleys' house in Surrey, King’s Cross station in London…) and the poetic and imaginary (Diagon Alley, Hogwarts School, the village of Hogsmeade…). This odd sort of magical realism somehow suggests that the magic world is real and unseen rather than merely fictional.The plot framework is identical to that of the first two instalments. Only some characters change, as well as the nature of the mystery Harry needs to solve. It naturally could be seen as a repetitive, almost predictable story. But I suspect that this sort of variation on the same, efficient, firmly established scenario, is part of the pleasure these books provide. The very pleasure children may draw from hearing the same bedside story over and over again, the sheer joy we, as adults, take from watching TV series that develop the same overall plot over and over.Furthermore, the general story isn’t incredibly original: the story of the poor orphan who discovers he has extraordinary powers and eventually becomes a celebrity is very similar to that of Cinderella’s or The Ugly Duckling’s plot. (There's an excellent video with Kurt Vonnegut on the Cinderella-type plot.) But this is, in fact, a story that lets the readers secretly sense or hope that they are more than what they (and others) might think. It's a call to a better Self.Edited to add: note that the plot around Harry Potter is very similar to the one around Luke Skywalker (Star Wars): a lad of humble origins who must fight a monstrous devil, a group of assorted chums, various challenges overcome, the evil defeated against all the odds, etc. People love that story!Whereas most of the characters in the story are well-drawn and colourful (think Hagrid, Hermione, Snape, even Pettigrew — a shrewd invention on Rowling's part), the very character of Harry, even though he is a central figure in the middle of everything else, comes across as somewhat bland and bloodless. In a way, Harry Potter (a common name) is a blank figure, and just as Ulysses, he could say: “my name is Οὖτις (no-one)”. Or in other words: “my name is potentially everyone, including you, faithful reader. I am the mirror of your life.”In the end, the one and (almost) only thing Harry Potter profoundly expresses is his unconditional love for his deceased parents: in a word, a feeling of endless mourning. This, albeit a bit soppy, is perhaps one of the most profound things the Harry Potter novels convey: what is truly magical and precious isn’t the many tricks and spells taught at Hogwarts. It is the past love that, in some way or other, we received at the beginning of our lives and which goes on through friendship.A final note: the best part of The Prisoner of Azkaban is probably the last hundred pages, and especially the story around the Time-Turner device. Alfonso Cuarón's film manages to make the most of it in what is perhaps the best of all the Harry Potter movie adaptations.",107,0.992,0.062,0.837,0.101,0.514033474776049,POSITIVE,0.9999

“Happiness can be found, even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light.”
 Harry is in his third year at Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry and although it's great to be back, everyone in the magical world is on edge. An escaped mass murderer, Sirius Black, is on the loose and it turns out Harry has cause to worry that he might be Black's next target. 
“What you fear most of all is —fear. Very wise...”
 I found it highly entertaining how obviously teenage our trio were in this book. The arguing, mood swings and first crushes were so on point. I'm glad this is the last of the middle grade books in this series and that from book 4 we move into YA. JKR really knew how to set the spooky vibes and the unsettling atmosphere. This book did have a little of the investigation element that the other books have but not as great as it is in rest. I forgot so much about this book in particular. I did not remember how much slower paced and lacking The first 3/4 were so slow and while I still love every bit of it I needed more to happen.

“I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.”
as a side note, this review has no order and is literally just me rambling abt my thoughts throughout reading the book. so I apologize in advance if my review is a mess. I'm sorry as I am still shook at everything that went down in the ending.the ending has left me shook. 
shook.
 guys, SHOOK. I just can't function properly rn. like, my brain is still trying to process all the information. everything that went down with sirius black, professor lupin, peter pettigrew, harry, ron, hermione, and snape like OMG. how scabbers was rlly pettigrew this whole time and that sirius wasn't the potters' secret-kepper and how the four of them, black, lupin, pettigrew, and potter, wrote the freaking map. and how they illegally made themselves change into animals. and omfg that one chapter when black was surrounded by the dementors and how they were on the verge of performing the kiss on them but harry stopped them in time with his spell and I kid you not guys, I repeat, I kid you not, I freaking had tears in my eyes. my friends were looking at me like I lost my damn mind. like I'm not even joking with you. I cried b/c well, obviously black is innocent and I rlly didn't want him to die, especially when he offered to have harry move in with him instead of the dursley's. like, he can't die b/c he's freaking harry's godfather. and he bought harry the firebolt as a birthday present and he signed the permission slip for harry to go to hogsmeade like bro, everyone is hella wrong abt black and he's just such an amazing person to harry and is nothing everyone thinks he is. I swear, I hope he's ok and that everything gets cleared up b/c I rlly want him to be ok and not have to be in hiding anymore.and hermione's secret?! she's been going back in time with the little hourglass and how at the end, she and harry went back in time and was able to save buckbeak and sirius black. like bro, I'm shook. and like dumbledore was in on hermione and harry going back in time and how he willingly let sirius black go even though there isn't sufficient evidence that he is, in fact, not guilty. this goes to show that dumbledore truly is a wonderful man. 
“Mr. Moony presents his compliments to Professor Snape, and begs him to keep his abnormally large nose out of other people's business.Mr. Prongs agrees with Mr. Moony, and would like to add that Professor Snape is an ugly git.Mr. Padfoot would like to register his astonishment that an idiot like that ever became a professor.Mr. Wormtail bids Professor Snape good day, and advises him to wash his hair, the slimeball.” 
k so going back to pettigrew, like screw him and I hated that he escaped. he better die a horrible death and rot in hell. b/c if he doesn't die and rot in hell, he's gonna have a meeting with my fist. professor lupin ends up resigning as defense against the dark arts teacher and I'm just sad. it's not his fault that snape is a freaking bastard. I hated how he had to leave his job. he rlly fit the role and I can't bear to see him leave. all the students obviously loved him and enjoyed his lessons and the fact that he has to leave now that everyone knows he can transform into a wolf and is a danger to everyone just breaks my heart. 
“What you fear most of all is —fear. Very wise...”
so this is like smth I can't ever forget, but hermione legit slapped malfoy in the face for being rude and saying harsh things abt hagrid. like gurl, YOU GO!

“You think the dead we love ever truly leave us? You think that we don’t recall them more clearly than ever in times of great trouble?”
 *Guess which character said the above quote. (view spoiler)[ Dumbledore, duh!  (hide spoiler)]The following isn’t really a review, more like random thoughts while and after reading the magical book:1. Aunt Marge deserved it alright. Lol. 2. I’m against hurting kids but could I make a bloody exception with Draco? 3. I enjoyed every class with Prof. Lupin. I agree he’s the best Dark Arts Professor so far but true to my premonition… (view spoiler)[He wouldn’t last more than a year.  (hide spoiler)]4. Perhaps I could use a cute “ridikulus” spell on a boss when his gloomy face comes hovering above my desk.^^5. I hate to say it but Hermione is always right. Love her! Lol.6. The movie is awesome but I couldn’t help notice important things missing like the Gryffindor’s match against Ravenclaw and later against Slytherin. 7. In the movie, Firebolt arrived only at the end of the story. 8. Buckbeak and Crookshanks=Their movie versions are so much cuter! <39. Marauder’s map is too cool, like a GPS only so much more fantastic! Love how it was made in the movie.^^10.

52,2291507896,04/20/2018,5.0,"Third book....third year at Hogswarts. I think this might be my favorite Harry Potter book yet. It has more psychological depth. The wild adventures are still wizardly enthralling ....but we there are also many emotionally unsettling scenes to grapple with....which has us thinking and feeling deeper. At the start, J. K. Rowling immediately begins by pulling on our heartstrings. It’s summer, Harry’s least favorite season when he’s in the throngs of the unbearable muggle relatives, the Dursleys. It’s Harry’s birthday - and for the first time ever - his friends- Hermione, Ron, and Hagrid give him cards and gifts.....but his relatives wouldn’t even consider such a thing. Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon looking at Harry suspiciously at every turn - is one thing - bad enough- but when Aunt Marge shows up on his birthday voicing her opinion that Harry was mentally subnormal and displaying other cruel actions - Harry is willing to almost do anything he needs including lie to get what he so desperately needs. Third year students at Hogwarts can sign out to visit Hogsmead on weekends - but first they must turn in a signed permission slip from their caretaker. So Harry makes a deal with his Uncle Vernon - promising to act normal - that’s going to come back and bite him. However - soon enough school starts in September....and the wild ride begins of following the escape of a prisoner Sirius Black. The wizards and muggles are both after him and Harry’s in real physical life or death danger .....but Harry - poor Harry also has to re-live the events leading to his parents murder whenever the dementors get near him. On the flip side Harry learns more about his parents and himself and so do we. Yep.... my favorite so far! The characters are endearingRon was more emotional in this story....Hermione was slightly wonderfully hysterical about studying for her classes......and watching Ron and Hermione go at it was - well was so wizardly-human! Ron thinks Hermione will never admit she’s wrong: squabbling over the Scabbers! I just started to fall in love with these kids more and more.And who knew I could feel excited for a Quidditch match? I did!Thank you .....once again to my friend Lisa for being my Harry Potter inspiration ",101,0.6404,0.097,0.783,0.121,0.5538988095238094,NEGATIVE,0.9081

Having read this book previously I know about (and LOVE) Sirius, and I had been waiting rather impatiently for his appearance in this book. He's, like, my favorite character as of now (and at the time I read Prisoner of Azkaban before). But seriously, there's absolutely nothing negative I can say about this book. (Well, okay, except for that happy moment between Sirius and Harry toward the end right before all hell broke loose. Yeah, I could have done away with the all hell breaking loose part, but I guess famous Harry Potter doesn't get that perfect outcome just yet...or ever.)

56,1778336900,10/07/2016,3.0,"The third HP adventure serves to bring the likable Sirius Black into the story and get Gryffindor their Quidditch Cup, but the story and action was still far less gripping than the first novel. I thought that Lupin was an interesting character, but less spectacular than the previous two teachers against the Black Arts. I recall reading this for the first time nearly two decades ago when it came out and losing enthusiasm for the Harry Potter universe. However, I read it again so that I can read the rest with my son (he refused to read 2 and 3 with me because he felt they were the weakest books in the series and I have to say I agree with him). Nonetheless, one must read this story for the long game if one wishes to make sense of the rest. I am still a bit baffled by the whole switcheroo that Prang & Co did leading to the death of HP's father and mother, but perhaps they will return to that later.
