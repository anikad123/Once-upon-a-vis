8,3727185829,12/30/2020,5.0,"""I is a good elf""It's been proven three times now, that I always get ahead of myself when reviewing Harry Potter, incorrectly concluding the last one (out of the ones I've read so far) to be the best, but it cannot be helped. The standards are moved up - again. It's like Rowling just had a look at the first books, found them to be way too short, and came up with this one, which is much longer than the previous ones - combined! And the writing style keeps on improving, while plot getting more and more thrilling, making it oh so delightful to read.""Will you please inform zis 'Agrid zat ze 'orses drink only single-malt whiskey?""It's great to have that feeling of 'how easy it is to read everything is' still being part of the author's narration. Though the events are being described in much more detail, it does not take away anything in terms of interest. On the contrary, the reader is kept well in suspense, with a number of twists, without making anything too unreal (relative to the world of magic that is). I don't recall ever being more immersed in a book than this one (again, I'm probably getting ahead of myself).""Alf-giant? Moi? I'ave - I'ave big bone!""As far as the environs go, I think it's safe to say that we've arrived at darker times, toward which the third book made way for. Though I loved the first three 'relatively-trouble-free' years, this one is certainly more interesting with so much happening, while introducing a whole new set of interesting characters. And the occasional humor complements nicely without distracting the reader too much.I don't think I'll be able to rest well until I'm done with the series. I kind of feel sad about the readers during original release years, who had to wait year after year for the next book. Must've felt being under 'Crucio'.""If you want to know what a man's like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.""",343,0.9979,0.015,0.755,0.23,0.5343045843045844,POSITIVE,0.6848

10,68913564,08/25/2009,5.0,"This was the beginning of my addiction to POTter. I had previously experimented with and enjoyed POTter on 3 different occasions, but could easily have walked away and never touched the stuff again. Then, under some pressure from some POTterHEAD peers of mine, I tried the newest blend called the Goblet...and everything changed. As the warm, easy, potato chip prose crossed my blood-brain barrier, euphoria ensued. My inner child was smitten. I...was...hooked and I...was...happy. Ignore the so-called ""experts"" who say POTter is brain cell killing pap. Don’t listen to those jaded, book snobby squares. Most of them are wound so tight they wouldn’t know a good book if it sat on their face and wriggled. POTter makes you feel good. POTter makes you smile. POTter makes you joyous and giggly. Hell, POTter makes you want to use the word giggly. POTter is enjoyable and fun. That's enough for me. So what made  the Goblet so much more addicting than the rest of the POTter I had tried. Part of it was that I had already seen the movies (up through Order of the Phoenix) before I got my hands on genuine POTter. The first 3 were fun but I felt like I had already ""been there done that"" as they were pretty faithfully adaptated for the screen. Still enjoyable, but not enough to put the POTter monkey on my back. Then came the Goblet of POTter and it was a big, huge, tightly-rolled fatty at 750 pages. The cut, diluted movie strain couldn’t hope to be as potent as the primo original and the story was finally given the room to breathe and take on an epic feel. It was completely addictive. The world-building details started coming fast and furious and the characters were given considerably increased depth. Add that to Rowling’s breezy, “ear friendly” prose and I found myself spaced out for hours turning the pages and still hungering for more. It’s high praise indeed when I say that 750 pages did not contain a single dull, ploddy moment. This was fun and wonderful and a pleasure to experience. It deserves to be recognized for the iconic work that it is in the realm of YA fantasy. Is it popcorn? Certainly. Is it a joy to read? Definitely. Is it one I HIGHLY RECOMMEND to all lovers of feel good, comfort food? YES. 5.0 stars.

11,2592111282,11/12/2018,5.0,"I know what you think: Don’t I have anything to do instead of rereading 750 paged long book on my weekend. Of course I am: I could try to cook breads, cakes, muffins or any other carbs involved project and share at my social media account to risk myself turn into Thor’s big bellied image at last Avengers movie for consuming them incessantly like my most friends do till the quarantine ends (it will end eventually, right?) Wait a minute, I cannot do that! I can only pose with burned or overcooked things if I insist to cook. I can also resume home soccer matches with my husband dearest but there is nothing left called glass at our place and I am still stressed walking barefoot because there may be still a tiny threatening glass piece hid somewhere waiting for me! And of course: After Ozark, La Casa Da Papel, Tiger King and Unorthodox, I couldn’t find any appropriate content match with my taste. I’m already working on three books but on weekends: I’m suffering from melancholy and I prefer to do something make me happy in the past. ( Like keep watching Shaun of the Dead, Big Lebowski and Fight Club. Interestingly at your each rewatching séance, you’re catching another detail!) I already told third book is my favorite because it was the last piece that my three musketeers keep their innocence till they take their first steps to the dark side.And this book is the beginning of the dark side. This is the middle part of long installment. A big death will shake them to the cores and everything about their life will change forever. This is one of the darkest, more action packed, gripping, thrilling but also heartbreaking book of the series. When I first read it nearly 20 years ago, I didn’t get intimidated when I see the page numbers. On contrary I felt blessed because normally I have been finishing a Harry Potter novel in a day (At least I finished the first three books in one day! Correction: First book took me only half day. Thanks to my fast reading technique I improved at college years!)Book’s longevity was great news. I could spend more time in Harry Potter’s world!After reading the whirlwind Quidditch Cup competition parts, I adored blooming creativity and visionary scenes written by JKR. I went back to my younger, dumber self and remembered the times how I cherished the chapters, how I thrilled when Harry succeeded and how I flabbergasted after reading the shocking ending.I adored it again and I promised myself to read it another 20 years later. ( I hope I won’t be at quarantine next time)I recommend you to read the books give you time travel to your happy times at the past so you can handle the daily terrors and find the strength to carry hope into your near future.

13,2048866485,07/04/2017,5.0,"“Differences of habit and language are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are open.”So this quote kind of sums up what “Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire” was really about and I think it was cleverly done. ;-) As always there’s so much to talk about and I decided to continue with another of my “My thoughts about this book” reviews. For HP this seems to be the best solution because otherwise I’d end up writing 5.000 words essays and we all know that 1.) Goodreads won’t let me post them and 2.) No one would even want to read so much! *lol* So random thoughts it is! 1.) ”Death Eaters?” said Harry. “What are Death Eaters?”“It’s what You-Know-Who’s supporters called themselves,” said Bill.I found it really odd that the term “Death Eaters” was mentioned and explained for the very first time in here. I mean Voldemort and his Death Eaters are one of the first things that come to mind when you think about HP. I thought it would have been mentioned in one of the earlier books already, but nope, it really was the first mention. Knowing the Death Eaters will accompany us for the rest of the series this was kind of shocking. XD2.) ”I shouted at you before you left!” Mrs Weasley said, starting to sob. “It’s all I’ve been thinking about! What if You-Know-Who had got you, and the last thing I ever said to you was that you didn’t get enough O.W.Ls? Oh, Fred... George...”Mrs. Weasley is legit one of the best moms ever and you can feel her love for all of her kids including Hermione and Harry. So yes, this a Molly Weasley appreciation moment and I still think that she is one of the most underrated characters in the entire series! I love that woman! <33.) ”Twitchy little ferret, aren’t you, Malfoy?” said Hermione scathingly, and she, Harry and Ron went up the marble staircase laughing heartily. Hermione clearly found her self-confidence and poise after “The Prisoner of Azkaban”. XD I loved how she always retorted comments that were thrown at her. She’s so smart it was a pleasure to see her stand up for herself! (and others) And yes, I admit it, just like Ron I wanted to hold the memory of Malfoy the bouncing little ferret in my mind. *lol*4.) ”How are you supposed to defend yourself against something you’ve never seen? A wizard who’s about to put an illegal curse on you isn’t going to tell you what he’s about to do. He’s not going to do it nice and polite to your face. You need to be prepared.”Ahh Mad-Eye Moody! As much as I agreed with a lot of the things he said, I also disagreed with a lot of the things he did. Does that even make sense? XD For me Mad-Eye is one of those super morally grey characters because he sometimes does bad things for “the greater good”. Then again his character is consistent too because as an Auror he saw what dark wizards are capable of and he’s totally right when he says that they won’t play nice and fair. Guess I’ll always feel conflicted about him. 5.) ”Neville, are you all right?” said Hermione.“Oh, yes, I’m fine,” Neville gabbled, in the same unnaturally high voice. “Very interesting dinner – I mean lesson – what’s for eating?”Neville will always break my heart. That poor boy deserved so much better than he got and I’ve such a soft spot for him. He’s another of those Hogwarts characters I really would have loved to read more about and no matter what people think: He is brave and a true Gryffindor! <36.) Snape looked coldly at Hermione, then said, “I see no difference.”And here we have another reason why Snape can’t be redeemed. He’s just nasty and mean to his students and a real bully. No matter what happened in his past, he should know better than to let his students suffer for it. I still think that movie Snape is way nicer than book Snape and if you only know book Snape you know why I don’t like him. I might understand his reasons, but I still hate him. >_<7.) ”Next second all the wind had been knocked out of him as the squealing elf hit him hard in the midriff, hugging him so tightly he thought his ribs would break.“D-Dobby?” Harry gasped.I love Dobby so much! <333 He’s such an adorable and sweet guy and it was so good to see him so happy! He’s probably the only house elf that appreciates his freedom but considering his former masters it’s no wonder he’s happy to do what he wants. *lol* Guess you’ve to experience the Malfoy’s as your masters to truly appreciate freedom. ;-P8.) ”Oh, I see,” Hermione said, bristling. “So basically, you’re going to take the best-looking girl who’ll have you, even if she’s completely horrible?”“Er – yeah, that sounds about right,” said Ron.*sighs* I usually like Ron but I never liked his “Goblet of Fire” version and I still don’t. I mean yes, he’s a teenage boy who’s going through puberty but that doesn’t excuse the many horrible things he does and says in this one. To say it plainly he’s a total dumbass in GoF and I really don’t like him. At least in this book. First he doesn’t believe Harry and then he’s hurting Hermione whenever he opens his mouth, just because his teenage hormones apparently make it hard to think before he says something. We could blame it on puberty but I think there’s so much more going on... Luckily Hermione is clever enough to see through it. 9.) ”Only this morning, for instance, I took a wrong turning on the way to the bathroom and found myself in a beautifully proportioned room I have never seen before, containing a really rather magnificent collection of chamber pots. When I went back to investigate more closely, I discovered that the room had vanished.”And here’s another breadcrumb that will be relevant in the next book. XD You gotta love how Rowling scatters them in the earlier books and makes use of them later on. ;-)10.) ”If you really want to know, he – he said he’d been coming up to the library every day to try and talk to me, but he hadn’t been able to pluck up the courage!”So after three books we dive right into the teenage drama and angst. Which is kind of suitable for their age but boy, did it impact their friendship in this one. I think from now on there’s no book in which they don’t have a conflict of some sort. No matter if it’s Ron/Harry or Hermione/Ron. There always seems to be something brewing between the trio. And bless Victor Krum for realizing how beautiful Hermione is! If none of the two boys at her side can see it, at least Victor can! I think he knows her value way more than her closest friends and I really appreciate him for it. =)11.) ”Trying to ruin someone else’s life?” said Harry loudly.Harry giving Rita Skeeter a piece of his mind is one of the best things in this book. That woman is horrible and she’ll only get even worse as the series proceeds. Harry’s got guts to confront her directly and I just love him for it. 12.) But Sirius shook his head and said. “She’s got the measure of Crouch better than you have, Ron. If you want to know what a man’s like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.”And here’s another character I’d love to see more of! Sirius Black is one of the best and I loved how protective he’s of Harry! He’s like a lion protecting his pup and I lived and breathed for it. After everything Harry went through he deserves someone who loves him and stands up for him. Even if it’s against Dumbledore because he wants Harry to rest and feel better instead of recounting events. Sirius placing his hand on Harry’s shoulder and defending him against Dumbledore’s questions really made my day! Best guardian ever!13.) ”Yes,” said Harry. “Professor – I was in Divination just now, and – er – I fell asleep.”He hesitated here, wondering if a reprimand was coming, but Dumbledore merely said, “Quite understandable. Continue.”Haha! As much as I disliked Dumbledore forcing Harry to relive that horrible night I still can’t help but love him for his attitude. He’s one of the best teachers ever and the fact he didn’t even bat an eye when Harry told him that he fell asleep in Divination. Priceless! *lol*14.) (view spoiler)[ ”And as he heard Voldemort draw nearer still, he knew one thing only, and it was beyond fear or reason – he was not going to die crouching here like a child playing hide-and-seek; he was not going to die kneeling at Voldemort’s feet... he was going to die upright like his father, and he was going to die trying to defend himself, even if no defence was possible...”I LOVE Harry so damn much, I can’t even! He’s one hell of a brave boy and I can’t even imagine how terrified he must have been. Yet he still refused to back down and didn’t give Voldemort the satisfaction of seeing him cower in front of him. This moment shows the true Gryffindor in him and why he got sorted into the house. When push comes to shove Harry always does the right and noble thing! <3 My precious boy!  (hide spoiler)]15.) (view spoiler)[ ”Harry, you can’t help him now. It’s over. Let go.”“He wanted me to bring him back,” Harry muttered – it seemed important to explain this. “He wanted me to bring him back to his parents...”“That’s right, Harry... just let go, now...”This moment always makes me cry! Cedric Diggory’s death is one of the most heart-wrenching scenes in this series and it will always break my heart. No matter how often I read it, it’s still devastating. And Harry’s reaction to it, knowing that he could have been alive if he would have touched that portkey without him... It’s the first time that he has to live with the death of someone he knew and liked and it’s even worse because he feels guilty. What if he would have done the egoistic thing and won the tournament? What if he wouldn’t have offered Cedric to win together? For the first time ever his sense of fairness and his honour brought death to someone and his feelings are so complex I could cry. He did the right thing but it ended badly and left him devastated. If that’s not the symbolical embodiment of growing up then I don’t know. (hide spoiler)]16.) (view spoiler)[ Professor McGonagall went straight to Harry.“Come along, Potter,” she whispered. The thin line of her mouth was twitching as though she was about to cry. “Come along... hospital wing...”To see McGonagall show so much emotion about broke me. This woman is always so composed and knows exactly what she’s doing but for the first time ever she can’t seem to be able to ignore her own feelings. She cares about Harry deeply and it never showed as much as after Cedric’s death. Such a great and beautiful scene!  (hide spoiler)]17.) (view spoiler)[ ”Fail to act – and history will remember you as the man who stepped aside, and allowed Voldemort a second chance to destroy the world we have tried to rebuild!” Well, and that’s about exactly what happens. Fudge didn’t take Harry’s story seriously and the wizarding world had to pay the price for his ignorance. It’s kind of eerie how Rowling captured politics and how the fact that they work so slowly is standing in their own way. At first Fudge didn’t react and once he did, it was too slow to make a difference. He kind of dug his own grave with his actions at the end of GoF and history will indeed remember him as the man who stepped aside and allowed Voldemort to take a second shot at power.  (hide spoiler)] “The Order of the Phoenix” is up next and it’s the last book I have to borrow from the library because I actually have book 6 and 7 in English at home. =) So let’s hope I’ll be able to borrow book 5 soon. ____________________________________I always forget how serious those books become.“The Prisoner of Azkaban” was already very dark but I think “The Goblet of Fire” stepped it up a notch. The ending will always get me, no matter how old I am. >_<Full RTC soon! Stay tuned!P.S: I borrowed this twice from my library. *lol* That’s how I was able to continue.

It follows Harry Potter, a wizard in his fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and the mystery surrounding the entry of Harry's name into the Triwizard Tournament, in which he is forced to compete. Definitely one of my favorites in the series.The Triwizard Tournament is to be held at Hogwarts. Only wizards who are over seventeen are allowed to enter - but that doesn't stop Harry dreaming that he will win the competition. Then at Hallowe'en, when the Goblet of Fire makes its selection, Harry is amazed to find his name is one of those that the magical cup picks out.

“We are only as strong as we are united, as weak as we are divided.”
The summer is dragging and Harry can't wait to join the Weasleys and Hermione at The Burrow and go with them to the International Quidditch Cup final. It's Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. This year will be different to the previous ones, for Hogwarts will be hosting the Triwizard Tournament, a competition which hasn't been hosted for a century. A contest involving two other international magical schools and three dangerous tasks, only students of age are allowed to compete in. Harry is looking forward to watching the games and supporting whoever the Hogwarts champion is. What Harry doesn't expect is finding himself entangled in these dangerous events. For me this is where the story really picks up. The games, as well as the dark atmosphere make this book so compelling. You can't help but want to know what happens next and how Harry decides to face all the challenges that come at him. “If you want to know what a man's like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.”The introduction of foreign wizards/witches in this book sets this one apart from the others. I absolutely loved seeing how different they are to the usual British magical community. And the rivalry that is usually present at Hogwarts between the Houses is amped-up. I really felt for Harry. He faces hate from the other students for something he had no control over as well as being shunned by one of his best friends. I don't know how he deals with everything honestly. “It matters not what someone is born, but what they grow to be.”Our trio are growing up. I loved those scenes with Harry and Ron struggling to communicate with girls 😂. Their sudden awareness of the female population was so sweet. I always associate this book with magical Christmas-sy vibes. It just felt a lot more enchanting than the previous books in this series.

24,1978359535,02/26/2018,5.0,"4.5 stars I really don't think I need to tell y'all that I loved this because I've been raving about this series since the moment I started it back in January but for the sake of clarity - I love this.  I believe everyone (even people that have no attachment to it at all) has a Harry Potter story under their belt. Whether it be the story of their first time reading it or the time they convinced everyone in their family to dress up as the Weasley's or when their Potterhead teacher made them play Quidditch in gym class, everyone has some kind of HP story they whip out at dinner parties - this is mine. Back in my early teens, after a childhood of ignoring the wizarding craze under the guise of my idiot-self being too sophisticated for magic (yes, 8-year-old Grace was an asshole - that isn't the story) I was a camp counsellor. But I wasn't a counsellor at any ordinary camp, oh no, I was a counsellor at a theatre camp. Each year we would put on a different musical and the year I was 15 it was decided we would do a child-friendly, dumbed down version of the Goblet of Fire, complete with all your favourite musical numbers stolen straight from A Very Potter Musical. I played James Potter, helped countless kids memorize their lines, choreography and ten musical numbers and yet the only plot points I picked up of the entire musical was the Yule Ball and (view spoiler)[Cedric Diggory's death.  (hide spoiler)]The whole time I was reading this book - 5 years later - all I could think about was that musical and what I knew was coming because of it. I was worried the entire novel and utterly heartbroken once it actually happened - 5 years of build up to finally understanding what was happening in this book and I'd say It was 100% satisfying. This book is masterful; it is the book where everything changes and you feel it with every flip of the page. It maintained the classic spirit of books 1-3 while perfectly balancing the added stakes and darkness. Also, like every other installment the way everything that is revealed at the end answers all your questions and puts all the more new ones straight back into your head was just as satisfying as it was the first three books and it was perfection. I want to curse 8-year-old Grace for being an idiot and 15-year-old Grace for not paying attention at work because, boy oh boy, do I wish I read this series sooner.",177,0.9865,0.097,0.739,0.164,0.4523129017447198,POSITIVE,0.9999
25,1560647610,02/25/2016,5.0,"Here I am in March 2020. It is day eleven of isolation and no school or work for most of us. I have four kids all learning by phone conference call or online chat, all on slightly different schedules, and I am here utilizing my education degree in case anyone needs clarification on an assignment. I wish I did not have the opportunity to put my education degree to such hands on use. Under normal circumstances, I would be gearing up for another baseball season and preparing for Passover, the dual rites of spring, but 2020 is hardly normal. With a new temporary normal upon us, I decided to reread Harry Potter along with two of my kids, who are embarking on rereads of their own. As the series grows progressively darker, there is also the underlying presence of hope. In these dark times, we all need a daily dose of magic in our lives, and, like an old friend, Harry is there for us. If Harry Potter were real life, Harry and his friends would be moving onto high school after completing their first three years at Hogwarts. With important discoveries at the end of their third year that penetrate magic at its deepest reaches, Harry is about to begin his fourth year of his magical education. Dark forces are gathering, as had been predicted throughout the first three books. With his servant returned to him, Lord Voldemort is determined to rise again, more powerful and lethal than ever before. Harry senses that something may be amiss because his scar, his connection to Voldemort, has bothered him over the summer. Reaching out to his father figures, it is apparent to all that Voldemort is gathering strength, and Harry represents the best chance to conquer him; that is, if he can get through a year at Hogwarts complete with teenaged love and angst and new magical tasks awaiting him as he furthers his education. With these forces both inside and outside of Hogwarts building up, determined to do Harry in, the fourth year at Hogwarts figures to be the most dangerous one yet. With summer vacation nearly over, Harry returns to his friend’s Ron’s house named The Burrow to see the final of the Quidditch World Cup. Rowling introduces readers to new characters at every chance she has, starting with the eldest Weasley brothers Bill and Charlie. Ron has always been conscious of the fact that he is a youngest brother, and now we see that Bill and Charlie have indeed been successful since leaving school. This theme of it measuring up to either Harry or his brothers stays with Ron for the rest of the series, and undoubtedly for the rest of his life. Here the family is at its magical best from the twins inventing jokes to the fully qualified wizards using their wands to perform mundane everyday tasks. We find another form of transportation, a portkey, an everyday object that allows the user to be teleported to a new location instantly; of course, a portkey will reappear later in the book as Rowling does not introduce minor characters or items unless they have a purpose later on. The scene in the movie while the kids look so innocent traveling awash in color contrasts how their lives are about to change with these dark forces conspiring to overtake the world. The color and innocence of childhood is about to end, and then Harry, Ron, Hermoine, and their contemporaries return to another year at school. Professor Dumbledore introduces the Tri Wizard Tournament to be played against champions from two other wizarding academies. One must be seventeen to enter by placing their name in the goblet of fire, which is guarded by Dumbledore’s age line. Fred and George would love to enter as the winner receives one thousand galleons, which they would love to start a joke shop; even they are no match for Dumbledore’s advanced magic. Somehow, someone who wants Harry dead places his name into the goblet of fire. Although only fourteen, Harry is now bound to participate along with the other three champions. His friends and enemies show their true colors as the tournament progresses, those aligning with him as a beacon of hope and those who support the other Hogwarts champion while also being staunch pure blood wizards who are eagerly awaiting the return of Voldemort. The tasks in the tournament, which include battling dragons, Mer people, and various magical creatures and hexes pale in comparison to the constant fear that would blanket the wizarding world should Voldemort return to power. Harry, exhibiting the mettle that has allowed him to overcome Voldemort on multiple occasions, represents the best hope for both the tournament and defeating Voldemort again. Here as the arc of the series reaches its apex, it is obvious that Harry will be destined to fight Voldemort again. The education he receives during this fourth year will be crucial down the road if he is to win that battle. Rowling interjects light moments throughout the book as well: Fred and George’s determination to create jokes, Ron and Hermoine’s growing relationship which comes to a head at the Yule Ball, the foul reporter Rita Skeeter. Readers acquire more magical knowledge as well. Dumbledore siphons his thoughts into a basin called a pensieve. This object will continue to play a role throughout the series, but here we learn about the trials against Voldemort’s supporters during his first downfall. We find new information about Neville’s family as well as Professor Snape, and wonder whose side he is really on, something that isn’t resolved until the end. Hagrid notes that whatever comes, will come, and Rowling notes that the division within the magical community between those who value pure blood and those who value ability are more pronounced that ever. House elves and giants play a prominent role, dementors bide their time to rejoin Voldemort, and Sirius returns to play his role as Harry’s godfather to the best of his ability. Sirius’ presence throughout this book tethers Harry to the magical community more than ever as he is there as a mentor and father figure, taking his place as the family Harry never had, and reminding Harry the need to defeat Voldemort once and for all. Three long books remain. As I am at home with more time than I anticipated to read this series, I may finish sooner than later. It is always bittersweet as I reach this turning point in the series, as Hagrid tells Harry to brace for darker days ahead, just as we are doing in real life now. My kids and I are here for the long haul, both in our new reality of 2020 and on Harry’s journey to eradicate darkness. We will cheer his triumphs and shed some tears as friends succumb to dark powers. Even though this may mirror what is going on in real life, at least for those hours that we are immersed in Harry’s world, we are experiencing a world other than our own, a world full of magic where one person gives us hope that life will be righted sooner rather than later. 5 stars ",171,0.9995,0.043,0.794,0.163,0.5029400804158085,POSITIVE,0.9977

I found myself constantly holding my breath towards the end, there were so many twists and turns! I have actually seen the movie version before, but I forgot much of it, so I was extremely surprised at some of the reveals. The build up towards those situations was just perfect!I loved that we got to see a bit more interaction between muggles and wizards in the beginning, as well as more scenes outside of Hogwarts. It was a nice change and helped bring a bit more realism to the story (it was nice to see that wizards and witches get excited over such a normal thing as a sport event, too!).One of my favorite things in the book was the portrayal of friendship. Harry, Ron and Hermione were depicted as normal teenagers, who sometimes just happen to fight over the stupidest little things. I feel like that really brought their friendship forward, in a way. I, in general, feel like there was a lot of progress and development in the book. I haven't read the following books yet, so I obviously can't say how much of what happened in this one will play a part later, but I still feel like I learned so many new things about the world this story takes place in and about the characters in it.

Rowling. I couldn’t grasp how she could make this most fantastic series with the most complex and most expertly planned out plot, you could tell she was so sure of the story the moment she started writing the first book. Her attention to detail is more than impressive and the diversity and the realness of her characters are just unbelievable. Every single character (even inanimate ones) is fully developed. I am just absolutely, completely, astonished!  ONTO THE RANDOM STUFF  Lol higlights1. George and Fred and their skiving snack boxes. These boys are just too funny. “Maybe Harry’s next task is to attack Percy while he’s in the shower.” 2. Professor Dumbledore and his twinkling eyes.3.

Rub the badge and it’ll change into “Harry Potter is the bestest!”4. THAT RITA SKEETER!5. He who must not be named is officially back! *shivers*6. Harry, you could be a pain sometimes, you know? All the danger signs are there. Your dreams, your scar, your name out of the goblet. Why won’t you listen to Hermione?  Woah moments 1. Harry against the Horntail: Way to go, Harry!2. The triwizard tournament of course3. Basically all the tasks! Harry is awesome! 50 points to Gryffindor for answering the Sphinx’ question.  Hermione moments 1.

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was my most anticipated read of the series… It’s my favorite movie (I KNOW I KNOW- the books are SO MUCH BETTER) and it’s where the books really start to get intense. Even though there was a part that brought tears to my eyes, its not as sad as whats yet to come… I feel like this book is the book of transitioning for Harry, Ron and Hermione. This is the last book of their childhood. If the movies follow the books as well as I hope, shit really starts to get real after this one. There is a lot of depth to this story, the characters and it gets a bit darker than the first three. I love the Tri-Wizard Tournament aspect and the new characters we meet. Once again, I listened to the audio book and the narration was fantastic. If you’ve never read the books before, or your a long time fan- I highly recommend these audio books. The narrator does a fantastic job. I love getting lost in the world of Harry Potter and can’t wait to read more <3 ",112,0.9799,0.048,0.77,0.182,0.5897272727272727,POSITIVE,1.0

Second Time Read Review
To be honest, it was pretty hard for me to decide how many stars I would give to the book. On one hand, I liked the book, but I didn't love it, but on the other hand I felt like I couldn't give it less that 5 stars because I wouldn't be the kind of woman I am today without this series. This series changed me and when I look back at the old version of me, I feel I don't really recognize that girl anymore. So yeah it was pretty complicated for me to rate this book. I think the reason why I didn't love it because I knew what would happen, so the shock was not there anymore. But then I loved the second and third book. hmmm, It's pretty confusing when I think about it. basically, I liked this book but I didn't love it.
Cedric Diggory's death
I cried you know when he refused to take the Triwizard Cup and he told Harry to take it. He was just so good and noble and when Harry told him to take the cup together, I was grinning while crying at the same time because I was so proud of Harry's decision. BUT I STILL CANNOT ACCEPT HIS DEATH. He didn't deserve that kind of death. I really hate Voldemort and Wormtail. They deserve a painful death and may them rot in hell for all the evilness they have done. Honestly, I still can't believe that there are death eaters who actually support Voldemort. Like what the fuck? Voldemort is evil and so freaking bad. 
Snape Being Mean To Hermione
I do not hate Snape but there were moments where he just left me gaping with disbelief on my face because he acted pretty mean and annoyed me. For example is the moment where Harry and Malfoy were fighting and they tried to hex or curse each other, but Malfoy's spell caught Hermione and Hermione's front teeth became longer. Like very long until they passed her collar but then when Snape saw them, he said 

Snape looked coldly at Hermione, then said, 'I see no difference.' 

I was shocked when I read that part because what did Hermione do to deserve that kind of response? that was just so mean. I felt sorry for Hermione right away in that scene. I wanted to say to her that ""it's okay, the teeth can be fixed and Snape was just being bitter.""
The Morning Before The Third Task
I really love the Weasley family with no exception. Percy is my least favorite though. This book is indeed a reread for me but I did not remember at all about this scene where Harry was told to meet his family before the final task and I totally did not know who would come because the Dursleys couldn't possibly come, so who's this family? and then when I realized that it was Mrs Weasley and Bill, my eyes suddenly became teary. It was so clear that Mrs Weasley, Molly, cared and loved Harry. Harry is so lucky to have the Weasley family. They're such a nice family and come to think of it, how can Malfoy mock Ron's family? to me it's so absurd. The Weasley family is a great and I adore this family. Thank you for reading and liking this review! I really appreciate it and I hope you all have an amazing weekend. ❤❤•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••5 STARS
"" Lord Voldemort's gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great. We can fight it only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust, Differences of habit and languages are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are open. ""

My Opinion
OMG!! This book! lot of things happened and I'm still in shocked. okay let's begin with Cedric Diggory. 
My Most Saddest Scene
Cedric was a nice guy and he was really sweet and I liked him. I was so shocked when he died because I thought he would be alive until the last book and he died so fast that I just sat on my bed and I was like "" What did just happen? "" I still can't believe he died in such a young age and it was all because of Voldemort. Oh! and I was so proud of Harry too! he's so kind that he suggested Cedric to hold the cup with him, So there would be two winners not only Harry or Cedric and I was so confused who I wanted to get the cup first, I liked Cedric but I also liked Harry. So I was very happy when Harry suggested that but that happiness vanished as fast as it came. The cup was a portkey and the cup transported them to Voldemort and Cedric died so fast that I didn't even cry. I was just so shocked.because what would Harry say to his parents?! and I was so worried what about if they blamed Harry for this ?!? but thankfully that didn't happen. Cedric's parents were very sad but they didn't blame Harry. They even thanked him for returning Cedric's body to them. 
My Favotite Scenes
I think there is something change between Hermione and Ron.Ron was so mad when Hermione went to the ball with Viktor. He said it was because Viktor was from Drumstrang and he said Hermione was fraternizing with the enemy. But I still don't believe this at all. Before Hermione went to the ball with Viktor, Ron liked Viktor so much that he even wanted to get his autograph and I think he acted like that because he was jealous. hahaha. it was so funny and sweet to see Ron got jealous and there's also this scene : 'Known what?' said Ron quickly. 'You haven't been mixing up Love Potions, have you?''Don't be stupid,' Hermione snapped, starting to pound up her beetles again. ' No, it's just ... how did she know Viktor asked me to visit him over the summer?'Hermione blushed scarlet as she said this and determinedly avoided Ron's eyes. 'What?' said Ron, dropping his pestle with a loud clunk.'He asked me right after he'd pulled me out of the lake,' Hermione muttered. 'After he'd got rid of his shark's head. Madam Pomfrey gave us both blankets and then he sort of pulled me away from the judges so they wouldn't hear, and he said, if I wasn't doing anything over the summer, would I like to -''And what did you say?' said Ron, who had picked up his pestle and was grinding it on the desk, a good six inches from his bowl, because he was looking at Hermione. 'and he did say he'd never felt the same way about anyone else,'Hermione went on, going so red now that Harry could almost feel the heat coming from her, 'but how could Rita Skeeter have heard him? She wasn't there ... or was she? Maybe she has got an invisibility Cloak, maybe she sneaked into the grounds to watch the second task ...' 'And what did you say?' Ron repeated, pounding his pestle down so hard it dented the desk. 'Well, I was too busy seeing whether you and Harry were OK to -'but before she could finish that sentence Snape came. Ugh. why did he have to come when she hadn't finish it!?!? but that scene was sweet and funny wasn't it?! AHH MY HEART!!
The Plot Twist
 The plot twist in this book was better than the plot twist in first book, second book and third book. I swear I didn't expect that at all! I thought the bad guy was Ludo Bagman because he acted so strange. He asked Harry whether he wanted his help or not and so I thought he was the bad guy. then there was a scene where Moody was the bad guy but he wasn't Moody. he was the imposter of Moody and the real Moody was imprisoned in his own trunk and this imposter was Barty Crouch's son.

Book Review

4+ of 5 stars to Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, the 4th book in the ""Harry Potter"" young adult fantasy series, written in 2000 by J.K. Rowling. Although this one was close to a 5 for me, I think it's enough to give 1 book in the series a 5-rating, which means this one will stay at a 4. But I still loved and adored the characters, the setting, the story, the themes... all of it! Rather than go into a detailed review, as we've seen too many of them (always fun to read tho!), I'm just going to chat a little bit about the parts that I enjoyed the most.1. The selection of the 3 students to participate in the Tri-Wizard Tournament. It's scary to think the schools condone putting the kids at such risk, but then again, I suppose they'd stop it just before anyone died or was hurt irreparably. To imagine the goblet of fire choosing one from each school, and then Harry's name being cast as a fourth one... fantastic idea and approach. I felt the drama. And I loved having him put to the test mid-way thru the series... as he never seemed to be all that good of a student or a wizard!2. The introduction of new characters in this one is intense. I loved all the folks at the various stages of the competition. To see feelings emerge for one another, to know they were going thru the same unrequited love and anger we all go through as teenagers. Was a good experience -- I thought it was one of the more real aspects of the series.3. The imagination for all the tournaments and the dance... fantastic. I wanted to be there watching it all happen. I can only imagine how it felt to write those scenes... knowing it would propel the characters forward in a very different path by the end. And to see the drama of how it all turns out.I am feeling the need to re-read this series again soon...

“It is my belief... that the truth is generally preferable to lies.”
Re-read - Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire steps up from the previous ones very well, it's the darkest book I've ever read since Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Who knows ? Harry Potter grows up and becomes a boy who has to take the responsibility on his shoulders, he never wants to be selected, he never wants glory and prestige, yet the world turns against him anyway.I love that this book isn't a children's book anymore, in my opinion, it becomes hastily intense and has more dimensions than J.K. Rowling had ever intended. She did a great job when she wrote this book, I could see her intention for the book to be a mature one and she made the right decision for doing that. I'm so pround of her and so she becomes my favorire author EVER !
“If you want to know what a man's like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.” 

“It matters not what someone is born, but what they grow to be.” 
Not only this book is full of adventures, but it hides some messages for you to discover. Isn't it the best way to teach our children via books ? Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire has everything I've asked for since the first time I read. Until now, the book is like a gem and I think of it as my treasure because it's so precious my eyes hurt to look at.Many things happen in this book such as a tragedy and deprecation, but it's the way our lives go on, right ? So I embraced this book like a teddy bear and told myself that perhaps something really bad would happen, but it's just mishaps and it would pass like a rainy day.
“Remember, if the time should come when you have to make a choice between what is right and what is easy, remember what happened to a boy who was good, and kind, and brave, because he strayed across the path of Lord Voldemort. Remember Cedric Diggory.”

And I’m stuck somewhere betwixt 4 and 5 stars for this one, so I’ll just write this review, pop on back to the beginning and smack a rating on this bad boy. (Disclaimer: I am on Hour 26 post-wisdom teeth surgery, on some painkillers no one should turn their nose up at, and desperate for solid food and human interaction. So in other words, bear with me, because this may be...somethin’.)https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...Okay, let’s start with our characters. I always gotta discuss the same collection of several. Both Harry and Ron are pretty consistently eh characters for me (except in the first book, in which I really enjoyed Harry). Here, instead of being eh, I found them...annoying? It drove me absolutely insane that Harry kept procrastinating his clues - like no yeah, do your Divination homework the night it’s assigned, but please put the life-or-death clue off to the side for now. And don’t even get me started on their constant, needless bickering. Ugh. HOW ARE YOU BOTH SOMEHOW EQUALLY ANNOYING HERE?Neville, on the other hand? Cemented his status as a fave o’ mine. His backstory is great. He really deserves to be in Gryffindor, the brave li’l guy, and I just want to give him a big hug. Snape, meanwhile....Well, somehow he outdoes himself here. I just don’t know how I’m going to hold onto this rant until book 7. God, you guys, get ready for a tsunami of anger, I guess.And let’s discuss that feminist message, shall we? I, first off, love that my perhaps-all-time-favorite character Hermione gets political as hell in this one. Mad respect, girl. And for a cause that she’s laughed at for, even one that would make her life far, far easier in every means if she just backed off it! (I’m seeing some parallels to feminism here….) Plus, her defeat of Rita Skeeter, who taunted her for her appearance and reduced her meaning as a person to the boys she spent time with, is just amazing.And don’t even get me started on the representation of women in professional sports in this book! Fabulous enough that almost half of the Gryffindor quidditch team is female, but the fact that there are women competitors in the Quidditch World Cup? Amazing! There’s no underestimating the empowerment that representation lent to young, female readers who dreamed of being athletes.If only this wonderful treatment of women - and we know that Rowling is a tried-and-true feminist - extended to the Triwizard Tournament. But alas, all we get is...Fleur. Fleur’s only trait is her beauty (cough cough, reminds me of someone we know, cough cough, CHO F*CKING CHANG), she (like Rita Skeeter to Hermione) is reduced to the boys she spends time with/thereby must be flirting with (Cedric, the Ravenclaw quidditch captain), and, worst of all, she’s not a good competitor. She gives an eh performance in the first task, receives pity-points in the second, and is ignored and eliminated in the third. Ms. Rowling, my love, couldn’t she at least use her looks cunningly to distract her opponent? If you were only going to give us one girl competitor out of four, couldn’t she at least be, well, good?There were fewer stupid mistakes in this one, but there were still some. One being that somehow magic-less mermaids painted pictures of themselves on a rock...underwater. Unless they’re sourcing that fancy schmancy under-da-sea paint, they should not be able to do that. Also, the search for Sirius is never mentioned by the many (many, many, many, MANY) members of the Ministry of Magic we are CONSTANTLY seeing in this book. Or by Rita Skeeter. Which doesn’t make sense, because that search was a big f*cking deal. (And don’t you think ol’ Skeeter would want to bring up that failing when she’s writing inflammatory articles about Hogwarts and/or the Ministry?)But this comes down to the same thing all these reviews come down to: the world. Goblet of Fire gives us the biggest look into the Wizarding World since Sorcerer’s Stone (Quidditch World Cup! Triwizard Tournament! The operations of the Ministry of Magic!), and because I love looking at this world so flippin’ much (plus fewer teeny errors) I have to give this a high rating.Bottom line: definitely better than the second and third, and maybe (MAYBE!) an almost-tie for favorite-so-far with the first one. The feminism contains some mixed messages, there are a couple things that don’t make sense, and I still haven’t found a way to kill a fictional character (but when I do, watch your back, Severus). But the world, Hermione, Neville’s story, and a couple other great things overcome all that. This book rocks! Hurray!",92,0.9897,0.094,0.771,0.134,0.4991906721536352,NEGATIVE,0.9362

54,262535509,01/15/2012,3.0,"This was the book that broke me from the HP series. My bride insists they got better, but she also married me, so her taste is... suspect.I loved Prisoner of Azkaban. Great struggle, clever time-travel story (very hard to do) and our first real glimpses of the dark places where this series would head. I liked that shift, I really did. So what broke me?Firstly, the plot holes. Well, more accurately, one plot hole, but it was a frackin' doozy. You know the opening scene in Star Wars where the camera is beneath the belly of the Star Destroyer and the shot just goes on and on for about ten frackin' minutes and you can practically hear George Lucas yelling ""That's right, Star Destroyers are REALLY BIG, bitches!""? Well, this was a Star Destroyer sized plot hole. (view spoiler)[ Rowling goes to some length spelling out that portkeys can be anything. A cup. A book. A fluffy bunny. She also establishes that you can't teleport in and out of Hogwarts, because it's warded. Fair enough. BUT, Harry and his chums have often left the grounds of HG's, to go and drink 'butterbeer' or buy living chocolate frogs or snog in alleyways or whatever. The precedent has been set that they can and do leave the school grounds. FFS, Harry lived outside of Hogwarts for YEARS (and yeah Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru's [or whatever] place was magicked so folks couldn't find him, but how did he get back and forth to it, eh? A TRAIN.)SO, you are an evil overlord trying to take over the world. You need Harry's blood to get your body back. You have an agent WITHIN Hogwarts, despite all these magical defenses, disguised as a teacher that Harry implicitly trusts.Do you:a) Set in place an elaborate ruse, framed around this enormous tri-wizard tournament, which (presumably) is under scrutiny by the most powerful wizards in the world and the ministry of magic, in which you manipulate events so that Harry not only enters the tournament (despite rules that expressly say that he's not old enough) but wins it, touches the tri-wizard cup, which, despite all these defenses and wizard-y scrutiny and security, you've managed to turn into a frackin' portkey (yes, you're that good) so that he gets teleported away from the tourney grounds into your evil clutches and hey, you bleed that bitch.b) Have your agent (who Harry implicitly trusts) say ""hey Potter, what's say we head down to the pub for a mug of butterbeer and I'll tell you some stuff about your dad/mum/long lost twin?"" use all your evil-wizardyness to change a mug of butterbeer into a portkey, and save everyone around 400 pages of this book.Sorry, but I didn't buy it. I've read many fan arguments explaining why the tri-wizard tournament and everything around it wasn't window-dressing on an overly complicated plan, the fruits of which could have very easily been borne by a far less convoluted and complex Evil Scheme(tm) which, granted, probably wouldn't have made a very interesting book, but YOUR WAREZ, I AM NOT BUYING THEM. (hide spoiler)]But second, and more importantly, it was in GoF that I realized that Harry was going to win. That he was just awesome, and no matter what rules were set in place (you're too young to enter the tournament/you're ten years old, why on earth would we put you in the CLUTCH position on our Quidditch team/you wear glasses, the ladiez don't dig dudes in glasses) he would triumph. Rowling LOVED Harry. She loved all the Harry gang. Too much. And it became painfully obvious that these kids were going to win, without a single fatality/crippling sacrifice/crushing loss. That in the end, Voldemort would be beaten, and Harry would marry Ginny, and Ron would marry Hermione and everyone would live happily ever after and make lots of adorable wizard babies.This was the book Harry ceased being a character and became a caricature. A SUPERHERO. Superheros bore me. I want torment. I want LOSS. I want my heroes to pay a TANGIBLE and TERRIBLE price for their victories. And no, killing tertiary characters doesn't count. (view spoiler)[Digory? The Weasley twin? Even Dumbledore (yeah I know he dies, I got spoiled) is disposable.  (hide spoiler)]I need to believe my heroes could fail. I know they probably won't. I know the good guys will eventually win. But I need to be afraid for them. I need to be scanning the faces of the MAIN characters and wondering ""which one of you will be dead/emotionally crippled/hideously disfigured before the final act is over?"" And I never believed for a second that Rowling would harm a hair on their heady-head-heads.(view spoiler)[And, turns out, she didn't. :P (hide spoiler)](shrugs)",82,0.8802,0.127,0.733,0.139,0.559761345852895,NEGATIVE,0.9998

I found it entertaining and really enjoyed all the inventive ideas around magic that Rowling comes up with. I kept saying to myself, ""why didn't I think of that?""The character development is interesting too as Harry is clearly heading into adolescence and having issues with girls. The Yuletide dance scene was absolutely the best part of the book, I thought. And, for the francophones reading this review, the French translation misses entirely the sly humorous French and Eastern European accents that Rowling uses for the Beauxbatons girls and the Durmstrang boys which were hilarious! That being said, I was a little disappointed with the Fleur Delacourt character from Beauxbatons. As the only girl among the four champions, she totally sucked at all three challenges. Not a very encouraging model for French girls or girls in general. I mean, I know Harry always has to win, but perhaps it would have been a wee bit better and even more suspenseful if Fleur had placed a bit higher. A note about the movie: it was FRUSTRATING! The movie skipped easily half of the book or more - no quidditch at all :( - and I don't know how folks could have followed the action without having read the book because to my eyes, there were a lot of nonsequitors (like the poor editing of the death eater scene following the Quidditch World Cup.)

The Goblet of Fire is, by far, the darkest installment of the series. It also marks a turning point in the series where it drops its young adult style and moves on to a more mature and adult audience. There is more plot and character development here. The story gets fiercer, adventurous, and nerve-wracking with nonstop action. The characters are mature. Harry, Hermione, and Ron are already facing adolescent issues. Harry's infatuated with Cho, Ron is jealous over Hermione's date for the Yule Ball, and Hermione is conscious of her appearance. These growing-up issues, the everyday normal school life, and Harry's nightmarish adventure together knot a powerful chord that binds readers to the book. There is a whole new magical world created here. One can see lots of new introductions of magical creatures, spells, and many peculiar wizarding items. I found this new magical realm created by Rowling to be very charming. Even the dark and mysterious ambiance had its allure. It's funny that I didn't like it much the first time. I can't recall why. Perhaps I didn't want Diggory to die and thought it could have been avoided. 16 years ago, I'm sure to have been more sentimental :). But if it was my reason (I'm not certain), I have surely failed to appreciate the flow of the story. The death of Cedric Diggory was necessary to establish the gravity of the situation, to show the kind of dangers they are about to face with the rise of the Dark Lord.

The way this book is moulded together is a true art and masterpiece. It continues to baffle me how one could come up with such an incredible story like this, simply from their own mind.In this novel, we begin to see the start of Ron and Hermione’s future relationship, and it was so cute to read about Ron’s obvious jealousy.This book really set up the eerie tone for the next books, and I can’t wait to see how dark the story ends up going, as I know it definitely gets a-lot darker in terms of the movies.I loved Dumbledore and Sirius in this, and Hermione’s bad-assery really started to kick off towards the end! I can’t wait to see how that progresses. The words Dumbledore says just shows how wise he is, and I love it!J.K. Rowling’s use of the Dementors is an incredible link to what they’re supposed to represent, which is depression. I’ll share with you a line that made me appreciate Ms. Rowling’s brain on this even more than I previously did:“Most go mad in there, and plenty stop eating in the end. They lose the will to live. You could always tell when a death was coming, because the Dementors could sense it, they got excited.”There certainly are some incredible quotes and passages throughout this novel, and I bow down to you, J.K. Rowling. I’m so excited to continue to read how Harry and his friends grow and mature, as the tone of the book does also.",53,0.9865,0.061,0.765,0.175,0.5710043787629995,POSITIVE,0.9994

How did we get so blessed to live in a generation where we can read a fully developed and incredible fantasy series that connects all it's threads together and weaves an epic tale of magic, personal growth and friendship? Re-reading this book was such a reminder to me of how blessed I am that I have the privilege to read Rowling's art—I know she personally is super prejudice and problematic right now and I feel like this book showcases how much of a hypocrite she is being when this book literally talks constantly about not having prejudice and that’s all she keeps spreading on her platform right now 😞😒🤦🏻‍♀️. However, this is the book where we really start to appreciate her mastery with the quill because so many loose ends from the first three novels begin to weave together. We get a fuller picture of the Wizard World and a deeper understanding of what happened when Voldemort was around the first time. During this read, I started to make a list of what I missed in the movies, but it really just turned into a list of some of my favorite things, so here we go!🧙🏻‍♀️ The Weasleys and the Dursleys meeting by way of the Dursley's chimney. 🤣🧙🏻‍♀️ The intricacies of having the Quidditch World Cup without muggles knowing about it 🧙🏻‍♀️ The sorting hat's yearly song. It is especially delightful when listening to the audiobook because the narrator does an amazing job singing it. 🧙🏻‍♀️ Hermoine's campaign for House Elves even though no one asked her to help 🤣 Poor Ron and Harry being forced into S.P.E.W🧙🏻‍♀️ Dobby. He is just so funny and loyal and a mess and I was so sad he wasn't in this movie. 🧙🏻‍♀️Ghosts teaching courses and being around all the time--not just Moaning Myrtle--and of course Peeves the Poltergeist. I just still can't understand why he wasn't in the movies. He's hilarious and so micheavious and I wish he was there. 🧙🏻‍♀️ The depth to the trials of the Tri-Wizard tournament. Yes the movies have each of them, but so much is missing. 🧙🏻‍♀️Bill Weasley. Swoon. 🥰 Being there for Harry in the final trial, meeting Fleur and generally being present rather than just showing up to get married and fight Voldemort in the last two movies 🤦🏻‍♀️Bottom line this book is masterful and incredible, and the movie is a perfect depiction of how Hollywood ruins stories.",52,0.9779,0.089,0.774,0.137,0.545700666854513,POSITIVE,0.9954

Harry Potter deserved better. I deserved better. I fucking hate Voldemort, Wormtail, creepy ass Mad-Eyed Moody that wasn't actually the real Mad-Eyed Moody because it was the fuckface named Barty Crouch. UGH! So much anger towards these characters.Then there's the whole TriWizard tournament which I'm not a huge fan of. Dragons - 100% dangerous (unless you're fucking Eragon, Daenery's Mother of Dragons, or Spyro)Eggs/Mermaids - 99.9% creepy as fuck and hurt your ears unless under waterTrophy - but not a trophy because it's a portkey to deathVoldemort - I can't wait for you to die.Again, I'm super emotional and I have no idea if my review is making sense but let's continue this shit anyways.Harry, man I love you. I'm so happy you got another school year away from the dreadful Dursleys. If I could I would totally send them to Voldemort for a nice vacation. But I can't. I'm happy his friendship with Hermione and Ron is stronger than ever. I hate that he was crushing on Cho the entire time. COME ON MAN! I fucking ship you with Ginny so go be with Ginny. Hermione was cute throughout the entire book. I loved her at the Yule Ball. I loved how she was always by Harry's side throughout the whole tournament. Ron was acting like a baby back bitch for the some of the book. But once he got the stick removed from his asshole he was a lot more tolerable. I love his friendship with Harry. I love the whole fucking Weasley family too - except for Percy, he sucks major ass.Mad-Eyed Moody was a creep from the start. I didn't like him at all - can I get Lupin back?!? I also find it strange that every year there's a fucking new teacher. Can't Dumbledore hire someone more permanent? Oh, and speaking of the bad ass wizard - I am so happy that he was there for Harry in the end. I get that he couldn't get him out of the tournament to begin with (because he was so young) but he always stood by his side. Other than that Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire made me an emotional wreck. I'm sure my family is judging me hardcore right now. I'm a mess. I can't relive through this torturous book ever again. I can't keep going through Cedric's death. Or Harry's infatuation with Cho. I need happiness. I need death - Voldemort's of course.

Unlike other books, this one gave us someone else too to dote on, other than the indefatigable trio- Harry, Hermione and Ron.THE TRIWIZARD TOURNAMENT:⏩Any year that exempts Harry from taking the year-end exams has got to be the best one, even though he was granted the concession only in the light of other scarier tasks. ⏩This is the year when the rivalry between houses has a slightly subdued presence as the Beauxbatons and the Durmstrang crowd arrives. In the face of stiff international competition, the rare display of camaraderie between Hufflepuff and Gryffindor is an indicator that Dumbledore's party is capable of standing united to tackle the external adversary, whether it is only the harmless fellow wizarding schools or a more nefarious death eater or the ultimate Dark Lord himself. ⏩No other untoward incident in any of the previous Harry Potter books hurt as much as the horrific death of the charming, beloved Cedric Diggory. ❎If anything ever made me strongly convinced of the unfairness of the whole affair, it was Cedric's death.❎If anything ever made Voldemort utterly inexcusable, then it was Cedric's terrible end. [image error]Rowling has always exercised caution in doling out punishments unnecessarily to the undeserving people, but, maybe she wanted the Triwizard Cup to be a turning point. The moment Cedric and Harry touched the cup was also the moment that brought contradictory, unhappy feelings to our hitherto always-feel-good Harry Potter moments. Maybe Rowling wanted to rouse the bland, simmering-beneath-the-surface sentiments of the readers into a raging inferno that is ready to devour the evil Voldemort, if the readers ever succeed in finding their platform Nine And Three Quarters. UGLY GETS MORE UGLY. ⏩If for all these days, we have been associating words like slime, filth, crawling-skin with Voldemort, things have just gotten slimier, filthier and more skin crawling! Yeww, we finally get to see the devil with its lock, stock and barrel. Do we like what we see? ⏩Finally, subtlety? You gotta learn it from the fraudulent Moody. Things are not going to be the same, but y'all accept that there was a fleeting moment when you wanted to hurl unforgivable curses at him? Poor chap! Anyway, we need to watch out for the slimeball with slits for nose! ",48,-0.9856,0.158,0.723,0.119,0.6181972789115645,POSITIVE,0.6086

75,2951228690,08/30/2019,4.0,"The hero of the fourth Harry Potter novel is the author J.K. Rowling.IMHO this is where she hit her stride and was moving forward with confidence as a storyteller. Sorcerer’s Stone was published in 1997 and was 322 pages. Chamber of Secrets was from 1998 and was 341 pages. Prisoner of Azkaban (which many reviewers have labeled as the best novel) was published in 1999 and was 435 pages. Perhaps more noteworthy was that sales of the book and critical acclaim had grown exponentially as word of this great series spread out from reading groups and exploded into bestseller status. Buoyed by the success of her earlier books and by selling the film rights and preparing for the upcoming film in 2001, Rowling literally knew without a doubt that people were buying what she was selling.Goblet of Fire was first published in 2000 and was a bold 734 pages. (It would later win the Hugo for Best Novel). It is the most ambitious of her novels to date and expands beyond Hogwarts into other magic schools and other countries and into the Ministry of Magic and pushes and elbows into our muggle world. Most noteworthy, though, is that we see Rowling’s personality and self-assurance shining through in her language. Not quite swaggering with virtuosity but certainly with a playful earnestness and ease borne of knowing what she’s doing and knowing that people are digging it.Two rival wizarding schools have arrived for the Triwizard Tournament. Champions from each school will compete to win and represent their academy. The Ministry of Magic is following closely and so are the Death Eaters, the remnants of Voldemort’s followers. Voldemort has grown stronger and is threatening to awaken back into the world and to threaten Harry.Rowling’s dialogue and characterization, already exceptional, blooms here and we get to know a plethora of fascinating players. She expands her already impressive world building into what is becoming Pottermore, the Harry Potter Universe. The growing maturity of the main characters is matched by the increasingly mature tone of the narrative.

Now he suddenly realised Cedric was in fact a useless pretty-boy who didn't have enough brains to fill an eggcup.At this point, you’ve either read the Harry Potter series, or you’ve deliberately chosen not to read them. Either way, there’s not much to say here. Each of the Harry Potter books is great in its own way, but Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is probably my favorite. The Quidditch World Cup. The selection of the Champions. The Tri-Wizard Tournament. Dragons. The Yule Ball. The Pensieve. The graveyard scene marking the return of Lord Voldemort. The book just flows from one great scene to the next, with just the right balance of humor and drama.

78,1471598053,12/17/2015,4.0,"Believe it or not - yes, I finally read the fourth book in the Harry Potter series, a book which made me anticipate the next three installments in the series even more eagerly. A Harry Potter book is no book you simply read; it is a book you are allowed to live in. I don't know any fantasy world which feels as realistic as this one. While the first three books were comparatively short, this one was - so far - the longest with 766 pages. 766 pages? It felt like 300, considering my pace while rushing through this book.Please choose wisely before reading this review. There are no specific spoilers, but in case you haven't read the first four books in the series, you might want to turn away from this review.Until now, The Goblet of Fire was the Harry Potter book I enjoyed most because it managed to find the perfect point of balance between the dark, gloomy and complex plot elements surrounding the return of Vol ... sorry, You Know Who, and the light-hearted, funny scenes which managed to conjure a smile on my face whenever another one of those appeared during the course of the book. Still I couldn't bring myself to rate this with five stars, as there were quite a few things which bothered me. (And yes, I know that I am getting myself in severe danger right now with saying this. I will better take to my heels and run as fast as I can after posting this review.)First of all, in case you have not already realized this during The Prisoner of Azkaban, the Harry Potter series is far away from being a children's book series anymore. Especially in the beginning and the ending, horror elements outweigh everything else, crying at the reader, ""This is no children's book you are reading anymore!"" Well, then why does J.K. Rowling still constantly fall back to the habit of using childish language? A short search of the story brought up nearly 1,400 exclamation marks. And everytime I stumbled upon yet another one, the only thing I could think of was this picture ...But well, by now, I have developed a soft spot for Harry Potter books, and sometimes childish writing style is not that bad, just ... kind of annoying. However, quite a few other things bothered me while reading this book, and I will now try to go through them as fast as possible. After all, I have learned one thing about discussions in my school time which still stays with me - list the arguments your reader should forget about first, then he will be even more convinced by the positive arguments you will list afterwards.► Rita Skeeter. I am sure just dropping her name makes a lot of fans of the series want her to meet a Dementor. However, the way she appeared made me think of her as a pure caricature, causing nothing but trouble, without being even the slightest bit complex, simply annoying and not the least obstacle to write as a character because of her one-dimensional appearance. I would have loved to see some more insight into her character, but sadly ... J.K. Rowling decided to just present us with a caricature.► How could someone as dumb as Fudge be Minister for Magic? (That's no true criticism. After all, just look at some of our real world's politicians. And yet ... can someone please lock up Fudge right beside Rita?)► The next tournament should include a World Cup of Perfection. Dumbledore would almost certainly win.► Why isn't Hermione more prominent? Certain parts of the books made me wish for her character to have a more major role.Now that the reasons for my 4-star-rating are out of the way, here comes what I loved about the book:► DOBBY. I know there are quite a few people who didn't like his uncommon behavior, but I fell in love with him. He is probably the cutest and most adorable character of the entire series, and his actions are always based on good-hearted motivations. Go, Dobby!► Socks that scream when they stink? Definitely my favorite moment of the book.► DRAGONS!► There are new characters, there are old characters, but they all have a certain depth. (No, Rita, I am not speaking of you.) I especially loved how the dynamics between Ron, Hermione and Harry were explored by throwing some obstacles for their friendships into the game. And this article perfectly highlights why Hermione should have a more prominent role in the books.► The Triwizard Tournament was pure awesomeness. I loved every part of it, and I am not ashamed to admit it.► (Almost) nothing is predictable in this series. I was so sure to find out (view spoiler)[Bagman (hide spoiler)] is the true culprit, but ... J.K. Rowling took my prediction and shred it to pieces. (I only wish that my intention to predict things will not continue to be destroyed by spoilers people seem to carelessly leave all over the internet. I will leave a huge thank you right here to the person who spoiled all the upcoming deaths in the next three books to me ... in a review for the second Harry Potter book. Thank you.)► There are actually signs of romance! Now let's hope there will be some more developments on the romantic level of these books, because even though I hate when romantic entanglements are thrown into the story just to make sure the reader roots for the oh-so perfect protagonists, these books need some romance. Harry, Ron and Hermione are teenagers now, and I totally want to see them discovering that children aren't born just because two people care about each other.► I want more of Cho Chang. Seriously.► Hagrid might not be as cute as Dobby, but he is certainly just as adorable.► This has the best world-building ever. I never liked the fantasy genre; there was even a time which saw me absolutely and whole-heartedly loathing it.And then I read Harry Potter.Two final thoughts on this book:(view spoiler)[An athlete: What was the most important moment in the history of sports?Me: Viktor Krum caught the snitch, but Ireland won.

This book is for you if… you have enjoyed the previous HP books and are ready to let the story become even darker as Lord Voldemort attempts to rise again (again).
⇝Preface.I am very happy to write this review, for several reasons:1) that a Harry Potter book is the first review of the new year2) Harry Potter (duh)3) I read this book together with the amazing 
Harry Potter and the Sacred Text Podcast
 which improved and enhanced my understanding of the Harry Potter world in so many ways. I can highly recommend the podcast to anyone, even if you are not a fan of the series or just haven't gotten down to reading it yet because it not only gives you a chance to question your current understanding of HP, but also of your life. It sounds wild and utopic, but it isn't. HP Sacred Text has empowered me to make sense of my ""real"" world a lot better and has given me the tools to work on myself. If you actually wish to read the HP series, then you should probably read each chapter before listening to the podcast.4) I think it's a good sign that I started 2019 with finishing a book that has had a very strong influence on my life ever since.
⇝Overall
The element of gossip is stronger than it ever has been before and it gives a special dimension to this fourth book in the series, which I like very much. The extra depth and the coming of age topics provide balance for the approaching darkness that weaves itself into the plot, as it becomes clear that more than one game is being played at Hogwarts (again).
⇝What’s happening.
Let's just say that the beginning of Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts isn't exactly a great one. After having to witness deatheater-action at the Quidditch world cup's final match, Harry is excited to dive into school and spend time with his friends, given his time with the Dursleys over the summer only held one good memory, which was Arthur Weasley picking him up to take him to stay with the Weasleys for the rest of the holidays.This year is definitely going to be special, as Harry, Ron and Hermoine are excited to learn. The Triwizard Tournament will be held at Hogwarts. The school will thus host guests from schools in Bulgaria and France. The Tournament, supposed to be a fun event that lures the participants to the edge of their magical skills, is a competition where three champions, one from each school - Hogwarts, Beauxbatont and Durmstrang - have to prove themselves worthy of the Goblet of Fire. This cup is only presented to the winner of the trio, who must show extraordinary endurance in both magical and emotional matters. As you might have guessed by now, this is not a competition to be taken lightly. Because of the deathly past of this tournament, it was decided that only students above the age of 17 - i.e. the wizarding age of maturity - are allowed to participate. Save to say dangers lie ahead as Harry finds himself being called on the night where the names for the champions are drawn. The quarrel between the schools upon the fact that Hogwarts is now in the run with TWO champions is the smallest problem. The imminent question Harry has to ask himself is: Who put my name in the Goblet of Fire?. It doesn't take long for him to realize that someone has an extraordinarily massive axe to grind with him because after getting deeper and deeper into it seems as if Harry could consider himself lucky above average if he came out of this with all limbs still attached.Also worthy to question is Why does Ron behave like a git? Ronald, always having been overshadowed by his siblings and later Harry feels left out as he only sees the benefits that come with the spotlight attached to being a champion. As someone who has been spending time with the trio for almost 20 years now it is obvious to me that Ron doesn't actually believe Harry found a way to evade the multiple measures and ancient magic protecting the Goblet of Fire against manipulation and chose not to share this information with his best friend.The first task arrives and it is only good that Harry got a heads up in advance about the specifics of it, because fighting a massive Hungarian Horntail for an egg is everything but child's play. Lucky, all his bones are still intact, he avoids worrying about what is yet to come and gets lost between a noisy Daily Prophet reporter, crushes and most of all, gossip._____________________

I'll be here writing all day and you'll be here reading all day if I even try to sum up everything that happens to the characters during Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts. So here are my thoughts in a nutshell. Harry finds himself thrown into a very dangerous Triwizard Tournament that sends the students up against a myriad of terrifying events that will raise your blood pressure, your heart rate, and the hairs on the back of your neck on numerous occasions throughout the book. The dark side of magic goes from too close for comfort in the beginning to an all time high level of intensity with a shocking finale by the end! For the tournament they're two separate wizarding schools mixed in with the Hogwarts students which adds a nice blending of cultures and challenges Harry, Ron, and Hermione to an additional element of boy meets girl for the Yule Ball, something they haven't had to confront until now. As a result this book really starts to dig deep down to the humanitarian dimensions and teenage drama within each of the characters, making it by far the most emotional year yet. Some things are worse than death. And that's just the beginning!Even though it's a 734 page book, the story continues along at a terrifying pace from beginning to end with no such luck of a break in the action anywhere in between! I'm still nursing a stiff neck! J. K.

After turning the last page and felt REALLY cheated, I never go back to read any other HP book.PSS: I read in somewhere that one of the appeals of Harry Potter series is that Harry as a character satisfies a common childhood fantasy about an orphaned/abused child getting away from the bad family (Harry's aunt and uncle) and goes into a world when he has a perfect family (Harry's real parents, they're perfect because they're dead), and everyone in this new world thinks he's important.Who hadn't imagined our parents aren't our real parents and we had a perfect family somewhere else, back when we were kids and our parents were giving us grief? And who hadn't imagined there's a secret world somewhere, where our importance and significance would be acknowledged and recognized, when as in reality we aren't so very special?

It's probably my least favourite of the books (or closely tied with PS for least favourite) but in this case ''least'' favourite still means a book I loveI love the mystery elements of this book, and the role Sirius plays in it. I also like how well it bridges the lighter tone of the earlier books and the darker tones of the next.

93,2300244008,02/18/2018,,"➳ 3-4 stars (view spoiler)[Because, well, nostalgia. (hide spoiler)]Whereas the first three books in the Harry Potter series have been considerably lighter—both in content and in volume—Goblet of Fire is the first one that has truly made its descent into darkness. It delves into much more serious, and much graver themes, and I feel like this is the book where you realize how much Rowling’s writing has developed, and how much the characters have grown (up).What I love most about this book (series) is, that even though it is placed in the fantasy genre, and is very much about magic, the themes of friendship, family, love, and sense of community, are so beautifully woven into the story that they can’t help but strike a chord with me.Goblet of Fire also contains so many of my favorite quotes in the Harry Potter series, and as such, it will always hold a special place in my heart.
“It matters not what someone is born, but what they grow to be.”
*Reading this book (or reading Harry Potter at all, to be honest) always makes mea) want to be Hermione Granger, orb) want Hermione Granger to be my best friend.

97,9681454,11/28/2007,5.0,"I'm a Harry Potter fan. A rather hardcore one, back in the day. The Harry fans at the big meetup of 2007 (last book) ditched me for not being cool enough. Shows what they know.I don't know if anyone on goodreads followed the intense Harry Potter fanbase core in the good old days. I wasn't on goodreads until after the last book came out. Goblet of Fire was the last Harry Potter book before all of the bitching naysayers. It was never as much fun after that, either to discuss theories or pick apart clues. It was also the book that started the ""I hate Ron!"" club (the Draco Malfoy is a conflicted hero idea started around the Chamber of Secrets film. Hey, I could be a Harry Potter scholar). It was pretty much like looking up any movie on the imdb or a tv show on Television Without Pity. No one hates something more than an obsessive fan, right? Fanfic writers who actually preferred their interpretations more than the original source (crazy!). The fanbase could be deterimental to nuturing ones own ""ohmigod I'm going to die without the next book"" that I so desperately needed. Harry Potter was my ""something to look forward to"". I haven't found anything else to take its place. I've not tried to hang around the fringes of a big fan base again, either. (My random goodreads tastes probably don't count. I have no idea what the big thing is. I liked The Hunger Games for the cozy district twelve parts and didn't give a rationed fig for love triangles or political outcome. I'm a loner bookworm freak!) Almost as bad were all of the people who felt some pressing need to inform me that they were too cool to even try to read Harry Potter, as if it made one bit of difference to me. [I suspect that I was expected to backtrack. You know, the way a person will immediately downplay how much they liked or disliked something based on what someone else says about it.] I was going to read it with or without them. They were not beating me by being too cool for school (especially if that school is Hogwarts!). Why were they too cool for Harry after Goblet of Fire? The fans, I mean.I don't remember an awful lot about plot points (I'm older now and my memory wasn't that good to begin with). There is some overlap between books, for sure. I do remember savoring the details and not because it would help me figure out was going to happen. I WANTED surprises. Harry disliking Ron for the bit of skin showing between his ankles and his pajama ends? That would totally have swayed me to be unwilling to hear an apology and nurse the annoyance another few days. I loved it when the whole school hated Harry (which is about all of the time). I loved how he didn't study and had to work up to the last minute nerve for everything. Those kinds of details made it for me. I remember the wait between the books and being excited to find out what Neville was up to over the summer (long live Neville Longbottom!). But no, the base was miffed 'cause they didn't get another Sirius Black who owned the motorbike that Hagrid used to escort Harry to Privet Drive appearing in Prisoner of Azkaban. If that's what you wanted the appeal of Harry Potter would be dead in the water with the giant squid after the last book. That's not me!Oh yeah, so it was a huge turning point in the series. Voldemort rises again, the romance shit (Rowling's one big flaw, in my mind). They got longer and less tightly edited (we fans were greedy for closer release dates. They had no one but themselves to blame!). Maybe some details got piled on (I can't remember which book had the useless James Potter quidditch info. Half-blood?). I think it was the Ron thing, anyway. D'oh. It has to be that. Maybe it was like season three of Buffy when Buffy goes to L.A. in the first episode and they still cut back to Sunnydale to show how the Scooby gang are faring without her. The new factors of the war is out there situation was like cutting into the Scooby dynamic. It's painful to go your own way and be all alone. It was like reaching the end half way through. Harry has to grow up, he has to defeat Lord Voldything and leave Hogwarts. And that's a sad feeling 'cause it means that I also have to leave Hogwarts. The bitching had to be about change. It still worked, it just worked in a different way. Change isn't popular.There are faults in the series but I loved what I loved so much that I didn't care. I just want to be in Hogwarts. I could tease about what I didn't like and still loved what I loved. How to be a Harry Potter fan in the style of Mariel 101. I'm sure I'll be rewarded with my Hogwarts letter any day now.D'oh! Of course! S.P.E.W. I remember now. (Society for Promotion of Elvish Welfare for the non-nerds. Oh wait, those people will not be reading this.) All the dumbfucks argued that the house elves wanted to be enslaved and that the point of the series was that Hermione was representing America rushing in to save oppressed civilizations when they shouldn't have been involved. (Dudes, they were probably the ones they needed saving from.) Uggggggh. So children should have always slaved away in factories because that was their only wages? Because they saw the film Newsies and Christian Bale looked like he was having a lot of fun? Killing Mudbloods is bad (""Sure, I don't want to kill kids but wars in the middle east are still a great idea!"") but reading about equality for all is less interesting if it changes the bottom line? I probably started resenting the fanbase a whole lot right around that time. Rowling could have made the point less hammer-head like (via Hermione). The films succeeded in that quite well. But still! It is like being in the wizarding world itself to have read that kind of crap. Bigots everywhere. Poor Dobby! Sobs. (Winky was fucking annoying, though.)I also didn't mention the ""Harry is a Death Eater"" people. I wonder where they are right now. Probably in a dark corner of the internet somewhere, writing about the ""truth"" of the Harry Potter series. Grrrrrrrrrrrr. Harry is all that is good and pure in this world!P.s. I always skipped Quidditch scenes. The Triwizard scenes were kinda Quidditch-y to me. For that reason Goblet is my least favorite of the series. And I hated reading about Ron not liking Harry. But still! I remember when I got Goblet of Fire. I had to go to work and stop reading it. I didn't think about anything else but what was going to happen next in this book. Every other day was I numb with wanting to be anywhere else. That day I was happy to be in my own head.

102,2334851024,03/21/2018,5.0,"Throughout the years my opinion of different books in the Harry Potter series has changed, some that I loved when I first read them have gone down and others that I didn’t love just as much have gone up (all still 5 stars books but just preference order changes). However, throughout all of that Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire has always remained my favourite HP book. The introduction to this book is perhaps one of the most intriguing of the series. By the time we had read the first book the rest of the series open in a similar fashion, with characters that we know and situations that we are vaguely familiar with. Not GOF though! Rowling starts this chapter at the Riddle House and we get to know a little bit more about Voldemort and bit about his early life, just enough to keep me desperate to find out more. And I was hooked in yet again. The Quidditch World Cup is perhaps one of my favourite magical moments, next to Harry’s first visit to Diagon Alley. I also have a soft spot for the Wesley family and I love that we get to meet Bill and Charlie in this book for the World Cup, a wonderful little gem! There is something about the way that Rowling sets these chapters that made me feel the magic radiating off the page, from staying at the Burrow before the World Cup, to getting there and dealing with the muggle farmer to the actual match itself and aftermath. The subtle feminism that Rowling weaves in this book is perfection and I love that magical sports are not gendered, neither the Bulgarian or Irish teams were all male players which I know is the same in the Hogwarts teams but there is something about national teams not being gendered that seems more impactful. Leading on from the Quidditch World Cup, GOF is really the first time that we start to see the magical world as bigger than just England and Hogwarts. From the fact that there is a Quidditch World Cup to the other European magical schools, GOF really welcomes us into a world that is full of magic across the globe. The majority of this book revolves around the Triwizard tournament which allowed for plenty of adventure, fun and danger throughout the book. The tournament also gave us some of the wonderful moments of levity in the books, including Harry and Ron attempting to ask girls to go to the Yule Ball with them and having to take dance lessons. Don’t be fooled though, there is a feeling of darkness throughout this book. Really from this point on HP gets darker and darker in the best possible ways, I am always excited to turn the page and keep reading. And finally, I would be amiss if I did not mention the elephant in the room with GOF, Rita Skeeter. I love this character for the sheer amount that I hate her, I did think that there was no way that I could hate a non-Death Eater character more until she who must not be named comes in the fifth book. Hermione’s dealing with Skeeter in this book, along with her first foray in activism made me really fall in love with the character of Hermione. In GOF she really comes into her own and develops into a true feminist that is strong and a great role model for women and girls reading these books. I love a feminist author!

“If you want to know what a man's like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.” 
 The fourth Harry Potter book, and I have to say I’m once again blown away by this series. It is my first time reading it but I’ve seen the movies a few time, so that’s why I’ve been putting the books off for so long. This book was truly amazing; the world, the humor, the characters, the heartbreak, the challenges, the ending!! It was just astounding and I’m so glad there are three more books in this series!Warning: A lot of praising a head.Contains spoilers!When I started reading I was at the edge of my seat, this scene about the Riddle house, read from the muggles perspective was so thrilling. As a reader we know it’s Voldemort and I was almost screaming at Frank: “RUN! He’s dangerous!” But reading from his pov with his background. Urgh it sucked me right back in the story and the world. Also the switch between that story line and Harry’s was done magnificent. I actually expected that after such an epic start, the book would slow down a bit and get a tad boring. But nothing like that happened and I was so thrilled about this. And it was just soooo funny; the Weasley’s getting stuck in the fireplace, sticking so many stamps on the envelop it was entirely covered, Fred giving Dudley that candy, Bill and Charlie making tables fight each other, every scene with Pigwidgeon or Percy lashing out at someone or talking about mr Crouch (him calling Percy Wheatherby), the Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes. It was just all so hilarious!And can I just say, I know I’m not the only one, but I love the Weasley family so much! They are so relatable and funny and loving; the personalities clashed so much but they also can’t live without each other. I loved how much more inside we got about the family; Charlie and Bill also got a part in this book. I don’t think I’ve ever read about a family that I want to be part of so bad. They made this book so funny and caused such hilarious, ridiculous scenes that made me laugh my ass of. The scene at the table with the whole Weasley family, Harry and Hermione, is I think one of my favorite scenes of all time! Just the whole atmosphere, and the humor and love..The beginning of this book was so incredibly well done, it deserved 10 stars!_________________________________
 “It matters not what someone is born, but what they grow to be.” 
Then the Quidditch World Cup was also one of my favorite scenes in the whole HP series. Just the atmosphere that was created, made me feel part of it.  I would give almost anything to be part of that. The world building in was done so incredibly well, things like the tent, the Portkeys, the omnioculars, the Veela and still the whole concept of the Quidditch game is so brilliant and original. And besides that, this also caused super funny scenes of wizards trying to be as muggle as possible. The game was soooo exciting and you’re just rooting for Ireland but also for Krum. OMG what a pleasure reading. After the Quidditch match all Hell broke loose and my heart just skipped a beat. The way J.K. Rowling manages to get me panicked and lost in the chaos just shows how well of a writer she is. My heart just stopped when I was reading about the masked men air flowing the muggle family, goose bumps. I however didn’t really get why all the parents left the children in the super dark, creepy, vulnerable woods, alone? Even though you can help the ministry and get the bad guys, you’d still choose to protect your own kid wouldn’t you? Another thing that slightly bothered me was that Harry, Hermione and Ron are again put on in this situation that is extremely convenient. Like it doesn’t infuriate me but, it’s still, there are 100.000 wands to take, and then exactly Harry’s wand gets stolen, there are probably 10 square kilometers of woods and this person just happens to draw the sign right were the three of them stand.. I know, I know, it’s exciting for the story but it was just to convenient._________________________________Getting back to Hogwarts the plot kind off slowed but it never got boring; there was still so much world building and excitement happening. I love the side plots in this book. Hermione’s SPEWT organisation, the plot about the skrewts.. and the lessons overall just never tire me. And on top of that the announcement of The Triwizard Tournament and the arrival of the other schools. I loved the division between the schools and the way they arrived was once again so creative and renewing. I actually forgot the whole twist about Krum being a student at the Bulgarian school, super cool twist! I loved that ‘little’ old Hagrid liked Maxime, that Ron was so star-struck with Krum and the everyone trying to get around the age bounder (which caused once again hilarious scenes). _________________________________________Harry’s name coming out of the cup was however kind of a turnaround in this book. Not only does this book get much more mysterious and darker, it also grew a tad less fun and I found myself less enjoying it about 200 pages or so in. I mean it is still funny and there is still amazing world building and the tests are amazing and creative but I felt that some of the characters got really on my nerves.In the previous books in the HP series there are characters I hate to love (Malfoy, Filch, Snape) but in this book quite a few character’s behavior got on my nerve. I didn’t understand why Harry didn’t fight harder to talk Ron to sense that he didn’t do it (after the first party), I would have shook him awake trying to make my point, and Harry is like okay I’ve said it twice now not going to repeat it a third time, will I? I also despised Fleur in the beginning, she was really haughtily in the beginning towards Harry, but also Hogwarts as a whole, complaining about a-ny-thing! But also Ron… in some ways I like the mc fighting with his/her best friend I mean they’re human’s after all and humans have disagreements and fights. So in a series over a time span of 7 years, it is understandable that a mc is going to have a disagreement with his friend (so props to Rowling for realism). However I found this fight annoying to read. I get Ron’s kind of jealous about Harry and he did think that Harry put his name in so he was mad for not telling him that he did that. But as a reader we know Harry is speaking the truth so it was just frustrating that when the whole school despised him, Harry couldn’t even count on his best friend to believe him.. And then another character that grew on my nerves (and that I wanted to slap like a thousand times was) was Rita Seeker, I know, I know that is what she was created for. But I just couldn’t stand her, every scene she showed up in made me want to close this book. I can’t believe what lies she wrote about my favorite characters and how she twisted words or silences to her advantage (did really like her self writing quill though, very creative).I can’t believe how Rowling turned this around towards the end!! I was once again mind blown; Ron said sorry to Harry after a few weeks, Fleur actually wanted to stay in England and grew rather fond of Harry and Rita Seeker got what she deserved by Hermione. 
“Time will not slow down when something unpleasant lies ahead.” 
_________________________________So Harry gets chosen by the cup, and the only thing that I kept wondering was; so what that he got chosen (or bewitched) why does he have to compete? He won’t die if he didn’t face the dragon right? It wasn’t really backed up why exactly Harry was forced to be a part of it and why Dumbledore didn’t just say it’s against the rules  on about three different levels so we’re going to ignore the cup right now and proceed with the three first champions? I think that could have been a bit better explained or thought out.I was a little bit disappointed by the Dragon scene (first task) if I can admit it. I’ve seen the movie, and there the first task was just done epic! The dragon is on a chain but the Horntail is so strong it breaks and sets of in the air over the roof after Harry and they are skittering along it, Harry fighting for his life. But here Harry was never in any danger? After about 10 lapses of flying the Horntail took after Harry and he could easily grab the egg. The scene was just a bit too short and disappointed for this 600+ paged book.Another tiny disappointing scene for me was the Yule ball. I think Rowling could have done a tiny bit better at describing the scenery like for example the dresses, it was all a bit dull and underdeveloped. I also don’t really get this scene in overall comparison to the plot even though I still liked it.I did however LOVE the scene with Hermione and Victor (shipped them so hard there for a second). I really liked how Rowling put down the characters there and starts to make a foundation for future relationships. I also loved the scene where Hagrid showed Harry the dragons and I really admire Harry for telling Cedric (and I love even more that it payed of). I LOVED the scene with Dobby and Winky in the kitchen. I loved the Sirius letters and the concern for Harry he showed (how Harry finally has a family member). I loved the scene with Harry and Mertle in the bath with the egg. I loved the scene where Moody helps Harry when he is invisible on the stairs and is almost discovered by Snape and Filch. 
“Numbing the pain for a while will make it worse when you finally feel it.” 
 _________________________________The second task lived way more up to my expectations than the first did. How Rowling comes up with these crazy, original tasks is just mind blowing. This one is my favorite. I love how brave Harry is and how he was rewarded for being concerned about the other people in the water even though he took longer because he also saved Fleur her sister. I loved how Dobby helped him. I think that’s one of the strong points about HP it has so many good lessons and even though Harry is the chosen one I’m never annoyed with him for accomplishing such unbelievable things because he has help, he doesn’t do everything alone (despite what is revealed at the end of this book). One of the best things about the HP books is that when you know what the plot is about and your read the books again, there are so many hints that you can’t believe you’ve missed when you first read/watched it! I mean the basic history lesson from Sirius, Dumbledores pensieve, the trashcans, the fake Moody’s hip-flask, Snapes storage being broken into. And many many more! I just can’t believe I missed all that the first time around. I love when mrs Weasley and Bill showed up for Harry at the third task, that made me almost cry with happiness for Harry._________________________________The third task blew my mind. It was so tense and the creatures in the maze were super cool! (I loved how the Skrewts came into play here). I did wish it took a bit longer though, just like the first task, I would have loved more. But it was absolutely brilliant that the cup was a Portkey. It just blew my mind. And then this scene with Voldemort in the graveyard. It made me speechless, cry and scream. It was so well written!! This is just one of the best scenes I’ve read. Ever! It made all my little comments from before go away and made me want to give this book 100 stars! Cedric dying, Wormtails hand, Harry’s parents, the Death Eaters. I loved how it came together with the beginning of this book with the house and Frank’s story, how we got to know more about Voldemort as a child and about his family. Everything just clicked in this book (and about some of the things in the previous books). It was absolutely epic! I also really loved how Harry still beat Voldemort (and what happened with the wands was brilliant). How Cedric asked to take his body to his parents made me cry once more. 
 “Remember, if the time should come when you have to make a choice between what is right and what is easy, remember what happened to a boy who was good, and kind, and brave, because he strayed across the path of Lord Voldemort. Remember Cedric Diggory.” 
_________________________________But still after that scene ended and Harry took the Portkey back to Hogwarts the tension didn’t end. Mad Eye Moody appeared to be Crouch’s son who was taken away to Azkaban!!!!! It just made so much sense, how his mother sacrificed herself for her son and took his place, and he became his father’s prisoner. I can’t believe Mr. Crouch let her do that. How Crouch junior and Wormtail found Voldemort and brought him back and junior took Moody’s place as a teacher to ensure Harry won the cup and took the Portkey to the graveyard. Absolutely amazing (can’t say that enough now, can I).I’m still mad about Fudge’s reaction though, how can he ignore all these clues that Voldemort is back, I did really like how Dumbledore said exactly the right thing! And I loved it even more how the people came together in the last few pages. Dumbledore, Snape, madam Pomfkrey, McGonagol, all the Weasleys, Hermione, Ron. Oh and I loved how Harry gave Fred and George the price money to invest in the WWW._________________________________I just can’t believe how amazing this book was even after I’ve already seen the movie, and I can’t wait to read the fifth book (or re-read this one in the future). “We are only as strong as we are united, as weak as we are divided.”",30,0.9996,0.114,0.712,0.174,0.5639840659340656,POSITIVE,0.9999

“We must all face the choice between what is right and what is easy.”

Something I really enjoyed about The Goblet of Fire is the exploration of side characters. The plot of the Triwizard Cup left room for people besides Harry’s trio to play a prominent role in the story, which was lovely. I’m especially glad that my favourites--Sirius Black and Cedric Diggory--were looked at in more depth this book. All I can hope for is that there’ll be more of the wonderful Remus Lupin later in the series!On the contrary, The Goblet of Fire is more than seven hundred pages long. Considering the majority of the plot is taken up by the Triwizard Cup, it was unfortunate that the first tournament event didn’t even commence until nearly the halfway point of this massive novel. I’m almost certain JK Rowling could have given readers the same--if not a greater effect--with a book four hundred pages in length. For this reason I found much of this instalment a trudge, save for the last few chapters where most of the action took place.Being years late to the Harry Potter series, I’ve heard plenty from the fandom. A common theme I came across was that many were upset with the treatment of the Syltherin house, which after reading this book, I completely agree with.JK Rowling really began hammering the antagonist role onto Draco Malfoy in this one, as well as his friends and any other Slytherin members we’ve heard from. At first it seemed like plain fun, but Draco began to seem almost malicious in this book, which I really didn’t like. He deserves so much better.It’s as if Rowling stereotypes the Slytherin's simply because they share common personality traits. Being cunning and ambitious does not mean a child is bound to turn out evil, yet the way they’re written here begs otherwise.This being said, the last ten chapters certainly redeemed a lot that I didn’t like about The Goblet of Fire. I could really see the planning that went into this story, regardless of my previous opinions. The twists and revelations that could be drawn back to earlier points were great.

110,1253878907,04/13/2015,5.0,"I'm not going to try to review this book or add any new thoughts to the thousands of reviews that are already all over the web. I do have a few observations about this book though.5 starsThe first, and probably the most obvious, observation I have is that this is the first of the series that didn't start out with Harry struggling over the abuse he's taking at the Dursley's home. This one started out much darker, focusing on He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named and his initial attempts to regain his physical form.Second, while this is still a kids' book, the are some very strong, very dark undertones throughout the entire book. The storyline moved from the ""Scooby-Doo"" format to something along the lines of dark fantasy, which happened at about the 80% point of this book. I wouldn't go so far as to compare it to George R. R. Martin or Joe Abercrombie, but the underlying threat and potential violence is definitely there. The twists in this one are surprising, especially in finding out who falls on which side, both good and evil.Third, this is the first book of the series to end without concluding the main storyline. The first three were like a 70s sitcom, resolving some problem within the half-hour time frame of that week's episode. In this one, very little is resolved. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are headed home after their fourth year, exhausted from the climax of the Triwizard Tournament, but it's almost a cliffhanger, especially with Hagrid's comments about preparing, taking things as they come, and not worrying before hand.On to Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix!",30,0.0825,0.073,0.846,0.081,0.500477022977023,NEGATIVE,0.9938

115,236519274,11/17/2011,2.0,"Bullshit sportHoly crap Rowling, why are you constantly making your plot holes bigger instead of fixing them? Quidditch now makes even less sense during the world cup, the most important championship in the magic world. It’s not a school competition where you can ignore the unfairness; this is supposed to be treated properly. And yet we see the mascots of each team bribing the crowds with gold or seducing the referees for ignoring fair play. The professional players were as civilized as apes on heat and didn’t miss the chance to brawl with each other just for the heck of it. As for the actual duration of the match, the players were moving so fast, that the on-lookers needed magic devises to slow down the scenes. It makes no sense, since while they are watching the slow motion, they miss the live action, which is the whole point of being there. And considering how they needed weeks to prepare and disguise their looks to resemble normal people, going to all the trouble just to be in a match where they can’t even see the players moving, just so everything can end in less than an hour, is simply not worth it.  Misdirected fameHarry’s legend grows even further! Adding to his title of greatest hero for not doing anything and savior of all oppressed people for not doing anything, now he is also the champion of Hogwarts. Guess why. I bet you know it already… Because he didn’t do anything! Anything other than being Harry freaking Potter, the guy who has the writer in his pocket. God, how dreadful; he was just standing in a corner not doing anything and all of a sudden everyone is saying he will compete in the Magic Triathlon as the champion of his school. Without signing in as a contestant, or wanting to become one, or even having the proper age to even being allowed participation. It was like sending a 12 year old to the Olympics… by force! FatalismAnd of course the teachers didn’t mind at all how such an important law was broken and they went along with it. They just believed what a magic cup was telling them to do without even questioning the reasoning. Just like with the sorting hat, an object is once again determining their lives without giving them the option to decline. How is this not tyrannical? How are they supposed to be a democratic society with its own freelance news reporters and elected ministry when they let arbitrary objects to control their lives? How do characters even have free will? This is once again proving why magic becomes a cheap excuse to initiate conflict, before used again for undoing said conflict in an instant, thus making the whole thing fatalistic and illogical. Cheating is ok if you are the protagonistIt’s impossible for a kid to win if he is facing epic level athletes with decades of more experience than him. Unless of course you are Harry freaking Potter, the guy who wins without doing anything and cheats all the time. Each test is supposed to be kept secret until the last moment, and yet teachers and house elves constantly tip him on what to do and even give him magic gismos for easily passing each test. See that kids? If you want to win, all you have to do is cheat, like your favorite hero does. How educational!No defensesSecurity is even easier to break now, since more people keep escaping from that prison which nobody is supposed to be able to escape from. You would think they would have doubled the defenses since the last incident, but nah, they just made it easier now.Even if you do something extremely obvious, such as attacking people in the middle of the world cup, the place that is supposed to be super secure so normal people won’t notice anything, you can have all the fun you like and then just walk away, because nobody is going to stop you. By the time the magic police arrive, you will have teleported away. That’s right; you can teleport anywhere you want. Just don’t go asking what’s the point of having trains and flying cars and owls delivering messages, when you can just teleport anywhere you like in an instant.As for the all mighty magic police, rest assured that they will never find you, since they will be busy attacking with spells innocent people who were just standing there doing nothing. And now imagine which person they attacked first. Come on, make a wild guess… Yes, it was Harry. He didn’t do anything and yet he gets accused of using black magic that only someone with twice his years can perform. Yeah, the magic police are geniuses.Magic is panaceaBut worry not, as there is a spell that can fix everything. Eye witnesses? Amnesia spell! Something broke? Mending spell! You don’t have money? Trasmutate something into gold. Just don’t go asking why Ron’s family is poor when you can do anything you like with magic. One of the countless things you can do with magic, is brainwash someone to do anything you want. You know, like telling you the secret passwords to the most secure places in the world? What is the point of security when magic can undo anything in an instant? Or if you are Harry freaking Potter, you don’t even need to do that since you can guess the password to the archmages’ room in a few seconds, by mentioning random words. Anyone else would need years to crack a code, but Harry does it in seconds by accident. Totally not convenient.Another thing you can do with magic is transforming yourself into a different person. Rest assured that nobody is going to find out you are fake, even if they know the person you are impersonating for decades. There is even a spell that stupefies the target for a few minutes, although I don’t see a reason for having to use that, since everybody in the magic world is already retarded. I mean, they can’t even spot an impersonator despite knowing the real person their whole lives. Also they have alarms that point out when someone is using magic for hiding something. Remember when they were in the previous book and nobody paid attention to them so the conflict can conveniently keep going? And what about the time machine? I mean, they were spamming its use in the previous book just to be in more school sessions. Shouldn’t they use it now to prevent the great tragedy that happened in the end of the story for saving lives and preventing the return of the Lord of All Evil? Well, you can now forget them with an amnesia spell, since as if by magic, they no longer exist. If someone asks questions regarding that, throw a stupefy spell and teleport away. And yes, they did say they destroyed all the time machines, but then you have the Cursed Child book where they still exist… as if by magic! Get it? Magic!!! Cheap showdownThe final confrontation is once again disappointing, as it has to do with the bad guy spending 50 pages in explaining his plan to Harry, instead of, I don’t know, killing him right away? And once again we have a plot convenience saving his ass, as dead friends and family return from the afterlife for saving him with some reverse spell bullshit excuse. Yes, with magic. It’s almost like nothing can happen in these books without the convenience of the supernatural. And the funny part is that when Harry teleports away from there, another bad guy finds him and spends another 50 pages in explaining shit! And despite having to suffer through 100 pages of infodump, this evil master plan still makes no freaking sense. If their plan was for Harry to touch the cup so he can teleport in front of Voltemort, what was the point of helping him join the triathlon and win in every trial? They could have simply used the disguised bad guy to trick Harry into touching the cup at any given moment. Or they could have grabbed him and pushed him on the cup. Or even better, they could have simply teleported him themselves. And not even the second villain is defeated by Harry doing something. Once again he stood idle, as the teachers appeared out of nowhere and saved his ass. And check this out; they captured the bad guy and interrogated him. What kind of great detective work did they use? Combining hints and solving riddles? Questioning suspects? Using mind games to lure him into revealing things he normally wouldn’t? Nope, they just brainwashed him with a spell and he explained everything right away. Which begs the question, why didn’t they simply use brainwashing on everybody since the first book and be done with it? Why didn’t they use it in the trials after the war to find all the hidden allies of Voltemort? And don’t give me bullshit excuses about not wanting to bend free will. They just used it on this guy just because he was a baddie. And they believe everything hats and cups are telling them without ever questioning them! They never had free will to begin with, so why are they not spamming the crap out of the brainwashing magic? … Oh, right, so the conflict won’t have been resolved by the time the first book begins. And if you think that was the worst part, you are mistaken as now we get yet another 50 pages of monologue from the brainwashed baddie! That’s right, the finale is 150 pages of infodumps. Awful storytellingThis book is essentially 500 pages of filler, infodumping, plot convenience, and Harry cheating in everything. Retarded beyond belief. This series is complete trash in terms of storytelling. How many children’s critical thought did this woman author ruin with them? The fanboys keep telling me that I should focus on the characters instead of the plot holes, but that is impossible. No matter what happens to the characters can easily be undone with magic. It’s like you are asking me to feel sorry for a guy who has a toothache, in a setting with dentists. Why would you feel sorry for someone who is simply not treating an easily treatable problem? You will laugh at his stupidity, which is exactly what I did. So don’t you dare say I am nitpicking because I am certainly not. I treat these books as they treat my intelligence.

I can't help but wish I had written a review for each of these books as I read the series for the first time. Anyway, I digress...let's get into my review. Even though the rest of the series has some moments and undertones of darkness, I think this is the first book in the series where that darkness is elevated and a divide is created from the earlier books in the series. This book is the gateway to a story that becomes much more emotional and detailed (as the increasing page lengths reflect). I continue to be amazed by the level of detail in this series and that everything is so finely intertwined and connected seamlessly. I will say that I know many people who have watched the movies but have never read the books (*gasp*). For me, this book was the first instance where I felt a lot was left out from the movie (not necessarily in a bay way) due to the length of the novel. Some vague examples would be: S.P.E.W, Rita Skeeter's secret, and details of Barty Crouch Jr. If you love the movies but haven't read the book series, I highly recommend reading them. Especially as fans of the movie, you'll get an increased level of understanding and detail that the movies are unable to provide in a certain length of time. Again being vague, even after many rereads, I can't believe how emotional I felt with a specific scene. I don't know if it's because of the specific event itself or if it's because it paves the way for the direction of the following novels. Either way, in both novel and movie form, this scene always causes my emotions to take a hit.

Obviously this is because i am a die hard Harry Potter fan, so it would be quite impossible for me to dislike any of the novels. I did however enjoy Goblet of Fire more than the previous 3 novels. This is mainly because of the size of the book and how much more detail there is. There's a good mixture of suspense, drama, adventure, and emotion in Goblet of Fire. I kind of wish i hadn't seen all the movies prior to reading the books since it spoils many parts of the story. There's still so much more detail in the books that obviously can't be put into the films due to timing, so i still get to enjoy the books tremendously. It's still great getting a more detailed view of the magical world and its many characters. I think the Triwizard Tournament chapters were my favorite, they were fun to read and interesting to see how the contestants would react to certain circumstances. To be exact, my favorite one was the second task which took place in the Black Lake. The Yule Ball was also interesting and a bit chaotic.. Hagrid, Maxime, Hermione, and Ron entertained me so much during the Yule Ball chapter. I also enjoyed getting to know the backstory of Hagrid's past! You feel sympathy towards him as you are reading about him. I learned so much about his origin and how he is perceived by other people. The house elves contributed a decent amount to the novel, i enjoyed reading about them and Winky was funny to me but also frustrated me a bit. House elves are strange little creatures... I also found the reporter Rita Skeeter to be quite annoying and irritating, i am pretty sure that was one of Rowling's objectives when she was developing the character, so she excelled at that. There's just so much i enjoyed in this novel. I won't go into more detail since i don't want this review to end up being eternal and to have spoilers.

“If you want to know what a man's like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.”
This book and all its glory.. I loved this. It was simply extraordinary and unlike any other Harry Potter novel. This was considerably more mature than any of its predecessors. I loved the size of it. It was a book I couldn't get enough of even though it's actual the biggest so far and the most detailed one. Mrs. Rowling never ceases to amaze me.I loved how in each and every book we see how Harry's changing to become the amazing grown-up man he is meant to be. Ron & Hermione & Harry. Our unbeatable trio. They are growing up so fast and it is amazing to read about them and how they overcome everything together. This one was mostly Harry working by himself because it wasn't allowed for him to have any help while participating in the Triwizard Tournament. 
“We are only as strong as we are united, as weak as we are divided.”
This marks the beginning of darker times ahead.. This was suprisingly darker and more morbid than any other book. Like Mrs. Rowling had said when this book came out: ""Book Four's a very very VERY important book. Something very important happens in Book Four. But also, it's literally a central book. It's almost the heart of the series, and it's pivotal.""In this book we see Voldemort for the first time. The first time in his physical form. It's all amazing to read. How he is involved with the Triwizard Tournament and how it all becomes a big mess. There is death and there is suspense, tons of it. There is a kinds-of prom. There is falling in love, and jealousy, for the first time in the Harry Potter series. And it's so breath-taking reading about our favorite characters falling in love, getting their feelings hurts, and tasting rejection for the first time ever.If you've loved the previous books then you're bound to love this one just as much and maybe a little more.

137,346832659,06/11/2012,5.0,"4.5 StarsRe-read: May-June, 2021When I first read this series, I would have held The Goblet of Fire high in my personal series ranking. However, now that I’m a little older, and a little more well-read, I find many aspects of this story repetitive and superfluous, with the action not really getting under way until almost halfway into the book. Slow isn’t bad, either is detailed, but a lot of what happens in the first half, like with the overly long time we spend at the World Cup, just doesn’t engage me now like it once did.When it come to the characters, this fourth instalment is where they grow the most, but also when they reveal parts of themselves that I found myself greatly frustrated with now that I’m older. Ron, in particular, and the entire plot surrounding many characters disbelief that Harry himself didn’t enter into the Triwizard championships willingly, was grating on my last nerve this time around. I wanted to shake Ron—which I’m sure is the normal reaction—but this time around I found myself wishing he was never forgiven for his bullshit behavior. It’s the kind of thing that may well cloud all future enjoyment of that character for me personally.The Triwizard Cup itself, and all the exciting challenges the chosen champions are faced, remains as fantastical and exhilarating as ever. The challenge scenes alone are some of the best, most thrilling scenes in the entire series for me, and I do enjoy the lead up to each with how the competitors would share information among themselves for support.With an ending that still manages to bring me to uncontrollable tears, some twenty years on, I guess I must still concede that this (like all of them, really) is a great addition to the series at large, culminating in the epic return of Lord Voldy himself. This is the moment the tides begin to truly change in the series, everything becomes bigger, more exciting, and way more high-stakes than ever before.",26,0.9948,0.075,0.729,0.196,0.480661976911977,NEGATIVE,0.8732

143,2028508985,06/13/2017,5.0," Re-Read November 2019   Re-read 07/29/2018:  Every time I read these books, I feel nostalgic. I cannot express how grateful I am to JK Rowling for creating this rich and enchanting story. This is a piece of my childhood that will always stick with me; it helped me become the person I am today. I continue to cherish these characters - especially Hermione, who reminds me so much of myself. Hogwarts will always be like a second home to so many of us. I know I will revisit these stories as I grow older. I look forward to passing them onto my kids someday.  Previous Review  ""Lord Voldemort's gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great. We can fight it only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust. Differences of habit and language are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are open."" Given the state of our world, the quote above resonated with me. Although unity is a simple message, Dumbledore conveys it eloquently. I finished Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire by listening to the audiobook and it was magnificent! Re-reading this book as an adult is such a nostalgic experience. Language fails to describe the intense reading slump this book sent me into as a child. I stopped reading books because nothing would ever compare to the Harry Potter series. Obviously, I've matured and I know there are lots of other amazing books out there. I remember seeing an interview with JK Rowling where she was talking about her writing process. She was sitting in this room with scattered boxes of notebooks and papers. To the untrained eye, it probably looked like a mess, but she revealed the boxes contained years of work. It was so detailed - there was even a chart that contained the blood status of every student at Hogwarts. In my perspective, the extensive planning that went into creating this series is what makes it such an  immersive and compelling book.  This is the book that transitions the Harry Potter series from elementary/middle-grade to young adult. This book is a lot darker than I remember (I mean, we witness a murder within the first 50 pages). That's the cool thing about re-reading childhood books - you pick up on subtle details you might have ignored. The story also deals with more mature subject matter because I think Rowling made it an effort to age the books with the characters. Despite being Wizards and Witches, the characters still have to deal with the same problems Muggle teenagers do - fluctuating hormones, insecurities and confusion about romance. This was a fantastic read and I kept turning the pages for several reasons, but be forewarned, this review contains spoilers! 1) I'm so grateful children have role models like Hermione Granger to look up to. Hermione doesn't succumb to teenage pettiness and is a total badass in this book. She acts as a progressive, intelligent and compassionate voice throughout the story. On top of a rigorous 4th year course load, she independently starts S.P.E.W. and campaigns for house elf rights. Despite the majority of people disagreeing with her viewpoints, Hermione remains brave and stands up for what she believes in. I also admire the confidence and maturity Hermione carries herself with in this book. She's attacked for her blood purity and physical appearance, but she remains steadfast. Hermione doesn't even waver after being publicly shamed by a huge magazine reporter. I love that Hermione is comfortable with who she is because healthy self-esteem is such a rare thing nowadays. Reading about her character makes me more comfortable with who I am as a person. 2) Ron's struggle with feeling ""average"" is one I think a lot of people can relate to.I really felt for Ron in this book because he's dealing with a lot of insecurities. He feels overshadowed by his older brothers because they appear more funny, witty and athletic than him. His jealousy of Harry's fame and fortunate even causes a rift in their friendship. But I think Ron is going through something a lot of teens and young adults do. His insecurities are preventing him from seeing his own admirable qualities. Ron has a great sense of humor and brings so much light to the story. He's also brave and doesn't believe in the whole blood purity rubbish. I found myself experiencing these same insecurities when I came to university. It felt like I just wasn't good enough and to be honest, I still struggle with feelings of inadequacy. But over time, I've learned to embrace my own unique journey for what it's worth. 3) Dealing with the injustice of the world In the Harry Potter series, there's a lot of injustice that exists just like it does in the Muggle world. Harry's character is manipulated by the media and thus, his words about Voldemort's return aren't taken seriously. Fudge cares more about protecting his reputation as the Minister for Magic than listening to Dumbledore's requests with an open mind. Cedric Diggory is murdered (a death I dreaded reading about) for simply being at the wrong place at the wrong time. Both Voldemort and Bartemius Crouch Junior are born to fathers who don't care for their wellbeing. That's the thing about the Harry Potter series - nothing is just black and white because there's a spectrum. Reading this as a child made me realize that the world and its issues are complicated. People are complicated. 4) There's wizards outside of England?! I found it fascinating reading about international wizarding communities and schools. It's a beautiful thing that everyone is able to connect during the Qudditch World Cup over sports! 5) Romance! When I was a child, I loved reading about the Yule Ball. It made me giggle to see the awkwardness Harry and Ron experienced trying to get dates (bare in mind I was like 11). It was nice to see the characters as being normal and going though things I experienced as a teenager. 6) Coping with grief Death has been mentioned prior to this book; however, seeing Cedric Diggory be murdered was especially painful not only for Harry, but fans everywhere. Diggory was a character who embodied the characteristics of Hufflepuff - kind, tolerant and fair. It was disturbing to see such a young person be taken away from the story in an instance. This was my third time re-reading this book and I knew Cedric Diggory would die, but I was dreading it. I'm not even sure if there is any point in writing this review! I mean, most people have read the Harry Potter series. I guess I write these more for me than others, but I honestly can't recommend this book series enough. The last 4 books start getting complicated and the issues the characters deal with become more intense. I highly recommend the Goblet of Fire to those who haven't read it before (or those who are debating re-reading it)!",22,0.9895,0.123,0.723,0.154,0.5832169312169311,POSITIVE,0.9998

Not to mention I love the tasks and meeting other wizards from other countries! Once again, here are little tidbits about the book and some things I noticed differing from the movie.-I think it would have been important for the movie to tell us that the house at the beginning is the Riddle house. -I am noticing this as a trend in every book.. in the book it's Harry's idea to write to Sirius about his scar hurting and yet in the movie it's Hermione's idea. It makes it look like Harry is too dumb to figure it out and that Hermione is the one that has to think for them all. It undermines Harry and Ron and I don't really see why they continuously do this every movie.-I love that JK developed the Dursley's as characters so well when they are not really central to the story at all.-Watching the Weasley's with the muggle world is always hilarious. The entire scene when they pick up Harry is hilarious. I'm upset it's not in the movie because it's the best scene.-I love that Harry taunts the Dursley's with Sirius to get them to be nicer to him.-I wish they included Bill and Charlie in the movies. We never get to meet Charlie and Bill is only a small figure in the last 2 movies. It was fun meeting them at the triwizard tournament. And of course more Percy which the movie has too little of anyways.-I love Pidwidgeon so much and I am sad he wasn't in the movie. -The movies don't ever explain what apparating is or how/when they learn it. Not to mention that they never explain splinching, even when it happens to Ron.-Since a random old boot is their portkey, I'll always wonder if trash on the street is a portkey. -They always ask Harry for muggle help even though Hermione is also a muggle? Why not also ask Hermione?-Super curious if Dean and Seamus were ever really gay.-I LOVE that Barty Crouch calls Percy Weatherby.-I don't get it in the movie where Draco has to comment how poor the seats are and how they have seats in the ministers box when the teams come out of their seat. And lets not forget in the book that they are all in the SAME box.-Winky though <3 precious-Veela are hilarious. I would have liked to see them, and even a LITTLE bit of the world cup stuff in the movie.-The entire dark mark death eaters scene was horribly done.-S.P.E.W - I will forgive Hermione for this. It was one of the most irritating things to read. She had sincere intentions but was really annoying with it after a while. Everyone (including the house elves) TOLD her that they don't want to be paid.-Hedwig's sass is my favourite.-The Goblet of Fire/Tournament stuff is all out of order in the movie.-I hate that classes become so unimportant in the movies starting now. Classes are the best part sometimes!-Why are the Pavil twins in the same house in the movie? And also they aren't identical in the movie but they are in the book?-Why is Beauxbatons an all girl school? Is it so hard to imagine that the cup picked a girl? Or is it only possible that a girl would be picked if there was no other choice. Clearly ridiculous. And why is Durmstrang an all boy school though.-Everyone's most hated thing: HARRY DID YOU PUT YOU NAME IN THE GOBLET OF FIRE?!?!?! ""said Dumbledore calmly"" yeah real calm movie.-Why was Harry so stressed in the book about the summoning spell for his broom? Worrying that it might not make it all the way? Like get Hermione to hide your broom somewhere near by so you know it'll be quicker.-The entire first task scene was horrible in the movie? The rooftop showdown? wtf?-There was also no point system..-I wonder why the Yule ball was only open to fourth years and above? Would it have only been 6/7 years if Harry wasn't in it?-So umm everyone wants to go to the ball with Harry in the book and no one does in the movie?-Hermione's PERIWINKLE BLUE dress. I wish we saw that.-The best thing though is Herm-Own-Ninny-Maxine + Hagrid fighting over being a giant would have been fun in the movie.-which makes me wonder how Hagrid's mom had sex with his dad like I am really curious about this.-The movie entirely cut out Ludo Bagman like he was not important at all. -I prefer book Dumbledore to movie Dumbledore. Movie Dumbledore is kind of an ass.-Does Harry ever get his Mauraders Map back from Moody?-Also why is Hermione Krum's closest person? That's weird.-Dobby is so precious I'm sad they cut him out of the movies.-Krum talking to Harry about his flying would have been fun.-Krum says ""your ministry..."" does that mean that each country has their own? -What do Ron and Hermione end up doing as jobs when they graduate (im sure this will be answered to me eventually...)-I love that in the end Mrs. Weasley got Hermione and Harry as children too. You can tell that she wanted Ron and Hermione together all along though because she gets mad at Hermione for ""dating"" Harry.-If they know Lucius Malfoy is a death eater why do they continue to let Draco come back to Hogwarts?-The Graveyard scene was actually well done in the movie surprisingly.-Clearly the Potter gene is really strong since his mom and his wife have red hair and his children still have dark hair.-I don't see why they cut out the Winky/Crouch story at the end, it's really quite important the the events of the movie.-They basically cut out Sirius from the movie and that pisses me off he's so prominent in the movie, the end especially.-Also why does Harry never cry. That seems a little unrealistic to me tbh.-The movies just never say what happens to Crouch JR? -I like that they set up the Order a bit at the end, even though the reader doesn't really know about it yet.-I liked reading that Dumbledore makes Harry go back to the Dursley's ever summer and I liked knowing that Mrs. Weasley at least invites him for Christmas and Summer. -I am sad the movie cut out so much Krum he seems like a stupid dumbbell in the movies but he's really actually great in the movies. Plus I liked his and Hermione's romance.-I just wish more than anything we see Harry giving Fred and George the money from his winning because that explains their storyline so much but nope movie just makes it look like Fred and George have always been rich.Time for book 5. Not my favourite at all but still looking forward to it!",22,0.9982,0.098,0.743,0.159,0.5906090723751275,NEGATIVE,0.6879
145,1825363931,11/19/2017,4.0,"This review is also featured HERE on my blog.Whoa… what an intense book! I’m still so shocked by all the revelations that occur throughout this story and the big reveal at the end is just so mind-boggling, i had to take a couple days just to process it all. So was this a good instalment? Yes, hell yes! Such a good book, although, longer than the others i feel like every single page was worth it and was needed for the progression of the story. So good!J.K Rowling has once again delivered a writing masterpiece. This story was action packed from the first chapter and didn’t let up once through the whole book. It had the suspense right on point to make you continue reading in anticipation of whats to come. The prose flowed smoothly and it honestly felt like you were really there with harry through all his trials and stipulations. One of my favourite authours in the way she knows how to keep you engaged. I fell like as a writer that is what everyone strives for and J.K Rowling has it.The actual storyline still follows the course of school at Hogwarts that we are accustomed to but it has an unexpected and ensnaring twist that kept me guessing all the way through. I really enjoyed the new aspects to this wizarding world and the dark atmosphere present. This is the first book that i can see actually being more of a YA than a middle-grade novel. Due to the fact that there are more heavy topics and a sense of maturity over the main characters.Speaking of characters, everyone we love is here again as well as some old characters that are brought back that we may have not seen in the previous book. Many new characters are introduced too and it is a diverse group of newcomers. We have people from different parts of the world, the ministry of magic (government) and the daily prophet. I kind of like this because instead of the wizarding world being confined to Hogwarts like it was in the last three instalments, we get a broader understanding of it, and realise that magic is everywhere.Harry is also older now in body and in mind, which becomes quite apparent as the story progresses. You don’t feel like he is merely 14; he has been through too much and has a greater sense of maturity that i think makes it easier to connect with him even at my age of 20. He still has his childish moments, and you can sense that bit of naivety in him but there is definitely a jump from the last book.You also receive a hell of a lot of information from the wizarding world, to character relationships, and the dark past. Be prepared to have your mind blown wide open with all that is revealed. I honestly couldn’t handle all the information that was pouring out of the last 4-5 chapters of the book. So much to take in and i had to take some time to process it all.All in all, this was really a fantastic book and as it was my first time reading it so what an enjoyment for me. I also found that this is the first book that really differs from the movies. I think that it was probably too long to fit everything in so they just focused on the main plot events, but there was so much going on in the background. If you have watched the films but never read the books, then i am telling you to get on the books. So much is missed in the films and its honestly an amazing read.",22,0.9972,0.026,0.832,0.142,0.4368801652892559,POSITIVE,0.9999
146,2550107048,10/21/2018,5.0,"Goblet of Fire begins with Harry having a dreadful vision of Voldemort conspiring with Wormtail about his destined resurrection to power. He wakes with his scar burning more than ever, reminding him that danger is growing closer and closer. He joins Hermione and the Weasley's at the Quidditch World Cup to take his mind off the constant burning of his scar, only for things to go horribly wrong. When the sign of the dark mark is seen at the event, the imminent return of Voldemort is made known to all. On top of this, Professor Dumbledore announces the return of the Triwizard Tournament, an ancient tradition that allows wizarding schools from all around the world to bond and compete in friendly competition. Things get even worse at Hogwarts when Harry's name is mysteriously drawn from the Goblet of Fire, forcing him to compete in many dangerous competitions against foreign wizarding schools against his will. All while dealing with the pressures of puberty, trying to discover who snuck his name in the Goblet of Fire and the looming threat of Voldemort, Harry faces his most challenging year at Hogwarts yet.The first three books are fun and witty adventure stories with touches of emotional triumph, moral dilemmas and subtle creepiness, but this one completely blows everything that came before it out of the water. The characters are growing and learning about love, religion, slavery, genocide, prejudice, racism and the darker side of the wizarding world. People are starting to die and scandalous truths are being revealed. Traitors as far as the eye can see, double agents hunting down innocent wizards and muggles, Voldemort coming back in full force. The stakes are higher than ever before.So many crazy things happened in this book that completely changed the tone and intensity of the series. The jolly days of childhood are over and the horrors of the world are slowly coming into view. The trials of the Goblet of Fire were exciting and much more interesting than the typical quidditch competitions. The introduction of several other wizarding schools into the story expanded the horizons of the main characters and opened the world to more intriguing possibilities. I’ve learned to appreciate and sympathize with Harry a lot more as he was incredibly brave and noble this time around. His final scene at the end of the book involving a certain act of kindness to Ron’s siblings really solidified the respect I have for him. I also enjoyed his friendship with Cedric.One thing that did annoy me a bit was the mistreatment of Hermione. I always thought she was a much better friend to Harry than Ron, yet both of the boys always seem to take her for granted and never give her the respect she deserves. Even when Harry and Ron have a big falling out over something very childish, Hermione instantly swoops in to support Harry and tries to mend their friendship. And right after the drama between the boys is settled, they go right back to treating Hermione as a third wheel. She deserves better imo.(Hagrid is still the GOAT, his relationship with Madam Maxine made for many entertaining scenes that also introduced some interesting lore regarding the history of giants.)",22,0.9908,0.107,0.726,0.166,0.5273189484126983,POSITIVE,0.9943
147,2819537740,05/13/2019,3.0,"No one needs another review of Harry Potter. Yet, here is another one because I don’t want to forget my thoughts on this series. But if you wanted to know my thoughts I can summarise them in one sentence: I am still underwhelmed.It’s been two years since I read the first three books as I am writing this review, and you can check out my reviews for those here… Book 1, Book 2 and Book 3. But my main problem with this series is that I am bored throughout reading, and it doesn’t excite me any way. I actually looked at the physical book and it looked like too many pages of unfun reading to me so I had to listen to the audiobook instead >.> But let me explain myself properly…This book is incredibly slow paced! Nothing much happens until the very very end of the book, and we can more or less guess what is going to happen. I know this is actually children’s fiction, but that doesn’t quite excuse it to me. I know children’s literature books which are much more exciting than this one, but it failed to thrill me in any way.I am still not feeling any deep connection to the characters. I don’t really care about them. I will admit that Hermoine’s character has improved in this one because she was a lot less annoying than in the previous books. Ron managed to make me laugh sometimes because his speech is just pure Britishness through and through. Sometimes it’s kind of fun to see your own culture and country coming through in a novel. I need to read more British based books by British authors, evidently. But I really don’t care about most of the characters.In fact, I often found myself impatient with the characters? I know they were fighting and so on, but I knew how it would be solved and I wanted them to get on with it so we could get to the next part. Or when small predictable events happened, I wanted them to move on with the action already and get to it! I’m not sure if it’s because I am reading children’s literature as someone who is clearly older, or if it is because it was too slow paced or predictable. But yeah, that’s how I felt.But I’m giving this book three stars because J.K. Rowling’s world building is off the charts wonderful! She has such a vast brain, and she manages to hold it all in there and also make us believe in the world. What I love especially is that she gives us world building which isn’t necessary to move the plot forward. It’s just some cool things from the world that the children are using or messing around with. It’s brilliant and if I was judging this book on world building alone, she would have all the stars.Also, the audiobook itself is fantastic. Stephen Fry read this so well! It made the book actually bearable and I got through it beginning to end. I enjoyed listening to this book way more than reading the first three. I don’t even think I would’ve made it through this one without Fry reading it to me. So, if you haven’t tried reading this series by audiobook yet, that’s definitely how you should do your next re-read 😉Will I continue with the series? Maybe. We shall see.This review and others can be found on Olivia's Catastrophe: https://oliviascatastrophe.com/2019/0...",22,0.9965,0.052,0.802,0.147,0.463247006404901,NEGATIVE,1.0
