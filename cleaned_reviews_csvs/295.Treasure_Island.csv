0,1656845653,06/02/2016,4.0,"3 items worthy of note in Robert Louis Stevenson's classic treasure ""Treasure Island"":1) There are a ton of tropes! We understand that this is pretty much what Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean ripped off, making tons of money off of this adventurous classic, including but not limited to: rampant alcoholism; a code of honor; castaways (at sea or in land); shipwrecks (new and ancient); treason (group & individual) & double crosses; mutiny, hostages, captures and shocking escapes; strangers appearing from the mist & pirate flags; raresome slapstick comedy (""...[he] fell from his whole height face foremost to the floor."" [16]) & good comedic timing (the parrot tells everybody The Secret, ruining plans); a compass made up entirely of human bones; & ghosts.2)Jim Hawkins is your typical YA protagonist prototype. He's the go-between the two fighting groups, the one who bargains with the villain Long John Silver (mmm.... breaded fish and shrimp...yumm) and propels the narrative forward. He's the center; a dreamer; while he loses his humility he attains a coming-of-age wisdom that peaks at the point where he brandishes a pistol for the first time.3)The plot resembles a Hollywood blockbuster. There is very little inaction, but when it occurs (such as the villain's cliched soliloquy or the factions grunting against their enemies) it does decelerate the pace of the story. Here is a very substantial urge to make everything explosive & loud. Thank you, Mr. Stevenson!",254,0.957,0.088,0.746,0.166,0.454752886002886,POSITIVE,0.9991
1,98085756,04/11/2010,5.0,"Treasure Island, Robert Louis StevensonTreasure Island is an adventure novel by Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson, narrating a tale of ""buccaneers and buried gold"". Its influence is enormous on popular perceptions of pirates, including such elements as treasure maps marked with an ""X"", schooners, the Black Spot, tropical islands, and one-legged seamen bearing parrots on their shoulders.An old sailor named Billy Bones comes to lodge in the rural Admiral Benbow Inn on the West English coast. He tells the innkeeper's son, Jim Hawkins, to keep a lookout for ""a one-legged seafaring man."" A former shipmate, Black Dog, confronts Bones and engages in a violent fight with him. After Black Dog is run off, a blind beggar named Pew visits to give Bones ""the black spot"" as a summons to share a map leading to buried treasure. Shortly thereafter, Bones suffers a stroke and dies. Pew and his accomplices attack the inn, but Jim and his mother save themselves while taking Bones's sea chest. Inside the chest, they find a map of an island on which the infamous pirate Captain Flint hid his treasure. Jim shows the map to the local physician Dr. Livesey and the district squire John Trelawney, and they decide to make an expedition to the island, with Jim serving as a cabin boy. They set sail on Trelawney's schooner, the Hispaniola, under Captain Smollett. Much of the crew, as it is later revealed, are pirates who served under Captain Flint, most notable of which is the ship's one-legged chef ""Long John"" Silver. Jim, sitting in an apple casket, overhears the conspirators' plan to mutiny after the salvage of the treasure and to assassinate the skippers. ...تاریخ نخستین خوانش: یکی از روزهای سال 1973میلادیعنوان: جزیره گنج؛ نویسنده: رابرت لوئیس (لوئیز) استیونسون (استیونسن)؛ مترجم: هاجر تربیت؛ تهران، بنگاه ترجمه، چاپ دوم 1343، در 278ص؛ مترجم: اردشیر نیکپور؛ تهران، گوتنبرگ، چاپ دوم 1351، در 364ص؛ موضوع: داستان کودکان از نویسندگان اسکاتلند - سده 19ممترجمهای دیگر، خانمها و آقایان: «حسین دستوم»؛ «یوسف فرخ»؛ «عباس کرمی فر»؛ «پرویز نجم الدینی»؛ «محسن سلیمانی»؛ «امیرمهدی مراد حاصل»؛ «صفورا کلهر»؛ «احمد کسایی پور»؛ «سپهر شهلایی»؛ «علی اکبری»؛ «علیرضا نعمتی»؛ «محمدرضا جعفری»؛ «نعیمه ظاهری»؛ «آرمین هدایتی»؛ «مهسا طاهریان»؛ «مهسا یزدانی»؛ «محمد قصاع»؛ «امین دادور»؛ «سهیل رمضانی»؛ «محمد همت خواه»؛ «ناهید حاجی سلیمانی»؛ «شهلا طهماسبی»؛ «بیتا ابراهیمی»؛ «سوده کریمی»؛ و ...؛داستانی ماجراجویانه، که «رابرت لویی (لوئیز یا لوئیس) استیونسُن» نویسنده «اسکاتلندی» نوشته است؛ این رمان نخستین بار در سال 1883میلادی به صورت کتاب به چاپ رسید، و موضوع آن درباره ی دزدان دریایی، و گنجی مدفون، در یک جزیره است؛ «جزیره ی گنج» هماره در زمره ی ادبیات کودک و نوجوان، بوده است، و منتقدان آن را به خاطر توصیف استادانه ی نویسنده، از: «شخصیت‌ها»، «رویدادها»، و «فضای داستان»، بسیار ستوده‌ اند؛ بارها به روی صحنه ی تئاترها، و پرده ی سینماها رفته، و از محبوبیت ویژه ای، نزد نوجوانان، برخوردار استرابرت لویی استیونسن، تنها فرزند «توماس استیونسن» یکی ازبهترین مهندسان شهر بود؛ او که از کودکی ضعیف و مریض احوال بود، پس از سفر به کشورهای گوناگون، سالهای پایانی زندگی را، در سرزمین دلخواهش «سامو» گذراند؛ مردمان بومی، ایشان را «قصه گوی قصه ها» نامیدند؛ دریانوردی پیر، در مسافرخانه‌ ای میمیرد، و «جیم» در صندوقچه‌ ی او، نقشه ی گنجی را مییابد؛ او و دوستانش، به جزیره‌ ای دور سفر میکنند، اما دزدان دریایی خطرناکی نیز به دنبال همان گنج هستندنقل از آغاز متن: (مسافرخانه ی «آدمیرال بِن بو»: از من خواسته اند که هرچه درباره ی جزیره ی گنج میدانم، از اول تا آخر بنویسم؛ برای همین هم چیزی را از قلم نمیاندازم؛ ماجرای من، موقعی شروع شد که پدرم هنوز مسافرخانه ی «آدمیرال بِن بو» را اداره میکرد و این همان موقعی بود که دریانوردی پیر، برای اولین بار به مسافرخانه ی ما آمد؛ خوب به یاد دارم، انگار همین دیروز بود؛ او جلوی در مسافرخانه آمد؛ پشت سرش، یک گاری دستی بود که روی آن صندوقچه ای قرار داشت؛ مرد تازه وارد، قوی و بدقواره بود و کت ملوانی آبی رنگ و کثیفی به تن داشت؛ روی دستانش علامت زخمی دیده میشد و ناخنهایش سیاه و شکسته بود؛ روی صورتش هم علامت زخم شمشیر بوداو به خلیج کوچک جلوی مسافرخانه نگاه میکرد و برای خودش سوت میزد؛ پس از مدتی، ناگهان شروع به خواندن یکی از آوازهای قدیمی ملوانها کرد: پانزده مرد، روی سینه ی یک مرده؛ یوهوهو، هوهوهودریانورد پیر، پس از اینکه از پدرم یک نوشیدنی گرفت، گفت: «جای جالبی است؛ آدمهای زیادی اینجا می آیند؟»؛پدرم گفت: «نه متاسفانه.»؛مرد گفت: «پس جای من این جاست.»؛ بعد، خدمتکاری را که گاری دستی را آورده بود، صدا زد و گفت: «صندوق را بیاور تو!» و به پدرم گفت: «من آدمی ساده ام؛ از شما هم فقط نوشیدنی، ژامبون و تخم مرغ میخواهم.»؛بعد چند سکه ی طلا روی میز انداخت و گفت: «هر وقت تمام شد، بگویید! در ضمن میتوانید مرا ناخدا صدا بزنید.»؛ناخدا مرد ساکتی بود.؛ تمام روز را با دوربین برنجی اش، در اطراف خلیج یا روی صخره ها پرسه میزد؛ شبها نیز در گوشه ای از سالن مینشست و مینوشید؛ او، اغلب از ما میپرسید: «در جاده، دریانوردی ندیدید؟»؛ اوایل فکر میکردیم که او دوست دارد با دریانوردها هم صحبت شود؛ اما وقتی دریانوردی سر راهش به بریستِل به مسافرخانه ی ما میآمد، ناخدا قبل از ورود به سالن پذیرایی، ابتدا از پشت پرده های در، با دقت به او نگاه میکرد و آنگاه وارد میشد و مثل همیشه، ساکت در گوشه ای مینشست.؛ روزی، ناخدا مرا به کناری کشید و گفت: «جیم! اگر همیشه مواظب باشی و هر وقت ملوانی یک پا دیدی، فوری به من بگویی، هر ماه یک سکه ی نقره ی چهار پنی به تو میدهم.»؛ آن روز، فکر یافتن دریانورد یک پا، خوابهای مرا آشفته کرد؛ با اینحال، بیش از آن که از دریانورد یک پا بترسم، از خود ناخدا میترسیدم، زیرا بعضی از شبها که سرش گرم میشد، همه را ساکت و مجبور میکرد که به داستانهای ترسناکش گوش کنند و آوازهای قدیمی ملوانها را با او بخوانند.)؛ پایان نقلتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 27/09/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 05/07/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی",224,0.8827,0.014,0.959,0.027,0.4624999999999999,POSITIVE,0.9518

Nevertheless, my daughter appreciated it, probably it's a novel that best suits the tastes of children and young people. In fact, Stevenson has never hidden that the inspiration to the novel came frome his adopted son, Lloyd, with whom in a rainy afternoon drew an island for fun, fantasizing with him on the places about the places map and on future characters. The novel that was taking shape for the 12-year-olds boy's amusement changed in a really fun adventure.

D'altronde Stevenson non ha mai nascosto che l'ispirazione per il romanzo gliela ha data il figlio adottivo Lloyd, con il quale in un pomeriggio di pioggia disegnò per gioco un'isola, fantasticando assieme a lui sui luoghi della mappa e sui futuri personaggi.

3,3677170986,12/25/2020,3.0,"Arr, me matey!I've finally downed the children's classic, Treasure Island.Sadly, these pirates weren't nearly as sexy as I was expecting. Where were all the sweaty pirate abs I've come to expect from the plethora of trashy romance novels I've gobbled down over the years?Not here, that's for damn sure. And mainly because of the overabundance of bodice rippers on my bookshelf, I felt like I maybe needed to expand my maritime horizons, and it seemed that going with a classic sailor story wouldn't be a bad way to accomplish that goal.Unsurprisingly, this is a pretty boring book by today's standards. And if this was what they gave kids to read back in the day, I'm no longer shocked that people found long walks and/or journaling about said long walks a valid form of entertainment.  When I'm done churning this butter, should I whittle for a bit before we have a family sing-a-long around the fire?Going to be totally honest, I don't understand the yearning for a simpler lifestyle, as this scenario sounds like my own personal version of Hell.Alright! Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson and why you should read it.It's short! <--not as much of a time suck as Count of Monte CristoIt's a classic! <-- therefore, you will sound classyIt's got pirates! <--remember: dirty rum-bloated pirates, not shirtless Fabio piratesYou can learn new drinking songs! <--Yo ho ho and a bottle of Zima, bitchesThat all sounds great.But what is Treasure Island about, Anne?The gist is that our young hero, Jim Hawkins, has the shittiest luck ever.His dad dies and leaves a tweenage Jim and his mother with a ramshackle inn to run, complete with a scary drunken sailor (Billy Bones) that's not too keen on paying his tab as a tenant. He's what the kids these days call a scallywag.Why does it matter that Bones is continually dodging rent?Well, after Billy Bob meets his maker with the help of a few of his old sailing pals, Jim and his mother have to rifle through his things to get payment.AND JIM FINDS A MAP. <--to a place called Treasure Island*choir vocalizes*Back in the day, if you found a map it was apparently adventure time. You and your neighbors would rent a ship, hire a sketchy crew, and set out for parts unknown full of high hopes that you'd be coming back with gold doubloons! The reality is that you'd be lucky to come back alive without scurvy or syphilis.And dark thoughts like that are why I would have made a terrible pirate-adventurer...The adults (of course) make some really bad decisions when it comes to securing an efficient crew. They have a competent captain, but instead of listening to him, they hire a fairly obvious villain as the cook and then proceed to take his advice over the captain's. This ensures they have quite a surly group of sailors to man the SS Mutiny. Who is this cook? Long John Silver. <--yes, exactly like the sub-par seafood restaurant!When your cook's name is synonymous with chewy shrimp poppers and diarrhea, you might want to rethink your hiring process. Luckily for all the grown-ups, Jim is a brave and hearty lad who manages to save the day! <--not reallyOk, so this was written back when it was a big deal to keep your word. Like, if you promised your kidnappers that you wouldn't try to run for it, then you couldn't try to run for it because that would make you a liar. Which, for some unfathomable reason, was worth more than your life.SWEAR TO GOD, THESE OLD-TIMEY PEOPLE WERE RIDICULOUS.Naturally, there comes a point in the story where Jim needed to hop a fence and get the hell out of there, but wouldn't - because INTEGRITY. And I suppose we're meant to think he's a better person for it, but all I could think was that maybe Stevenson based his story around a child with special needs.Except, no. Because the doctor agreed with Jim, so apparently in the days of yore, the good guys couldn't just win, they had to win by a set of idiotic rules.Which is nuts! What are you teaching our kids, Robert!?Looking someone dead in the eyes whilst giving a firm handshake and lying through your teeth is a fucking lifeskill that every child needs to have perfected by adulthood in order to survive.But whatever. This is a fantasy, so it all works out for our heroes.They return home with their honor intact, a good bit of wealth, no STDs, and only a little bit of PTSD that kicks in whenever they hear a parrot squawk.

4,907146412,04/10/2014,4.0,"YO-HO-HO AND A BOTTLE OF RUM!!!This is the iconic novel about pirates that it stands as the best example in this topic and easily one of the most adapted to other media novels in any genre.I can remember having watched several adaptations, live action films, animated movies, even an animated film using animals as the characters, there is the Muppets' one, a Japanese anime TV series, an European mini-series taking the story to outer space starring Anthony Quinn, the animated remake of that version by Disney and the current Starz channel prequel TV series ""Black Sails"". Just to mention the ones that I have watched but there are a lot of more adaptations.While the topic of pirates is a popular one, I think that there aren't much novels about it. At least not examples really worthy of reading them. Obviously there are some here and there, but taking in account how much options one has in other topics in literature, pirates has been a concept seldom touched with success.However, this novel was able to keep on the mind of everybody the storytelling appeal of the topic of pirates inspiring successes on other media such as Japanese anime ""Captain Harlock"" and live actions films of ""Pirates of the Caribbean"".For all that and its own merit, Treasure Island keeps retaining the crown as the best novel about pirates. Characters like Jim Hawkins, Billy Bones, Ben Gunn, Captain Smollett and of course, Long John Silver have become iconic in the universe of literature. Even they have been so admired that other authors couldn't resist to makes homages/mentions of them on their own novels, such examples like on Peter Pan.Its appealing is obvious depending the readers, many young ones can't resist to be amazed by Jim Hawkins who is 14 years old but he is able to keep up in the middle of adult characters and even being a key character in the success of the adventure.To readers and writers of all ages, certainly the character of Long John Silver stands out as one of the best developed characters in the history of literature becoming a model to many following similar ones. He is able to do ruthless things but he has a code, he has limits, and not matter that he is not a nice person, there are things that he never will do and for that, he is a complicated and truly interesting character to read about.Not matter how was on real life, Robert Louis Stevenson, the author, was able to show a romantic picture of pirates' world with now iconic elements like islands with treasures, maps with ""x""'s, fearful papers with a black spot, peglegs, eye patches, parrots on shoulders, but above all, he had no doubt to show how dangerous and murderous can be real pirates.",173,0.9959,0.054,0.785,0.161,0.4818681318681319,POSITIVE,0.998

Well, then, you get on a horse, and go to – well, yes, I will! – to that eternal doctor swab, and tell him to pipe all hands – magistrates and sich – and he’ll lay ‘em aboard at the Admiral Benbow – all old Flint’s crew, man and boy, all on ‘em that’s left.

I believe a chill struck for a moment to every heart.“He was a seaman,” said George Merry, who, bolder than the rest, had gone up close and was examining the rags of clothing. “Leastways, this is good sea-cloth.”“Aye, aye,” said Silver; “like enough; you wouldn’t look to find a bishop here, I reckon. But what sort of a way is that for bones to lie? ‘Tain’t in natur’.”Indeed, on a second glance, it seemed impossible to fancy that the body was in a natural position. But for some disarray (the work, perhaps, of the birds that had fed upon him or of the slow-growing creeper that had gradually enveloped his remains) the man lay perfectly straight—his feet pointing in one direction, his hands, raised above his head like a diver’s, pointing directly in the opposite.“I’ve taken a notion into my old numbskull,” observed Silver. “Here’s the compass; there’s the tip-top p’int o’ Skeleton Island, stickin’ out like a tooth. Just take a bearing, will you, along the line of them bones.”At different ages we believe in different treasures and they keep luring us.",164,0.9968,0.03,0.798,0.171,0.4261904761904762,POSITIVE,0.9851
6,1795947687,10/28/2016,4.0,"Treasure Island is arguably one of the most influential tales in the world of fiction. Every pirate stereotype that we take for granted these days we can see the foundation somewhere in this magic tale. Approaching this story; I am quite lucky that I knew nothing about the plot except that there was a map where X marked the spot showcasing Captain Flint's legendary treasure. I went into the task of reading this like a happy youth, wide-eyed looking forward to experiencing a legendary story for the first time without being hindered with prior knowledge of the narrative, the characters, the pace and the plot twists.So the story goes something like this. An alcoholic ex-pirate Captain spends his days in a local bar drinking himself to death whilst singing jolly pirate songs. ""Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum"" etc... He, unfortunately, passes away and leaves a chest which contains a secret map amongst other treasures. The map is highly sought after by all the wrong people. Our 1st person perspective young superstar Jim Hawkin's finds the map and speaks to his friends Dr. Livesey and a squire, Mr. Trelawney and they decide to venture to this mystical treasure island to hunt for said treasure. Leaving from Bristol, they gather a ships worth of pirates and hands. Experienced in their own ways but none more so than pleasant, pub-owning ship's cook Long John Silver. So off they go on this adventure. They get the treasure and go home and live happily ever after. But, that obviously didn't happen because that would not make a legendary story. The main protagonist, Jim is a great character. This is typically seen as a children's book (although some of the sea and pirate terminology is quite specific and complex) and having the first person perspective shown from the view of a young kid adds to the remarkableness of the story. The fact Jim is a young man who performs extraordinary deeds, often going against the odds on the Hispaniola (the trusty vessel that takes them to treasure island) or the island itself amongst hardened sea-faring men means we really have his back and support his deeds throughout the tale. We feel close to him because of how well Stevenson writes this character. Every time the plot progresses, it is because of an amazing deed that Jim has done, often on his own back without the consultation of the most senior members of the group. We route for him every second of the way because he is us. Things don't work out smoothly when they get to the Island. A divide occurs. Mutiny some might say. A split is presented so Jim, Dr, Squire and a few trusted men are on one side. Old pirates who were part of Captain Flint's crew rally under who we thought was a nice dude. Long John Silver.He is the most complex character in this short book. Peg legged, parrot on his shoulder ""pieces of eight"" are some of his characterisations that you will probably see some 12-year-old child imitating this Halloween. You never quite know where you stand with Silver. He starts off seeming good. Jim overhears his plot of mutiny whilst hiding in a barrel. At that point, he is portrayed as purely evil but towards the end, he seems more human and complex. Sticking up for Jim Hawkins when the rest of his sea mates want to kill the poor lad. Other notable characters are Ben Gunn, the Robinson Crusoe-esque marooned island dweller and Dr. Livesey. It is ingeniously written that in such a short book we can care about so many of the players and their complexity is unrivaled. There are lots of cool scenes. Shootouts on the Island between the two factions. Jim vs. Israel Hands. Meeting Ben Gunn and when Jim goes back to the safe haven of the wooden castle expecting to regroup with his friends but alas... it is not to be. I will end this review with a few pirate clichés that frequent Treasure Island. ""Shiver my timbers"" ""Shipshape"" ""Jolly Roger"" & ""Pieces of Eight"" come to mind. I really enjoyed this. So different to Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde that I have previously read by Stevenson. Yet, that makes a good author, being able to flaunt his linguistic skills in various genres making tales such as these which will last forever.

8,89644127,02/14/2010,4.0,"Remember when pirates briefly became ironically cool, and all of your annoying friends were joining facebook groups for International Talk Like A Pirate Day? And the first Pirates of the Carribbean movie came out and was surprisingly awesome? And then the second Pirates of the Carribbean movie came out and was decidedly less awesome, but you didn't really realize it until the third one came out and you discovered you couldn't remember and didn't care about number two's cliffhanger ending (it was like The Matrix in that way actually)? And then you finally saw the third one on DVD when you were home from the hospital after almost dying of mono,who knew that could happen, but apparently it really messes with your liver, and the movie was so bad you couldn't even stay awake through the literally 45-minute long action sequence that caps it all off, and besides, it makes no sense at all, with everyone betraying everyone else so many times you need a flow chart to follow the plot?I suppose we have RLS and Treasure Island to blame for all that. Because this is the book that established what we think of when we think of pirates, from skull & crossbones banners to peg legs to squawking shoulder-mounted parrots to maps with big red Xs and yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum. It's kind of weird to think about: those concepts are so ingrained in our culture (see: International Talk Like a Pirate Day), and yet they all stem from this rather innocuous adventure story for children.But it is a really great adventure, which is probably why it became so iconic. This book is 130 years old but exhibits none of the mustiness of late Victorian-era fiction (turgid description being the chief offender, which you know if you've tried to slog through Jules Verne, and how in the world do you make submarines and sea monsters boring? Ask Jules). The adventure clips along quite nicely, moving from murder and mayhem on dry land to mutiny and more murder on the sea, and then to a creepy island filled with treasure and other dangers. Long John Silver is a crafty and compelling villain, switching sides more often than Benjamin Linus (hey, speaking of islands). Even though I knew basically where the story was going, it was a fast and engaging read, with a lot of creative sequences of suspense. The only sections that bogged down a bit were the brief but somewhat technical descriptions of the ship, the sails, how the waves turned it this way and that, etc. I don't know starboard from port, and I don't care to, RLS.

Well, it does if you're a pirate, which basically means that as a pirate you have a statistically much higher chance of finding treasure than any archaeologist ever would. I find this a bit unfortunate and if someone had presented me with this hard and fast evidence I would have ticked the pirate box and not the archaeologist box on my careers worksheet at school. Instead, I have to make do with reading Treasure Island and fantasising about my ideal bespoke treasure island (emeralds growing on trees- I know this is an arboreal unlikelihood but it's my fantasy so back off; lagoons filled with sapphires, gold dubloons in huge heapy piles at the foot of azure blue waterfalls and knuckle sized diamonds to be chipped off the walls of underground caverns). Stevenson's Treasure Island is much less of a Disney-esque fantasy and Jim Hawkins, narrator and salty sea dog in the making, is forced to pit his wits against the wiliest of all pirates, Long John Silver in a race to retrieve the booty. After finding an oil-skin map in a dead mans chest (nice Robert, very nice) Jim sets off to find some trustworthy (or gullible) adults. Jim must be in possession of some serious powers of persuasion because within minutes the good squire and his associates are rustling up a ship (no mean feat when a schooner could set you back £6000 and your chance of surviving the voyage was slim), tightening their buckanneering belts and getting ready to hit the high seas. It turns out the ships cook is more than he seems though and not to be underestimated (I wonder if JF Lawton, the writer of Under Siege was a Treasure Island fan, after all he served up Casey Rybeck, the most underestimated ships cook of all time).Caribbean capers ensue as Long John Silver serves up a melting pot of mendacity in an attempt to get his hand on Captain Flint's treasure. Jim Hawkins proves he's tougher than a soused herring that's been at the bottom of a barrel for a year and successfully repels the Island siege before hoisting the main sail, jibing -ho and heading for Britain. The other pirates are left marooned as a punishment and their skeletons will be unearthed 250 years from the time of telling during the construction of a Sandals adult holiday resort. Personally I think I'd rather be marooned than go to Sandals.",91,0.9874,0.046,0.818,0.136,0.5050260416666666,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Book Review

4 out of 5 stars to Treasure Island, a coming-of-age-of-sort novel, written in 1882 by Robert Louis Stevenson. I read this book as a young adult when I received it as a Christmas present from an aunt and uncle. At first, although I knew it was a classic, I wasn't too anxious to jump into it. I wasn't a big fan of pirates and boats. I wasn't a normal kid, what can I tell you. But... it was a gift and I thought I should give it a chance. And once I did, I loved it. I had read Peter Pan recently and felt a kismet connection of sorts between them. From the adventures to the bonds, to the test of good versus evil, the book had so many wonderful moments. And since then, I've sampled many different iterations, from movies to other books with pirate stories, all the way to Once Upon a Times interpretation. It's truly a remarkable story that helps young adults figure out how to approach a world full of fears, hopes and questions. And to think it's a pirate and a cook who help you to figure some of it out. But it's more. There's bonding. And team work. And treasure hunting. And challenges. And mystery. All culminating in reaching one's goals in ways you didn't necessarily expect.

13,2488303474,08/10/2018,5.0,"Motivations to read Treasure Island have been pinging me all my life. Most recently I read Henry James's famous essay “The Art of Fiction,” in which he says “I have just been reading . . . the delightful story of Treasure Island, by Mr. Robert Louis Stevenson.” That got me recalling all the favorable mentions of Stevenson in good old Jorge Luis Borges' Selected Non-Fictions. More recently, while streaming Blade Runner 2049, I decided to throw in the towel when Rick Deckerd says to Officer K “'You mightn’t happen to have a piece of cheese about you, now?'” which is an allusion to Treasure Island's desperate Ben Gunn. Thus, was I finally sent regressing. Well, not really; I’d never read it as a boy. And neither, says James, is it a book solely for boys. It’s a book for all ages, rather like Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe. Read it. It’s pure narrative pleasure—a treasure in itself.A great joy is the suspense, but also the description of passing across the landscape. This is a gift all the great novelists share—Gabriel García-Márquez, Thomas Hardy, Edith Wharton, V.S. Naipaul spring to mind. Here’s a favorite passage as the search for the treasure finally begins:Heavy, miry ground and a matted, marish vegetation, greatly delayed our progress; but by little and little the hill began to steepen and become stony under foot. It was, indeed, a most pleasant portion of the island that we were now approaching. A heavy-scented broom and many flowering shrubs had almost taken the place of grass. Thickets of green nutmeg trees were dotted here and there with the red columns and the broad shadow of the pines; and the first mingled their spice with the aroma of the others. The air, besides, was fresh and stirring, and this, under the sheer sunbeams, was a wonderful refreshment of our senses. (p. 166)",81,0.9941,0.013,0.813,0.174,0.5681451612903227,POSITIVE,0.9908

Practically every pirate tale written since then was influenced by this classic. I do not think I really need to mention the plot as it is widely known, but I will do it just in case. A young boy named Jim Hawkins got his hands on a map showing the location of a buried pirate treasure - by a pure accident. A group of people is ready to go on a treasure hunt, but their plans are about to be destroyed by pirates who also want to get the treasure. This is a classic adventure which also happened to have some very well written characters. First and foremost of such is Long John Silver. He is one of the most morally ambiguous characters from the genre. He was famous enough to have a chain of restaurants named after him, among other things. Another brilliant character which comes to mind is half-mad Ben Gunn (is he really?)Strictly speaking this novel rates closer to 4 stars than 5, but I will raise the rating due to respect for the classic and its influence (as the most recent example: Captain Jack Sparrow would not exist without this novel).This review is a copy/paste of my LeafMarks one: https://www.leafmarks.com/lm/#/users/...",81,0.9732,0.04,0.817,0.142,0.4243055555555555,POSITIVE,0.9007

I had forgotten about it frankly. Then while I was rereading it this time, images from past readings and the iconic Disney 1950 film (which I devoured as a kid) were jogged back into my mind by the words I was reading. The youthful fear I felt about the treacherous Israel Hands, the frustration at Squire Trelawney’s big mouth, and others all came roaring back at me. It was a very pleasant experience.On this reading, I appreciated the world Robert Louis Stevenson created, and I was impressed by his use of dialect and dialogue to establish and distinguish character. It is really well done. You can tell a lot about Long John Silver or the castaway Ben Gunn by the manner in which they speak.On top of that, it is just a ripping good yarn that also happens to be well written. It is not often that the two go together. The book keeps your attention and I found myself wanting to pick it up and read.A note about the Barnes & Noble classics edition…the Introduction by Angus Fletcher is overwrought and pretentious and adds nothing to your enjoyment of the text.

The protagonist, Jim Hawkins, is a young man caught between the mutinous pirates, led by the charismatic Long John Silver, and the smaller band of honest men, led by honest Captain Smollet. The book is full of action sequences, narrow escapes, crosses and double-crosses. It’s not subtle, and outside of Long John Silver—whose complexity is the only real wrinkle to the story—the characters are exactly who they seem to be.As an adult, I preferred reading  The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, which is a much more serious story exploring the duality of human nature and the struggle within each of us between good and evil.

20,1620186335,04/25/2016,,"Long ago I was chatting with a colleague and put it to him that we could send out to all the people who had particularly annoyed us at work an envelope containing a single sheet of paper, entirely blank, save for a large black spot. My colleague, despite his unnecessary youthfulness, was sagacious beyond his years, and pointed out that most of the people who had really got our goats had probably never read Treasure Island. Acquainted as we were with their varying degrees of semi-literacy I had to concede that he was right. I did propose that we follow the black spot with a second envelope containing a copy of the book, though sensing we might need to follow that with adult reading classes I'd have been best off getting straight to the point and making use of The Black Arrow instead. Occasionally in a moment of clarity I might see how odd something familiar is, in this case a children's book, because what have we here - amorality, ill-gotten gains, not simply sinister disabled persons but actually savage ones (view spoiler)[though if you are blind perhaps you prefer Blind Pew to the milk and white bread goodie two-shoes out of All the Light you cannot see (hide spoiler)]. The problem is my assumption of children's literature as needing to be didactic and purposive and worthy, this rather like in the later Peter Pan and Narnia goes nowhere good at all (view spoiler)[ unless you very strictly hold to life as a vale of tears through which one ought to scurry with the eyes firmly closed in a race to get to that fine and private place where none, I think, do there embrace (hide spoiler)], instead Stevenson offers up rich ooze from the imagination.A joy in reading a few books by one author is getting a sense of the soup of their mind, the ingredients that get ladled out in varying proportions in one book after another. While in The Black Arrow we had a wicked uncle dressed up as a sinister leper, here we get the same ingredient in a less refined form - the hideous blind man and one legged man, their physical disabilities seem to make them even more powerful, Pew has a fearful speed and powerful grip, Silver is more adroit than a South-African athlete, with a crutch that doubles as a javelin when required. I was going to say that there is something childlike in seeing disabled people as inherently sinister but then I recalled (view spoiler)[the court case in which a young woman used her crutch as a weapon and the old woman who tried to run me down with her disability scooter, luckily I was able to leap up onto the town hall steps while she drove off cackling into the evening fog (hide spoiler)] that children can often be remarkably indifferent to difference accepting it at face value while adults, when one watches the evening news, can be apparently obsessed with it.Along which lines I was worried to read the Squire's letter I forgot to tell you that Silver is a man of substance, I know of my own knowledge that he has a banker's account, which has never been overdrawn. He leaves his wife to manage the inn; and as she is a woman of colour, a pair of old bachelors like you and I may be excused for guessing that it is the wife, quite as much as the health, that sends him back to roving (p39) (view spoiler)[ Treasure Islands has more on the links between contemporary piracy and banking  (hide spoiler)]. Ah, Jim lad, I thought, do you really want to be a cabin boy to a pair of old confirmed bachelors like that who have no comprehension of why a man might want to live together with a woman - look at the racist attitudes you could end up learning from them(view spoiler)[Quite aside from the attitude to property - who does all that gold belong to? One could say to those it was stolen from, or one might value the labour put in by the pirates in seizing the treasure and fairly ascribe it to the survivors of Flint's crew, but of anybody the Squire has the least reasonable claim - its a bit like How to Read Donald Duck which shows the same attitude present in the cartoon - if you have wealth you can use it to acquire more while if you don't have wealth you have no right to keep your gold from others - as we see here in the fate of Ben Gunn who trades a cave full of gold for the promise of some cheese(view spoiler)[Ben Gunn is sorry figure - all those goats about him and never no cheese... had he been Robinson Crusoe he'd have domesticated the goats, been clad in the finest homespun goat's wool, feasted on roast kid and had a cave full of goat's cheese (hide spoiler)] (hide spoiler)].I'm also interested just as in Kidnapped the child has the more adult behaviours than the grown ups - the pirates are rather like Stevenson's Highlanders, full of feeling but aside from Silver, showing little sense and about as much patience as a child at Christmas (view spoiler)[ or similar present related festivity (hide spoiler)]. So it is the boy Hawkins who runs rings round them demonstrating loyalty, cunning, and a taste for one-liners One more step, Mr. Hands...and I'll blow your brains out! Dead men don't bite, you know (p142). The thing about Treasure Island is that the whole adventure is for the sake of adventure. Ok, Ben Gunn gets a job, Silver gets three hundred guineas and hopefully gets back to Bristol so that he and his wife can enjoy one another and start the ground work for International Talk like a Pirate Day. Do the Squire and the Doctor need the money? Does Jim Hawkins get anything?

25,339254058,05/30/2012,4.0,"Treasure Island was a swash-buckling adventure where the stakes were high and the Gentlemen of Fortune weren't so gentle when seeking their fortune. I absolutely loved this book. Having never read it before, I picked it up because it looked to be a quick read, and I had books on route to my house and not much time before they got here, I thought I'd get another quick read off my list of classics. Immediately upon reading I wanted to get on a boat and search for buried treasure, but settled for playing in the sandbox in the backyard. Stevenson brings to life characters in a new and frightening way that held me captivated, in which Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde failed to do. He writes in such a way in this novel, that the characters come to life vividly and with great detail in my mind as I read, even though, when I later went back to re-read parts, the characters weren't defined nearly as minutely as I thought they were. I don't attribute this to my own imagination though. I think Stevenson's brilliance lies in the meticulous vagueness of his descriptions, allowing the reader to take the direction of their choosing with the character's appearance. A perfect example of this is in Ben Gunn. My husband and I were watching Treasure Island with Eddie Izzard, and he commented on the age of Gunn, saying he'd seen another movie where he was old, opposed to this one, in which he was younger in age. So then I thought back to the book and wondered, what age was he? So I looked it up, and really, it could be interpreted in so many ways: ""...unlike any man I had ever seen, stooping almost double as it ran..."" - As an animal or from old age? ""...his voice sounded hoarse and awkward, like a rusty lock. I could now see he was a white man like myself, and that his features were even pleasing. His skin, wherever it was exposed, was burnt by the sun; even his lips were black; and his fair eyes looked quite startling in so dark a face. Of all the beggar men I had seen or fancied, he was the chief for raggedness."" - Old? Young? ""...I was a civil, pious, boy..."" - Speaking of when he was young, makes me see him as older. ""You're a good lad, Jim..."" - He calls Hawkins a lad, which makes him seem older to me, but then, how old is old? For the time it was and the longevity of life span, especially for the pirates with so hazardous a life, they didn't live long. So maybe in his thirties? Besides the wonderful characters, the chapters were breathtaking, causing me to sit at the edge of my seat with each page turn. What a wonderfully suspenseful tale with such colorful inhabitants! Even the slang was picturesque, with nicknames like ""Barbeque"" for Silver, and ""Long John's Earrings"" for the ropes strung across the ships decks that allowed our favorite character to pass easily from port to starboard with his one leg. And even though the movie I saw gave a satisfying death to the despicable Trelawney, I'm rather glad that the book left him alive at the end. It wasn't what I expected and it was more true to life. The abhorrent man, who puts himself off as one of the good guys, never seems to be the one with a bad run of luck. And although Muppet Treasure Island was not exactly true to the original story, (the Captain a frog?), it was still surprisingly accurate in most aspects of the novel, which is something I've always enjoyed about the Muppets, especially in The Christmas Carol. Overall, it was a superb book and an intoxicating adventure. A natural classic, with a huge following, underlying themes, and above all, a great deal of the Magic Factor, it's a story that will live through the ages and continue to be adapted in many ways and various forms for years to come. Treasure Island is a beloved tale for both young and older readers alike. I highly recommend it.  ClassicsDefined.com",51,0.9991,0.045,0.755,0.2,0.527593795093795,POSITIVE,0.9991

We'll divide stores with you, man for man; and I'll give my affy-davy as before to speak the first ship I sight, and send 'em here to pick you up... Refuse that, and you've seen the last of me but musket-balls.""""There!"" he cried. ""That's what I think of ye. Before an hour's out, I'll stove in your blockhouse like a rum puncheon. Laugh, by thunder, laugh! Before an hour's out ye'll laugh on the other side.

30,1946968084,03/19/2017,5.0,"Last year I read Kidnapped and I was truly amazed by the fact that I ignored the existence of such a good novel, so I decided that I definitively have to read more Stevenson. Treasure Island was the second novel I ever read. Then I was too young and I realized I didn’t remember neither the plot nor the characters nor anything. Truth be told I remember it was a novel about a treasure in a desert island and someone (a pirate?) called John Silver. Even though I had completely forgotten what Treasure Island was about (besides the treasure and the island), I was absolutely certain that I really enjoyed reading it and that it was a great book. So after the great experience of reading kidnapped I decided that I had to read Treasure Island one more time. I recently found it in a bookstore and for a moment doubted about buying it: I was afraid it might be a children’s tale or that I wouldn’t enjoy it as much as I did the first time.Well, I bought I read it and NO REGRETS. Actually I was sorry I waited so long for reading it again, this is simply a marvellous tale. The nautical terms and the pirate slang made reading a little slow at first but then I got used to it. The rest is awesome. You can read what this book is about in Wikipedia so I won’t bother you with the “Young Jim Hawkins meets captain Flint, blah blah blah” I will say this though: Yes, it’s a coming of age book, and no, it is not a ""tale for children"". If you read this book when you were young and kind of remember liking it, read it again. If, on the other hand, you kind of remember not liking it, then read it again, chances are you were too young to grasp all the beauty of this book. #JustSaying.Treasure Island is the result of a very talented author who puts in one place all the elements to create a classic of literature: A great plot, amazing descriptions, and incredibly well developed characters. The prose is magnificent: the pace is excellent with more than one cliff-hanger and a couple of twist that make you put the book down for a moment until you realise what just happened and then eagerly resume reading to know what will happen next.TL;DR: Read this book if you haven’t. Read it again if you read it when you were young. Because it’s awesome, that’s why.This review was also posted in my blog",40,0.9976,0.045,0.743,0.212,0.5407377344877345,POSITIVE,0.9969

Claim the prize. Flee the scene. End of the story. Alas, that is not how Robert Louis Stevenson envisaged the ending. At this point, you have more than two thirds of the book to finish. Yet you carry on as if you haven't a clue about how the mariners who are on a death-mission will return absolutely unscathed, to enjoy the riches that the island bestowed upon them. Yes, because it is Stevenson. So, if you are not someone who is directionally- and spatially-challenged like me, and is fond of cursing like an old English sailor (or a buccaneer) (Anu, are you reading this? Man! That was seriously messed up even for dootiful followers of the parlance!), and utterly bored with life's real quests, then hop onto Captain Smollett's schooner and head for Treasure Island. Remember, you'll only have young Jim Hawkins to save your butt in case you get caught in trouble. And, may luck be with you. As for the sheer literary brilliance of the book, I leave it up to you to decide (I am not particularly partial to piratealect!). [The only thing that troubles me is how people treat Long John Silver like a glorified villain. He stabbed a faithful seaman in cold blood at the first chance he got-- and there's no glory in that, I tell you.

It's filled with well-rounded, enjoyable characters - Jim as the main, a mere child, was easy to enjoy as he led most of the story through his viewpoint. Long John Silver was twisted but fascinating and, having not read the story before, I was surprised with some of the faces he showed. Yes, I've been living under a rock in that regard. Stevenson is a good writer - his words make a smooth sailing experience, talented and pretty but keeping on point to hold up pacing.Despite perks, the story itself is only average to me since I wanted a full fledged adventure and felt more could have been included. Skeleton Island had a personality we didn't get to fully explore, and most of what happened was predictable with little surprise. Sure, I didn't see some of the small twists, but overall the surprises weren't strong. The book shines brightest at the beginning at the inn, but I thought it would keep going strong when they set sail. Instead sea travel is abbreviated and the rest of the book focuses mainly on the internal fighting of the men. While this was interesting, I'd like to see other things thrown in to shake things up. Keeping it a little basic makes it clear to me he was writing this more with young readers in mind.Overall it was a book that started much and deserves its place as a classic treasure. The writing is well done, the characters rich, although the story is a little bare bones.",36,0.9942,0.042,0.768,0.191,0.5240338164251207,POSITIVE,0.984

Artist for this review is American illustrator Howard Pyle.]My younger brother triggered a long-forgotten movie that we had watched and enjoyed as children, Disney’s Treasure Planet; the pirates were animal, cyborg/robots, the ships flew in space rather than on water… I don’t remember much more about it, only that we both enjoyed it. It is, of course, a science-fiction retelling of Stevenson’s story “for boys”. Children love pirates, for whatever reason: perhaps because they have big ships, they have swords and guns and parrots, and their life is one giant nomadic adventures on the seas. This book, published in 1883, is probably just exciting to a child as it was back then. I’ve always felt somewhat guilty for never having read it, though I am certainly about 20 years too late. I prefer my novels to be heavier, pensive, and with far less action. In a way, I enjoyed this as much as I would enjoy an action-movie, though I don’t watch action movies on the whole. This is a fairly short book and not difficult to read but I found I could only manage a chapter here and there before putting it down again and wanting to read something with more depth. It is fun and fast-paced with nothing to chew on, exactly how Stevenson wanted it, I imagine.""So the Treasure was Divided""—1905Had I read this as a boy, I am sure my brother and I would have played Treasure Island together, arguing over who was going to be Jim Hawkins.

35,1484613738,12/29/2015,5.0,"I have toured the Stevenson House in Monterey, California where it is said Stevenson conceived the idea for “Kidnapped”. Stevenson said he got the basis for the story of “Treasure Island” after drawing a map of an imaginary island for his stepson but when he lived in Monterey the scenery triggered the story. I had read the book, years and years ago when in elementary school. I reread it in 1959 after first touring the Stevenson house. When Audible displayed the book I thought I would reread the classic even though it is a children’s story.The story takes place in the mid 1700s, on the west coast of England. Our protagonist is Jim Hawkins, the son of an inn keeper. An old sailor “the Captain” Billy Bones is a logger at the inn and pays Jim to keep an eye out for a one legged seafaring man. Billy has a stroke and dies, and then Jim’s father dies. Jim and his mother open Billy’s sea chest and discover money, a journal and a map. The district Squire Trelawney obtains a ship and hires the local physician Dr. Livesy as the ship’s doctor and Jim as cabin boy. He hires a crew including Long John Silver as the cook along with his talking parrot. They sail off to find the pirate Captain Flint’s Treasure Island.The story was published as seventeen weekly installments in the “Young Folks Magazine” from 1 October 1881 to 28 January 1882. It was later published as a book. Stevenson wrote “The “Amateur Emigrant,” “The Pavilion on the Links,” and “A Vendetta in the West” while living in Monterey. Stevenson said his time in Monterey influenced his writing in many ways, the scenery; the people of many nations living together gave him many ideas for stories. Needless to say the book is well written and Neil Hunt did a good job narrating the book. I read this as an audiobook downloaded from Audible.",33,0.8519,0.0,0.97,0.03,0.390625,POSITIVE,0.9943

38,96026977,03/27/2010,3.0,"There are a lot of Sea Stories out there, and this is one of the better-known, but it hardly outshines its genre. I found myself missing the humor and vivid characterization of Conrad, not to mention the insightful philosophical asides. I also found it somewhat lacking as an adventure story, as the plot was somewhat simplistic and contrived, following the empty avatar of a narrator through various vicarious thrills. There's nothing wrong with an escapist yarn, but a good one keeps you riveted with twists and turns, alternating verisimilitude and the unlikely. It's not as if it's a problem of period, either, since The Three Musketeers is one of the most rollicking and engrossing adventure stories ever written.One must take into consideration the fact that Treasure Island is one of those genre-defining works which has been rehashed and plundered by a thousand authors since, until it is ingrained in our culture as The representation of piratical life. Like Neuromancer, many of the tropes and plot points might seem unoriginal, but that's only because they have been copied so frequently that we are no longer capable of recognizing their origin.Yet, this isn't the case for all genre-defining works. The Virginian still stands out when compared with any other Western and The Moonstone remains unique despite all the Mysteries that have dutifully followed it. The difference is the author's verve and style, because even if later authors can copy his ideas, copying his style will prove beyond their skill. An author who is good enough to recreate another author's style already has a unique voice of their own.It's curious to compare this with Poe's sole outing in the novel, The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket, which has the voice and unpredictability Treasure Island lacks, but doesn't provide the same lilting tone or straightforward plot, leaving each as interesting artifacts in the genre, even if neither can claim to be a complete vision.But then, it is often incomplete visions that provide the greatest inspiration, since they illuminate flaws and pitfalls, providing an outline for later authors and a caution of what should be avoided. Few people have come away from a book they couldn't possibly outdo feeling inspired to create, whereas reading a flawed but entertaining book can be the perfect jolt to a prospective author. But then, a book that inspires other authors to write could hardly help being the influential anchor from which the rest of a genre depends, so such flaws end up serving a purpose, if inadvertently.What drew me to this book, more than anything, is my desire to understand the unique literary mind of Mervyn Peake, one of the most powerful authors in the English language. Peake often invoked this as a favorite book, and produced a powerful series of illustrations for it. In these illustratios, one begins to see what Peake took away from Stevenson, as an author.While this is, to some degree, a story about simple characters, particularly the narrator, it is also a very dark tale, particularly for a children's classic. The death and deceit of the tale come out in Peake's drawings, as does the grotequerie.This darkness is undeniably there, but truthfully, I barely noted it until I looked at Peake's vision. To some degree, Sea Stories always bear this kind of horror, a world of conflict, the unforgiving sea, headhunting cannibals, and death a cheap thing. Poe and Conrad each outdo Stevenson in unsettlement, but in different ways.Poe's tends to be more purely visual, as is always his obsession in writing. It is the languid, lingering description that Poe gives to the leering face of a gull-bitten corpse that drives home the darkness of this life.Conrad, on the other hand, gives us horror in the eyes of his characters. He doesn't shy away from the pure physicality of the unpleasant world, but where it lingers is in the mind's eye; visions which can never be erased, which will forever taint our everyday actions.But Stevenson gives us neither. His adventure tale holds plenty of fear, but when young Jim murders a pirate, gruesome as it is, it rarely lingers either as vignette or psychological crack. Of course, he had a different notion of the maturity of a ten-year-old than we do today, where childhood lasts into the twenties, but we don't get the psychological progression we expect from a man coming to terms with death.These moments and reflections are not entirely absent, but they tend to get lost in the fleeting, episodic style of the story. But I'm glad for Treasure Island, if only because it inspired Peake to expand upon this tale of a precocious boy drawn inexorably into a dark world of grotesque characters in his unfinished magnum opus, the Gormenghast series.",31,0.9952,0.082,0.773,0.145,0.5242796092796094,POSITIVE,0.5406
39,67542437,08/15/2009,3.0,"My first time to read this book. The reason why I read this book now is that my favorite author, Frank McCourt mentioned in his memoir Teacher Man that Robert Louis Stevenson was his favorite author when he was a young boy in Ireland. When he moved to New York and during the first year of schooling, he submitted Treasure Island as his home-reading book and his literature teacher was impressed because his American classmates submitted books of contemporary (now forgotten) authors. After reading this book, I agree with McCourt's teacher. This classic children's book is a readable as the day it first came out in 1883. Truly a proof of Stevenson's excellence in writing. Treasure Island is really the ultimate ""young boy's book"".I have not seen the movie or TV adaptations of this book but I now remember, when we were little, hearing my eldest brother singing this song that, according to Wiki, is entitled Sea Shanty:
""Fifteen men on the dead man's chestYo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!Drink and the devil had done for the rest -Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of run!""
Stated in the Wiki entries for Robert Louis Stevenson (1850-1894) that this novel was dismissed by critics to be juvenile and they considered Stevenson as flippant to be taken seriously. However, more than 100 years after its first publication, the book is still being read by people of all ages and from all walks of life. Who knows? Maybe the people who criticize Harry Potter, The Twilight Saga, The Hunger Games or even The Song of Ice and Fire will also eat their words 100 years from now.It tells the story of Jim Hawkings who assists in the running of their inn in England during the 18th century. Their inn is not very busy because it is far from the crowded area so scrupulous (translation: people hiding from something) individuals become their clients. One of these is Billy Bones who has a secret: he used to be part of the crew of Captain Flint, a notorious pirate. One day, Bones is visited by a former fellow crew, Pew who gives him a treasure map. When Bones opens the map, he saw a ""Black Spot"" that foretells bad luck and he drops dead of stroke. Jim and his mother opens his chest to get the amount due for Bones's board and lodging but before they could get the money, pirates arrive searching for the treasure map. The rest of the story is about the treasure hunt complete with lots of swashbucking actions (that reminded me very much of the movie Pirates of the Caribbean) and the flight to the DeadChest island, an island near the Norman Island located in British Virgin Island.So before Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Deep), there was Long John Silver and the other pirates of Treasure Island. The movie series has many similarities with the book so, if you haven't read this and you are a Pirates' fan, you may want to consider reading the book first before seeing the third part of the series, On Stranger Tides. I saw it today and oh it was so good! Of course, still starring Johnny Depp: Oh, I am just desperate to get your votes!

I have always been fantasized by the Pirates stories, but reading ‘Treasure Island’ once, had been a long awaiting quench. These was a daring and courageous boy inside the innocent face of Jim. His innocence was his key to success. Even when the pirates of various kinds, good and bad and even worst, are there but still Jim dealt with them like they were just neighbors. From ‘Billy’ to ‘Long John’, he managed to find solution with everyone out there. Dr. Livesey, his neighbor and Magistrate, along with Squire Trelawney, supported him throughout the adventure, to & fro by Hispaniola.Captain Flint’s Treasure was living in the mind of Jim, Dr., Squire, John, Billy, and all rest crew of the Hispaniola and relevant persons. ‘Black Dog’& blind ‘Pew’ were also the part of the same search party.I liked the rhythm of;“Fifteen men on the dead man's chest—Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!”Most interesting chapter was the first one, that not only created craze and curiosity to read further but also the plot was way better than the other chapters in the whole story. I really enjoyed the plot at ‘Admiral Benbow’. Next to it was the last one. The way Author chose his cast and use them in his plot on Island is exemplary. ‘Ben Gunn’ added as wild card proved his worth at last. His support to Jim even when he had whole treasure, shown his good character and mental health even though he was left alone on the Island with no one around. To be stable in such a condition is quite not expected. Trusting anyone in that situation was tough for Jim but he somehow made his way out.This whole adventure with all interesting cast made this work more memorable and enjoyable. Though it dips in between while the changing of the narration from Jim to Dr. Livesey bit the again it gained strength and finally the last chapter held grip like the first one. This whole sailing adventure created by ‘Stevenson’ will always be the most enchanting one of all the Pirates’ Stories ever.

42,17081348,03/05/2008,4.0,"Robert Louis Stevenson was an author I became acquainted with very early in life, as the 1959 date suggests; this was my first book by him, and one of the staple favorites of my childhood. (The date is rough; I may have been younger than seven when I first read it, and two is just a guess as to how many times I read it --it was at least that, but maybe more.) My rating is my hindsight assessment of how it stacks up today in the mental canon of literature I've read; but if I'd read it today, with an adult's perspective, my rating might actually be higher.Stylistically, this book has much in common with the author's Kidnapped (without the Scots dialect), and illustrates some of the qualities that lead me to rank him as a favorite writer: a well-crafted plot with a hefty adventure and excitement quotient; vivid, vibrant characters; a solidly moral orientation; a protagonist I could identify with. His formal, 19th-century diction seemed to me back then (and probably also would today) like serious prose for a serious story, and seemed appropriate to the historical setting. (Admittedly, the nautical terms and some of the other vocabulary, using terms outside my experience, was a challenge, but I could usually roughly interpret it from the context --for instance, I could tell that a ""lugger"" was some sort of boat.) Today, I can recognize the book as a classic of Romantic style (I didn't know what that was back then), with its frank evocation of emotion and exotic --once England is left behind-- tropical island setting and pirate milieu. But Stevenson does not ""romanticize"" pirates, in the sense that much modern popular culture does; these are brutal, coarse, treacherous cutthroats motivated by greed, with nothing glamorous or charming about them. Long John Silver, of course, is the template for the stereotype of the one-legged pirate captain with a talking parrot; but the formation of the stereotype testifies to the power and vitality of the original creation. I agree with the Goodreads description above that the ambiguous relationship between young narrator Jim Hawkins and Silver is one of the strong points of the book, and the storyline has a coming-of-age theme to it through the relationship, as Jim realizes both that an outwardly jovial and winsome facade can mask a personality capable of very ruthless and self-serving choices --and that, at the same time, the ruthless and self-serving aren't cardboard villains, but human beings.Another similarity to Kidnapped here is that both novels have no major female characters. Indeed, Stevenson wrote this at least partly to please a nephew who was at the age for disliking girls, and had promised him a novel with no female characters except the hero's mother. :-) Given that superstitious 18th-century sailors believed a woman's presence on a ship caused bad luck, that's not an unrealistic situation. So, this isn't a read for fans who insist on having small-r romance with their historical/adventure fiction!",28,0.9927,0.07,0.781,0.149,0.4708024691358025,POSITIVE,0.9999
43,3201905796,02/22/2020,5.0,"Fifteen men after a dead man’s chestYo, ho, and a bucket of bloodWhat do pirates do? They drink one bottle of rum after another. They kill each other and anyone else they desire. They are also greedy and will steal the shirt off your back and the gold in your teeth.They are vulgar in speech but forget the sex, because they are too busy drinking themselves to death. And they say that this is a children’s book. I tried reading this book way over two years ago, and while I loved the beginning chapters, those at the Admiral Benbow Inn. After Jim and company arrived at Treasure Island and there was a mutiny, I put the book down. I hate battle scenes. Yet, I never forgot the scenes at the Inn, which I thought contained the best writing of any author. I wanted to read it again, because it kept nagging at me to do so. This time I decided that I had to finish the book, battles and all. It began with an old captain dragging a chest into the Admiral Benbow Inn, placing it in his room and hiding its key. The Inn was operated by Mr. and Mrs. Hawkins with the help of their young son, Jim. The captain asked Jim to keep an eye out for a one-legged man and to let him know immediately if he sees him. Next, the captain is creeping around, trying to see who is at the Inn at any given time. And he is eating large amounts of food and drinking rum, enough to fill a large barrel. You know, you have seen them at wineries, only those are not filled with rum. And what is it with rum? I thought that it was only good for making Rum Balls, those rum cookies that they make at Christmas, the ones that can also make you drunk. Or, perhaps, rum is used in fruit cakes to make them taste great. Of course, you add the rum after the cake is baked, and of course, and you do not bake the cookies at all. This time around, I am not reading this book, instead I am listening to it on my BARD app, and the narrator is great. His name is Erik Sandvold and not the same narrator as who you get on Audible. on. He sounds like a pirate when speaking those parts, I should say, what people imagine pirates to sound like. I found myself almost as fascinated with his different voices as I did with the book. Not really. And what is more, I could see the Inn, the island, and the skeletons, even the buckets of blood. I could even almost hear the captain singing “Fifteen men on a dead man’s chest, Yo, ho, and a bottle of rum.” Well, now that I think of it, it was sung aloud by the narrator. Last of all, I even saw the ships shelves with bottles of rum and wanted to grab a few to make Rum Balls. So now, you know that I have read the battles on the island, and I learned its secrets, but if I tell you anymore, you will have the story spoiled for you. So, I will leave you with this recipe:No Bake Rum Balls1 cup finely crushed vanilla wafers1 cup powdered sugar1 cup finely chopped walnuts or pecans1 cup, rum, bourbon or brandy2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder2 tablespoons light corn syrupMix all in a bowl and shape into balls. Store in an air tight container. Makes 3 dozen.",28,0.561,0.083,0.832,0.084,0.4885260770975057,NEGATIVE,0.9882
44,76127066,10/29/2009,5.0,"(Reprinted from the Chicago Center for Literature and Photography [cclapcenter.com:]. I am the original author of this essay, as well as the owner of CCLaP; it is not being reprinted here illegally.)The CCLaP 100: In which I read for the first time a hundred so-called ""classics,"" then write essays on whether or not they deserve the labelEssay #32: Treasure Island (1883), by Robert Louis StevensonThe story in a nutshell:Inspired by a doodle from his step-son and originally written as a rainy-day family diversion, the slim 1883 children's book Treasure Island (originally published serially in 1881 and '82) was not only the first novel of sickly genre author Robert Louis Stevenson's short career, but eventually one of his most famous. Essentially the tale of young adventurer Jim Hawkins, the story opens with him as a dutiful mama's boy off the southwest coast of England, helping to run a family inn that sees little action because of being located much more inland than most of the other local sailor-oriented hotels. Ah, but this is exactly what brings the drunken, scary Billy Bones there, where it becomes quickly apparent that he is on the run and in semi-hiding from a whole crew of mysterious, nefarious characters; and when they finally show up after Bones' alcoholism-related death, the family realizes that they are in fact pirates, on the hunt for a treasure map that Bones stole from a recent mutinous voyage that went horribly, horribly wrong. This then convinces a group of local Victorian gentlemen and family friends to go after the treasure themselves, eventually buying a boat and hiring a local crew to take them to this far-off tropical island; but little do they realize that the sailors they've hired are none other than the surviving pirates of the former mutiny, led by the charismatic yet psychopathic one-legged ""ship's cook"" Long John Silver, who plan on turning on the ship's owners once actually reaching the island and retrieving the treasure they were forced to leave behind during their last voyage. The rest of the book, then, is essentially an adventure tale, full of all kinds of legitimate surprises that I won't spoil here; let's just say that a lot of swashbuckling takes place, that many details regarding ship-sailing are faithfully recorded, and that the day is eventually saved by our fast-thinking teenage hero Jim, no surprise at all for a book designed specifically to amuse fellow teenage boys.The argument for it being a classic:Well, to begin with, it's arguably the most famous pirate tale ever written, and in fact established for the first time many of the stereotypes now known within the genre, including one-legged buccaneers, treasure maps with a big 'X' on them, shoulder-sitting parrots squawking ""Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!,"" and even the very idea of British pirates being associated with exotic tropical islands in the Caribbean, an association now so strong that it's almost impossible to separate the two; and of course it's also the novel that created the unforgettable Long John Silver, now a thoroughly ingrained part of our Western culture at large. Add to this that it's simply an incredibly thrilling tale (rumor has it that England's Prime Minister at the time stayed up until two in the morning to finish his first reading of it), that it still holds up surprisingly well even 126 years later, and that it's also of immense importance to fans of Stevenson, a prolific author whose genius is just now starting to be widely recognized, after being dismissed by the literary community for almost a century as a frivolous ""kiddie writer;"" and now add to all this that Treasure Island is a surprisingly sophisticated examination of the era's ethics and moral code as well, taking an unblinking look at the ""Victorian Ideal"" as manifested in different ways among the stuffy gentlemen ""heroes"" (unable to improvise in changing circumstances, much to their detriment), the anarchic pirate villains (who almost kill themselves off just on their own, through drunkenness, ignorance and jealousy), and the ruthless yet principled Silver who straddles both these extremes.The argument against:A weak one at best; like many of the genre prototypes of the late Victorian Age, one could argue that this is simply too flippant a tale to be considered a classic. But we already established a long time ago here at the CCLaP 100 that genre stories are indeed eligible for ""classic"" status in this series, making this argument inapplicable in our case.My verdict:Holy crap! What an incredible book! And what a refreshing change in this case to not have to add my usual caveat to statements like these regarding late Victorian genre experiments: ""...you know, for a century-old children's story that's kind of outdated and that you need to take with a grain of salt."" Because the fact is that Treasure Island to this day still reads as fresh and exciting as the day it came out, which is a real testament to the writing skills of Robert Louis Stevenson (who I was already a big fan of before this essay series even started, because of his superbly creepy and also surprisingly relevant Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde); what a shame that this illness-plagued author ended up dying at the age of 44 in the prime of his career, instead of surviving to pen the truly mindblowing mature works I'm convinced that he had been capable of. And it's exactly for the reasons that his fans bring up that this book remains such an amazing one, and how it is that it can still easily be read for pleasure instead of having to force one's way through for historical purposes; because it is indeed not only a thrilling adventure tale, not only written in a style that largely rejects the purplish finery of the Victorian Age in which it was created, but is also a deceptively complex look at the entire nature of ""gentlemanness"" that was so prevalent at the time, gently poking holes in the entire notion of what it means to be a Refined Citizen of the Empire, even while acknowledging that a complete disavowal of these gentlemanly standards is even worse. There's a very good reason that Long John Silver has endured so strongly in our collective imagination over the last century, when so many other fictional pirates have fallen by the wayside, because he turns out to be a surprisingly complicated character worth coming back to again and again, a vicious killer but with a consistent internal moral code worth perversely admiring; it's but one of many reasons that I confidently label this book a undeniable classic today, and highly recommend it to anyone on the search for the best of 19th-century literature.Is it a classic?

45,2426346224,06/18/2018,4.0,"I’ve come to the conclusion that the 1880s were a great decade for exciting classics. We got the introduction of such famous characters as Sherlock Holmes (in a Study of Scarlett) and Alan Quartermain, (in King Solomon’s Mines) but also Long John Silver and young Jim Hawkins. Of the three stories I mentioned above, Treasure Island is to my mind the far most entertaining (though personally I like some of the later Sherlock stories better… but that is beside the point). I won't bother with a plot description. You all know the story; it has been parodied, homage, and adapted into films, cartoons, television episodes, video games, radio plays and more countless times. The number of alternate takes to this story are just mind-boggling. It is an entertaining tale, and the adaptations both good and bad, are in a way about the biggest praise that can be shown for it, as it is a tale that every generation wants to put their own spin on. Personally I think the Muppets did it best.  Personally I found the most interesting thing about the novel, especially given the time period of the writing, is that the two most intimidating character both have physical disabilities. Pew is blind and Silver has only one leg… despite these aspects they both come off as strong and far more menacing than any of the other pirates presented in the book. Stevenson presents them as threatening, capable, and frankly badass pirates… and that is rather refreshing.For the most part, I have very little to complain about on this one. While I don't find it to be a perfect book by any means, it is one I found myself smiling at constantly. My criticisms would all come off as nitpicks. It is what it is, and it is very entertaining. The only issue I would even mention is that the section titled “My Sea Adventure” was a bit too slow. It could possibly be very exciting for those with a great love of descriptions of ships and waves, but I found it a bit dull… there was also a distinct lack of Silver in it. Now let’s go ahead and cover this; Long John Silver makes this book. Yes, he is iconic for a reason. Silver is disloyal, greedy, a constant liar and seemingly quite often devoid of human empathy (save maybe for Jim)…, he is also charismatic and constantly entertaining. He is the obvious inspiration for pretty much every charming (but amoral) buccaneer in pop culture. In closing: this book is a classic for good reason. While some may consider it a young adult novel (and indeed it was publish initially in a publication for children) it is still a wonderful adventure and a great read. A well deserved 4/5 stars.

46,3270582281,06/23/2020,5.0,"So much is said about ""Treasure Island"". That this was the book that established all the now-familiar elements of the well-worn genre of swashbuckling adventures with pirates and also laid down the groundwork for countless and equally rehashed tales of hunting buried treasure on an isolated island in an uncharted sea. And there are also so many who call it dotty, predictable (it seems ""predictable"" only because because we have done the same story to death) and even overrated. Well, what then makes me give it the highest rating possible?The answer to that is not merely that ""Treasure Island"" still holds up as an exhilarating, exciting and ""swashbuckling"" adventure even today and that is no small achievement. While most of our classic adventures might seem quaint and only merely pleasing and passably entertaining to a modern reading mindset, for instance ""Around The World In Eighty Days"" which can be savoured more as an enjoyable colonial-era travelogue and less of a thrilling race against time to win a high-stakes wager, here's a rip-roaring, rousing adventure that grips the reader right from the first page, introducing him or her to a fascinating, intriguing cast of slimy buccaneers, dignified scoundrels and dainty heroes and then tugging us all along to a ride riotous with sights, sounds, thrills and spills that never, for once, lets one up. What further makes the book such a delirious delight to read, however, is an unexpected shade of darkness and menace that marks many a page in the narrative. This is due to the man at the helm of this tale - Robert Louis Stevenson, that perceptive, dexterously skilled storyteller with a penchant not only for exciting, suspenseful plotting but, most crucially, a flair at portraying moral complexity which was still a rare sight in most popular adventures of his time. And so, even as we seem to be clear about who are the heroes and who are the villains in this adventure, Stevenson's brilliant staging of the mayhem on the titular island reveals his deception and after that, as the book approaches a startling climax, we are no longer sure as to where our loyalties lie. And whether that lovably malicious Long John Silver can be trusted too.This much, however, one is sure: ""Treasure Island"", packed with action, excitement, dangerous suspense, moments of triumph and also of defeat and also a chocolate-rich flavour of darkness, is truly unforgettable.

In fact, Disney, the producer of Pirates of the Caribbean, did a movie remake of Treasure Island back in 1950. Some believe Disneyland's pirate ride, which opened in 1967, was modeled after the classic Robert Louis Stevenson novel.We all know the story, or at least have heard the names. Vague memories from high school days gone by. The opening chapter is vivid in pirate lore. The bedraggled pirate, Billy Bones, checks into the seaside inn, Admiral Benbow, along with his pirate trunk. He drinks rum, sings ""fifteen men on a dead man's chest"" and befriends the son of the innkeeper, Jim Hawkins. He asks the young boy to let him know immediately if he spies a one-legged man. Soon after, a blind man enters the inn and gives the pirate a piece of paper with a black spot on it, and the pirate then promptly falls over dead. Jim soon discovers a treasure map hidden in the pirate's trunk. Thus begins the adventure to find the lost treasure of Captain Flint.The main character, Long John Silver, is epic. He's the ultimate politician, as he tends to blow with the wind. One never knows who's side he's really on. He's a smooth operator. He'll save your neck one minute, and slice it the next. Like Johnny Depp's role in Pirates, Long John is indeed colorful. His parrot, Flint, sits on his shoulder and squawks ""pieces of eight!"".

64,1407154424,09/08/2018,4.0,"This is one of the classics I meant to catch up on this year. In six parts, it tells the story of Jim Hawkins and his encounter with some pirates. The story begins with a mysterious ""captain"" lodging in the inn of Jim's parents in the first part. We are being told of the man's accentricities as well as fears and we see that he is hunted. He eventually leaves a chest in which Jim finds a map that is supposed to be the map to a great treasure. In the next part, Jim leaves with Dr. Livesy and the Squire to find the afore-mentioned treasure. There is a plot on board their ship, the Hispaniola, and when they are on the island at last (parts three to six), the different factions fight it out and it comes to quite a number of deaths as well as plots and counter-plots.It was a fun adventure that incorporated several plot points highlighting the meaning of certain character traits and decisions, the worth of someone's word, and more. Moreover, it was fun to read about the author's take on piracy as well as on black people (maybe making one a bit uncomfortable, but the book is a witness of time).The writing style was light and fun at times, suspenseful at others, but also quite impactful and as solemn as some of the topics addressed called for.

68,3937215922,04/11/2021,3.0,"Treasure Island was a fun reread for me - I think I first read this in Jr High... about the time it was originally released (or something like that 😀). This is one of those classic books that influenced so many to follow. When I read Bram Stoker’s Dracula I felt similarly. In that story there were so many ideas introduced for the first time that today make up the mythology behind vampires. In Treasure Island, Stevenson brought to the masses many of the ideas that comprise pirate stories. The Black Spot, parrots on the shoulder, x-marks-the-spot, yo ho ho and a bottle of rum. Although some of these ideas were first introduced in other books - Stevenson brought them to the mainstream. And like Dracula... many of these early ideas seem like caricatures nowadays - 120+ years after they were first written down, but at the time they new and fresh and inspired an entire genre.One of the reasons I did a reread of this is that I am watching the series Black Sails. This series is a prequel (of sorts) to Treasure Island in that several of the characters from the book are in that show. This show is about 20 years prior to the events of this story. In addition they have real pirates (from different time periods, but that’s ok) brought together to make an interesting mix of personalities and stories. I guess I didn’t realize this until this reread, but one character - Israel Hands - has the distinction of being both a real pirate as well being a character in Treasure Island. As I’m nearing the end of the series I wanted the book fresh in my mind to see how they leave off the show. I actually expected more overlap with characters, but that’s ok it was still interesting. This story was written for a younger audience and was actually released a chapter at a time in a magazine called ‘Young Folks’ spread across 17 installments from 1881-82. Stevenson was not very well known at the time and actually released the story under the pseudonym of Captain George North.The protagonist- young Jim Hawkins - finds his way - either by his ingenuity or just dumb luck - to outwit the many adults in the story. While some of this stretches believably the situations he gets himself into and out of aren’t totally crazy. When I read this back in 1881... 😀 I mean if I had been a kid reading this back in 1881 I would have been rooting for Jim and anxious for each new installment. Given the fun pace and the time period in which it was written I can see why this adventure story has endured to become one of most influential and recognized pirate stories of all time. 🦜🏝",19,0.9918,0.025,0.855,0.12,0.4047479698950286,POSITIVE,0.9999
69,1805229229,04/04/2017,2.0,"In the words of Italo Calvino, “a classic is a book that has never finished saying what it has to say.” These are stories that have stood the test of time, that communicate a thought or weave a tell that has touched deeply a multitude, and continues to do so decades and centuries after its inception. But that doesn’t mean that every single “classic” work of literature will strike a cord with anyone who picks it up. Unfortunately, this book is now an example of that in my life.I wanted so badly to love Treasure Island. Here is a tale of pirates and buried treasure and gun fights and a young boy named Jim Hawkins who seems to be the center of everything. Here is the origin of Long John Silver, one of the most famous pirates in literature. This novel is one of the ultimate classic adventure stories. And yet, I couldn’t connect with Stevenson’s writing at all. For such a small book, it seemed to drag on forever, with little resolution. I just couldn’t make myself care. Jim Hawkins annoyed me, with his propensity for getting into trouble that somehow ends up saving the day. For a tale of piracy and mutiny, everything Jim “stumbled” into and out of seemed awfully convenient to me. The most three dimensional character in the book was Silver, who I’m pretty sure Stevenson never meant for his readers to like. Every single scene in the book also felt overblown to me, too fraught with emotion compared to the circumstance. I guess it just struck me as overly dramatic, like a literary soap opera from a bygone era.While this story didn’t speak to me, that doesn’t mean it was a bad book. Classics just tend to be hit-or-miss, and though it was a miss for me, I know plenty of people who absolutely loved it. The wonderful thing about books is that we all read them differently.

I was totally blown away by it--the wonderful adventure story filled my head to the brim with a sense of awe and excitement I can't quite explain. Reading this fabulous book makes me connect with the movie even more...The Disney movie called ""Treasure Planet"" instead of ""Treasure Island"". But I will tell you about that later. For now, my summary of Treasure Island.Jim Hawkins lives with his father and mother at the Admiral Benbow Inn, a good life filled with laughter and love. All is going well, until a strange man appears who will untimely change his life, and many others. Robert Louis Stevenson does such a stupendous job describing everything (and everyone) in his book, I just had to write this little excerpt from the book down for you, when Jim meets the man for the first time:I remember him as if it were yesterday. He came plodding to the inn door, his sea chest following behind him in a hand-barrow--a tall, strong, heavy, nut-brown man, his tarry pigtail falling over the shoulder of his soiled blue coat; his hands ragged and scarred, with black, broken nails; and the saber cut across one cheek, a dirty, livid white. I remember him looking round the cove and whistling to himself as he did so and then breaking out in that old sea song that he sang so often afterward while he stayed with us at the Admiral Benbow,""Fifteen men on the Dead's Man Chest--Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!""in the high old tottering voice that seemed to have been turned and broken at the capstan bars. Then he rapped on the door with a bit of stick like a handspike that he carried and, when my father appeared, called roughly for a glass of rum. This, when it was brought to him, he drank slowly, like a connoisseur, lingering on the taste, still looking about him at the cliffs and up at our signboard.This man is Billy Bones. The sea-chest he has holds a very valuable map, (formerly Captain Flint's, now a dead pirate) a map to the ""particulars of Treasure Island"" which many people are after, especially ""the seafaring man with one leg"".Then suddenly Billy is dead and a man called Pew wreaks the inn before Jim had time to react!And with that, the young protagonist of the story is plunged into a bone-rattling adventure beyond him--and, indeed, the reader's--wildest imagining. A hunt for treasure, a race against time....What book could be better? By now I found myself addicted to the escapades of Jim, trying to read at every opportunity. However, before you read this book, I suggest you keep a dictionary by you--or your computer, so you can look words up on Wikapedia. I had to do this on a number of occasions...for the simple reason that many of the words are  nautical terms, and anyone who hasn't spent some time at sea might not know them--No offense to anyone who hasn't spent some time at sea, but still knows them. XD I think you all have gotten my point. Get a dictionary!It was also very fun to match the characters from this fabulous book to the movie, ""Treasure Planet"", an animated version of the book set in space. Except for Jim and his family, all the other original characters re-imagined as aliens because the movie is set in the future.Here are my calculations:Captain Alexander Smollett: the stubborn captain of the Hispaniola (He is on the left)Captain Ameila: Disney changed Captain Alexander Smollett into a woman who is half-cat, but this is okay with me, seeing as Disney always wiggles a female into their movies somehow and, in the book, girls were hardly mentioned. Long John Silver: This is the seafaring man with one leg whom Billy Bones warned Jim of. He is charming, deadly, and has a tendency to change sides; first he was good, then the next minute he was planning mutiny.Disney changed him into a Cyborg, a guy who is half robot. Disney also included a father-son relationship between Jim and Silver, this was not in the book, although it did say, ""he [Silver] made himself the most interesting companion"".Jim Hawkins:This is almost how I imagined him in the book, almost--a young boy thrown into the adventure of a lifetime. He is the person by the top of the picture.However, Disney changes the character of Jim into a troublesome teenager, upset because his dad left and never came back. (In the book his dad died, but obviously Disney omitted that fact to make it more kid-friendly.) Discovering who Israel Hands ( the ship's coxswain and Flint's ex-gunner) was in the movie was very fun, at last I found out that Disney had replaced him with a spider-looking alien. In the book, there was a very exciting scene where Jim was trying to cut the rope anchoring the ship, so it could float away to sea; however, Israel Hands was aboard the ship and he wanted to kill Jim.In the movie version, though, the character of Hands was replaced by a spider-looking alien, and instead of getting the ship, like in the book, Jim had to get the map instead. There were differences like these, but some things in the movie (which I saw first) helped me understand the events in the book. Sometimes the way the pirates spoke in the book was hard to understand, but then I’d recall a line of dialog in the movie and think, ‘Oh, that’s what he meant!’  Okay, this review is done! I was very sorry when the book ended, it was so good. I look forward to reading it again! I enjoyed watching the Disney adaptation, but the book will always remain in my heart as a fantastic adventure to be re-read again and again!

I thought then that Jim's adventures were very exciting and I drove my mother crazy for awhile pretending to be a lady pirate. Anytime I read this I can still hearmy dad acting out the different voices....he was very good as Long John Silver, and to this day I still like the character, even if he is such a rogue.Some years ago I saw for the first time a movie version of Treasure Island with a young Christian Bale as Jim and Charlton Heston as Long John. With a background of music by The Chieftains, this movie quickly became a favorite and I have watched it many many times. Charlton Heston was even better at being Silver than my Dad had been. I loved the way he spoke the phrase 'to be sure': drawling the last word out into half a dozensyllables and dropping his growly voice on the last of them, it sounded deliciously wicked every time.And the point of all this reminiscing? It is that Treasure Island is now a very noisy book for me to read. I hear my Dad first, then I start seeing the movie running as I read, and I hear Heston. And whenever there is a lull in the action or when that action gets hectic, there is the stunning music by The Chieftains.

""... he came plodding to the Inn door, his sea-chest following behind him in a hand barrow -- a tall, strong, heavy, nut-brown man, his tarry pigtail falling over his shoulders of his soiled blue coat, his hands ragged and scarred, with black broken nails, and the sabre cut across one cheek, a dirty livid white."" ""...called roughly for a glass of rum. This, when it was brought to him, he drink slowly, like a connoisseur, lingering on the taste and still looking about him at the Cliffs and up at our sign board.""And, after a few rum and waters Cap'n Bill would sing:""Fifteen men on the dead man's chest--Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!""Cap'n Bill was always on the look out for seafaring men along the road by the Admiral Benbow Inn, and paid Jim a silver fourpenny on the first of every month to watch out for a particular seafaring man with one leg. Hmm. This sounds familiar. A one-legged man. Wonder if might he have a parrot on his shoulder too? Oh, not mentioned as of yet.Some other motley crew mentioned at the beginning are: Black Dog and the Blind man, ""a dreadful looking figure"" as Jim describes.Black spot is spoken of by Cap'n Bill at the beginning of this story and I was baffled – then realized it is a summons of sorts. This came up again towards the end of the story and I believe this has symbolic significance – maybe with the pirates in particular. This is an easy read except for parts of the piratese language, but it gets easier to decipher as you go along. My first episode of vetting a chapter is when Jim was in the apple barrel overhearing Long John Silver giving advice to a sailor. And, this ""language"" is essential to the atmosphere created by Stevenson. Without it, this treasure would be lost.Here is a little more pirate-speak:""See here, now, Hawkins,"" said he, ""here's a blessed hard thing on a man like me, now, ain't it? There's Cap'n Trelawney--what's he think? Here I have this confounded son of a Dutchman sitting in my own house drinking of my own rum!"" Oh, my - rum is mentioned often in this lovely tale, and my mouth watered every time. A good swig of Pyrat while reading this would have been perfect. Need to grab a bottle to have close by for my re-read in a couple of months. ""How that personage haunted my dreams, I need scarcely tell you. On stormy nights, when the wind at the four corners of the house and the surf board along the cove and up the cliffs, I would see him in a thousand forms, and with a thousand diabolical expressions.""""To the Hesitating PurchaserIf sailor tales to sailor tunes, Storm and adventure, heat and cold,If schooners, islands, and maroons, And Buccaneers, and buried gold,And all the old romance, retold Exactly in the ancient way,Can please, as me pleased of old, The wiser youngsters of today:--- So be it, and fall on! If not, If studious youth no longer crave,His ancient appetites forgot,  Kingston, or Ballantyne the brave, Or Cooper of the wood and wave. So be it, also! And may I And all my pirates share the grave Where these and their creations lie!""I can't get enough of the sea. The rollicking, rolling waves crashing against the schooner, crashing against the craggy rocks, the sea breeze slapping about with a fine mist of salt water. Oh the swashbuckling aroma of life on the Hispaniola. What a life of a Pirate. Speaking of pirates, I need to pick up Pirates of the Caribbean next. If I hadn't read Moby Dick, I would not have realized how much I love sea adventures; how much I love reading about a journey to somewhere for something- a whale, a treasure - any adventure! Robert Louis Stevenson is at the top of my favorite authors' list-- right in line with Tolstoy, Melville, and Dickens. Think about it -- Kidnapped, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and Treasure Island? What extraordinary works these are! What a creative genius he was! ",17,0.9986,0.052,0.787,0.161,0.5130889392794156,POSITIVE,0.9113

Though, i DO wish i had read it 1. as a kid and 2. before having literally watched Pirates of the Caribbean 500 times because wow I see where Disney got their story from, but i also know POTC like the back of my hand which made this book a little bit boring. If you like pirates though or know a kid who likes pirates, definitely a good one!",16,0.9781,0.028,0.65,0.322,0.62,NEGATIVE,0.9878
85,1639707447,05/16/2016,5.0,"I should probably be embarrassed that I reached the ripe old age of 43 before reading this book. I didn't even know what it was about, and I don't think I ever watched a movie adaptation of it. I'm not mad, though, because that might be why I enjoyed this book so much. What great fun! Treasure Island is a classic YA novel intended for young boys written by Stevenson, who I am coming to believe might have been a genius. I read The Strange Case of Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde earlier this year and loved it, so I picked this one up with high expectations. The two books are so different in so many ways that I am having a hard time believing they were written by the same author. Jeckyll and Hyde was thick with psychology and character building, but Treasure Island doesn't care one lick about that. Treasure Island is simply an adventure story; there are tons of colorful characters here but we never really learn why the characters are how they are, and we really don't care. With 13 year old Jim as the narrator, the reader gets a peek into the foolish bravado of a young man on a treasure hunt. There are dangerous situations, mutinous pirates everywhere, and a 13 year old who jumps in the thick of it. He tells us many times during his narrative that he is the hero of this story and ends every chapter with a mini-cliffhanger to keep us all wanting more. This book was the origin of everything pop culture knows about pirates: the pirate language, the parrot on the shoulder of the peg-legged Long John Silver, the Dead Man's Chest, X marks the spot on a treasure map, and so many other things. It is also the origin of my new obsession with pirates, even if I am a long way behind everyone else. ",16,0.6064,0.081,0.815,0.105,0.4391672679172679,POSITIVE,0.9998
86,3244396166,03/31/2020,5.0,"Fantastic book, a true adventure, this is one story that stands the test of time, and continues to entertain many people around the world, this book is just as good as the movie (sometimes the books are not as good as the movies) but in this case, this book must be one of the greastest adventures of all time, I am a big fan of the TV series Black Sails, but it was the stroy of treasure Island many years ago that got me interested in the Pirate world. The story as everything, I cannot fault one aspect of it, the book is perfectly written, the story quickly grabs the readers mind/concentration and only releases it once the story is complete, the writters really defines the characters in the novel, giving them each unique characteristics, many have their own agenda. The book is well written, no editorial errors, excellent book cover, the pace of the story is good and allows the reader to absorb the story unfolding in front of them, without feeling over saturated with information. The author demonstrates lots of imagination to produe this book in the era it was written. Years later the story is still a brilliant story to read and is on a par with most modern day adventure books. Loved this book.",17,0.9948,0.029,0.73,0.241,0.607638888888889,POSITIVE,0.9997
