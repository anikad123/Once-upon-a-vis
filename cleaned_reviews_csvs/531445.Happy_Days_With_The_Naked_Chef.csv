0,994470450,07/12/2014,5.0,"This book comes with high quality photos of Jamie's cooking and Jaime and his family. As a photographer-hobbyist, I like the way the photos were blended because it brings the message that cooking as central to a warm family life. There is a centerfold of ""the missus"", a photo of Jamie and his wife sharing a beer and a shot of Jamie's hands cooking, one finger with ring on it. That broke my heart completely. Hahaha! I love the idea too that it comes with a narrative of how best to do things and why instead of blunt directions. . It's a wonderful addition to my small library at home!",2,0.9693,0.024,0.772,0.204,0.51125,POSITIVE,0.9997

The general idea was that when I was at uni I would be able to cook for myself - I went to uni and lived in catered halls. Jamie Oliver uses simple language and the food he is describing look yummy. Now I am living at home, my uses the cook book and the food doesn't just look good anymore, it taste fantastic.",2,0.8269,0.028,0.852,0.12,0.4970238095238095,POSITIVE,0.9995

4,102707873,05/13/2010,3.0,"I haven't looked at the other Jamie's books yet, but I'm definitely going to now. This one has quite a few ideas that I liked in it - baking stuff in foil ""bags"", several easy salad dressings, different variations of bread based on the same basic recipe... What's even more, there is an air of lightness and happiness that this cookbook has about it: nice photographs, laid-back tone of the recipes - it's more like reading a good blog in a paper format than a ""proper"" cookbook. I think it would make a great present for a Jamie's fan, or for someone who is just beginning to cook (like me) and needs some ideas and techniques for inspiration.Why only three stars then, you ask? Well, it might be just my expectations conflicting with reality, but Jamie has A LOT of meat in this book. Basically all the main dishes are based on either meat or fish and virtually every side/veggie dish calls for bacon or panchetta - to spice things up, I guess. And those that don't have bacon have butter or creme fraiche as ingredients. Come to think of it, many have both butter and bacon... Now, I'm not a vegetarian, but I don't think that every.single.meal has to have meat in it. Seriously. And how 'bout trying to reduce fat intake, Jaimie? A more balanced collection of recipes would be nice, but then again, I haven't seen any other of his cookbooks, maybe this is an exception.",0,0.9908,0.021,0.818,0.161,0.4784722222222222,POSITIVE,0.9997
5,1318878,05/19/2007,4.0,"I really enjoyed this cookbook, and use several of the recipies in it as staples inmy family, most notably the chicken in milk and the sweet and sour pot-roated chicken. There are a few recipies that are not worth the effort, such as the rock hen in dough, but overall I' d say it's a lively book which really appeals to my desire for easy, ""fancy"" dishes. I'd say this isn't for some beginners becasue not every ingredient is measured exactly but I don't really think it would be much of a problem. The pot-roasted pork with fennell is AMAZING. The pictures are great, too, as I've always preferred cookbooks with pictures of every dish.",0,0.9767,0.037,0.755,0.208,0.4441666666666666,POSITIVE,0.9995
