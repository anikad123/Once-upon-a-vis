0,3353884557,05/26/2020,,"That was not what I expected.Not that I can define very well what I did expect. I am curious that Ali, after making a splash with this book and writing a few more novels has pretty much disappeared.I supposed I imagined that this book would very strongly a novel of the New Labour era that by now would be well past it's best before date and that it would smell dated and stale. It is dated in that I could see a novelist tackling the same topic might be angrier and there would not be minor touches of optimism like the estate getting a youth centre and the main character's flat finally getting some repairs, (view spoiler)[possibly this 'modern' version I imagine might tie up the Bangladesh and Tower Hamlets stories courtesy of the Bangladesh Awami League  (hide spoiler)].What this is, is a very close portrait of a woman over time, another review mentioned Madame Bovary and Anna Karenina, well yes there is a connection, but that would be a spoiler and in terms of the drive of the story it is only a part of the main character's journey not a decisive (and fatal) hammer blow. Ice Skating and Torvil & Dean are more important ultimately in this story. My sense was that this is much more like a version of The old wives tale, the contrasting lives of two sisters, the adventurous and beautiful Hasina, and her elder sister the dutiful and eager to please Nazneen. The two are brought up in a village in Bangladesh, although at first (view spoiler)[ and that is significant, because this is an evolutionary novel, all about change over time (hide spoiler)] Nazneen, who is married of to an older man and goes with him to London, hankers after that lost world of childhood, Ali is careful not to show us the village as a bucolic idyll. Still it is what Nazneen knew. We learn of Hasina's story through the occasional letters that she sends Nazneen and this is used to advance the story by a few years at one stage.This novel is a great portrayal of London too - not as a teeming, pigeon infested Metropolis with it's sewers full of looming Fatbergs, but as the tight world of a one bedroom flat (later a two bedroom flat) in a shabby council housing estate in Tower Hamlets, when we see; Bishopsgate, Covent Garden or Buckingham Palace they are strange, alien places, other worlds in every sense.I felt also that aside from some jokes, that this was a Victorian novel, the main character is suspiciously reliable, it is mostly scrupulously chronological - flashbacks are clear, there is no whiff of modernism, in literary terms this is a continuation of the novel as Dickens knew it, it is something like David Copperfield, very domestic, starting from the birth running from misery towards non-misery with up's and downs on the way, the wicked Loan Shark - an increasingly elderly Bengali woman with two dim sons as her enforcers, is a Dickensian grotesque as is Nazneen's hapless husband, overweight, with his corns and unheard thesis on white working class racism - though Ali treats him far more tenderly than Dickens' would have, he is something of a Mr Micawber believing that 'something will come up', a promotion, a job, business opportunities - his narrative arc is very (view spoiler)[ sorry for the spoiler (hide spoiler)] similar too. He does get to be the voice of truth and knowledge, despite being a ridiculous and often silly figure in the novel.And then there are jokes (view spoiler)[ ok, not particularly funny ones (hide spoiler)], Nazneen's husband works for Mr Dalloway but is never invited round to his house for the barbecue hosted by his wife, there is a Dr Azad, like his namesake in A Passage to India ashamed of his own house (view spoiler)[ this novel could have been called  A Passage to England - it is very largely Forster's book turned inside out (view spoiler)[ but I am just showering you with spoilers here (hide spoiler)] (hide spoiler)].Clothes are a nice feature of this novel both as character or character's statements of allegiance and outlook. Certainly a good, solid novel, it may not turn your life upside down or keep you awake at night, but is very nicely done.",45,0.9965,0.061,0.782,0.157,0.5080228847834483,NEGATIVE,0.9997

2,806742433,12/31/2013,4.0,"There's a good reason that Brick Lane was short-listed for the Man Booker award, and was nominated for a whole slew of other prizes too. It is just brilliant. That doesn't mean that it is necessarily fun to read. (A 16 year old Bangladeshi girl is married off to a 40 year old guy in London, and goes there to start a new life in almost poverty. No, not exactly a ""fun"" topic…) However, the descriptions are brilliant, and the story itself is mesmerizing. The subplots are rich and believable. You really feel like you've learned a lot about what it means to be a Blangladeshi immigrant to the UK.However, it does a lot more, namely it urges the reader to think about:* The imposition of passivity on a woman, to the point of making passivity a virtue, something that certainly transcends cultures and limits self-expectations (a theme throughout the book is the main character being left to her Fate at birth)* The experience of any immigrant, and the complex attitudes that the immigrant experience generates both towards the new culture and the old* The deplorable status of women in Bangladesh* The wrenching realization that one is married to an idiot* The nature of marriage itself* The hypocrites that exist in any culture and religion (very ironic that the shameless usurer in the book is named Mrs. Islam)* The way that living in a specific slice of history influences one's opinions and valuesAlthough this book is rather long, the author probably needed the length to address her varied themes. It's a serious book, but often hilarious. It's uplifting, because it speaks of women's empowerment.

4,1428668434,10/29/2015,3.0,"I thought this book was really interesting as it gave an insight into being an immigrant in England and it also gave insights into life in Bangladesh. Of course, Monica Ali has been scrutinised because she doesn't speak fluent Bangladeshi etc and I know nothing about the being an immigrant myself but I felt like the representation she gave felt really authentic. I thought the characters were brilliant. They were really interesting and I felt like nearly every one of them added to the story. They weren't just devices to the main character, in fact, I would say Nazneen was sort of like a device for them to be portrayed. Nazneen was a silent observer. The amount of things she observed was unreal. Even if a character didn't say much, Nazneen observed what they were doing physically and that gave us such an insight into characters. I feel like Nazneen was the way she was because Ali wanted her that way. I thought Nazneen's inner-monologue was similar to that of a third person narration that sees all. The story was kind of slow but for good reason. Nothing thrilling or exciting happened and that's because it mainly focused on a family. So because of that the pacing was sometimes unbearable but I can understand why. I actually liked the ending a lot. I think it ends with a bit of hope and maybe that's a bit of a cop-out but I'm a sucker for hopeful endings. I would recommend this book to people who think that they'll enjoy it but just be aware it's quite slow. I would probably read another book by Monica Ali.

5,3936613227,04/10/2021,,"So I read this because I felt I should have read it – which is not an ideal way to read a book, and that’s on me.But I think maybe … it hasn’t aged so well? It feels like the kind of book that would be shortlisted for the Booker circa 2003. And, to be fair, I think that says more about the kind of books a white British audience wants to read about non-white British people than about non-white British people themselves or, indeed, non-white British authors. So the deal here is that the novel takes place between 1985 and 2002. It’s mostly set on an imaginary council estate near Tower Hamlets and mostly centres on Nazneen—a virgin bride sent to London from a Bangladeshi village to marry Chanu, an older and self-described ‘educated’ man desperate to establish himself in the UK. Something he singularly and persistently fails to do, through a combination of, uh, what I assume is institutionalised racism and also just, um, being a loser? Hard to entangle that one for sure. Later she has an affair with Karim, a second-generation immigrant, somewhat younger than Nazneen herself, who is radicalised after 9/11 and later vanishes. Finally Nazneen pushes back against her life of submission and decides to stay in London with her daughters following her husband’s decision to return to Bangladesh.I am having a really hard time to sorting out my thoughts on this one, while also sensible of the fact that it’s not really my place to dig into what this book does or was trying to do. While the character work is really intricate, especially when it comes to Nanzeen and her husband, and does pay off at the end it takes a long time to get there. And a lot of that time is spent essentially trapped in the council flat with Nanzeen which is narratively stifling. As, I guess, it’s supposed to be? There’s also long sections of the book which take the form as letters from Nanzeen’s sister—her scandalous flight from the small village where she and Nanzeen were born precipitated Nanzeen being sent to London—and while I appreciated Hasina’s importance to Nanzeen I did find this sections hard to get through. They didn’t feel fully integrated into the novel’s structure but given the very different paths of Nanzeen and Hasina’s lives, this probably deliberate.More complicated still—and even more beyond the scope of what it’s appropriate for me to talk about—I couldn’t help but feel the characters occasionally came perilously close to falling into “types” that spoke more to, well, white British stereotypes of the immigrant experience? I mean, the silent, submissive Bangladeshi wife? The husband who is full of goals and lofty talk, but has nothing to show for it? The radicalised youth who sees Nanzeen as “untainted” by the west. I just don’t know. And this is why I’m inclined to feel the novel hasn’t aged so well. Obviously I don’t get to say what stories get to be told, nor who gets to tell them but it’s very difficult for me to see, perhaps, what this book might say to a British Bangladeshi reader in 2021. I’m not quite sure what it says to me as a random white person either. Also, for a novel called Brick Lane, I found it surprisingly lacking in sense of place. But since alienation is one of the major themes of the novel, maybe that too is necessary?I did appreciate the writing here, though. And I’m glad the read the book. I feel singularly incapable of engaging with it usefully though.",23,0.973,0.055,0.858,0.088,0.4098952641165755,NEGATIVE,0.9997
6,743526518,10/17/2013,4.0,"I did enjoy this novel; it goes at a good pace and there is a warmth about it that I appreciated. The structure of the novel is interesting. Nazneen is born in a village in Bangladesh; when old enough she is married to Chanu, a much older man who lives in England. She goes to England as a bride in her teens in 1985. The story follows her over the next years (until 2002) as she has children and mixes with the Bangladeshi community around Brick Lane. The novel also cuts to her sister Hasina back in Bangladesh periodically. There are memorable characters in the Bangladeshi community, each coping with being in a strange culture in different ways; some by blending in others by keeping apart.Nazneen’s husband Chanu turns out to be a decent man (he doesn’t beat her); he wants a simple village girl to look after him and doesn’t allow Nazneen to learn English, as she doesn’t need it. The novel is tragic and comic, although the comedy is restrained, it is still there. Ali describes physicality very well; you do get a sense of the characters by the descriptions of physical habits and tics, by the way they wear their clothes, fiddle with their hair and so on.Nazneen develops as the novel goes on and gradually one gets a sense of her becoming rounded as an individual, liberated almost. There are also grand themes; religion and its relation to culture, characters cut off from their origins and adrift in a foreign land, adultery, poverty, family tensions; all the stuff of everyday life and high drama. There are correlations with Madame Bovary and Anna Karenina. It is about how much control we have over our lives; can you go back to a dream? It isn’t a simple clash of cultures; it is more nuanced; even Karim, a devout Muslim, is a complex and interesting character. Brick Lane is also a novel about place and the geographical restriction of Nazneen’s life adds to the power of her character development.

Having lived the immigrant, foreigner, displaced person lifestyle for so long, I wanted this book to capture everything that it means to have lost links with my own personal history in the effort to fit into the culture that's welcomed me into it's monied bosom. But Nazneen is not me. She's a village girl without education and more importantly, the confidence education brings to a traveller navigating a foreign world.I snacked with her in the dead of night, desperate to fill a void opened when I left my home and all things familiar. But when she wandered into meeting of revolutionaries looking for acceptance, I stood at the door and wondered whether she had left her brain at home. And really, why are her sister's letters from home so poorly written. I've never seen a native speaker butcher her own language to the point of becoming incomprehensible as brutally as Hasina does. Of course I worry about the poor girl struggling to face the fate she foolishly chose for herself, but must she do it in such a jarring manner. I wish I hadn't bother to finish the book.

Don’t ask me what I was expecting because it is not a definable quantity and defies explanation but when I bought this book on a whim because I liked the juxtaposition of white background and colourful printed letters, this was not it.Ali has created a book for those who love the microscopic and want a very detailed picture of a very limited section of space and time. Hold on you might say, this book moves from 1985 and Nazneen’s arrival in England all the way up to and beyond 9/11 so how can that be microscopic. That’s a good 15 years plus some. Yes, it does cover this ground but it covers this ground in the same way that Bill and Ted covered all the major periods of history in their righteous phone box. By jumping about a lot with no real overall picture. But anyway it’s obvious that Monica Ali did not set out to create a worldly overview. Instead it is and was always about Nazneen. And it is through the eyes of Nazneen and her sisters epistles that the story is told. What’s the story? Primarily that life as a bride in an arranged marriage, on a council estate in a country where you don’t speak the language and hold no currency (I think I may have accidentally started quoting a Paul Simon song but never mind), is going to be largely devoid of joy. And it is up to a point. However the other side of the coin is that joy can be found in the most unpromising of places and under surprising circumstances and that just because your life is one way, does not mean it always has to be so. The power of change lies within you. Shocked? Really, you’re not? I wasn’t either but hey, it’s part of the story so it has to go in the review.The cast of characters who are fully fleshed out are fairly limited; Nazneen, her husband Chanu and their two daughters Shahana and Bibi are all well developed -you might find them dull, but that’s another issue. Karim is an object of lust with eminently describable forearms and mercurial dress sense and the usurer Mrs Islam, friendly Razia, and unemotional Dr Azad are all quite memorable.For me, youngest daughter Bibi was the stand-out character (she is the reason for the third star). She doesn’t say anything - well maybe a couple of lines but Monica Ali imbued her with a sense of personality purely through the descriptions of her physical stance, her hair-chewing proclivities and her general watchfulness that gave me a greater sense of her motivations and personality than all of Chanu’s chatter or Mrs Islam’s outrageous theatrics. If you want a big story where a lot happens then you need to walk away from this book immediately or be endlessly annoyed.

Her younger sister Hasina runs away to marry the young man she is in love with, and not long after that, when she is eighteen, Nazneen is married to a man twenty years older than her and sent to live with him in London.Her husband, Chanu, is kind and very talkative. They live in a dingy flat on an estate where she makes friends with some other Bangladeshi women. Her world is narrow and small, consisting of the flat and Brick Lane, where she walks one step behind her husband. She is not encouraged to learn English, or even leave the estate. But gradually she moves more and more into the world outside, though all that she knows is what Chanu tells her - and he ""is an educated man"", as he is constantly saying. They have three children, two girls after the first little boy dies, and some twelve years after she arrived in England she is swept up in an affair with a young man, Karim. Slowly, so slowly, she begins to speak for herself, but always there is this need to be a good, dutiful wife. To cut the skin around the corns on her husband's feet, to cook and keep the flat tidy, to be Chanu's audience as he lectures, to watch as his plans and ambitions fall flat one by one.The story is told from Nazneen's perspective, sliced through with letters from her sister in Dhaka, whose story is easily more tragic. Nazneen, quiet and unknowledgable, is like a blank canvass for the opinions and impressions of others. When she asks a direct question, rarely is it answered. We see her world, small as it is though at times shaken by greater deeds (like nine-eleven), through her watchful, patient eyes. Many things are shown rather than told, making the real situation easily discernible and very rich and layered.It is beautifully, skilfully written. A bit slow maybe, but with great impact. I can't deny that it didn't affect me, and bring me down a bit at times. The story slips into a secret place, shines a light on a place generally ignored and dismissed and undervalued: the housewife's domain and life. The politics, the aspirations, the hatred against Muslims, the clash of cultures and struggle to assimilate without abandoning your own culture, it's all there. But through it all there is strength in these women, and determination. The struggle Nazneen goes through, with her own conscience, her own desires and wants so long put aside, her fondness for the often revolting - but not cruel, no, he never beats her - Chanu (a surprisingly sympathetic character, in that it's easy to feel sorry for him), while gang wars and drug abuse and abusive husbands play out in both England and Bangladesh, all creates a vivid portrayal of an immigrant experience common to London, Paris, Sydney, Toronto. Relevant, topical, at times heartarchingly sad, Brick Lane is like Nazneen, watching silently, presenting a story without spoken judgement, biding its time, and at the end, so very very rewarding.",15,0.9924,0.079,0.768,0.152,0.5209201388888889,POSITIVE,0.9997
11,2361872408,04/18/2018,5.0,"Monica Ali is able to capture  the sense of discombobulation felt by both both first generation immigrants; whether it is the Shakespeare-loving Chanu, who on the one hand sees himself as a lover of English literature, a sensitive, educated and artistically minded man who missed his calling as the Private Secretary to the Prime Minister, but on the hand deeply feels the deep-seated prejudices he experiences in Britain and begins to hate the modernity taking over the country, a kind of walking contradiction he harks after an idyllic British past which never existed, yet resents the Westernisation of a Bengali culture which he, outside a love of Tagore, he is never really a part on.  On the other hand is his wife Nazneen, or whom marriage at first is a kind of trap-for all his profession for being a liberal, Chanu represents some of the worst aspects of misogyny of  first generation Bangladeshi immigrants; rarely allowed to leave the house, not given permission to be educated, Nazneen feels trapped in a country she not only cannot, but is not allowed to comprehend. On top of this she feels emotionally stifled by becoming a sounding board for Chanu's frequently sententious rambles which she is unable to fully comprehend. Gradually she is able to gain a sense of self, culminating in an affair with the energetic if somewhat mediocre Karim; this acts as a catalyst for her self-actualisation, that she is able to, for the first time in her life, treated as a fully rounded human being and able to experience emotions outside the sense of obedience expected of her, that she is no longer just a daughter, wife or sister but a woman with her own sense of independence. Naturally, like her early attempts at marital rebellion when Chanu rejects her request for her sister to move to England, her affair goes un-noticed by her husband who meanders through life labouring under a series of illusions, blind to what is going on around him. It is difficult to describe the relationship which exists between the two, Chanu, despite the bluster and blindness seems to genuinely care for Nazneen, likewise Nazneen, despite the occasional sense of disgust she feels for him, seems to value the innate sense of kindness in Chanu, the sense of comfort he brings. In many ways Ali describes the emotions which marriages, especially arranged ones, often bring; comfort and convenience. The secondary characters who inhabit the novel, from Chanu and Nazneen's daughters Shahana and Bibi to Mrs Islam help add depth to the novel-most of the secondary characters represent an important part of the immigrant experience, whether it be clashes with narrow-minded nationalists or acclimatising to life as a second-generation Bangladeshi girl in London, 'Brick Lane' is a nuanced and well-written depiction of two generations of a Bangladeshi family in a fast-changing world. ",14,0.9072,0.089,0.795,0.116,0.5218085106382979,POSITIVE,0.8912

I wanted to love it, it’s been compared to White Teeth by Zadie Smith which is one of my all time faves, but I thought it lacked the vibrancy and liveliness of White Teeth, despite both of them portraying the lives of immigrants in London..Brick Lane follows Nazneen, a Bangladeshi woman who moves to London for an arranged marriage. I think the slowness of the book comes from the passivity of Nazneen, as she doesn’t really do much for much of the first half. Her husband, Chanu, is such an interesting character though. He is tragic, annoying, inspiring, and hilarious all at once, and I really felt for him trying to find an outlet for his passions in a system where he doesn’t feel appreciated!.My favourite parts of the book were the passages describing anecdotes from Nazneen’s childhood in Bangladesh - I wish there were more of them! The letters from Hasina, Nazneen’s sister, were also interesting (not to mention heartbreaking) but the extremely stilted English that they’re written in is off-putting and tiresome to read. It seemed to me that the first batch were written far better than all the others - her writing seemed to deteriorate, I thought it was inconsistent..Overall, plenty of compelling parts, such as Nazneen’s friend Razia’s struggle with her wayward son, but too many dry patches that dragged, and a romantic subplot that I didn’t care for.

15,3359707723,05/27/2020,3.0,"Monica Ali's ""Brick Lane""This lengthy and ambitious first novel explores, with indifferent success, the lives of Bangladeshi immigrants to London and the growth in independence and modification of culture of a young Bangladeshi woman.The heroine of the book is Nazneen who at the age of 20 enters an arranged marriage with Chanu, age 40, a Banladeshi struggling to establish himself in London. Chanu is striving for a promotion, is proud of his attempts to secure education, and is portrayed at the outset of the book as rather vain and foolish. Bangladeshi society and traditional Islamic practices are patriarchal by western lights, and much is made of this throughout the book. Nanzeen and Chanu have a son, who dies as an infant, and two daughters Shahana and Bibi. Mid-way in the book, with her growth in independence and awareness of her physical and emotional needs, Nanzeen takes a lover, a young man and would-be Islamic radical named Karim. Nanzeen has a beautiful younger sister, Hasina, who remains in Bangladesh, and writes many letters to her sister in a broken English about the course of her life and its hardships.The book gives a portrait of life of the Bangladeshi immigrant community in London. I had no prior knowledge of this community. It describes how the immigrants lived in cramped living conditions in the poorer sections of town with up to ten people per room trying to support themselves in a culture utterly foreign to most of them. Some of the people work at assimilation while others try to retain their religious and Bangladeshi identity. Drugs and violence come to plague the community and, of course, the open sexual mores of modern London prove irresistible to many. The community is shown as divided in its response to the terrorism that has come to dominate world news in recent years.There are a host of well-drawn secondary characters in this novel, including the loan-shark, Mrs. Islam, Nanzeen's lover, named Karim, a friend of Chanu named Dr. Azad, and Razia, a friend of Nanzeen. These characters give weight and texture to the novel and partly succeed in bringing it to life.The book focuses on Nanzeen's development, and the parallel development of Hasina, as it involves Nanzeen's husband, her lover, and, ultimately her independence. It also centers upon Chanu's and Nanzeen's differing desires in terms of returning to Bangladesh.I was intrigued by the excellence of the 100-some discussions by my fellow Amazon reviewers and by the wide divergence of considered responses to this book. Reading the reviews helped me focus upon my own response to the book. Many reviewers found this novel an outstanding first attempt to describe the immigrant experience of the Bangladeshis and the personal growth of the heroine. Other readers found the novel vastly overpraised, difficult, and trite. There is something to be said for both views, but on the whole I agree with the latter opinion. I was happy to have it reinforced by a substantial group of fellow reviewers.The book does portray eloquently the difficulties of the Bangladeshi immigrant community and provokes reflection on how many individuals, in immigrating to a new land, respond to the various choices of assimilation on the one hand and remaining deeply attached to one's initial identity on the other hand. Some of the characters in this book are convincingly drawn. But these are largely the secondary characters, such as Mrs. Islam and Dr. Azad, and also, surprisingly enough, Chanu, Nanzeen's husband.The problems with this book far outweigh its virtues. To begin with, I found it far too long, too slow, and, in many places, dull. It was an unrelieved chore to finish this book. The long sections of letters to Nazneen from her sister Hasina break up the story are difficult to read and detract much more than they add.Equally important, the character on whom Ms. Ali lavishes most of her attention, Nazneen, is trite and unconvincing. I don't think we need another long novel to inform the reader that traditional Islamic society is patriarchal. At times, both at the beginning and at the end of the story, the book does little more than that. Portions of the Nanzeen's development show more depth, as Nanzeen learns of her sexuality and also stands up to Mrs. Islam. But the main theme of the book is predictable and boring and has been done many times in many other contexts.While Nazneen's development shows predictable stereotyping, the author, possibly in spite of herself does a better job with Chanu who for all his faults is a complexly drawn human being deserving of compassion and, perhaps, of a better fate.Thus, in spite of some good moments, I cannot recommend this book due to its length and structure and due to its stereotyped plot line and heroine. I found it worthwhile to review the comments of my fellow reviewers and to offer my own comments here.Robin Friedman",10,0.9887,0.07,0.811,0.119,0.5049353109012199,POSITIVE,0.9878
16,1597307263,04/01/2016,5.0,"Loved this book. The author makes the everyday and often sorrowful events of this woman's life poetic. It is about ordinary life, struggles, hardships, conflicts of faith, duty and culture, and yet for all that it is also beautiful... Giving the details of the good in life which comes with the bad... Showing Nazneen's love for her children, her understanding of god and faith, her sister's search for the life she wants... and although it wasn't always easy to read, it was captivating. The world of Nazneen came alive with scents... The lime, the spices, the earth and the rain. And I found myself oddly sorry for Chanu, Nazneen's husband who strives and strives to be known as an educated man, and yet never manages to achieve the dreams he has. Surrounded by his certificates, and never really seeing that his wife is so much more than the ""simple village girl"" he married, Chanu is as easy to sympathize with , for me, as he was to dislike. His arrogance and inability to see anything beyond his own wishes are so easy to dislike, and yet he fails so many times to become the man he dreams of being that I cannot help but feel for him. To create characters as complex as Chanu and Nazneen, not to mention the host of others, (Mrs Islam being rather like a Dickensian baddie to me) is truly a sign of great talent. Its the kind of book which demands you pay attention, miss one sentence and you miss a huge part of the story. Its a keeper, going on the book shelf to be read again and again.

17,64892906,07/25/2009,4.0,"Brick Lane  is an interesting book. The central character, Nazneen is totally passive, almost too passive. It should be noted, however, that Monica Ali does a good job of setting up that passivity. From the very first page of the book, the reader is shown and told that Nazneen is passive, that she was raised to leave things to fate.The problem with the passiveness of the central character is that it can make the book insufferable, you want her to do. It is here that I have to give Ali points. The bulk of the novel is told though the eyes of Nazneen and when it is not Nazneen we are hearing, it is her sister. Because of these characters and how they were raised, the reader must puzzle things out because the woman are silent on such issues. For instance, what exactly happened to Hasina when she left her first husband. Hasina never directly tells us, but an attentive reader knows. The same is true about Nazneen. It seems that though a good portion of the book Nazneen is heavily depressed. In fact, Ali does a very good job of conveying this, from the state of the house to the state of the food to relationships. This book thrives on the main characters not saying things, and having small details speak. Its interesting, and something I did not find annoying. In many ways, the book is about what takes place in silence.Ali could also make Nazneen's husband Chanu into a brute of a man, but she doesn't. In fact, Chanu is a sympathetic and believable character. When Nazneen hurts him, we feel his pain even though we can understand why Nazneen chose to do what she did. I'm not sure how accurately the book captures the London immigrant's experience, but it does display a good sense of time and space.",9,0.9426,0.055,0.835,0.111,0.5063293650793651,POSITIVE,0.8483

19,836390783,02/16/2022,3.0,"I read this in 2022, ahead of the forthcoming  Love Marriage , and it’s difficult not to compare the book to other novels which centre on the immigrant experience in Europe/America.  Dominicana  by Angie Cruz was listed for the Women’s Prize in 2019 and Americana  by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie in 2013 also listed for the Womens (Orange) prize. Brick Lane was my least favourite of the three but it was written over a decade before both the others and hence allowance should be made. Interestingly the importance of home work and sewing is important in both Brick Lane and Dominicana, and both books share this claustrophobic feel with Rohinton Mistry’s  A Fine Balance The Brick Lane community borders the east end of London, and the high rise City financial district. This is where the Bangladeshi community established itself, and the contemporary setting is apparent as the global outrage occasioned by the 9/11 airplane suicide crashes in New York take place at this time.The leading character is Nazneen, and while she provides the core around which the other characters float, she is one of the least striking characters, something that diminishes the book.Her sister, Hasina, lives an altogether more dramatic life, and her progress is relayed to London in a series of letters.Highlights & Lowlights The book concentrates on a typically delineated local community and its the characters that make or break it. Nazneen is a disappointment, and her sister Zahira, who we get to know exclusively through a series of letters, is also uninspiring. By contrast, Nazneen’s much older husband Chanu continues to interest. His early belief in the power of a (mostly western) education underpins his sense that he is destined for greater things. The realisation that he is likely to be thwarted is not for the lack of trying. From mobile libraries to chair restoration Chanu is the entrepreneur who lacks the street-wise charm to move others. Two of the best on going riffs in the book revolve around him. He is a man whose corns and calluses are in constant need of attention; dutifully managed by Nazreen. Chanu’s interaction with the local GP, Dr. Azad ( ”He puts his nose inside a book because the smell of real life offends him” ) is superb as their mutual delusion includes an impromptu dinner party as the guest, Chanu presses his claim to extend his social acceptability. “From time to time their conversational paths intersected. More frequently they walked around one another.” ( 204). I found it telling that my interest peaked in passages involving Chanu, an older, ostensibly unattractive man physically, but my interest waned when Karim, a younger, ostensibly more dynamic representative of the younger generation was centre stge.Historical contextBrick Lane was published in 2003 and memories and images of the 9/11 attack on America were fresh in the mind. Closer to home rioting in the north of England, in Oldham, were being played out on the television. The younger generation in Brick Lane try to come together to articulate their anger and frustration at the interpretation of global events. Meetings are convened to speak as one voice grass roots movements try to find leading voices even as the nascent activism breaks up into smaller factions.ThemesI work close to Brick Lane, and the area in 2022 is, I suspect, a far cry from the environs described by Monica Ali. It still has a local and unique feel, but not an exclusive one. Brick Lane today, from the refurbished Truman Brewery to the wine bars of Aldgate, it is no longer simply a destination boasting a multiplicity of curry houses. The author herself is an example of a Dhaka born Bangladeshi who life and career are indicative of ‘proper’ integration (of the sort that Chanu aspired towards). Ali still lives in London, but a different part. Her education, career and marriage are all indicative of the changing times of the last twenty years.Since the publication of Brick Lane Banglashi members of the London community have acceded to important and influential positions in the area.• Lutfur Rahman – Community activist and Independent politician. From 2010 to 2015, he was the first directly elected mayor of Tower Hamlets and the first Bangladeshi leader of the council. • Rushanara Ali MP – Labour Party Member of Parliament for Bethnal Green and Bow constituency. She became the first person of Bangladeshi origin to be elected to the House of Commons and one of the first three Muslim women to be elected as a Member of Parliament.This would seem to prove that while newly arrived immigrants struggle for acceptance, the next generation, British born, are able to achieve great things. If you check out “British Bangladeshi Power and Inspiration 100” the range of Bangladeshi luminaries is impressive (it includes Nadya Hussein of Bake Off fame).This is in contrast to what Chanu describes as the “The immigrant tragedy” of Razia’s husband:  “in his heart he never left the village” I’m glad to have read Brick Lane and it has set me up for the latest Monica Ali novel. To a certain extent it seems a bit dated, and in context that may be a good thing.",8,0.9962,0.058,0.819,0.123,0.4091851983632806,POSITIVE,0.5625

Ignoring the outwardly prejudiced attitude towards Sylhetis by a Dhaka-born writer, Ali chose to further insult the protagonist's culture by allowing the Sylheti community (within the book) to ostensibly reveal these negative stereotypes creating a sense of collective self-hatred. Another plot hole I found was the ""broken English"" within her sister's letters - the protagonist moved to England and can only say two words in English but her sister, who did not once leave Bangladesh and experienced an array of upheaval, can write well in English asides from the improper sentence structures? It didn't make sense to me. If it was the letter translated from Bengali, there was really no need to make the translation sound ""broken"". It made reading the letters seem disingenuous and irritating to follow. The protagonist herself was entirely too passive to be able to pass off as a metaphor and lastly, her writing style was completely dull. The death of her own child was shown completely blank without emotion (unintentionally).

But I found the main character of Brick Lane, Nazneen, to be very relatable, to the point where I ended up totally immersed in her story and her perspective. That was a pretty heart-wrenching experience, honestly, because Nazneen's story is one of disappointment and fear and powerlessness, right up until just before the very end.

Three lines in the book captures the sense of belonging or lack of belonging, that is the main takeaway: And most of all she thought of what he (Karim, a politically active young man, son of Bangladeshi immigrants) had that she and Hasina (her sister back in Bangladesh) and Chanu (Nazneen's husband) sought but could not find. The thing that he had and inhabited so easily. A place in the world.There is also attention to the trials of marriage, perhaps particularly an arranged one, to a basically good but ineffective, flawed man: Nazneen heard Chanu suppress a belch. She wanted to go over to him and stroke his forehead. She wanted to get up from the table and walk out of the door and never see him again.Humor is low key and wry: ""The cigarette."" It had rolled from the table and was burning on the green-and-purple rug. ""Shit. Your rug is spoiled."" ""I don't know, said Nazneen. "" if a rug is already green and purple, it is very hard to say that it is spoiled."" And: Three dealers were arrested. Job opportunities opened up.I don't know Brick Lane in London, but there is a sense that this does a good job of capturing Bangladeshi immigrant life there.

It details the world she finds, the mix of cultures she encounters, the family she raises and the affair she embarks on with a much younger radical. The passion of their romance is incredibly well written, with the confusion a housewife being consumed by feelings she’d never had before tangible on the page. Similarly well done are the scenes detailing the rising ethnic tension, with the riot scene being particularly excellent.However, the reason this only gets three stars is that I never thought the characters raised themselves about caricature level. The husband doesn’t seem to develop at all over the years we know him, while the young lover never seems fully formed at all. As such, despite all the passion of the prose, it’s hard to really care about this eternal triangle.For all its good points, the lack of convincing characters to empathise with means that it’s like looking through a window (or into a snow globe, a recurring motif in the book) and being entranced by the world you find there but never fully engaging with it.",4,0.9846,0.057,0.798,0.145,0.4846666666666666,NEGATIVE,0.6751

It is rather a book with its roots in emotion (which all intelligent novels are), in the sense that it examines the thoughts and soul of a largely uneducated (important: that is not necessarily a negative quality, oh no!) woman born (literally) and taught above all to endure her fate at the hands of what the world labels intellectual men. (Nazneen's: ""Let's see what happens!"" is a leitmotif and kind of signalling buoy floating over the ocean of her endurance (not ""passivity"" – it's all going on inside her!). It is about the depths of her obedience, servitude and endless patience and subjugation to ""Fate"" that finally blossom into a realisation that she can and must have more control over events and her life – if only for her children.Any book is going to be read in different ways by different people. We all have agendas, and we like reading books that match them. Sometimes we even twist them around to suit our agendas. My reading of this book was of a very sensitive portrayal of what it's like to be a Muslim in a poor part of London, to experience (an arranged) marriage (the topic of arranged versus love marriage is also looked at), to dedicate one's life to the wills of others... but above all to be a woman; suffering loss, confusion and change – and finally triumph and emerge from that as a fuller adult.But enough analysis: it was for me above all a deeply moving story, well told.Two quotes from the book stuck out for me. The first one deals with an idea – the idea of regret and of not breaking out of thought and intentions and into action. Interestingly, it is spoken by Chanu, the man of ideas who suddenly realises how worthless his life has been (and, by contrast, how rich Nazneen's is going to be, since once she is freed to act, she will not waste her time in pompous, empty theory). This is what he says (to Karim): "" 'Anything is possible [as a young man] so everything I wanted was possible', Chanu went on, 'But what about all the other possibilities? The ones we never see when we are young, but are there all along. One day you wake up and say to yourself,  I didn't choose this. And then you spend a long time thinking, but did I?'""And the other one deals with an emotion, and I choose it to illustrate why I think Monica Ali is a very gifted writer. It's a beautiful metaphor that does what a metaphor should do: paint a picture of an idea with words that is more powerful than a simple statement. A mini parable; an image that stays with you. It describes a moment in the relationship between the close friends Nazreen and Razia, who suddenly find themselves unable to share secrets:""With all those secrets between them, how easy it was to talk. Talk flowed like the Meghna: the fast-flowing gush of new gossip; the hiss and splash of their various moans and complaints; disturbances around the rocks of the more serious stuff, always family; a widening and a narrowing, running deep and coming shallow; even in silent stretches the currents between them never stopped and the whole vast outpouring tumbled endlessly into the sea of their friendship. And now the river met a dam, built out of truth and knowledge and need. These things had stopped up their mouths."" Talk between two people as a river that flows into the ocean of their friendship. What a beautiful metaphor! And the meticulous detail with which the image is painted! For me, anyone that can craft a paragraph like that one is a gifted writer, a very gifted one, in fact.A beautiful story, well told. That's what we all want in a novel, surely? But, of course, we don't all find it in the same novel, do we? That would be boring – and a denial of our valuable and socially fruitful individualities!",3,0.9971,0.056,0.804,0.14,0.593443362193362,POSITIVE,0.997
41,243253424,12/05/2011,4.0,"I really would give this a 3.5 but thought it deserved rounding up rather than down. This is a very clever book on several levels. The writing is superb, particular Ali powers of description. She can describe a character in such comical detail you feel you are standing right in front of themThe story is told through the eyes of Nasreem, a young village girl from Bangladesh who has been married to an Immigrant in London.Also to a lesser degree by her sister who still lives in a city in Bangladesh and struggles with her fate albiet with an optimism that defies her circumstances and a trust in all she meets that they don't deserve. We feel Nasreem's irritation with her rather boring husband and we share her embarresment at his social faux pas.We feel her increasing depression and helplessness and her sense of accepting life as it is.The great skill in this story is the way we can share Nasreems feelings but as the reader our view is broader Monics Ali expects the reader to read between the lines.Throughoutt the book she leaves enough clues as to whats really going on but its never actually mentioned in the text.WE the readers know her mother committed suicide long before Nasreem did, we knew that her Father was unfaithful. We know that Nasreem herself and her husband suffer from depression , that Hasina 's land lord would eventually want more than rent from her and that her husband was beating her before she ran away.We know that Hasinas factory friends are not the"" sisters "" she describes them as and we desperately want to warn her.As someone who has suffered from depression most of my life this book is a remarkable desciption of the many ways it can effect peaple. I can relate to the growing mess in the flat, to the midnight eating,to the utter lack of ability to think or plan or do, like a brain paralysis.I think now I may have talked myself into thinking Brick Lane deserves a four anyway. I dropped one point because I did need to take a break now and again. I wasn't bored but I needed to back of a bit as it could be hard going. I dropped a half because of the ending! The ending left me feeling a little sad and with an overwhelming feeling of waste.The wise doctor , near the end of the novel tells Nasreem he has realised there are two kinds of love: the kind that is all consuming and passionate and then ends [like the love between her and Karim] and the kind that gets added to day by day and little by little and grows bigger and deeper as the years pass[ like her marriage to Chanu] Just as Nasreem feels she can tell Chanu she loves him and just as she can see his gentle caring nature above the little irritations ,they must separate. And just as the children are getting on with their father so much better and Nasreem realises she doesn't in actual fact want to be with Karim , the family, which is a family for the first time, is split up. What a waste! This is probably how I am meant to feel however . After all, Monika Ali has managed to manipulate my feelings throughout the book, and she does give some signs of hope for the future. Chanu may come back, they will go there on holiday and the skating at the end which has always been Nasreems dream and a symbol of people in control of their lives. If you like lots of action and excitment in your novels this is not for you. But if you appreciate great characters and description that lures you in and plays with your emotions then I reccomend it.",3,0.9971,0.094,0.719,0.186,0.5024784182678921,POSITIVE,0.9992

Our protagonist Nazneen who is left to her fate from the very birth is pictured, transformed and described beautifully.Why I like this book:>> Narration is tremendous and funny; also very very intricate.>> All the characters are drawn with utmost care and every single negligible character is memorable.>> Story is good and fresh and being a Bengali, I have felt deja vu kind of feeling with scenes and characters.Few things I don't like in this book are:Somewhat slow and dragged story.There are so many ""as if""-s that it have seemed dull; but there are many instances where it actually have made the sentences funny.Examples of few such sentences are: Two old men in white panjabi-pyjama and skullcaps walked along the path, slowly, as if they did not want to go where they were going. OR She never spoke to Abba after that, not that Nazneen saw. She always kept back the choicest bits of meat for Nazneen and Hasina. She kissed them all the time, even though they were fourteen and twelve. And she talked about Amma, over and over, as if you could change something by talking about it. 'I don't know why those spears were in the store, and wedged like that. So dangerous.' Hasina always ran off when she started, but Nazneen just stayed and listened. OR  She took a handkerchief and wiped her mouth, as if clearing the way for the next story. Her eyes were small and hard like a bird's; her white hair looked as if it would snap under a comb.

However, I wanted to give it a chance. And I'm SO glad I did. There were so many different aspects that made this book special to me. First off, I loved the well-developed characters. Nazneen and Hasina are so real and human with beautiful qualities. They're both strong, loyal, diligent, patient. It was also so beautiful to read about their faith in God. The reader really gets to know them in depth throughout their actions, thoughts, letters and dreams. I loved following them on this psychological journey.The friendship between Nazneen and Razia was also very beautiful to read about.The book is also surprisingly funny at times. Nazneen, Razia, Chanu have a good sense of humour.This novel also teaches about many important topics such as being an immigrant, being a woman, marriage, making decisions and finding yourself.I had never read a book based on Bangladeschi characters and their culture before and I'm really hoping to read more about it in the future.I often forgot I was reading fiction, because of how authentic it all felt.

Or something like that. What makes the book a comfortable companion in the hour before bed is not so much our heroine's emergence into self-actualization (which begins rather late in the book, and feels like it was tacked on so that the author could sell the story to Hollywood -- which she's done) as her long hibernation in a mental state where one must always be resigned to one's fate. While the heroine takes this muffled attitude toward life, the narration (third person but primarily from Nazneen's point of view) is hypnotic -- detached, ironic, approaching all objects with the same mixture of scrutiny and bewilderment. This voice -- in which all things are equally unknowable and uncontrollable -- is complemented by letters that Nazneen receives from her wayward sister, Hasina, who is doing everything BUT abandoning herself to her fate back in Dhaka, and writing it all down in an ungrammatical jumble for her sister's perusal.

Moving through isolation and depression, gradually realising that her husband is an ineffectual dreamer, the sister in London gradually moves into a new life in which she accrues at least a degree of independence. The sister who married for love is beaten by her husband and by life as she falls from one disaster to another. One of the interesting things Ali does is to show how important it is to each of her main characters to show the others (sisters, husband) that they are doing well in their lives.

50,375681098,01/12/2022,2.0,"If Goodreads would allow me, I would give this a 1.5-star rating. Reading Brick Lane was as dull as watching paint dry and the entire book could have been shortened to 200 pages at maximum. Who edited this and was Monica Ali being paid by the word for this book? Let's move on to the main character - Nazneen - the oppressed, passive and uneducated Bangladeshi immigrant woman ""stuck"" in an arranged marriage. I use quotes to describe her situation because it doesn't seem like this woman has any particularly strong feelings or thoughts about her state. There's passive and fatalistic and there's zombie-like, nearing brain-dead: I don't remember her having any emotions, thoughts or plans for about 90% of the book. And then the author would like me to believe that she jumps into bed with an extremist-in-the-making just like that? No preamble or buildup regarding her decision? Another trait of hers that irritated me was her servility towards her so-called lover. To me it seemed like the book hints at her resentment towards serving her husband by deriding him whenever possible, but Nazneen seems more than happy to bend over backwards for her lover (in the bedroom and otherwise) even though she barely knows him. If Nazneen had been set up as a teenager-stuck-in-a-grown-woman's-body type character, it would have been more believable. Hasina was a far better character but the author had to go spoil this too by having her run away in the end with some weirdo because she's eternally looking for love! I find it very hard to believe that this strong, independent and thoughtful woman who had finally found some peace in her life abruptly gives it all up. And don't get me started on the letters she sends Nazneen: why were the translations so broken? Even if I translate them to Bengali, I haven't come across anyone speaking or writing that way whether it be broken or intact Bengali. If everyone else's speech and words can be translated correctly, why not Hasina's? I cannot believe an entire chapter was filled with only these letters to move the plot along by a decade.Apart from frustration, the only other feeling that punctuated this bland and tedious read was slight nausea induced by some questionable figures of speech. ""You could go there"" The words burst as hot and fast as boils.  She spoke the words as if they were two turds dangling from the end of a stick. Add to this the repeated descriptions of her husband's corns, toe nails, nose hairs, etc. and you have an overall reading experience that can be compared to acidity. Despite the repeated attempts to make Channu seem uncouth, I actually ended up rooting for him as the other principal characters are either gormless or outlandish. I assume this book received so many glowing reviews from critics as it was published in the early 2000's where immigrant stories were all the rage. I'd rather stick to books written by Jhumpa Lahiri, Rohinton Mistry and Zadie Smith if I want to understand the immigrant experience and suffering better.

51,3901836162,05/03/2021,3.0,"Brick Lane is a romanticised yet possibly accurate account of what it’s like to be an immigrant anywhere in the world : juggling between fighting to fit in and craving to go back. It is a secret ode to both the new land - Great Britain - and the motherland - Bangladesh - without trying to idealize either. The mentioning of 9/11 and its consequences on Muslims all over the world sets the story in a very real timeline and, therefore, gives it more depth. But what this book is particularly remarkable at is making you feel like you are standing there with the characters. The depictions of the places, the people and especially the small things like the colours of the saris or the smells of the spices roasting on the stove are so sharp that at times I could almost smell Nazneen’s Dahl in my living room. I enjoyed that aspect of the book very much, especially at this time, when travelling to foreign lands seems like a long gone dream. The only problem is that some chapters are stretched out and you get kind of bored after a while.

Mostly boxed into a single apartment in a Bangladeshi neighborhood in London, Ali provides great depth to her characters' every-day domicile. She does this by revealing how seemingly simple aspects of life can create or signify transformation.I dog-eared page 100 because there is just the most wonderful description of rice (rice! You couldn't possibly get any more banal than that!): ""The rice was perfect. Fluffy white grains, each one separate from its neighbor. In the rainy season, back home, when the land had given way to water and the buffaloes grew webbed feet, when the hens took to roofs, when marooned goats teetered on minuscule islands, when the women splashed across on the raised walkway to the cooking hut and found they could no longer kindle a dung-and-husk fire and looked to their reserves, when the rain rang louder than cowbells, rice was the means, the giver of life. Precooked, it congealed and made itself glue. Or fashioned itself into hard lumps that only worked loose inside the stomach, the better to bloat the innards and make even the children lie down and groan with satisfaction. Even then it was good. This rice was superb. Just the rice would be enough for her. But fresh coriander made her swoon for the chicken. The deeply oily aubergine beckoned lasciviously. She wanted to stick her tongue in the velvety dal.""Holy crap! What the hell is a dung-and-husk fire?! I mean, I certainly had never called one to mind before, but the scene here is so artfully constructed, I have no problem incorporating the fire and its purpose. But here, too, is where I imagine Ali loses readers. The prose is so thick, it's a showering of adjectives and feelings. So, it slows the reader down.

The story also has a very strong political theme running throughout and as I have little to know knowledge on Bangladeshi affairs this was sometimes tiring to read about.

Nothing particularly exciting happened, throughout the entire novel! As I am used to reading fantasy and sci-fi maybe I was just expecting too much from this book but it was literally a telling of someones life that wasn't very interesting!There were aspects of the book that I did enjoy, Nanzeen left a sister, Hasina, in Bangladesh and so corresponds with her through letters. There is a chapter about mid-way through the book that is solely letters from Hasina but with no response letters from Nanzeen, I found this to be a highly interesting way to drop in parts of Nanzeen's life without them coming directly from her, you are literally reading her sisters responses.Parts of the story did make me feel a little towards the characters but for the most part I found it hard to connect; the story is written in third person and so I didn't feel strongly towards any one character in particular.

Meanwhile Nazneen's sister has married for love back in India, and no one seems to care what she thinks or experiences either.Clipping nostril hair and corns for her spouse, cooking meals, learning to live with neighbors who each in their own very different way accommodate to a new world, Nazneen dreams of helping her sister and of staying true to herself. Meanwhile her husband dreams of riches and returning home in state, while he lives in unfulfilled failure.Under the skin, whether it be burned away by acid and fire or rendered transparent through the eyes of an author who sees what lies beneath, we’re all of us the same.

60,2212739810,12/18/2017,1.0,"I really wanted to like this book but I didn't enjoy it one bit. I found it tedious, utterly bland and skimmed at top speed through the last ten chapters. There's only so many times that you can write about someone cutting the corns off her husband's feet or said someone eating her food at the sink in the dead of the night or a BBCB (British Born Confused Bangladeshi) girl kicking her sibling in her bottom. I couldn't help but marvel at the flatness of the characters- Chanu seemed to be defined by the corns in his feet , the expanse of his belly and his seemingly narcissistic and self- indulgent intellectual rants; Mrs Islam by the wart in her face and her paper dry skin... I'll stop with that. We get it (no thanks to Monica Ali for reminding us about these little things at least a million times).The protagonist, Nazneen, is so phenomenally boring that it's absolutely impossible to sympathise with her. Many parts of this book felt utterly disjointed to me. I wonder if all Ali was trying to do was to be evocative in her writing by painting detailed pictures of the countryside and cities in Bangladesh and the every day routine of a stay-at-home Bangla woman. But to me, it all boiled down to a waste of words and pages. I found it hard to spot a value addition to the story; the writing didn't do much for me either. And the final straw was the terrible way of portraying Hasina's letters to her sister. The broken English didn't help in sustaining my interest in the only fleshed out character in this book, regardless of the fact that she never makes an appearance in the flesh, as it were.

61,77338321,11/10/2009,2.0,"This was less satisfying than I expected, and several days after finishing it, I still can't quite believe that it made the Booker short-list. The novel concerns a young Bangladeshi woman called Nazneen, who moves to a council flat in London in the mid-1980s after an arranged marriage to an older man named Chanu, who I think is meant to be sympathetic in a nebbishy sort of way, but who becomes loathsome to the reader by the time Ali gets to her second description of Nazneen cutting his corns. (And there are far more than two such descriptions.) The baffling structurelessness of the novel stymies any attempt to discern what it is essentially about. Nazneen's life in London is occasionally interrupted with memories of life back home; we see her first child die of an unspecified illness, an event that does not appear significantly to alter her relationship with Chanu. Then six years pass with only letters from Nazneen's sister to mark the time, and these are written in broken English, which makes no sense because her sister would surely not write in English at all. After the letters, five years pass undescribed and when Nazneen reappears, we learn that she has two daughters. The second half of the book is about Chanu's resolve to move back home, their daughters' resistance, and Nazneen's eventual realization that she, too, wants to stay. The ambiguity of the structure was distracting—you keep waiting for the main idea but it never comes. Also, though I don’t require books relating to the subcontinent to be exotic, this one is strangely colorless, as though a bit too much English starch had seeped into it. Ali illustrates the insularity of the immigrants’ community, but resorts to stereotype when showing how they interact with the English world around them.",2,-0.8969,0.08,0.87,0.049,0.3717881944444445,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Hated the ending – don’t worry, I won’t give it away, but the last line just sounded so corny I was quite shocked. The book as a whole is not simplistic, but the ending made it seem that way.I think maybe this is one of those cases where the hype was so massive that the reality is bound to disappoint. It was an interesting depiction of a woman who moves to England in an arranged marriage and gradually, over decades, changes from someone who accepts her fate to someone who takes charge of it.Part of the difficulty of the book lies in the fact that for much of it, Nazneen is so accepting of her fate. This is consistent with the character, but doesn’t make for a great story until much later in the book where she starts to take action. Unfortunately some of the things she does when she starts to take action are not very believable, like joining an activist group and having an affair with its organiser. It’s quite a big leap, and didn’t convince me totally.Overall I don’t regret reading this, but I do feel as if I would have been better off reading it with lower expectations.",2,-0.3596,0.135,0.748,0.117,0.4755799755799755,NEGATIVE,1.0

First studied in Modern British Literature 2I06, taught by Dr. S BrophyThere is a difference between loving a book because you relate to it in a universal manner, and loving it because it speaks to you on a personal level. The classes we spent on Brick Lane were dizzying, exciting, and incredibly nerve-wracking. South Asian culture, and the South Asian diaspora are not topics readily explored within the university, and to have that diversity addressed hands-on was refreshing. Ali's work engages with the nuances of immigrant life, first generation perspectives, and the notions of belonging. Brick Lane asks all the difficult questions: what does it mean to be part of a community that does not want you? What does it mean to be a woman of a colour who is part of two cultures but ""properly"" adheres to neither? What does it mean to be British, Muslim, a true South Asian, a model minority, a good wife/mother/sister/friend? What constitutes ""brown-ness""? When is love enough, if ever?My appreciation for the book is because of the exposure it gave the South Asian diaspora and the grace with which it handled several incredibly sensitive issues that people far more formally qualified than Ali have yet to achieve.",2,0.9836,0.013,0.847,0.14,0.4638440860215053,POSITIVE,1.0

A less careful and ambitious writer would have settled for one or more of them. Nazneen is plucked from her Bangladeshi village to marry a man who lives in the Bangladeshi expat community of London. Her sister runs away for love but is disillusioned over and over again. Nazneen's pompous but not unsympathetic husband mismanages his career, takes out usurious loans and winds up a tax driver while she keeps the family together as a seamstress. Nazneen faces what looks like every possible alternative future: her sister's experience, the unhappily aging marriage of the doctor who is her husband's only friend, the thrill of an affair with a younger man, political involvement, and her husband's desire to return to the home country, which drives her assimilated older daughter into flight. Any one of these alternatives could turn the novel into a cautionary tale. Ali astutely sends Nazneen in another direction, one that avoids any of these traps. Vivid, often satiric but without malice, and ultimately hopeful. ",2,0.9621,0.046,0.804,0.15,0.5848958333333334,POSITIVE,0.9595

The idea, that where you are born determines your life – and that this is 'the fate' as the mother of the main character, Nazeen, called it – is nothing new. But somehow, the way Monica Ali describes what goes on in the heads of Nazeen, who has the luck of being married to a man living in London, and her sister Hasina, who decided for a love marriage, run away from her father, and ended up on the streets of Dhaka, makes you understand more of your own life. At least that is how I felt. The ideas of family, love, marriage are more or less universal. The feelings that we as humans have are such too. It's just the culture that differs, but it is up to us how we are going to cope with it. Although it surely requires strength and what's surprising it's those seemingly oppressed people who turn out to be the strongest in the end.If my words make the plot seem cheesy, then I'll make it clear: it's not a chick-lit.

66,2390806074,06/01/2018,3.0,"What I liked in reading Chanu, this Bangladeshi man failing from one career to the next as he’s caught under the wheels of the whiteness racism machine, is how he voices the crime of colonialism and makes rightful condemnations of Britain’s Indian Empire. And that was it. Because whatever good qualities Chanu might possess that could redeem his slovenliness, his egotism, and his deluded self-aggrandizement are persistently warped by what is obvious to the reader, and what is always there in the background, defining his character: he doesn’t let his wife go to school. Nazneen is an imported servant. “Wives who only served and were not served in return” was a phrase that kept coming back to me during this novel, and it’s key to one of the novel’s central dilemmas. Chanu’s hesitation to support Nazneen’s desire to learn English so that she can navigate independently in her new country is a subtle, revolting piece of abuse, and it shapes the rest of the novel. When Nazneen is taught, it is by her daughters. Her daughters, who are made by their father to prove comprehension of the things Chanu only orates to Nazneen - those meaningful academic questions that he discharges impotently, never fulfilled in his ambitions, shooting for accolades (his collection of certificates), but never achieving them; “there was in the world a great shortage of respect and Chanu was famished.” It infuriated me that Chanu values his daughters’ education because they are reflections of himself, part of himself, but his wife is part of the property. Everything is beyond her reach to him; everything, for her, is too difficult to comprehend.Enough on Chanu. In the later chapters, that’s what I kept groaning to myself, “enough of Chanu already, enough.” Because Brick Lane is Nazneen’s story. The style of the writing, the structure of the novel, everything is built to tell Nazneen’s story. And it’s *brutal*, in the way that only being immersed in the dulled, resigned experiences of a woman whose courage is built on dogged surrender to powers entirely absent from her sense of self can be. Exhausting. An absolutely exhausting read. And what keeps you going are those glimmers of hope, right? Guerilla domestic actions. And early on, Nazneen has a spark of recognition: realizing that what makes her happy is not accepting, but fighting, when it’s for Raqib... (view spoiler)[but then Raqib dies, and what happens to Nazneen is very real, very understandable - she sees this as the preordained punishment for fighting at all. The narrative drifts into a gap of years. There is no more fighting after Raqib. (hide spoiler)]But there is fighting in Shahana. The weakness in Chanu’s, “I’m talking about children who don’t know what their identity is,” when Shahana’s identity practically burns every page she appears on - granted, it’s her identity as an individual, as herself, and not as a member of Bangladesh culture which is entirely intrusive into her family’s consciousness, an inexorable disaffection. I was wondering, as I read, how much Nazneen’s observations of her daughter inspired her to make an action. An action which is, itself, skipped over in the narrative as small as if a rain had come and Nazneen mentioned it caused a small flood under the window. (view spoiler)[The adultery is like that - she makes it nothing. Ali writes it, as nothing. Later, Nazneen is telling herself this and it makes me scream: “The last few weeks, since the first time with Karim, since her life has become bloated with meaning and each small movement electrified, she had taken to reminding herself. You are nothing. You are nothing.” (hide spoiler)]This is a book about self-abnegation. Uniquely feminine, highly culturally-enforced self-abnegation. And it was a straight exhausting read for me, so that I hardly noticed how tight Ali was holding the reins. But look at some of these sentences, and reviewing them altogether now I’m seeing this scrupulously-edited poetry: “The sun is large and sickly. It sweats uncomfortably in a hazy sky, squeezed between slabs of concrete.” ; “crackled and leaked a yellow pollution” ; “The light inside the bus was furred up.” Gorgeous language. Imagery with those surreal corners to turn up. But all edited and subdued - to match Nazneen’s voice. Nazneen, who when it occurs to her that there’s a power inside her, and she it’s creator, “dismissed it as conceited.” And what else has she been taught?She is so convinced that she does not have a striving mind, that her person in its entirety is receiving, is defined and ruled by receptive, passive acceptance, that her greatest revelation is simply: imagination; is simply, “we made each other up.”To be something, to have a strong identity, Nazneen always approaches this and then shies away from it - because to be significant, and therefore culpable, and therefore stronger than the tide of fate, is anathema her character. Even as she takes up her duty at the end of the novel and (view spoiler)[breaks up with Karim, tells her husband to leave without her, casts out Mrs. Islam and refuses the infinite debt, and rescues her daughter from the culmination of colonialism, colorism, post 9/11 fear, and every tension mentioned in passing in the book up to that point, she does so with a thorough sense of inevitability - but she has become the inexorable one, not fate. I love that line, “Unbidden, a memory of Karim came, entering her as he entered her, tearing apart her passive soul.” (hide spoiler)] The strong identity Nazneen comes into focus with during the crisis of the novel - the riots - is motherhood. Her role in the community of women that are her family solidifies her. Chanu, Karim, the doctor, Tariq - they touch into her life and fall away again. Who are we left with? Her daughters, Bibi and Shahana. Her sister, always striving, happy. Razia. They teach her English, they take her ice skating; it is men who defined her many states of isolation, who escalated the cycle of her “series of gnawings, ill-defined and impossible to satisfy.” It is women who guide her into herself, and into the world. Who tell her she can do what she wants. A relief. After so long, a huge relief.",0,0.9906,0.082,0.802,0.116,0.4999905117713336,NEGATIVE,0.9964

Ali has a deft hand with characterisation; Chanu, the husband, is an excellent example of a character who would have been a villain in many other novels, yet who here is exasperating and tragi-comic figure almost completely lacking in self-awareness, and who one really cannot hate. I thought Nazneen's evolution was sensitively and delicately done, too—it didn't feel like reading about a revolution, but rather the story of one woman coming free. There are problems with the novel, of course—perhaps the last ten or so pages felt unnecessary and bit trite, and I wasn't won over by the letters Nazneen's sister sent from Bangladesh—but as a first book, it's quite impressive.

87,2074692089,07/28/2017,5.0,"Brick laneThere are some books which lift a veil and enable you to see something with more clarity and understanding than you have ever managed in real life. They present a world which is so vivid that it smacks you in the mouth. You are not so much drawn as dragged in. You become a participant in whatever drama is playing out. Brick Lane is one of those books.It tells the story of Nazneen, a Bangladeshi woman brought to Britain for an arranged marriage. She is not beaten or abused or trafficked. Her husband loves and cares for her as well as he is able to, and she grows fond of him. She has food and shelter and security, but she has no freedom. Her culture precludes her from going out and about at will, from working, taking courses or engaging in society. British society itself also hampers her because it makes her feel strange, suspected and unwelcome. Society judges her - people like me, who - before I read this book - would have looked at her without seeing who she is, and judged her because she does not speak English but failed to say ‘hello’. Between her culture and mine, her emotional, intellectual and social life is squeezed until its pips squeak. Her life is reduced to the four walls of the shabby high rise council flat, with its crumbling plaster and unreliable toilet and odd medley of furniture picked up for cheapness. She tunes in to the sounds and unintelligible babble of the neighbours half-caught through the paper thin walls. Some days, these are her only human contact. She stares for hours through the smeary glass of the kitchen window, down into the litter-strewn quadrangle far below, trying to make sense of the cold, foreign, unfriendly country where she finds herself. Boys push drugs and dogs defecate in the playground. Racist gangs roam round looking for a fight and Islamic protest groups gear up to give them one. It comes to you with a shock that if this shabby, smelly little flat is her prison, the world outside it is filthy and cruel and dangerous - no escape at all. You wonder why Nazneen is not crushed. Indeed she is crushed, but she is not extinguished. Nazneen has such courage and integrity, such largeness of human spirit that she forges for herself, out of virtually nothing, a life. Her compassion and humour as she does so is amazing. I am in awe of her. I want to know her. That’s how brilliant this book is. She is a fictional character brought to life so vividly that I like her and I want her to be my friend.Chanu, her husband, is a man full of his own importance, pompous, well educated in matters of little or no interest to anyone else. He reminded me of Mr Micawber, certain beyond all evidence to the contrary that something will turn up. Whether it is his lack of self-knowledge or just the fact that he is an immigrant, whether his inflated expectations or British failure to see and value his qualities, he is as much at the heart of this tragedy as his wife.Except I am beginning to wonder, now, whether this really is their tragedy. I wonder more if it isn’t mine.I do not want to give the impression that this is a bleak or depressing book. It is neither of those things. It is actually rather funny, the language at times is as dry and lip-withering as a good Sauvignon Blanc, at other times as naughty as Prosecco on a work-day afternoon, sometimes unctuous as tawny port. Monica Ali observes Nazneen’s world and mine with equal asperity. The small troupe of Bangladeshi characters who populate Nazneen’s tiny world are Dickensian in their comedic exaggeration. Like many people, I have been aware of and completely ignorant about immigrant communities in Britain. I have seen sari-wearing ladies who keep themselves to themselves and have little or no English and I have wondered ‘why did you come here, if you didn’t want to join in?’ Well, now I know.I urge you to lift the veil and see.",0,0.8826,0.113,0.745,0.142,0.4574543049543049,POSITIVE,0.9969
88,3793172616,01/31/2021,4.0,"It was a very close run thing whether to award this four or five stars.I was tempted, given that I listened to an abridged audiobook version - exquisitely read by Ayesha Dharker - to allow the benefit of the doubt to Monica Ali and give the higher rating. In the end, though, I'm basically a ratings miser.The writing is largely superb with hardly anything that grates. The characters that Ali creates are some of the most vivid I've come across in recent years; though of course this is no longer a new work. The character of Mrs Islam, userer extraordinaire, for example, is one of the most brilliantly unpleasant in modern fiction.I also think praise is due to Monica Ali for not simplifying the difficulties inherent in building a multicultural society. She does not shy away from pointing out both the advantages and the deficiencies of modern day Britain, particularly in comparison to the characters’ native Bangladesh, where - for example - acid attacks on ‘dishonored’ women are depicted as being all too frequent.Nazneen’s journey from meek ‘girl from the village’ to individualised person in her own right, able to make her own decisions in life, is a powerful one. But Ali is careful not to trivialise characters such as Chanu, who, while having many faults and often being a figure of mockery, is at heart trying to be a good man. That is what makes Nazneen's ultimate decision a genuinely difficult one and the book all the more believable and engaging for it.What then is my one criticism? When we are hearing Nazneen’s thoughts they are written in English in complex prose. This is also how her speech to those around her is communicated to us. However, we are given to understand that both her thoughts and most of her speech are (naturally) actually in Bengali. However, in the letters she receives from her sister, Hasina, who remains in the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka, the language used is broken or pidgin English. I can appreciate that this may have been a deliberate decision by Monica Ali, to lend a kind of simple innocence to Hasina. However, we have to assume that until Nazneen is sent to England to marry Chanu, and Hasina runs away with her first husband, they had received a similar upbringing and education and would thus have had the same command of their native Bengali language. For me, putting (only) Hasina's words and thought into broken English drives a wedge between the perceived abilities of the two sisters, because all of Nazneen’s thoughts are expressed so carefully in Ali's beautiful (English) prose. Part of the message of this book is that chance plays a big role in life. But for fate and chance the sisters might have been in each other's shoes, and so, while not interchangeable, nevertheless can be viewed as living parallel lives, and so I found this ‘linguistic separation’ mildly disconcerting.But overall I have little but praise for this novel and I am once again reminded of why I try to avoid abridged versions of books; because you never know what you have missed. And with this novel that is definitely something to regret.",0,0.9512,0.051,0.85,0.099,0.5088725601883496,POSITIVE,0.5427
89,2954846445,08/27/2019,4.0,"What a beautiful book.Brick Lane follows the life of Nazneen who is married off at 18 and moves from Bangladesh to Tower Hamlets in London.Monica Ali's writing is good. Heart-stoppingly so. She writes with accute detail but also with style. She effortlessly weaves in and out of the two different cultures and styles with flair. Take for instance her description of burning tires during the riots in Tower Hamlets - ""coiled snake of tyres flamed with acrid fury and shed skins, thick, black, choking to the wind."" Ali has a way of getting the intended message across along with style and deep emotion.The book is chock full of emotion, not only from its characters but from the reader too. One cannot help but feel sorry; anger; pathos; joy and countless other emotions for Nazneen, her family and her friends. Ali makes it so the reader becomes attached to these very realistic and inherently complex characters. Her use of language portrays the conflict of culture between the East and the West as the language is often broken like in Hasina's letters, but this too speaks volumes about what is important to the character and her values. Hasina's letters may be short but they are powerful.The sense of place in the novel was very interesting. The characters often talk of home and it was interesting to see their different interpretations. For Shahana this was England but for Chanu it was Bangladesh. Home is also inherently linked to identity. For Nazneen and her friends this was complicated -do they choose to follow their traditions and values or to make their own way? This question kept me intreagued and hearken back to the title? Is Brick Lane home, or is it Bangladesh?Ali discusses several important issues within the book and I think it is important to acknowledge the nuance she presented. Again, issues such as identity, drug abuse, finances and poverty can all be tied up with cultures, but also with individuals. The two sides are exposed and explored beautifully within the context of Nazneen and her community and I love it. Ali's writing I think speaks to the immigrant experience and to anyone with dual nationalities. She asks what makes us who we are and what makes our countries what they are? Ultimately she suggests that the individual is more important but nonetheless her discussion is amazing. Overall, read this book! It's very good and says a lot about people and what makes us who we are. 4.5 Stars",0,0.9807,0.085,0.774,0.141,0.5933333333333334,POSITIVE,0.9995
90,3255495909,04/14/2020,2.0,"Ughhhhhhhhh I really wanted to like this book. The subject matter held so much promise - a young woman from Bangladesh is forced into an arranged marriage and sent to live in Brick Lane, London with her new husband, where she struggles to find her identity in an unfamiliar and often hostile world. I think I would have loved it, if I hadn't been so detached from the characters. The story is told from Nazneen's perspective, and I get that because she lacks a connection to her surroundings, we are supposed to as well. But all that does is create quite a boring read, where I struggled to care about anything that happened to her, traumatic though some events were. Her reminiscing of village life in Bangladesh bored me to tears and I skim read those parts. I desperately willed her to develop some kind of personality throughout the novel, but she never did. She just continued in her robotic and tedious stream of consciousness, so that in the occasional moments when she did display some emotion, it felt jarring and out of place. Her actions later in the novel were incredibly juxtaposed with her character, and even these interesting diversions ultimately amount to very little in the end. The only parts I felt connected to were the letters from her sister, Hasina, who had run away from their parents early on for a love marriage. The letters, as a contrast to Nazneen's narration, are full of emotion and zest as Hasina describes what is is like to try and survive as a lone woman in Bangladesh (spoiler: not easy). I feel like Ali should have firstly, made these letters more of a regular thing in the book, and secondly shown the effect on Nazneen that her sister's communications had. If she had become a stronger character because of her sister's letters then this would have made for a much better story. And if that was supposed to be the case, it wasn't made explicit enough. It's a shame because the book was certainly well written and painted a vibrant picture of a London estate in the 80s and 90s, and did delve into what life would have been like for a young Bangladeshi bride who did not speak a word of English, trying to retain her culture whilst assimilating into a starkly different one.

91,2604159593,11/24/2018,4.0,"Looking at a lot of the other reviews down here a common theme is that not a lot of people liked Nazneen enough to follow her through what was a pretty gently paced novel. And that doesn't surprise me, not because Nazneen isn't an intriguing character, but because at least on the surface of things she's very passive, and if there's one thing many readers will hate it's a passive protagonist.And it's a shame, because if you can look past her apparent meekness--or rather if you can look at it in the right way--Nazneen is a very interesting character study. Nazneen is in internal turmoil right from her arrival in England, and I think Ali does greater justice to the internal complexity of an outwardly compliant character than I have seen before. In the end, the story of Nazneen's self-empowerment is a subtle one, and that, to me, made it feel more true.The thing I find ironic about Nazneen's apparent 'boringness' and passivity is how it reveals a discrepancy between the way many of us see ourselves through the lens of gung-ho Western culture and the reality of our lives. How many of us work jobs that we barely tolerate, stay slaves to our mortgages and the shallow aspirations of consumer society, give up on dreams and ambitions, or stay too long in relationships that don't fulfill us? The truth is that most of us are not quite so active in the pursuit of life as we would like to tell ourselves we are.

He sends for an uneducated village young woman for his bride. Together, they raise two daughters who have little or no interest in Bangladeshi language, art, history, or music as they are trying hard to assimilate into British culture.

The hardships of raising the first generation of youth is presented navigating covert and overt racism and dangers such as rampant drug use.

99,357856158,06/28/2012,3.0,"I just finished this book, having picked it up and not knowing anything about its previous fame or movie version. I found it very engaging overall, and particularly on points about the difficulties of the immigrant experience (as expressed mainly through Chanu, Nazneen's husband). That being said, Nazneen was by no means by favourite character - but I almost think that was the point of the book. In between Nazneen's almost drab experience, the pages are colored haphazardly with letters from her sister Hasina. The letters, as told to us by the author, are written as if bursting with life, with no time or care for grammar or spelling. The mode of writing is clearly a metaphor for the personalities of the two women - Hasina disregards societal rules and does as she pleases so that her life (and letters) are a wonderful mess of life, emotion and experiences whereas Nazneen tries so hard to follow the rules and fit within the lines drawn out for her, that her life (and letters) are scanty and reserved, giving a dutiful Muslim wife but also removing her voice from us, the readers. SPOILERS:Because of her passivity, Nazneen became a malleable springboard or backdrop off of which other stories and characters bounced and were brought alive. Due to her birth and upbringing, she was incredibly passive and accepting of her ""fate"", and the first time she truly challenged that - when her son fell ill - she felt triumphant, but was immediately knocked down again by her son's death, as if to reiterate the lesson of passivity. A whole chunk of her life passes unknown to us where we see Hasina's life unfolding somewhat miserably but always full of hope and potential. In contrast, I imagined that Nazneen was literally locked up in a room all day, not daring to even know or reach out to see what her potential could be. The love affair, for me, was incredibly unbelievable - I'm unsure how it started, why it started, or why it even lasted so long. The only resolve I could come up with was that Nazneen simply needed to do something for her self and her own pleasure. Apart from the bedroom descriptions, which were rather poetic, the relationship seems awkward and forced, as if they don't really even know each other. And indeed, it seems they don't - when Nazneen (finally) begins to take initiative of her own and breaks off the relationship, she reflects on how she had created an image of her lover, and in reality, did not actually know even the basics about him. Oh well. The character I ended up loving the most was Chanu (surprise, suprirse). Although he started of in the most repulsive way, he was for me the most relatable and human character. He had many downfalls (which we saw from the start - unusual as in most courtships, the best face is presented in the beginning) but he also had a clear and genuine depth about him. In fact, it is his relationship with his daughters that is complex and endearing (ie reads as real), as opposed to Nazneen's. Nazneen, as she always seems to be doing, falls to the background and the most of a relationship that we see with her daughters is her eldest daughter's propensity to kick her when upset. Even when her daughter tries to uncover some depth to Nazneen, asking her if she ever loved Chanu, Nazneen blows off the question. This is unexpected, as seeing as she has two daughters and she is also a female, one would expect more of ANYTHING coming out of this relationship - more love, more affection, more resentment, more reflection - ANYTHING. This is also in contrast to Nazneen's relationship with her son, whom she loved more than anything in the world at the time it seemed. Not sure if this is a commentary on gender at all, or if the relationship with her daughters is so lacking because she is afraid to invest in them after investing so thoroughly in her (now dead) son, or both.I struggled to make sense of the book and the ending, in particular. In an unexpected (and undesired by me) twist of events, Nazneen puts her foot down and refuses to go back with Chanu. As I said, he was my fave character and this broke my heart. He so clearly loved his daughters and even his wife, and had so many disappointments and broken dreams which, as Nazneen points out, will probably be repeated in Bangladesh. All I could think was ""except he'll be alone with all his despairs now!!"" Then Nazneen, through her friend Raiza (another strong character), starts a business and in the end she goes ice skating - so what? It felt like an actual ending was sorely missing!! After some more thought and arguments w myself, I began to think that maybe this was the point. All through the story, I keep waiting to hear Nazneen's VOICE - I see her actions and her choices that she eventually makes, but we have little or no insight into her voice. Even when she is searching the streets frantically for her daughter during the protest-turned-into-pointless-violence, it is the environment and the scenery that stands out in my head, rather than whatever was going on in hers. Her reunion with her daughter - which had so much poignant potental as we have a moment where both mother and daughter have defied rules, society and customs for what they love the most (for Nazneen, its her daughter; for her daughter, its the idea of freedom) - this moment is ABSENT! There is no follow up, no explanation, no establishing of ties, no voice. (Whereas in contrast, everyone else's voice and story - her mother's, Hasina's, Dr Azad, Chanu, Raiza's, even Karims's and Mrs Islams) is told through Nazneen. Perhaps, it is at the end of the book that Nazneen's voice is finally beginning (??).",0,0.9965,0.086,0.783,0.131,0.5510840336134453,NEGATIVE,0.9985

128,1021552511,08/09/2014,4.0,"I have only a superficial knowledge of immigration in the UK, and this book is by no means an authority on the subject. It does, however, provide some insight as to what it means (or, at least, meant) for one womanto be Bangladeshi, still adhering to major cultural values of her country, suddenly thrown into a foreign country with very different ideals and little care for her situation. Obviously not every woman whose life path is similar to our lead character, Nazneen, will navigate with the same plodding reluctance. But this book shows one side of the story that we often don't pick up books to read about. And for that reason, I think it is important.Nazneen would like to get a job or maybe go to school, but her arranged husband, Chanu, forbids it. He is an educated man, a lengthy talker, who believes in keeping with certain traditional ideals such as the man provides for the family, and the woman stays home. He talks of burqas and women's honor, solidifying these decrees by stating that Nazneen is a ""good girl from the village."" He is never harsh, though, and not abusive, at least not in the way I expected him to be from other books I've read with similar storylines. He is a gentle, nearly pathetic character, who has all these convictions and all these words but very little action and follow-through. Somehow, Nazneen learns to love this.Nazneen befriends other women, the somewhat outlandish Razia and the conservative drama-queen Mrs. Islam. Her two main friends polarize the reactions possible in being an immigrant--one fully adheres to the life and becomes a ""modern"" woman, while the other remains fastidiously tied to old customs. Both clearly represent the dangers and heartache involved with each lifestyle.Nazneed keeps in touch via letter with her beloved sister who has remained in Bangladesh, the result of running away to marry a boyfriend who ended up physically abusing her. She bounces from place to place, man to man, and her situation is downright miserable. But Hasina is ever positive, writing to her sister of her blessings, the diamonds in the expansive rough. My biggest gripe with Hasina is that the author presents the letters--supposedly in her own language--as broken, border line illiterate. We know from the story that Hasina has been educated, and I cannot understand why her letters would be written with improper grammar and very poor sentence structure. Regardless, Hasina's story is one we all know, the ever-positive native, and that proved to bother me somewhat as I worried it bordered on stereotype.Nazneen does something while she stays at home. She eventually learns to sew and quickly develops an affection for Karim, the ""boy"" who brings the pieces to be sewn (through this, Nazneen has finally gotten a job, from home no less, mostly because Chanu cannot keep one locked down). I felt very torn by Karim's presence, as on the one hand he represented an escape for Nazneen (her affection develops into a full blown affair, a smack in the face to ""traditional"" values and her less-than-spectacular relationship with Chanu), yet I resented his other symbolism, as the woman's gateway to independence through dependence on a man. As much as I disliked Chanu, I disliked Karim more, because he further disabled Nazneen from finding her feet herself like I so desperately wanted her to do through the entire book.But maybe that is the point. You can fight or situation or you can concede to it, but either way if you are to survive you have to find a remnant of happiness in it. Nazneen found that in a way that I abhorred, but understood her human need. We all want our characters to be triumphant heroes, but sometimes the veiled failures are truer to life and truer to human nature. I thought this book conveyed that extremely well, and through all my frustrations I realized that perhaps that is the purpose of creating a character such as Nazneen--her story gives us a better understanding of ourselves and what we stand for.",0,0.991,0.095,0.756,0.148,0.5125046221139972,NEGATIVE,0.9891

The writing style is excellent and I thought the observations were sharp and inventive. The three stories running alongside each other - the yound Nanzeen in Bangladesh, the older Nanzeen in London, and the older Hasina having a chaotic existence in Dhaka - are distinct in style and work well together. I found the letters written by Hasina to Nanzeen quite difficult to read at times because of the broken English, but I did think it lent authenticity - like the Scottish patois you get with an Irvine Welsh novel. The males in this book do not come out of it with much credit - being variously nasty, incompetent, stupid or a mix of all three. The husband is all in all a bit of a loser - initially I felt he was just gross but as the story develops you get to understand that at heart he loves his family and ultimately you feel more sorry for him than anything.The protagonist Nanzeen grows in strength through the novel, and it is a lovely thing to observe.

130,69535485,08/31/2009,3.0,"The book centre’s around Nazneen, an 18 year old Bangladeshi village girl thrust into council estate living in London after an arranged marriage to 40 year old Chanu. Ali follows Nazneens’ development from confused, bewildered and displaced young woman into an even more confused and displaced wife and mother. I found Brick Lane to be a book of 2 halves. The first half took me about 2 weeks to read, it was hard going, at times boring and I can understand why some people gave up on it early. Fortunately, the second half took me a few days to read and was far more interesting. It is a slow moving book and I imagine it is meant to be so. A kind of documentary of one womans’ transformation from girl to woman whilst seeking to find a place in a Western world she is far removed from. On the whole, I enjoyed Brick Lane. It passed a good few days for me and was worth the read, if not the hype. Having said this I found myself uninvolved and having very little empathy for characters I felt I should have. I found them often one-dimensional despite their lives full of woes and sadness. I found very little affection, warmth and love in the telling of the story. Maybe this was meant to be so. We see only brief glimpses of warmth in her thoughts of home and in the letters her sister wrote (and yes, I agree with some criticisms that the broken English the letters were written in were distracting). Her husband and children seemed to merely tolerate her. Her lover, Karim, also seems to merely tolerate her and, like their ‘secret’ meetings, the relationship is kept under wraps. I found that Nazneen had very little to say throughout the book until she developed later on. I noticed that in the first half her dialogue could be penned in one page and everyone around her spoke AT her, rather than with her. She appeared to me as a soundboard for everyone else’s thoughts. She kept all things to herself, secrets, lies and worries. This was even more noticeable in the letters Hasina wrote to her and the ones she wrote back, or tired to write. Hasina often wrote long and interesting letters to her sister and showed a great deal of insight into what was happening around her and a self awareness whereas Nazneens’ letters would barely scratch a paragraph. As the book moved forward Nazneen become more vocal and I feel was an intentional part of Ali’s writing to show the development of her character. That said, I felt that other characters had more to offer and drew me in more. Nazneens’ eldest daughter Shahana, her friend Razia and Dr Azad’s wife who made all but a brief appearance, all seemed more real to me. Karim seemed almost dreamlike, lacking substance and their relationship just didn’t gel for me. One thing I feel that is created rather well in Brick Lane, is the environment within which Nazneen lived. The description of her home, the council estate, plaster coming off the walls, the groups congregating around dog crap strewn streets, the desperation and lack of hope amongst some, all conjured images that were described so well by Ali. She contrasts these with glimpses of the poverty that Hasina was living amongst in Bangladesh. Yet somehow there seemed more hope there and Hasina, no matter what she had gone through, always seemed a little more hopeful and happier than her sister, possibly illustrating how poverty is relative and often spiritual poverty can, in a way, be more damning than monetary poverty. It was this and the sidelined characters that seemed more tangible and interesting to me.But perhaps that is as it is. Nazneen feeling unhappy, unloved, used, disenfranchised, displaced and, to a degree, invisible. Ali certainly does leave me with this impression of the central character in this book and this I believe is one thing to be recognised and applauded",0,0.1471,0.09,0.814,0.096,0.4528839704896042,NEGATIVE,0.9805
131,2185236782,11/27/2017,3.0,"“The thing about getting older is that you don't need everything to be possible any more, you just need things to be certain.”At the heart of this book lies an adulterous affair. Nazneen, the central character, is a Bangladeshi woman who arrived in London as the wife of a much older man, Chanu. Nazneen does not enter lightly into her sexual adventure but as Karim, a young Muslim radical, comes daily to her house bringing her sewing piecework a growing physical attraction gradually grows between them. Ali manages to capture all the little details as each abandons their moral objections.However, Ali manages to also encompass a growing partnership between Nazneen and Chanu. Theirs is an arranged marriage and she arrived in London as a naive 18 year-old village girl who spoke no English. In contrast Chanu had lived in London for some time as a single man and appears well read. Initially Chanu appears to be little more than a figure of fun, with his deluded ambitions of promotion and his useless certificates for unimpressive qualifications. Yet gradually we come to see him rather differently, as a figure who is, tragically, aware of his own shortcomings and of the way his dreams have been thwarted bit by bit. Ali paints a subtle portrait of how clashes of culture can threaten a marriage like theirs and how they can hurt one another whilst at the same time come to depend on one another. This she does so with a deft comic touch.Outside this very domestic world their lives are also touched by the politics of the time, the riots in Oldham, the 9/11 attacks and growing anti-Muslim sentiment. These events are used to illustrate the growing differences between the love triangle. I particularly enjoyed the depiction of the 'Bengal Tigers', a group of local Muslims led by Karim, at whose meetings girls in head-scarves argue with boys in Nike tracksuits about whether to engage in global jihad or battle local injustices. Nazneen attends some of the 'Bengal Tigers' meetings.Initially she admires Karim and his certainty about his place in life, but gradually as her own self-awareness takes root, she realises that his dreams are likely to turn out as groundless as Chanu's. ""She had looked at him and seen only his possibilities. Now she looked again and saw that the disappointments of his life, which would shape him, had yet to happen.""Throughout the novel Nazneen receives letters from her sister Hasina back in Bangladesh. Hasina had run away from home marrying for what she believed was a love match only to then be compelled to leave her violent husband and try to survive on her own. The choices that Hasina must face in Bangladesh are so much starker than the sister's in London. Whereas Hasina's choices will determine her very survival Nazneen's seem only to regard her own happiness. This contrast exaggerates the seemingly random nature of life and love.Despite some fairly momentous themes, Ali employs a deceptively light touch throughout avoiding the pitfalls of melodrama. This is particularly true of her portrayal of Chanu. However, strangely the relationship between Nazneen, her daughters and female friends are poorly drawn in comparison. Also the ending, given the complex relationships that had proceeded it, was a little too neat for my liking. However, one must remember that this was the author's first novel and as such is a largely accomplished piece of work.",0,0.9763,0.098,0.768,0.134,0.4855595238095237,POSITIVE,0.8962

133,2998707405,10/08/2019,1.0,"3.5 stars.To be honest I'm in Limbo with this book. Part of me liked it and part of me thought it was OK.The basic storyline was OK. It revolves around the main character, Nazneen, and her family, namely her husband, Chanu, and her two daughters, Shahana and Bibi. Ali's writing style, whether intentional or not, read in broken English and the style was definitely South Asian in style. In other words, it read how Indian, Bangladeshi and Pakistani people talk in the UK. The description of saris, markets, spices and vegetables was brilliant; in both senses of the word. You could see the bright colours known to these people, you could smell the spices and see the people feeling the vegetables for quality, even though it was not written. You could hear them talking in their fast-paced, almost aggressive style. This was very clever in my opinion. And it was wonderful. I've lived in these places and the ambience she portrays is very accurate. However, the blurb states that Nazneen meets and falls for a Radicalist, an Islamist and although this was mentioned it was very, very fleeting. To me, the main crux of the story was centred around Nazneen and her family and friends not the relationship between her and Karim. The 'love affair' didn't happen until past halfway and the worst of this was that there was no consequence. Chanu never found out and it seemed pointless to include it. On top of this, the book was called Brick Lane and although, as mentioned previously, there were beautiful descriptions of the area, this book was more about Nazneen and not Brick Lane itself. Overall, I did enjoy the book. But I do have a bugbear with it. And it is this. The letters sent to Nazneen from her sister, Hasina, were annoying. So annoying, that I skipped nearly all of them. I understand what Ms. Ali was trying to do here. Again, she was trying to portray the way South Asian people talk to one another in English but the broken English Hasina wrote in was incredibly difficult to read. Not in the sense that it was misunderstood or confusing but more that I felt myself having to re-read, several times, what had been written. It was incredibly disjointed and although I get that that was probably the intention it was way, way too much. Let me give you an example:July Something bit change in your letter. First time now I know more how the girls grow how different one daughter and another. Sound like your husband have very good job with taxi full time take him round all the place. Lovely have had entertaining dinner for Betty and she husband. Only two people come but many days preparation you imagine is Bangabandhu return to earth and honour house with presence. Lovely wear special trouser sparkle everywhere look like make from crush diamond. Betty wear yellow sari and Lovely say after even best one can trip up in fashion.Ali, Monica. Brick Lane (p. 246). Transworld. Kindle Edition. This dialogue wasn't just a few paragraphs. It was many pages. Probably a good 20 to 30 throughout the book and it really became infuriating and annoying. This is the main reason for the 3.5 stars. Had this been done differently, had the affair been more involved within the story and had the book been more about Brick Lane or had it had a completely different title then it would have got a 4/4.5.

134,835501179,01/26/2014,3.0,"This is what I call a quiet novel. There is not a lot of action but don't let that fool you, big things happen in this story.The novel opens with the birth of Nazneen in East Pakistan, now Bangladesh, just 4 years after my own birth. I could not help but to think that although Nazneen and I are of similar age our lives could not be more different.At the age of 18 my parents dropped me off in a college dorm room and said, work hard, make something of yourself kid. You are own your now. Meanwhile at 18 Nazneen's parents arranged a marriage for her to man she never met, who lived in a country where she did not speak the language, and they said, this is your fate. Accept it. There is nothing you can do about it.Luckily for Nazneen her husband Chanu was a nice enough chap. He treated her like a possesion, or a servant. Nazneen is stuck in an apartment with no life of her own. She is expected to cut his corns and trim his nose hair, and she did so without complaint. She accepts her fate.In many ways Chanu reminded me of my own father. He's one of those people who talks big talk and never listens. He's frustrated that he never achieved the kind of success he thinks he should. But he's not a bad guy so he's hard not to like. He thinks he's a enlightened man but the way he thinks about his wife reflects how stuck in tradition he is.There are sweet slices of family life that sneak into the story from time to time. I loved the scene where Nazneen and Chanu watch their two daughters sleeping and they ""administer secret doses of love.""Then something remarkable happens. Nazneen takes a lover and she ever so slowly begins to understand that she can change the course of events and the course of her life. She attends a meeting a meeting at which her lover is running for elected office and Nazneen votes, ""I have given him victory, thought Nazneen. She felt it a momentous thing. By raising her hand, or not raising it, she could alter the course of events, of affairs in the world of which she knew nothing."" For those of us who have lived our entire lives in a democratic society, we don't think of voting at a meeting as that big a deal, but to Nazneen, it was life changing.Her affair ends up to be emotionally unsatisfying. She had a conversation with Dr. Azad who himself had a love marriage, and he tells her, ""What I did not know - I was a young man - is that there are two kinds of love. The kind that starts off big and slowly wears away, that seems you can never use it up and then one day is finished. And the kind that you don't notice at first, but which adds a little to itself every day, like an oyster makes a pearl, grain by grain, a jewel from the sand...All the little irritations. Who would think they could add up to anything.""As the story progresses Nazneen finds herself. She finds her own power. She begins to create her own life. Not that big a deal for someone like myself but this is a HUGE change for someone like Nazneen.This novel ends in the most magical and happiest way imaginable. I closed the cover smiling. I recommend this book to readers who appreciate subtle changes in characters and understand that sometime small steps are as important as giant leaps.

This book is certainly slow-paced, which sometimes resulted in me being a little bored. The book is primarily character-driven and it was such a joy to see Nazneen finding her agency throughout the story. I think what bothered me the most, though, were the letters from Nazneen's sister. I can't imagine that these letters were written in English as her sister lives in Bangladesh and it felt like the author was butchering the language. I also didn't see a direct function of the letters being written in broken English which may have excused it. The book received criticism from Bengalis who said that the book doesn't accurately portray the immigrant experience and Bengali culture. As a white woman, I cannot speak on that, but it seemed important to mention it.",0,0.6953,0.046,0.864,0.09,0.5179271708683475,NEGATIVE,0.9997
136,1309803127,06/16/2015,2.0,"Yet another novel I had high expectations of and have come away from underwhelmed and confused. I did enjoy the story, and I feel like I learned a lot about culture, however the plot was very weak, and I didn't fall in love with any characters. Falling in love with at least one character per novel is a requirement for me.Nazneen, our protagonist, is as emotionless as they come. She wanders through her life as though she is practically brain dead, and even when the most emotionally gripping things happen to her she remains stoic. I couldn't fathom her out. She begins an adulterous relationship with a younger man and her feelings for him are described, but they are somehow metallic and meaningless. She is a still life painting; a hologram of life. I originally thought that she was portrayed like this to embody the oppressed nature of a Muslim wife, but this isn't the case. There are other Muslim wives in the novel who have so much more character. Towards the end of the novel, Nazneen begins to stand up for what she believes in, but even this just seemed alien and downright odd. I couldn't stop imagining her walking around with a perpetual poker face, regardless of the situation she found herself in. I would have liked more from Nazneen based on the fact that she was uprooted from her home in Goripur and taken to London where everything is different. Other than a fleeting scene involving her bursting into tears over a bowl of cornflakes on the flight over, there was nothing in the vein of trying to fit in. I enjoyed Nazneen's memories from Goripur and really immersed myself into these. The difference in culture is so lovely to read, especially when there's jinns, talking birds, and exorcisms involved. I just wanted a bit more, a bit of comparison and contrast in Nazneen's blank canvas of a brain.I particularly liked the letters Nazneen's sister sent to London from Dhaka. These were full of life, emotion and wonder. Hasina's life was far from perfect and she was not without her problems, but her letters oozed soul. I did have a problem, however, with the way these letters were written. Ali had Hasina write in broken English, and I couldn't understand why. Surely Hasina would not be writing to her sister in English? They both spoke Bengali, so I wasn't sure whether Ali was implying that Hasina was poorly educated or whether these letters had been translated into English by Nazneen. Neither of these outcomes make sense, and the thought irks me - are we to be looking down on Hasina?The poltics and racial issues here are themes I was really looking forward to getting my teeth into, and learning from. I just couldn't. The planned marches, the riots, the looting, the fights; all of these just passed me quietly and they shouldn't have done. They didn’t make sense to me, and were poorly explained.I am really disappointed in this. I had heard so many good things, and it really just wasn't what I was expecting.

Brick Lane
, and I fail to uncover it in this post. I just collected a few quotes I particularly liked about life in London...that's what you get, reading for enjoyment. I did enjoy this exploration of immigration and grappling with culture as they intertwine with character and expectations, and of course, the city itself. I loved its focus on women's experience, enjoyed Nazneen's attainment of strength and freedom, how it compares to her sister's, how it connects to politics and race and self and place.I remember first coming to the city from the desert -- nothing like a village full of verdant green, but still this critical view of the East End strikes a chord. Of course, I moved to L.A. first, the bits with far fewer parks and green spaces, so it's harder to be so critical of London in face of that sprawling concrete disaster (much as I love so much of it).There was a patch of green surrounded by black railings, and in the middle two wooden benches. In this city, a bit of grass was something to be guarded, fenced about, as if there were a sprinkling of emeralds sown in among the blades. Nazneen found the gate and sat alone on the bench. A maharanee in her enclosure. The sun came out from behind a black cloud and shone briefly in her eyes before plunging back under cover, disappointed with what it had seen. (58)This is an East End without all the lovely and curious things in it I have come to love, an East End restricted to estates and concrete -- all the problems of social housing without much to redeem them:She turned into the Berner Estate. Here, every type of cheap hope for cheap housing lived side by side in a monument to false economy. The low rises crouched like wounded monsters along concrete banks. In the gullies, beach-hut fabrications clung anxiously to the hard terrain, weathered and beaten by unknown storms. A desolate building, gouged-out eyes in place of windows, announced the Tenant's Association: Hall for Hire. (468)That said, I have seen a number of these Tenant Association halls, and they really are entirely dire. I always wondered about that. They, more than anything else, show that estates weren't always built with the most respect for the people they were to house. Many were, of course, but not these perhaps.The meeting was in a low building at the edge of the estate. It had been built without concession to beauty and with the expectation of defilement.

138,1575436581,03/10/2016,4.0,"‘Brick Lane’ is the debut novel of Monica Ali and published by Black Swan Publishers. It was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize in 2003, and is all-around regarded as a pretty solid read. It follows the life of Nanzeen, an Islamic woman from Bangladesh who marries a much older man, moves to East London, and struggles to maintain her identity in an increasingly strange and difficult world.I’m going to admit, when the blurb on the back of the book mentioned Nanzeen’s arranged marriage, I internally groaned. I’ve been reading a lot of quite stereotypical Islamic women’s fiction of late, and I thought I knew what the pattern (and therefore the characters) would be. How wrong I was. ‘Brick Lane’ blew everything else absolutely out of the water with its heart and its nuance. Nanzeen is just such a wonderful character – she’s possibly the most well-rounded character I’ve ever read. It feels wrong to even call her a character, because she feels so real. We see her as a daughter, as a mother, as dutiful, as rebellious, as hopeful, as despairing… and all of it is completely in-character.Ali is obviously aware of the politicised nature of her novel as it travels from 1967 to October 2001. The events of 9/11 are handled in a particularly sensitive way. It is humane, and it is reflective, and through the multitude of characters, gives an enormous variety in the portrayal of Islam. There are those, like Chanu, Nanzeen’s husband, who consider themselves a higher class of Muslim, there are jihadists, there are seemingly ‘Westernised’ Muslims, there are women in burkhas, and women in sweatshirts… But there are also a whole set of problems that Nanzeen faces that are not to do with race, but just occur throughout life. The novel ended with hope, and love, and a wonderful mesh of cultures.The writing style was very accessible -Nanzeen’s thoughts unfold slowly and deliberately across the page, and you cannot help but interact with them. Fairly often there are letters from her sister Hasina, which are realistically written. Charming and full of life, Hasina herself bursts from her letters, creating yet another wonderfully written female character within ‘Brick Lane’. It was also very funny. Chanu in particular was written as bombastic, effusive, and absolutely hilarious.I did find it slow, I will admit. But having finished it, I think that it needs to be. The steady pace so accurately represents the mundanity of Nanzeen’s daily life – until the last 100 pages, in which everything explodes into action. I read these last 100 pages quicker than anything I’ve read in my life. Those last two chapters…they absolutely shattered me, and on the last page, lovingly put me back together again.On the whole – if you’re trying to read more diverse fiction, in particular Islamic women’s fiction?

I knew that it had caught a lot of attention in the UK as well as outside and having read others by Zadie Smith and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie I was sort of expecting something similar. However, Monica Ali is no Adichie nor Smith... I'm seriously surprised that the book was shortlisted for The Guardian first book award 2003.The book is, well, pretty plain; especially having into account that it deals with topics such as race, ethnicity, cultural shock, and even women's rights. The character of Nazneen is dull and boring, her main feature seems to be that she is passive towards life, but to a point that you don't actually care what happens to her. When she finally shows some signs of being alive and engages in the affair with middleman it seems rushed and really hard to believe. The relationship between her and Karim is not well constructed, nor it is never really well explained how it happened -apparently they looked at each other in the eye and boom magic!. The whole plot about the death of the first baby seems pointless, as the aftermath is not even developed. Not to mention the omission of going into labor. She's a sixteen year old, pregnant, in a foreign country where she does not speak the language. I mean, there's plenty there to talk about... and it's left unsaid.The husband is stereotypical throughout the whole novel. It's like he almost only has two sentences: some academic rambling and 'who's going to turn the page?'. We never get to see the real relationship between him and Nazneen, and the same happens with the kids. Shahana is in her rebellious phase but she's only twelve which seems a little hard to believe, and Bibi could as well not have existed at all because her only sentence is that she's hungry.The letters from Hasina are far more interesting that the main storyline, however that broken English is impossible to read. It's irritating and I found myself counting the pages to finish that chapters. It does not make any sense that if Nazneen and Hasina speak the same language (Bangladeshi), and we can perfectly understand Nazneen, Hasina will write in that horrible English. What's the logic behind choosing to write in that manner? Why didn't anybody tell Ali that it didn't make sense at all?The end of the book was far more interesting that the middle part. The steady growth of racial tensions was engaging, although I kind of was expecting more development about the lives of Bangladeshis in London in the aftermath of 9/11. In general, the book is a bit disappointing. Not a completely waste of time but I'm sure there must be better books about the lives of British-Bangladeshi people. 2.5/5",0,0.9379,0.084,0.795,0.12,0.5242757335257335,NEGATIVE,1.0
141,2851418475,06/14/2019,3.0,"It was a fine read, though it got tedious sometimes.It was interesting to have a look into the head of Nazneen, the main character. She was a traditional woman who was submissive, who believed just playing the role the society expected her to and obeying others, especially men in her life like her father and her husband, was the way to live. But she was also clever and questioned whether the traditions, the rules of the society, were right, albeit only in her mind. And deep down, she wasn't so resigned. Her defiant side showed now and again, though not to a large degree until (view spoiler)[she started having an affair (hide spoiler)].And I liked the ending, that (view spoiler)[she chose to stand on her own feet instead of submitting to a man and shape her own life instead of submitting to fate. I think the author did a good job of depicting Nazneen's gradual change into an independent woman.  (hide spoiler)]However, I was disappointed about Hasina. I expected this book to be about both of the sisters even though it focused more on Nazneen. But Hasina's parts were only inserted between Nazneen's parts once in a while in the form of her letters to her sister. Her story was never fully told, and it didn't have much of an ending even, simply left to our imagination. I feel it was unfair to her, especially considering how hard her life had been.At least, though, I admire that ""she isn't going to give up"" as Nazneen put it. It must have taken Hasina a lot of courage and strength to (view spoiler)[try for another romantic relationship/marriage (hide spoiler)] after everything she had gone through.The sisters' lives, and their stories’ endings, were a good contrast indeed.There was another, larger disappointment I felt while reading this book. It was about the relationship between Nazneen and her husband.She was supposed to grow to love him. That's what the blurb says, and she thought she could love him (view spoiler)[while their son was in the hospital (hide spoiler)]. However, I saw no love. I didn't expect romantic love or passion, of course. But I expected some friendship and familial love. I love reading about non-romantic love, and I was looking forward to reading about a married couple connected with each other by such love.Yet, this book thoroughly let me down on that point.Nazneen and Chanu were distant, almost never sharing their thoughts--important ones anyway--or feelings or situation with each other even after about fifteen years of marriage. And they rarely showed affection or even care for each other. There was a clear hierarchy, he above her, and neither tried to change that. Not before (view spoiler)[Nazneen became bolder because of her affair, at least (hide spoiler)].Their relationship is exactly what you expect from an arranged marriage in the society where women are considered lower than men. Not a love ""which emerges like a surprise, growing unexpectedly over years"" the blurb promises us to see. And I felt deceived.It seemed to me that when she thought she could love him, Nazneen simply accepted her husband, accepted spending the rest of her life with him, letting go of the dissatisfaction she had been feeling toward the prospect. But it's far from loving him. I wasn't even sure she liked him. Not disliking someone (anymore) isn't equal to liking the person.She obviously loved her sister and children. And she liked her friend Razia. But her husband? It didn't seem like that.Unless we are talking about ""love"" a servant/slave feels toward a ""generous"" master, or something of the sort. And even then, her feelings wouldn't have been much.Or maybe she loved the familiarity of him, of being with him. It's not surprising that she felt attached to him after fifteen years of living together. And people love things familiar to them because they are safe. But I don't call it a love for a person, because they don't love the other person for who they are. The other person is more like a tool for them to feel the sense of familiarity, and the sense of security that usually comes with it. Besides, it's still totally different from the love the blurb described.My observation might have been affected by my feelings toward Chanu. He wasn't the worst kind of husband or father, sure. There were worse men in the world and in this book than he was. And there were times when I pitied him and times when I thought he wasn't that bad.But he wasn't the best kind of husband or father, either. Not even a good kind. Most of the times, I simply disliked him, especially because of the way he treated his wife and daughters. I don't care whether it's normal in Bangladesh or whether he is a good man/husband/father by Bangladeshi standards. It still doesn't make his attitude right, or make him a good person in my eyes. Although he wasn't exactly unkind, he was rather selfish, self-important, and self-absorbed, using his wife and children to protect his ego, which was too big for him to support by himself, while not caring much about them.Well, at least (view spoiler)[he had the decency to admit that he wasn't exactly a good husband or father. Only ""not bad.""  (hide spoiler)]Anyway, it's possible that my own dislike of Chanu prevented me from seeing Nazneen's love for him, though I doubt it especially since (view spoiler)[she decided she couldn't be with him anymore in the end despite saying she loved him.  (hide spoiler)](I added the part below after reading other reviews.)I can't believe some reviewers have said that Chanu is a good man because he doesn't beat his wife. No, wait. Actually, I can believe that. This isn't the first time I've seen such people. I've seen plenty. Too many, really.If you are one of them or inclined to agree with them, stop for a moment and think about whether you call someone a good person just because they never committed a murder. If you don't, why would you call a man good just because he doesn't beat up his wife? Why do you feel such a need to set standards for men so low?Not committing a murder isn't a proof that someone is a good person and people shouldn't be considered good just because they never committed the crime. Likewise, not beating up his wife isn't a proof that someone is a good man and a man shouldn't be considered good just because they never beat his wife.Doing that is destroying our moral standards. Because it normalizes those horrible things. It makes it seem like killing someone or beating your wife is a normal thing to do, what an average person does. Otherwise, why should people who don't do those things be considered good, better than average?And saying that men should be considered good if they don't beat his wife, or rape a woman, is pretty misogynistic. Because it implies that women should be grateful for not being beaten up or raped. That it's not a basic human right women should be given freely, with no condition. That it's a kind of privilege given to women because of men's ""generosity"" and because of the price women pay, whether it's showing gratitude toward men or submitting to men or sleeping with men.That kind of thinking isn't so different from justifying men beating up his wife or raping women. Those who say a man is good because he hasn't beaten up his wife or raped a woman may think that they aren't at all like those people who have no problem with men doing such things. And yeah, they may be a bit better than those despicable people. But not as much as they believe.If you think Chanu is a good person, you probably missed the scene near the end (view spoiler)[right after Chanu went home to Bangladesh, where Nazneen looked at a family photo and thought that her daughters, tucked under their father's arms, looked half like hostages. She, or rather the author, practically spelled out for readers that Chanu had been terrorizing his family.There were other signs, like Bibi, the younger daughter, always being stressed and anxious to meet every demand of her father but starting to relax after he'd left.

Although her husband Chanu is kind to her, he has a rather inflated opinion of himself and Nazneen submits to him and focuses on being a good wife until such time that she begins an affair with Karim - a much younger radical.

Nazneen is passive to the point of being almost vacant in her demeanor, however does reclaim some personal power towards the end of the book. This, however was one of the gripes I had with this book as I found it hard to believe that someone so lifeless and inexpressive would embark on an affair. Monica Ali is a talented writer in my opinion though, as she truly shows and not tells.

However, I felt that it could have been even better, if some chapters had been excluded. The story is told from the viewpoint of Nazneen, the main character. She is a Bangladeshi village girl, who is married to a man from London (who is twice her age) and therefore is sent to live with him in London.

Nazneen has a sister in Bangladesh, who she converses with via letters to and from Bangladesh. The story started off really well, but it gets lost somewhere in the middle. I loved reading about Nazneen's life in London, and how she adjusted to living in a foreign country. However, I didn't like reading the letters from her sister. I felt this slowed the story down, and they were just boring. I also didn't like the love affair angle. It just didn't make sense that a character like Nazneen, would engage in a love affair with anyone, let alone a younger man. That bit could also have been left out.

I have woken up and thought about this book. I have eaten lunch thinking about this book. I have reread, and reread, and reread this book. I have spent a year of my life writing a research essay about this book- my EE, for those of you who take the IB (although admittedly I wasn't working at full speed).  I still love it. Maybe the excessive detail is a bit much for some, but to me it meant that every page fully transports me into another world. Nazneen is the rare main character that is really speaks to me. It is not a rare occurrence that while reading this book, I will come upon a line so poetic and beautiful that I have to take a moment to grin to myself. Again, maybe 432 pages of painstakingly described life can be overwhelming, but I didn't feel like I was taking on some impossible task by reading this book at all. Instead I felt how Nazneen felt, from when she first met Chanu (her husband) to when she resolved her story... no, I'm not going to tell you how it ends.

I can't say if this book is ""accurate"" or not. However, I do think that Brick Lane provides a captivating window into the mind and heart of a realistic and fully-fleshed main character. That, to me, is the trademark of a novel with true literary merit. The plot was meandering at times but it still kept me interested, and I've already covered how amazing the language is. The setting, too, is rendered with a skill that leaves me in awe.  In conclusion, you should read this book. Yes, you.

Nazneen, the main character, was sent off from Bangladesh to London in an arranged marriage with Chanu, and watching her slowly come to understand that he's nothing but talk, and then eventually come around to finding the soft man underneath, it seemed very real and was quite fun.I also loved the whole portion with the sister, Hasina, all the letters she wrote and the sudden gap in dates when her life fell apart. Yes you have to suspend disbelief a bit with the contents of the letters, sentences improperly formed to indicate the lack of education, but snippets of wisdom that you'd not expect even in a letter from Proust. But my feeling is that that only added to the charm. My complaint with the novel is just the whole last half. I didn't care for the whole thing with Karim at all. It seemed largely unrealistic, uninteresting, and just went on too long. The ""climax"" with her daughter running away, seemed artificially inserted for the sake of having a ""climax"" and didn't really fit with the rest of the novel. And then the story just ended.I get that this half was about Nazneen getting her independence, learning things that Chanu was ignorant of, and also playing on the comparisons of downfalls of the sisters, and those were all actually great aspects. However the extent to which that was told was disproportionate to the rest of the novel. Additionally it felt like it needed a ""what she did with this new-found independence"", but like I said the story just ended; yeah she did make one decision with her independence but that felt like too little.Overall though, I still thought it was a highly enjoyable read, well worth the time.",0,0.9939,0.051,0.77,0.178,0.5232183908045976,NEGATIVE,0.9884

"" Needlesss to say, these transliterations will be amusing to Bengali speakers and quite baffling to others.The novel touches on a few difficult issues like an immigrant's life and dilemmas, a wife's supposedly good quality of being subservient to the most ridiculous husband, generation gap and conflict between parents and children due to their upbringing in a foreign land, identity crisis of a British man of Bengali heritage and the atmosphere of fear after 9/11 - to mention a few. But the narrative is rather boring most of the times. The author made the descriptions lengthy and jumps from one topic to another without leaving any gap between the paragraphs which slows the pace and confuses a lot. The transformation of the chief protagonist Nazneen was the most positive aspect of this book. After long being resigned to fate, finally Nazneed decided on her own fate- and the book even finishes with the sentence 'This is England,' ... ""You can do whatever you like'Hasina's letters written in English to her sister Nazneen - full of grammatical errors- to portray Hasina's lack of education- clearly the writer indicates the letters were written in poor Bengali- was a very interesting creative choice. My most favourite quote from this book is“what I did not know - I was a young man - is that there are two kinds of love. The kind that starts off big and slowly wears away, that seems you can never use it up and then one day is finished. And the kind that you don't notice at first, but which adds a little bit to itself every day, like an oyster makes a pearl, grain by grain, a jewel from the sand.”",0,0.9218,0.066,0.829,0.105,0.5250971250971249,NEGATIVE,0.935

I decided to read it because so much of the criticism I was reading about British Caribbean authors kept referring to her book as groundbreaking. The author that she reminds me of most is Dickens because of the characters she creates and the setting of council housing. She captures the meagerness, unease, and almost impossibility of achieving even basic dreams like a Dickens novel. An example of what I am talking about is the money lender, Mrs. Islam's treatment of the family. The limited scope of Nazneen's life in London seems accurate based on poverty and culture. I love when she refers to a picture she has of the England she has never seen. It is significant that most of Ali's comments on political and religious activities and conflicts are through Nazneen's very reasonable point of view.I thought her vehicle of letters from Hasina was an interesting and effective technique, but didn't quite come together in the end. One thing I really admired was how Ali portrayed the pain involved in Nazneen's decision to stay in London with her children and the way she showed Nazneen's love for Chanu. The way her mother hangs around her life like a spectre was well done also.Most of all, I loved her portrayal of Chanu. He was full of contradictions and so ineffectual in almost everything he did - buffoon-like, but loveable at the same time. While his lack of success might have had a lot to do with his personality, it is also true that it's difficult to make your way in a new place, and she showed that very subtlely. He was obviously very intelligent, but this was only recognized by Dr. Azad, and didn't help him succeed.",0,0.961,0.091,0.77,0.139,0.482823902288188,POSITIVE,0.9981
150,66284258,08/05/2009,4.0,"At the risk of a wholly autobiographical review, I feel the need to introduce Monica Ali’s Brick Lane with some personal back story. Since December of 2007, my reading was almost entirely confined to non-fiction of the historical/political variety. While interesting, it was also heavy and dry. I eschewed fiction beyond brief forays into a mystery or a romance. Then, in February of 2009, I picked up Salman Rushdie’s Midnight’s Children, anticipating the same enjoyment I felt while reading The Satanic Verses. However, I put the book down after ninety pages. To Rushdie’s credit, the world he created was incredibly consuming. But I felt indignant about the care he lavished on the significance of the size of a character’s nose when it could have been better utilized to effect change. Because I admire Rushdie’s work so much, I realized the fault was mine and that I had so far distanced myself from the world of literary fiction that I had no idea when or if I could return.Brick Lane was a wonderful return to literary fiction. The story centers on the relationships a Bangladeshi wife has with her family and neighbours after being transplanted to London. Ali uses carefully chosen adjectives to draw her character in mosaic: corns and yellowing toenails versus a gold chain snaking through a thicket of chest hair, for example. There is no attempt on the author’s part to write a “great novel.” However, since she tells her story with a simple and unassuming manner, one cannot help but get sucked into the tale. Though the drama is largely domestic and the main character sometimes maddeningly self-effacing, Monica Ali’s Brick Lane is a wonderful book with which to return to the world of literature.",0,0.8727,0.049,0.86,0.091,0.4614216701173223,NEGATIVE,0.8375

Domestic maintenance has this fascinating mixture of comfort, care, and claustrophobia.So at the beginning of the book, when Nazneen was still wedded to her role as Woman, Plaything of Fate, I was totally hooked. Aside from her domestic trance, I loved the stories from the Bangladeshi village, the description of 1980's London from an outsiders' eyes and the raw exuberant letters from the sister. I was still into it as she fell crazy in love with her little son, neglected all for him, and began to neglect propriety for his sake - I love the scene when the awful respectable Mrs Islam demands that she babysit the boy for the evening and Nazneen flatly refuses. After it jumped ahead in time into the 21st century, though, it totally fell apart for me. I never understood how she felt about her daughters. I never understood how she felt about the radical political movement she got involved with. The book starts with psychological insight but ends with economic and political musings. Plus her metamorphosis into liberation rang false and slightly offensive. I hate it when liberation for an Eastern woman automatically means embracing Western ideals. But so it was for Nazneen, whose liberation is confirmed when she dances around her apartment half-naked to ""Shout!""

The plot takes us through her adjustment to life in the grim apartment complex, the births of her three children, an affair, and through it all her worry about her sister who is making a very different kind of life back home.While we're following Nazneen's story we also learn about her sister Hasina and her husband Chanu. Hasina's story is told through the exuberantly ungrammatical letters she sends to Nazneen, and Chanu's story we have to infer from Nazneen's perspective. All three characters are rich and convincing, and travel compelling arcs.The primary conceit of the story is Nazneen's discovery of her own agency. She is taught as a child to be fatalistic, to accept the bad with the good as out of our control. It takes her years to shake off that belief, even as she makes choices for herself.I particularly enjoyed the portrayal of Chanu, maybe because I relate to him as someone really smart with lots of ideas who is, nonetheless, unable to get anything off the ground. He is deeply flawed — arrogant, self-important, disorganized, prone to making bad choices — but at the bottom of it he's a good guy who means well. I also related to Nazneen's feeling that she's responsible for keeping harmony between her children and her husband, and the description of the tension she feels when they're all home and she's trying to referee their interactions.

From her birth, when she was miraculously resuscitated, through her marriage to the much older Chanu, and even her relationship with the sexy Karim, Nazneen accepts her fate. Through the somewhat forced medium of letters, one is also made aware of her sister Hasina's fate back in Bangladesh. Initially the much prettier Hasina makes a love match but then abandons the husband who beats her and her life slowly degrades into prostitutions and misery. After a long interval she reappears, happy to have found a situation as a maid, and eventually runs off with the cook. But this is a sub-plot, the main story revolves around Nazneem herself. She considers herself lucky to have a kind husband, although Chanu's ambitions, like his many projects remain unfulfilled. Gradually and with the help of the sewing machine through which she is able to earn, Nazneem realizes she can direct her fate and takes charge, gracefully dismissing both husband and lover.

There's a contrast between the trials of Hasina in Bangladesh which are much starker than Nazneen's, but I didn't feel it was an attempt to show how the struggles of immigrant life in the West were self indulgent or less important.

The heroine Nazneen focuses the book's point of view, and her growth and difficulties continually held my interest. Some of the villains (though that's probably too strong a word), such as Mrs. Islam, are drawn with Dickensian sharpness and gusto. Naznene's husband Chanu could easily have been typed as a villain, and he does have an infuriating but very symptomatic mixture of arrogance and insecurity that Ali diagnoses as an immigrant complex. (The book's sharply ironic critique of his worship of the supposed eternal verities of classic English literature is pretty devastating.) But Chanu emerges also as a somewhat kind and sympathetic figure too, just one who has less imagination and resilience than his wife the heroine, who must break the boundaries of her husband's conception of her if she is to grow. The least successfully drawn character (because we have so little access to his inner self, such as it is) is Nazneen's lover Karim. The plot portrays obliquely but effectively the anti-Asian racism in London during the Thatcher era and beyond, and the East London community's response.

The intricate character portrayals were no small achievement. Even better than that, however, was that her characters evolved as Ali knitted her way through the story. Age and experience moulded Nazneen and changed her, as Ali explored the journey from the fatalism that poverty instills in the poor to the sense of agency and empowerment that the more fortunate too-often take for granted. This was the essential preoccupation of the story, and the only flaw I perceived in Ali's writing was that this theme was sometimes over handled.

The short answer is that Ali does it very well. I felt every emotion as the protagonist made valiant attempts to adjust to life in the UK. Seeing it from her perspective made me realise how miserable it must have been - and no doubt still is - to be wrenched from all you have ever known and married off to someone you hardly know. So, strong characterisation is a key feature of this novel and I enjoyed this aspect more than the plot itself, which I won't give away but will say in passing that it's not likely to make my 'top five plots ever' chart, but then I don't think plot was a major consideration of Ms Ali's when she wrote the novel in the first place.
