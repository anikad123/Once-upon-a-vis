0,2295047609,03/27/2018,4.0," Ohhh yeah, I went there (check out the video to see all my unpopular opinions...if you dare.)Anyway, onwards to the review!
 Oh the memories. The angsty teen memories. They're all flooding back.It should come as no surprise that I have a dark and dangerous past - I was a Twihard. I loved this series with every beat of my teenage heart. I had a poster, I had a vegetarian vampire shirt, I had a themed birthday party, and (worst of all) I did this to a book:  
 I can't even open it anymore for fear of the pages falling out and the spine splintering...yet I can't bear to throw it away.And now (ten years later), I'm revisiting the series to see how my opinion's changed over the last decade. For the most part, I still am pleasantly pleased by how much I enjoyed rereading. I very nearly memorized the series as a teen so during the reread, it was nice to see the scenes with fresh eyes after all this time. It was like visiting an old friend. However, this time around there were several moments/aspects that stood out so much clearer to adult-me:Jacob went from a lovable sidekick to a mopey and whiny teen in my eyes. It wasn't unbearable, but it was so much more noticeable this round:
“What do I look like? The Wizard of Oz? You need a brain? You need a heart? Go ahead, take mine. Take everything I have.” 
15-year-old me thought this was perfectly reasonable (and undoubtedly romantic). 25-year-old me couldn't stop noticing how he kept trying to force himself on Bella in Eclipse and then did the whole woe-is-me when Bella kept trying to tell him to stop (even when she was married.) That werewolf needed a firm kick in the teeth. AND (for the first time) I noticed how conveniently and absolutely perfect everything worked out for Bella. The sheer amount of coincidences drove me a bit bonkers: 
And then we continued blissfully into this small but perfect piece of our forever.
 15-year-old-me was so relieved that the tension/uncertainty was resolved. We could finally get those super-cute moments with the Cullen Family. 25-year-old-me kept waiting for something to happen. I mean, the first 2/3 of the book consists of Bella getting married and being pregnant.  Lots and Lots of filler-fluff. She's the calmest newborn in centuries, she makes leaps and bounds with her gift and has a super adorable precocious child. It's verging on Mary-Sue territory. 
Stop being so… optimistic. It’s getting on my nerves.
Most notably, the series' end wasn't as all-consuming and life-altering as I remembered it being. I still enjoyed the series but it just doesn't hold to my memory. (I guess that's a product of growing up). I'm a bit disappointed about that. Ah well. It's still a four-star-er in my book - here's to nostalgia and memories!Audiobook CommentsFor such a popular book, you'd think the audio would be a bit better. The female voice (done by Ilyana Kadushin for Bella's parts) didn't have enough variation in tone - especially when she did male characters. Nearly every adult male had the same voice and the accents of the new/visiting vampires wasn't distinct enough. The guy voice (done by Matt Walters) was a bit better for the distinction but sounded wooden throughout the book.

2,29101320,08/02/2008,1.0,"I was so disenchanted with Eclipse I wasn't excited for this read, but I had to know how it ends. I held off judgment in hopes that the conclusion would redeem the series. The verdict? Hard-to-swallow soap opera. A car crash you can't stop staring at in hopes that something salvageable comes out of the wreckage. But nothing does. So bad I started taking notes on all the plot holes because I couldn't keep track. What happened to the story that captured the hearts of girls everywhere?You can't fall in love with your characters so much you save them from the dilemma you created: the impossibilities of vampire and human love, the instinctual need to destroy between vampires and werewolves, the girl who has to choose between two boys in opposing worlds, the boy who gets left out, the girl who has to make massive sacrifices for her choice. You can't save them from the plot by taking it all back and saying ""never mind the rules I created, you can all have it all without giving anything up for it."" When you do that, you take an exciting premise, take all the fire and excitement out, and ruin the story. As an author, you have a responsibility to your story, your characters, your fans, even yourself as a creator, to let the story be. I recommend you write your own ending. Or better yet (since I'm not really a fan of fan fiction), take your book back and get your money back. If everyone does, maybe Meyer will pretend it was a big joke and rewrite a plausible ending to the saga. Maybe this time her editor (and copy editor) will actually read it. By the double-digit errors I found not even looking I doubt he/she did. What I expected from this story:1. The big dilemma. In Eclipse Meyer finally showed the downfall of vampire life. Bella has to give up her family, the potential of her own family, her friendship with Jacob, and the ease of human life out in the open. Most importantly she takes on the internal moral struggle of an instinct to kill, of being a monster. This is serious sacrifice and I wanted to see some soul searching, some grieving, some preparation for death from Bella. 2. Vampire sex. Vampire trying not to kill human sex. Newborn vampire with unquenchable passion sex. No harlequin romance graphic, but like Twilight explored kissing, exploring how they could possibly do that.3. One scary newborn vampire. Murderous screaming during the transition after a bite from Edward to save her from death. The rage, the passion, the strength, and most importantly the thirst, the unquenchable thirst, that overpowers all that is human. I wanted to see Bella going after a human, preferably someone she knows, and have to be restrained. I wanted to see the true monster that is vampire take shape before learning to control the beast.4. A good showdown. Eclipse robbed us of the vampire battle. I didn't care if it was the Volturi coming after Bella or the werewolves after Edward. I just wanted a good fight (from all the buildup to one) and I wanted people to die (because a battle without death isn't realistic), maybe even Jacob sacrificing for Bella. Isn't killing the vein of their existence? I expected some death.But alas that is not the story. I think I may have to start denying I've ever read the Twilight saga. I was going to buy the boxed set if for nothing else for a pretty addition to my bookshelf, but now I'm truly embarrassed to have read the series. The rest of my review has spoilers.(view spoiler)[I'm calling wolf. This is not Jacob's story. This is Bella and Edward's story and Jacob is a distraction. I'm sorry that you like him too much to hurt him, but that doesn't mean you have to ruin the story for him, much less give him half the book. Making Bella still love him hurts them all, makes her self-centered, and Edward seem an indulgent parent with a whiny brat he can't say no to. It diminishes their love to volley back and forth. Everyone I love together? I don't buy it. Bella said goodbye to Jacob in Eclipse; leave it at that. Sacrifice for Edward. That's love. Bella's treatment of Edward (and Jacob) is only as infuriating as his indulgence of it. His idea for resolution of her nudger (gag!) is ghastly. For a second I thought Meyer was going to go down that road and I was sickened. How in anyone's mind is offering your wife up to another man shows undying love is beyond me. It is sick and wrong. And how is insemination gross or worse that pimping her out? How can Bella never consider Edward's worry for her? She knows how she'd feel if he died. Bella seemed more like Wanda in The Host: trying to portray her as too kind which is just blindly selfish. She should have written The Host after and not confused the stories or writing style. The characters have wandered so far from their original shells that I couldn't branch this story to the magic of Twilight. Where were Edward and Bella? And the rest of the Cullens?The way Meyer transfers Jacob from one obsession to another while not extreme to be pedophile is still creepy, much worse considering Jacob's comment about seeing Bella naked or that Bella's eyes caused the imprint. This is not a southern joke where your father is your uncle and your grandpa too. It doesn't excuse Bella's unhealthy possession of him and it doesn't smooth over the hatred with Edward. My brother, my son? Gag. His intrusion in the happy family of three was beyond grating. He doesn't get a say in how that child is raised. And is Renesmee seriously supposed to grow up and love a guy who raised her? That's disturbing. Why couldn't Jacob and Leah be happy together instead of Meyer making all of her relationships the older man with a young girl? The story was going that way, but Meyer had reserved this sick end for Jacob she found romantic so she forced it onto the story. Werewolf imprint on vampire hybrid? That makes no sense, especially after Leah's discussion about imprinting on the best mate to keep the race alive. As much as I didn't like the extent Jacob was in the book, the other vampires were more disappointing. All the old albeit shallow side characters were replaced with a freak show. I thought this was a book about vampires not superheros? The abundant ""rare"" gifts got more ridiculous from one to the next--at least the original gifts connected to human traits. And the flaws. Alice's ineptitude at her visions was not consistent. Bella? Willpower? Bella's ""holes"" didn't make sense. How could Jasper affect her if she's that strong? Why couldn't Edward hear her inside her bubble? Everything about all these extra vampires was just wrong. Hundreds of vampires on a feeding frenzy without the Volturi reducing numbers didn't make sense. She should have stuck to developing the Cullens. And Bella. The second half was so out of character I couldn't take that disjointed leap with her.I was so disappointed with the lengthy Volturi scene, the only thing with any hope of excitement that only built and tiringly built and then fizzled. These were the only vampires sold as creepy monsters and while their mafia-type support didn't make sense, I still expected them to act out the role. They didn't deliver. The story was so far gone by that point, I half expected the spawn of Satan (and by that I mean Renesmee) to destroy the Volturi alone. It seemed more ""The Incredibles"" than Bella and Edward at that point so why not a Jack-Jack ending? It didn't resolve anything and only put them in graver danger but she still shoved a happily ever after down our throats.Vampires (dead humans with extra chromosomes?) don't have blood; they don't drink, pee, sweat, or have liquid in their bodies. Beyond the complications of sex for those reasons (which I wouldn't have questioned if that's as far as it went) or the likelihood of Rosemary's baby, don't turn the monster into an angel more werewolf than vampire. It's a confusing stretch. You know in soap operas where babies get in the way of the storyline so they magically grow up so the parents don't have to deal with childhood? Sacrifice is what gives you undying love for children; they are not convenient plot ideas. Nothing about that child made sense and I thought Nessie, considering its monster ties, was a vast improvement on a ridiculous name. And Edward Jacob for a boy is not sweet. It's obscenely selfish. The point at which I started hating this book was when Bella didn't even act like a vampire. Not being a newborn vampire is not a gift, particularly for a vampire who needs a myriad of other gifts to save the story. It's an excuse to not have your characters suffer. But instead of making characters stronger, it weakens them. It robs them. It robs us of a good story. You can't soften that blow. Hiding the pain of the bite from Edward robbed him of a chance for compassion--something dependent Bella would not do. Turning to the person you love most in your worst hour is love, is what strengthens relationships. And how is Bella's human uterus so strong that only a vampire could cut through it with his teeth? That was about the biggest joke in the book. Being a ""soulless"" newborn vampire isn't all Meyer cracked it up to be. If it were, they never would have let a strong newborn go hunting with only one guardian. Since Bella was so easily distracted from a thirst that didn't seem all that powerful, there should have been some good loving in that forest. Having the thirst that drives the series not phase her, diminishes its power and intrigue for all vampires, all the way back to Twilight. Being a vampire isn't torture; it's fun. I want to be a superhero vampire. Sacrifice is what Bella knew she was undertaking when she picked Edward. But she gave up nothing. Everything is twisted for the sake of convenience: children, newborn desire, imprinting, human family, death, special gifts, a cast of new vampires, everything. Would a cop who detaches his daughter's battery so she doesn't sneak out plead ""don't ask, don't tell"" with the scary supernatural threatening his community and daughter? The only reason this bogus aspect is even in the story is because Meyer couldn't bare for Bella to lose anything. But if Edward, Bella, and Jacob are unrecognizable characters, why not Charlie? And if Charlie gets pulled into the story why not her mother? I'm sure Meyer could have come with an implausible excuse for her too.Meyer tried to add plot twists, but couldn't commit to their consequences. With all the conflict removed for Bella, there is no drama so Meyer tries to create it with ill-placed childish mood swings. There are no monsters in the book. Vampires are sparkly happy supermodels. Werewolves are snuggly tame pets. Even the werewolf-vampire antagonism seems to have dissipated. The head-butting between Rosalie and Jacob seems more personality conflict than the innate drive to destroy each other. They all want to sit around the campfire and sing. Couldn't at least some Volturi sinister be burning in that fire? (hide spoiler)]There is more to complain about, but I am out of room. In a nutshell: part one: strange, part two: disgusting, part three: dull. I'm appalled it has more stars than New Moon. I guess some girls care more about a happy story than a good one. I didn't buy the book and I still want my money back. I feel robbed. Not having the guts to finish what you started not only ruins this book, but previous installments too. I will give her this: she used a dictionary to add a few big words and she kept it clean. But I can't read her books anymore. And I wish I could wash this one out of system. The saga had such potential and she killed it.",457,-0.9994,0.178,0.699,0.122,0.5551605707217951,NEGATIVE,0.9997
3,16208114,02/23/2008,1.0,"[pardon any grammatical/spelling errors, I'm not reading this over again--I didn't get much sleep obviously:]If I could give this book a lower score, I absolutely would. When you create a book series, there tends to be an issue with the next book that comes out in the series having to be better than the last. Of course that is always a possibility for stories such as Harry Potter, where the plot is laced through all of the books and leads to an ultimate climax and resolution in the final book. Stephenie Meyer did not follow this example in any way, shape, or form.Instead of possibly creating an internal plot that would follow the entire series, every book has...well, I cannot justify a plot in any of the books, save the first one (that was in the last 100 pages of the book), so I'll try to skim sweetly over this. For her last attempt, strike 4 on my count, Meyer rides this train till there are no more tracks; taking the train, and all of it's passengers on a bumpy, uncomfortable, and unforgivable journey no one had prepared for.Bella's half-breed child shouldn't even exist, given Meyer's specific ""VAMPIRES CANNOT HAVE CHILDREN"", so of course she gives a pathetic, if not confusing, explanation to how Edward gets Bella pregnant. The child's name itself is atrocious; I honestly hope no one loves this series enough to name their own child that, out of their ""love for Stephenie Meyer.""Let's remember what I said before: there is not a sustaining plot throughout these books, besides the fact that Bella wants to become a vampire; but even that is stretching it. So when Bella becomes pregnant, it's almost as if Meyer suddenly thought, ""PLOT!"" and took off at the speed of light in a direction that flabbergasted me. Has she even mentioned children in this entire book series? Besides the fact that little mutant Nessie takes the entire stage, Bella's giving birth to a mutant that should not exist (X-Men anyone?) seems to be the only thing that drives this story forward. Because otherwise, the story would have ended. Bella got married, Bella somehow someway got pregnant, Bella had a half-breed baby, Bella becomes a vampire, Jacob creepily imprints on said baby, and everyone lives freakishly happily ever after. I shouldn't have to describe how horrific it is that the entire 800-pages of the final novel is about a baby. Bella seemed to move to Forks and somehow grow up in a year, getting married and having a baby, and living for forever with her ridiculously good-looking husband. I understand that Bella made the choice for herself, doesn't mean I have to think it was a good one. Or a good example for young girls to follow. I'm not going to step up on the soap box and preach about how many horrible morals this gives to girl's of today's generation (after feminism has fought to get us this far) because if they haven't read a cheap romance novel yet, they certainly will. Guys looking to date girls of that generation should beware however. If you don't sparkle in the sun, devote every step you take and every move you make to her, and like to watch her sleep, you might not have much of a chance.But, back to the story, cough, I mean lack thereof. The Volturi coming in deemed itself, once again, random and overreaching for Meyer. As if she just wanted them to show up and have an epic battle, but it wasn't really epic and it didn't serve much of a point. However, if I was a 1000-year-old vampire, I'm sure I'd be bored enough to care about someone as trivial as Bella Swan too.1/3 of the novel is in Jacob's perspective, and to be honest, that was the one part I enjoyed (somewhat). Only because I think Jacob was Meyer's best character. He shall forever be known as the character with a personality. However, as Meyer had introduced me to Jacob, and gave me reason to like him, she also had the power to do the opposite. Thank you, Stephenie Meyer for ruining one of the only realistic characters you created. *two thumbs way down* Not only did Jacob CREEP me out, he was so completely overbearing and whiny, I couldn't wait to get back to Bella, the whining queen! His imprinting on little Nessie just put the icing on the shit-cake I had been eating for the past 400 pages. I had assumed we went passed the pedophilia part with Quil, and come on, he imprinted on EDWARD AND BELLA'S BABY? Why couldn't he have imprinted on a 35-year-old alcoholic with an abusive husband and Meyer could give someone who needs saving a fighting chance by someone with super powers. By this point, I was going to take an example from New Moon and jump off a cliff just to save myself from the rest of the book.But I didn't, and I should have. The rest of the book was almost as boring and laughable as the first half, but at least the first half had (gasp) fade-to-black sensual scenes.As many people have been saying, this book is exactly like 1,000 stories on FanFiction.net--and if I can give you any advice, find a story on there and it might be a lot better than reading this.And it would probably be 700 pages less.",403,0.9919,0.067,0.823,0.11,0.5556601326264247,NEGATIVE,0.9996
4,1257463565,08/13/2020,1.0,"Congratulations to Breaking Dawn for being the first book in human history to be so long both emotionally and physically that its length is measured in centuries and tears of boredom shed rather than pages.In other words: Snooze.Does anyone remember why I decided to reread this series? Was it masochism? Self-hatred? The desire to review every book I've ever read? Divine punishment?Whatever it was, that sh*t hurted.I don't LOVE to hate-read things - I am still definitively a part of the population of people who do not enjoy consuming content that is bad - but I’ve been known to have a problematic fave or two in my time.The first Twilight book, for example...if it hits me at the right time...when the tide is out and the moon is waning and the temperature is precisely that thing where it feels exactly like nothing...sometimes I have fun with it.But now I can confirm that any such experience with books 2 through 4 is impossible.This is just so boring.Also, it’s dumb. Everyone has heard of Renesmee, the half-human half-vampire baby who is totally one of a kind (in having the world’s worst name, I mean. The monster creation part pales in comparison to that). She grows up crazy fast, and within a few days is big as hell and has shoulder length hair. Bella’s first thought upon seeing that child? “She looks weeks, if not months old.”You know. All those weeks-old babies with a long bob.Plus there’s this vampire warzone party, where the previously completely unsociable Cullens suddenly have 847 friends, and all of them are boring and also sometimes racist. My personal favorite is Garrett, who inexplicably is supposed to have a mysterious past even as he says things as obvious as “‘The redcoats are coming, the redcoats are coming,’ Garrett muttered mysteriously to himself and then chuckled once.”And let’s not forget the grand prize winner of cringe, the pièce de résistance, the moment we’ve all been waiting for: Bella and Edward finally swiping each other’s V-cards after hundreds of pages of moral pontificating and aggressive Mormon messaging from the immortal man himself.I wanted to jump into this book and wring Edward’s marble neck myself. And then give Bella a reality check beatdown while I’m there.Like. Imagine your boyfriend makes you MARRY him before you can get that d*ck and then once you’re on YOUR HONEYMOON he screws you once and then spends the rest of the time purposefully trying to tire you out so you won’t try to, gasp, have sex with your husband.Also don’t even get me started on the hit-you-over-the-head anti-choice messaging in here.I just convinced myself to drop this baby down to a one star rating.Bottom line: If you want to brush up on your Mormon rhetoric in a tome that’s somehow just as dry and boring as the actual religious texts while also including vampires...have I got the book for you. ----------if i were stephenie meyer, i simply would have written this series to be less problematic and boring. no offense to her but i'm differentreview to come / 2 stars probably----------HOW IS THIS BOOK SO LONG.i feel like i've lived a thousand lifetimes within its pages and i'm not even at the halfway mark----------when i was in fourth grade there was this kid in my class who wore a twilight shirt EVERY DAY that said ""life sucks, then you die."" not sure which is more impressive now: that he read this 750-page book at 9 years old or that he'd settled into nihilism so early in life----------my mom didn't let me read this book until i turned 13. it was because of the sex stuff but i prefer to think it was because of the imprinting-on-a-baby thing",352,-0.7273,0.109,0.793,0.098,0.5211486678004535,NEGATIVE,1.0

6,24861467,06/18/2008,5.0,"Where do I begin? I LOVED this book. It was even better than I even imagined. So many surprises! I picked mine up at midnight when it was released and could hardly put it down.  So first off...the wedding was beautiful. The honeymoon was even better. Stephenie Meyer did an amazing job of writing a ""tasteful"" honeymoon scene. It wasn't dirty at all. It was beautiful. You knew they were able to have sex and that there was a definate strong ""intensity"" during these moments but she didn't go into too many explicit details which leaves much to the imagination (I loved the quote by Bella, ""Why am I covered in feathers?""). It was PG-13. Plus they were married when it happened so that made it even better. I have to admit I was a little shocked she wrote the sex parts. I didn't think she would go there but I am so glad she did because it just made the bond between Edward and Bella even stronger if that was even possible. It was hot and sexy for sure! I am so happy Edward and Bella got their proper wedding & honeymoon and more importantly....that I got to read about it like I was right there! Does that make me a pervert? Oh who cares! It was amazing!So what I never dreamed of happening was a pregnancy! This is when the story goes from pure happiness to total uncertainty and even sadness for some. Bella is adamant that she would keep the baby even though it was killing her, hoping she could keep her heart beating long enough so she could be turned into a vampire to save her. I have never felt so horrible for Edward. To say he was in agony would be an understatement. Chapter 9 was very hard for me to read because Edward was in so much pain. Pain isn’t even close to describing what he was feeling. Not that I doubted before but it was in this chapter that really solidified that Edward would do ANYTHING for Bella no matter how much pain it caused him. Pain he feels he deserves. I felt awful for him.Chapter 18...the birth was by far the most intense chapter of all the books in the series for me. I was literally shaking as I read it. It was pretty graphic with Bella’s bones cracking and breaking, her spine shattering, throwing up all the blood she had been drinking to feed her unborn child. She was dying. I was on the edge of my seat wondering if they would be able to save the baby and at the same time save her. I always hoped Bella would become a vampire but I always had this feeling that Stephenie wouldn’t let that happen. I am so happy I was wrong. One of my favorite parts from the chapter was when Jacob was giving Bella CPR after the baby was born…. “Move your hands, Jacob,”	I looked up from Bella’s white eyes, still pumping her heart for her. Edward had a syringe in his hand-all silver, like it was made from steel.	“What’s that?”	His stone hand knocked mine out of the way. There was a tiny crunch as his blow broke my little finger. In the same second, he shoved the needle straight into her heart.	“My venom,” he answered as he pushed the plunger down.You could feel that at this moment Edward was very somber. He was turning the woman he loved into a vampire. Something he had fought against for a long time because he didn't want her to have to give up any human experiences and eventually regret becoming a vampire. Now he did it to save her. There was no other way. I wish I could have been in his head at this time though it would have been very depressing I'm sure. Jacob too had to give in to letting her become a vampire to save her. So now not only was Bella changed into a vampire, but she was a mother and a wife. So many changes so fast. This all shocked me but nothing shocked me more than when Jacob imprints on Bella & Edward’s baby...Renesmee(not fond of the name...but thank goodness it wasn't an Edward Jacob! That name irritated me even more). I have to admit though it kinda freaked me out at first. I don't blame Bella for wanting to tear him apart. Like me I don't think she could have ever imagined this happening. This event was so significant. It released all the pain Jacob had to endure by being in love with Bella but knowing she would never be his. At the same time it tied him to her permanently. He still loved her but in the way it should have always been. He loved her as a friend and nothing more. Also with her change into a vampire & birth of Renesmee brought a release from the pull she felt to have Jacob as part of her life, though he would still be because of the whole imprinting thing but it would never complicate things between her and Edward’s relationship again which I was very grateful for. She loved him as a brother like she always wanted. Everything was as it should be.So in the end the challenge was the Volturi. They were coming to kill all of them because they believed Edward & Bella had created a youngling. Changed a child into a vampire when really Renesmee was the biological child of Edward and Bella. I cried (the ugly kind, I was hysterical) at a point when Edward and Bella said their quiet goodbyes to their daughter and Jacob when they thought they were about to die. It was heart wrenching. It was so touching when Edward said to Jacob, ""Goodbye Jacob, my brother.....my son."" What a wonderful gesture from Edward to Jacob. Luckily in the end they were able to conquer because of Bella and her amazing gift to shield everyone she loved from the ""special"" gifts of the Volturi. I thought it was wonderful to see Bella so powerful and strong. That for once she was able to be the protector instead of the one being protected. She got to be the savior. This too made the unbreakable bond between her and Edward stronger. Because of her they were able to beat the Volturi and save their daughter that they loved more than anything. Their family was intact. One of my absolute favorite parts (there are so many I have to say) was at the end when Bella removes her ""shield"" so Edward can read her thoughts. Edward was NOT expecting this. Not being able to all this time has driven him mad at times. Especially when it came to Jacob. He always wondered if Bella made the right decision. Now he knows without a doubt that she always loved him and that nothing can or ever will change that. Edward got to experience all the feelings she had for him as far back as she could remember. He can know now without a doubt that they truly belong together. What a wonderful gift to give Edward. Oh I just LOVE Edward! That Bella is one lucky vampire. I was so glad this book had the Happily Ever After ending. Especially after all the horrible things that have occured in the past. Everything came together beautifully. I loved it. I liked Jacob a lot more in this book in fact I laughed out loud several times at him. I also liked Bella a lot more when she became a vampire. She wasn't as selfish and winey. I wanted to strangle her at times in the other books because of the way she treated Edward and even Jacob. The pain she caused both of them in the past because of her own selfish desires. Everything for the characters is balanced or in line how it should be in their relationships. I feel closer with the story now which I needed badly. These books totally consumed me to say the least. This was my favorite of the series by far. It was filled with love, suspense, true friendship, loyalty, sorrow, happiness and so much more. I look forward to reading it again!

7,30027001,08/13/2008,4.0,"Reviewer update Aug 2009: I have demoted the book from 5 to 4 stars. My confession/explanation is at the end of the original, unedited review.___Yes, I gave it 5-stars. This is partly because I was so pleased by it compared to the last two books in the series that I overreacted. But I also approve of her approach to the book and have rated it so highly in order to counteract those reviewers out there who hated it because they felt Bella was a bad example to young girls.***THESE TWO PARAGRAPHS SPOIL THINGS THAT HAPPEN EARLY IN THE BOOK***I have a bone to pick with these people. Read some of the reviews on Amazon or GoodReads and you will find a certain type of person who feels that Bella's character fails as a role model for young women today. Why? Because she, gasp, got married and had a child at a young age.Oh, my, what is the world coming to when young people choose eternal love and devotion! (Oh that more young women could be more like the implausibly articulate yet utterly selfish lead in the movie Juno!) In my favorite example, one reviewer on Amazon claimed it wasn't credible that a girl as young as Bella would feel joy at sensing a baby growing inside her. ""I'm 28 and if I felt something moving in me, I would freak,"" she said, ""I can't believe a 19-year old would be happy about it.""***END OF SPOILAGE***Sadness ensues. Women and men from every culture in every era of history have found a tremendous and peculiar satisfaction in their children. It doesn't matter where you believe this instinct came from, it's real and it manifests millions of times over. Should we be so surprised that Stephenie Meyer would be one of the billions who believe this love to be real? Read the author's bio and it becomes clear: She was married at 21 before she finished college and had three children while still in her 20s. But one can hardly call her a ""failure"" for choosing family first. By all standards she's fabulously successful and wealthy. Plus, she has a college degree (one of the big beefs some people had with Bella's choice to postpone college). Are we really surprised that Stephenie would see the world through rose-colored, happiness-prone glasses when her own life is exactly that, deliriously happy?Social polemics aside for a moment. The one thing this book lacked was a satisfying climactic, apocalyptic battle royale between the forces of vampire good and vampire evil. I know this book was intended to cap off a romance series, not 
The Lord of the Rings
 but there's a reason books of high fantasy all end in cataclysmic bloodshed. It takes a conflict of such dramatic proportions to drive the point of a story deep into our minds. And the point of this story, if you weren't too focused on your own family planning to notice it, was worthy of such dramatic punctuation. The real point of this book is that we can and should choose love. That despite our personal weaknesses and faults -- our immature attempts at love and our petty jealousies -- we can make important, permanent decisions that will tie us to other people, making their lives and our lives better in the process. The battle I propose -- one I hope sees the light of day in a future novel -- would seal Bella's decisions and the decisions of her family and loved ones in a way that would render their commitments real. Their marital love, their parental love, their familial love, and the love of fellowship with others who share their principles.Some would have to die to preserve the love they have made immortal. Others would have to kill to do the same. Nothing is more final, especially for immortals. But they would do so to symbolize the triumph of their love over the petty dynasty of the Volturi and thus establish a global movement of vampires that respect human life and restrain their selfish hungers in deference to the greater good. Something that wise humans do every day. Such a symbolic battle would take this series to the next level. But even without it, this book is the best evidence that Meyer wasn't really writing a sloppy romance saga for misty-eyed girls, but was instead telling a story about the eternal power of love and self-denial. ___Update from Aug 2009I have had some fabulous comments to my review (please read them, most are very intelligent). I have been properly chided by many of these reviews for overreacting to the ""Bella is a bad role model"" flack and failing to acknowledge the principal flaw of this book. Amy said it best below: Meyer shortchanged us by not forcing Bella to face any hard choices. Bella got everything she wanted, including a (strange) relationship with Jacob. Nobody she loved got hurt -- which was the problem I did mention above -- and she never had to disappoint anyone. Given that a year has passed, I have some distance on all the whining that went on about Bella not being a protofeminist. As a result, I should own up to the fact that this fourth book fails to deliver not only the climax I hoped for, but the real character crisis and development that a saga of this length should strive for. Or that we all should strive for in our own lives, to go all metaphysical on you for a moment. So I have demoted the book from 5 stars to 4 and begun to ruminate on the topic of why Meyer -- a woman possessed of such clear imagination -- was unwilling or unable to make Bella's life hard. Here's what I have come up with, for what it's worth:1 - Meyer's own life is pretty darn pleasant. Let's be honest, she has everything most people think they want. All of us who struggle to write books that nobody reads desperately wish for her success (a fact that generates more than few snippy comments on Goodreads, I might suggest). She has a whole community of women around her who adore her and come to all-night parties when she debuts a book or movie, just to be near her. In the end, she might make Bella after her own image because she doesn't know that life ultimately requires pain. 2 - Meyer is a Mormon. For those not acquainted with the faith, Mormonism is a faith that believes everything will ultimately be okay. If not in this life, then in the next. In fact, the whole vampire immortality gig is just a metaphor for the Mormon idea of the afterlife: You get to be with the ones you love forever, without pain. In that way, Bella is a perfect reflection of the ideal Mormon eternity: God forgives us for our idiocy, acknowledges our flawed attempts at love by magnifying them and making them eternal. Though this is only one side of Mormonism -- it's also a faith with sorrowful history of persecution. Mormons certainly suffer plenty in this life just like everyone else, so this explanation is only true to the extent that Meyer has willingly isolated Mormonism's view of the end state of humanity. 3 - Twilight is just escapist fantasy. This is not only the most obvious but probably the strongest of my three explanations. We're so accustomed to watching James Bond run through the street with machine guns trained on him that never hit their mark that we no longer point out that Bond is completely implausible and ultimately unsatisfying as a character. But we're not used to reading fiction in which women get everything they want. (At least, I'm not.) So we get tied up in knots about the lack of deeper meaning and pathos when in reality, Meyer never promised us a garden of sorrow and personal growth. So even though I have to demote the book, I still feel like the saga was worth reading; both because of the fun I had teasing about its flaws but also because it gives me fodder for worthwhile introspection. Oh, and it connected me to some great commenters who I now follow on Goodreads. ",217,0.9995,0.081,0.738,0.181,0.5692380952380953,NEGATIVE,0.9967

Was that because she wasn't as female as she should be?Okay, it's always been obvious that the only things Smeyer finds important in life are marriage and babies, the younger the better, but what the fuck, y'all. I am beyond disgusted at this. (edit - this is kind of unclear, mostly because at the time of typing I was too angry to think properly. I'm disgusted at the statement that women who cannot have children are less than female, with the implication that the only point of being a woman is reproduction. Which is bullshit. Families are great and all, but they are not the be-all-end-all of my double X's, and sterility does not change one's femininity. Blah.)Yeah, finished - well, meh. Writing was better, but by the end none of the characters were recognizable except Alice - ILU ALICE - and Bella became even more of a Mary Sue than she had been before, which I think managed to break part of the universe. Death Baby was annoying, Edward and Jacob both came over all woobie, and the ending was the BIGGEST FUCKING COP-OUT.

That whole mess with chromosomes, and how vampires have 25 and humans have 23 which is why Alice can see their futures but she can't see werewolves' futures because they have 24, and the reason she can't see the bb is because it has the average of Bella and Edward - what the hell is that? Seriously? Other than complete and utter pseudo-intellectual laziness?

Ever.Or you will be thinking about things you shouldn't be thinking about.Don't think about boys. Thinking about boys leads to thinking about holding hands and kissing, which leads to thinking about sex, which is bad.Don't wonder about how babies are made and don't ever wonder where you came from. Clearly you popped out of your mother's vajayjay the instant your parents thought about having a child, like in The Sims 1. No sex involved.Don't wonder if your parents still have sex. (Newsflash: most parents keep having sex after their kids are born).And girls, especially don't think about other girls in the way you should be thinking about boys. I mean... don't think about boys in that way, either. If you must think about the thing you're not supposed to think about, it should be about boys. But still, don't think about it.In fact, don't even read these books, because they include boys, and a girl who tries to seduce a boy who - like all good boys - won't do that thing you're not allowed to think about with her. Because he's the perfect boy. But don't think about him.Because you don't need to think about sex. You don't need to be prepared. You don't need to know about protection. You don't need to know that some boys only want you for the feelings the magic baby-maker between your legs gives him. This whole 'sex' thing? It just happens. Magically.

11,29392060,08/06/2008,1.0,"Breaking Dawn just might be one of the worst books I have ever read. Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse can stand together as a fairly pleasing, lovable trio. Breaking Dawn seems almost unrelated to the series, like some crazed, over-the-top fan fiction. In the first three books, Stephenie Meyer creates this world of seemingly realistic magic – realistic because it is bound by explainable rules, and the characters within the world have retainable qualities from book to book. Though New Moon shows how utterly weak and pathetic Bella is sans Edward, it seems a natural progression of her needy personality that was introduced during the development of their relationship in Twilight. It seems as if in Breaking Dawn, Stephenie Meyer ran out of ideas for her characters or else decided to completely remake them and ignore the logistics she created for these magical creatures. It might as well have been named Breaking Rules.First let’s start off with Bella’s personality. Though her aversion to the wedding ceremony is over-done and her self-deprecating attitude by this point is impossibly trite, it seems like the classic Bella. By the time she finishes her honeymoon with Edward, she has gone from being this average teenager who is in love enough to marry her boyfriend but doesn’t want to jump into a marriage for fear of being thought of as “small-town”, to a married, pregnant eighteen year old who is so intent upon keeping her incubus child that she is willing to die so that the thing can live. Oh, and she has also become somewhat reminiscent of a crazed sex-addict. She is annoyed that Edward wants to go out and explore the island with her, snorkeling and hiking and doing fun activities. She would rather just stay in the house and have sex all day, every day, for weeks at a time. That’s disgusting. Also defying any sort of logic is the fact that once she realizes she might be pregnant, it is confirmed by the fact that her stomach has a little bulge and she feels the baby kick. The five-day-old embryo. Right. It’s almost like Stephenie Meyer wanted to stuff five years of normal life into Edward and Bella’s magical existence for the sake of not having to write a fifth book. Although Bella’s pregnancy was a surprise to the vampire world, the event seemed utterly contrived. By the time I finished reading the honeymoon scene, I was having to shut the book to collect myself. I felt my mind had been violated, like Stephenie Meyer had just mind-raped me through nearly 100 pages. I had to force myself to continue reading. It only got worse.I was annoyed that Stephenie decided to use a whole third of the book for Jacob’s perspective. What sort of structure is that? It’s just a lame excuse to develop the plot from an easier angle. It’s a total cop-out. Why even write a version of Twilight from Edward’s perspective if you can just throw in alternate perspectives wherever it makes things easier? Once Bella becomes pregnant, she ceases to be Bella. We see most of the pregnancy through Jacob’s eyes, and Bella’s stubbornness is annoying. I didn’t even feel compassion or sympathy for her. Edward speaks of it as a “thing”, Carlisle is afraid of it, they say it’s an incubus and not even a real infant, that it eats its way out of its mother’s womb, and yet Bella wants it, is willing to die for it. What? Since when did Bella want to be a mom? Since when did she not care about the whole “small town” image? She doesn’t seem to see how this child could complicate her life, much less end it. Plus, the thing grows at an alarming rate. Within a week or two, Bella’s stomach is large enough that she “cradles it” in her arms. This image disgusted me. First of all, I would rather not imagine a pregnant 18 year old, married or not. Second of all, the logistics of it bother me. Like oh, of course she gets through 9 months of pregnancy in roughly four weeks. Way to go Stephenie, it’s obvious you’re not anxious to speed the plot along or anything. Plus, with Bella’s personality it seems like she would have a hard time wrapping her head around the idea of impending motherhood, let alone be absolutely ready for it in four weeks’ time. Then the birth – grotesque, disgusting. Edward biting open Bella’s womb to free the child. Um, sick? I can only hope the movie version of this saga ends with Twilight. I can't imagine them trying to dilute the honeymoon scene, let alone the birthing scene. I can just picture the awkward energy radiating in the theatre during a movie like this. I wouldn't be surprised if there were nothing but crickets at the end, moviegoers awkwardly shuffling out of the theatre, avoiding eye contact with those they came with. But moving on, how about the lovely celebrity-coupleish name they burden her with? Renesmee. Gag me. I wonder what Stephenie Meyer was even thinking. And to further her perverted, illogical tirade, Stephenie has Jacob imprint on the infant Renesmee. Wow, didn’t see that one coming. Of course, how perfect for Bella. She can have Jacob in her life AND have him be happy. Wow. Applause. Great solution. Not. I would rather he imprinted on Leah. That would have made much more sense. Once Bella becomes a vampire, she continues to remain the exception to every rule while being utterly oblivious to the fact. Bella! You’re so under control! Really? I am? What? Bella! You are unusually graceful! Really? Was that jump good? Bella! Your mind can block everything out, you have super powers! And oh, you can conveniently use them to protect the ones you love! Really? Is that good? Am I being modest enough? Gag me. How convenient to the plot that Bella can skip over all the newborn vampire nonsense and just be herself. How convenient that her passions for Edward only intensify. Who needs human experiences? How convenient that Charlie gets to know the Cullens are not human. How convenient that he happily accepts that two months after giving his daughter away, he already has a grandchild the size of a 3 year old. Right. Because infant Renesmee is not nearly as interesting or cute as talking toddler Renesmee who appears to be a baby Einstein that prefers to “show” her thoughts rather than speak them. And suddenly Bella has the mental maturity of a 30 year old mother though she’s still an 18 year old who got pregnant four months ago and has a daughter who is progressing at least 5 times as fast as a normal infant. The whole plot line reminded me of a child who got bored playing the same old story with her Barbies and suddenly decided that Barbie and Ken were going to have a baby, and that baby was born and became a functioning member of the family within two minutes of play time. I was a little hopeful when the Volturi arrived for what seemed to be an inevitable war. I recalled back to when Bella mentioned something about not being able to imagine the Cullens without their head, Carlisle. I thought for sure Carlisle would make some ultimate sacrifice to save Edward and Bella. At least one major casualty would have breathed some feeling into this book other than “everything is perfect because Bella and Edward defy every bit of logic.” But no. In true predictable fashion, Alice returns and saves the day. Bella grows some balls and radiates her “shield” over everyone. Pathetic Bella, the damsel in distress, the one who always had to be protected and saved, now the one protecting and saving everyone else. How convenient. No fighting occurs, Renesmee is assured a life of immortality and will conveniently grow up extra fast for Jacob. Bella and Edward live to have more sex. Everyone lives happily ever after.

And there is this whole fight lalalallalla. But I dont care about that.

The deeper and deeper I got into the absurdness of it all, I realized what it reminded me of: a bad fan fiction.Let's start with the *shudder*...pregnancy. GAH! GAH GAH GAH! What was Meyer THINKING, making it possible for Bella to be pregnant? What the hell was she thinking?Now that I read Meyer's statements more carefully, I realize that she never actually said it was impossible for a male vampire to impregnate a human girl, just that a female vampire couldn't bear children. I guess we (the readers) just jumped to conclusions with that.But regardless, I have never thought of Bella as particularly maternal. So imagine my surprise when the fried chicken she makes one day nauseates her! My reaction: ""...No! It can't be! She can't be! It's impossible, damn it!"" And then when she realizes she's late, here's my reaction: ""NOOOOOOOOOOO! NO! NO NO NO NO NO! WHAT THE HELL!""Yes, it's that bad.And then shortly after it goes into ""Book Two,"" which is Jacob's point of view.Now, I hated Jacob. Almost. I guess it was more dislike, since I don't usually hate things. But anyways, I was expecting his view to be boring and disappointing.But as we got further into it, I started to have a better understanding of him. It was refreshing to get a glimpse into his mind, to see his feelings. I have always been one of Team Edward before now, so imagine my surprise when I realize that Jacob is now one of my favorite characters!Seth and Leah are great characters too. Leah really developed--all she needed was to be able to push away from Sam. I have always liked Leah, truthfully. But even though I liked her, I could never truthfully say she had a great personality. Breaking Dawn changed that.And in Jacob's point of view, we see how badly the pregnancy is affecting Bella--this is also a good part of the book. Too often in fan fiction I see pregnant!Bella having a blissful time. But the pain and misery of it in Breaking Dawn is absolutely wonderful. A new take on it, I thought, and my opinion of the book increased as I got to that part.But then the book just HAS to go to Bella's point of view again. And shortly after she gives birth (also plenty of pain there), she is dying, and Edward has to change her into a vampire quickly. I can't say I like the circumstances for the change, but alright. Fine. But the disappointment comes during the change.She mentions the pain, the monstrous fire that keeps licking at her skin and causing her pain at every moment. But she fails to describe it well--after a while, she's grown used to it. How exactly do you get used to being in a fire? I just don't get that. And one other fact--she stays still throughout the whole transformation. She should be screaming, thrashing about. How did she suddenly become this ""strong, silent type?""Don't worry...one of the biggest disappointments is yet to come.She wakes up, and all her senses have been magnified: the entire world looks different. That's not the disappointment, though. The big disappointment is that there is barely any mention of thirst. Know why? Because she has this super-self-control that allows her to completely skip the typical YEARS of savageness, the newborn stage! Yes, everyone. She is that awesome.She has become a Mary-Sue. If you don't know what that is, go look it up on Wikipedia now.Is that not enough to convince you of her Sue-ness? Well, as if that's not enough, a little later she discovers that she can protect people with her mind!But that's for later. Right now, let's rewind a little bit.Remember Bella's kid? Turns out it's a girl. What's her name?Renesmee.You heard right. Renesmee.Try pronouncing that. I can think of a lot of mispronunciations: REEN-smee, REH-neh-smee, etc etc. Correct pronunciation: ruh-NEZ-may. Combo of Renee and Esme.And as if that were not enough, she's nicknamed after the loch ness monster.And as if THAT, were not enough, Jacob imprints on her.Ugh. I mean, most of us want him to eventually get over Bella, right? But the way Meyer does it? It's like, POOF! The moment he sees Renesmee, Bella vanishes! She was never there!It's laughable.Using such an easy way of getting rid of Jacob. Ugh. Meyer could've at least spent time on the solution.Meanwhile, a series of events which I don't feel like explaining happen which lead the Volturi to come to try to kill Nessie. Nessie is Renesmee, if you can't figure it out. Concerned, the Cullens gather seventeen other freaking vampires as witnesses. Don't ask me for what, I don't feel like explaining.And obviously all of these vampires get along, even though most of them prey on humans and a whole neighborhood of them live a few miles away.And as if that weren't enough, almost all of them have superpowers, completely deflating one of Meyer's earlier claims.So here they are, all gathered, when suddenly the Volturi get convinced that Nessie is not a threat and they all leave peacefully--though not without killing Irina, who ratted all of them out but did so on a false claim.And then they lived happily ever after.Yes, that really happened. The title of the last chapter was even ""Happily Ever After.""Personally, I would've liked to see a fight at the end.But then, even after all this, you still say, ""But at least Alice was there to make the story better, right?""Well, no. She was barely there for anything. Which takes away a lot of the series' appeal.And while we're on the topic of characters, may I also add that no one was acting in-character?And while we're on the topic of out-of-character-ness, I would also like to say that Charlie found out about werewolves and that the Cullens weren't human (he doesn't know they're vampires, just that they aren't human), but guess what? He barely cares about it! Who would've thought?Remember earlier, when I said this was like a bad fan fiction? Let's weigh all the characteristics.Everything that happened in cliche fan fiction happened here, including:- Pregnant Bella- Stupid names- OOC-ness (Out Of Character, if you can't figure it out)- The commonness of gifted vampires- Bella's self-control gift- Two gifts for Bella- Jacob imprinting- Charlie knowing the secretI'm sure there's more, but I don't want to think a lot.Please don't read this.August 30th, 2008 UPDATE:Okay, so I've gotten over the initial shock of the book. I'm not going to write another review, because I'm still in denial that the book was actually okay. So I'm just going to say that I respect it. I'm never, ever going to like it, of course. But I respect it.October 4th, 2008 UPDATE:I changed my mind. I hate this book again with a passion. I no longer respect it or Meyer.",108,-0.9799,0.115,0.789,0.096,0.5110745396295855,NEGATIVE,1.0
15,8525181,11/01/2007,5.0,"I'll preface by saying that I did enjoy this book - I love the story overall, and the characters, and the premise and all of that. I don't have a problem with Bella, and it was funny seeing her through Jacob's biased eyes - on the contrary, I like Bella. I wouldn't be able to read these books if I didn't. What really bothers me most about this series are the obsessive fans.This is one of those series where the obsessive fans take the story away from the author, writing their own versions, coming up with their own theories and all the rest of it. I don't begrudge them that, but what really annoys me is when they say that Meyer has it all wrong, that that's not what vampires are like, and on and on. I came across a few discussions over what would happen in this book, which I tried to avoid, but people were coming up with all sorts of things: about babies, about what Bella's special gift would be, about the wedding and so on.I would have thought that this book would have completely satisfied people, but from the glimpses I've caught (much to my annoyance), a lot of fans seem almost scornful of how things panned out. Maybe it's because there was too much of a build-up, like with the last Harry Potter book, and it creates an anti-climax. I'd like to pat myself on the back for avoiding that feeling, by steering clear of all the online discussions - though it's hard on Goodreads, because people's comments pop up on your updates page. Grrr.The pregnancy took me by surprise, but I loved it. It was plausible, it was scary, and by switching Point-of-View to Jacob in the middle there (an ingenious device), we not only get a more fleshed-out perspective of that period, a wise move, but it makes Bella's life more fragile, precarious, uncertain. For a while there I was extremely worried that she wouldn't survive. Edward's pain was so very real, and really got to me.The baby device is quite common in fantasy - the baby that will save the world or the baby that will unite people and so on. Here it was much more personal though, and I appreciated that. Renesmee was a little too perfect, but her bizarre nature balanced it enough that she wasn't too sickly sweet. I wasn't surprised at Jacob imprinting with her - and it was certainly an effective way of handling that pesky problem! I wonder, though, was Bella less interesting when she no longer had to worry herself over two men?As for the other characters, apart from Bella and Jacob, they're very much in the background, which was rather disappointing. Playing their typical support roles, it felt a little rushed at times, almost like Meyer's heart wasn't really in it - as I understand it she wrote this book because her publisher wanted her to, like with the previous two; Twilight was meant to be a stand-alone novel in the beginning. [I've since learnt from a friend who saw her interviewed that she had this planned out from the beginning and had to convince her publishers to let her do it in four books. But it still felt a bit rushed and half-hearted in places.]Is it just me or is Jacob Meyer's favourite? He gets an awful lot of airtime here, which gives us a chance to feel really comfortable with him, and he has a nice irreverent tone, but it still leaves many of the other characters thinly sketched. Even Edward, I never really feel like we break through his mystery and outward charisma to the person beneath. Bella sees him as a kind of idol, and as such, he's almost inhuman (ha ha). His emotions come across, but not so much his reasoning, or motivations. I'm not sure, maybe that's not it exactly, but I always want more Edward and want I'm given just doesn't satisfy me.Now, it was always going to be tricky, writing Bella as a vampire. All her main quirks as a human are gone - the clumsiness, the blushing, the sweetness - which Meyer always used to define her character, so I was really pleased at how she managed to make Bella a convincing vampire while still retaining enough to make her familiar. Her voice doesn't really change, but her actions have. She's much less vulnerable, and that's bound to change anyone. But her body language has been altered, and her confidence too. It worked well. Edward, too, no longer treated her like a fragile human but effortlessly shifted his perspective and treated her as more of a partner, less as an eccentric pet.The climax was less climactic than the other books, but the fact that it didn't end on violence like the previous book gave the end of the series the right kind of ending, a peaceful one. Bella's special ability made sense, and while it's not visibly impressive, it's certainly very useful and fits her character: always trying to protect others.Is it just me or do all the books start with Bella in a car? I can't remember how the others started and I didn't get a chance to have a look, but it seemed like they do. If they do, it's an interesting comfort zone.I love Meyer's version of the vampiric species - it's original and very well fleshed out, and differs at important points from the more generic, Anne Rice version, making them much more attractive, less vulnerable creatures. This is an addictive series, with as many detractors as fans, and with as much hoo-ha as Harry Potter. They're not as well written as the Harry Potter books, but they're nothing to cringe over either - you don't read them for the prose, but for the story, which is emotionally intense and very, very addictive. It's a classic love story, it's just that the circumstances are a little different.So, I guess the long and the short of it is, I loved the book, yet it wasn't wholly satisfying, like there was something missing, some part of character development maybe, or maybe I'm just wishing Edward was more fleshed out, now that Bella's like him and he's no longer an alien species. I can't quite put my finger on it. But there were lots of surprises, and the plot was well-structured in three parts, three distinct stages, with all the emotional gut-punching I've come to expect from Meyer. Truly, she puts me through the wringer like Diana Gabaldon - and for this alone I will always love these books (yes, I like the feeling of being put through the proverbial emotional wringer!). It's also a great romance, though too much time was spent telling us of the bond between Bella and Edward, and not enough time showing us. Perhaps that was what bugged me?",100,0.9995,0.067,0.736,0.197,0.5168763711446639,POSITIVE,0.9688
16,2325644706,03/12/2018,1.0,"The fact that this has an above 3 rating on this website is a travesty. It's taken Snark Squad over a year to read and recap this book, in large part because it was actively awful. Listen, this isn't hating on a popular series because it's cheesy or a love story or any of that other nonsense. This is an actual garbage story. First, it's PROBLEMATIC, which is consistent from the previous entries. Bella and Edward ""can't"" have sex while she's a human, because if they have sex, Bella will probably actually die. For the entire series, Bella's sexuality is held hostage to Edward's rules and whims. Then, they finally get married, and instead of backing up her IF YOU HAVE SEX BEFORE MARRIAGE YOU WILL DIE BUT SEX AFTER MARRIAGE IS COOL message, Stephenie Meyer just makes sex horrible period? Bella isn’t allowed to enjoy sex. She can’t bring herself to talk about sex with her partner in a mature or adult way. Edward lords sex over her as a means of control. When she finally ""gets to"" have sex, it's physically dangerous for her. After she has sex, she has to repeatedly apologize for it. Bella enjoys sex, but she's ""too fragile"" to have it. Bella has to beg, plead and scheme her way into more sex. Bella gets insta-pregnant and it kills her. WHAT IS THIS? WHAT IS THIS MESSAGING? Breaking Dawn is also racist in a lot of little, strange, micro-aggressive ways. And then it's racist in very overt ways. Stephenie Meyer made the Native Americans in her story werewolves, and then spends the entire series calling them feral, wild, dogs, smelly and assuring us they are the lesser supernatural race. Then, in this book, we get vampires from all over the world, and all of the people of color are wild or described in the most painful and stereotypical ways. And then, in the worst turn of events ever, Jacob  imprints on A BABY. And if anyone tells you ""it isn't like that,"" question their reading comprehension, because it is LIKE THAT AS HELL. At BEST, it is child grooming. At worst, we have to read about a pedophile over and over again. ""But they are supernatural beings who don't follow our rules."" Like, okay people. If that's what you need to tell yourself to feel good about reading a man fall in love with a days old baby. I, for one, hated it. It's gross, especially because it's meant to be this epic love. Imprinting as a concept is messed up because it robs agency from especially the women in the equation. It's extra gross when that woman is actually A BABY. You guys, it's implied that the entire reason Jacob even liked Bella was because of a pull toward HER UNFERTILIZED EGG? LIKE W H A T T H E H E L L. But okay. Let's say you don't care about all the awful messaging in this book, from misogyny to pedophiles, and racism in between. This also is not a good story? It's nearly 800 pages of NEXT TO NOTHING HAPPENING. 800 pages and we rush past the marriage (the ceremony is skipped over), get a chapter of honeymoon, then she's pregnant and we get the pregnancy and delivery FROM TWO DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES WHY, and then the Volturi take MONTHS to get to Fork and I swear to god, at one point the vampires spend an entire night staring at each other. I'M NOT JOKING. In the last 30ish pages, we get the big ""showdown,"" but after gathering all of these incredibly powerful vampires, the big showdown is a bunch of people talking in a field for 4 chapters. And then that's it. And then it's over.AFTER 800 PAGES. It was boring, plot-less, repetitive, Bella consistently cheats her way through narration, knowing things she couldn't possibly know. Meyer plays fast and loose with her own vampire rules. Bella is immediately the best at everything, so there is absolutely no tension there. We spend 3 books building up to OH NOES BABY VAMPS ARE DANGEROUS! And then in like one hot second it's like ""lol, it's okay, Bella is too special to be dangerous."" Wow. Payoff. Nothing makes sense, everything is the worst, why do people like this, please send help.

17,29278193,08/04/2008,1.0,"I gave Breaking Dawn several days' worth of chances and it did nothing but stun, anger, and disappoint me. I enjoyed the first three books, despite how badly written and full of grammar mistakes and typos they were, because they were fun and exciting and took me away from a sucky year at college. Breaking Dawn, however, was so shockingly awful that I actually burst into hysterical laughter every time something drastic happened. I actually was unable to read it in one sitting like I wanted to because my brain couldn't handle the ridiculousness for more than an hour at a time. Not even considering how insanely bad the plot and writing were, the morals the book presents made me wonder how Stephenie even managed to get it published. Moral #1: Marriage is easy. Bella doesn't have to pay for, take care of, or do anything in the way of keeping her marriage going. Not even touching on the whole Mr. Perfect issue. Moral #2: The only thing worth staying alive for is sex. Bella never stopped considering her choice to become a vampire until she had sex with Edward and then suddenly wanted to hold back. Crying and begging him to screw her because her happy dream was over? Come on girl, have some pride. Pull yourself together, Bella. Sex isn't everything. Moral #3: Women are only good for babymaking. ""Had her body changed because she was a werewolf? Or had she become a werewolf because her body was wrong? The only female werewolf in the history of forever. Was that because she wasn't as female as she should be?"" Are infertile females less female because they can't make babies and that's all women are good for? Stephenie thinks so. Moral #4: All of your problems will be solved for you, so don't try to fix them. That year of wanting to drink human blood? Don't worry about it, you'll just skip it anyway. That baby who's killing you from the inside? Don't sweat it, Edward will just make you a vampire and then you'll be fine. Annoying cub boy won't fall out of love with you? Chill out, he'll imprint on your babies and then you won't ever have to worry about them getting in the way of your perfect love life again. And that leads into #5...Moral #5: Pedophilia is okay! Just wait until they get old enough (or in Renesmee's case, wait until they're 6 years old because then they'll look old enough) and you're good to go. I could keep going with the morals but I feel the need to touch on the fact that the ending was the biggest and most awful cop-out I could've imagined her writing. The other books had incredibly kickass, awesome action scenes that pulled me in and wouldn't let me stop reading. Breaking Dawn just built up and built up and then the Volturi just decided, whatever, no battle. Go home with your mutant baby. See you in six years when she tries to make babies with the werewolf and we get pissed off at you again. There were no struggles. There were a lot of solutions springing from midair and the preparation for sacrifices that were never made. And that is why Breaking Dawn ruined the Twilight series for me.

THIS WASN'T AN EPIC NOVEL, IT WAS A CONTAGIOUS RASH.Everything we came to know (and presumably love) about the characters and the way their stories were told in the first three books completely sh*t the bed in this one. It was impossible to bond with any of the characters in the book, especially Edward, who became no more than a peripheral sperm donor.Each plot development/""twist"" was either so ridiclulous I wanted to scream, or so predictable that I had to groan. For this I rented a hotel room and stayed-up all night?Oh, and BREAKING DAWN the MAJOR MOTION PICTURE......I just can't wait to see that gruesome Anne-Rice-Mayfair-Witch-Style-DIY-Cesaerean-Section brought to life on the big screen!!Nah, how about a colonoscopy instead?FOLLOW-UP:Now that I've had a few days to calm down from my violent objections, I am ready to explain in detail why, I feel, this book sucked. In plot order:1) The wedding was pretty good, but it was the only time we saw Angela, Mike, Jessica and Ben in the entire book. What happened? SM just kind of abandoned them. And Renee fell off the face of the earth, too. And I think that Bella's nearly non-existent reaction to meeting Tanya was out of character for her. The Bella we all know would have stressed it alot more.2) The ""sex"" scene(s) irked me on so many levels. First of all, how does a vampire with no blood flowing through his body acheive an erection? I preferred SM's method of politely skirting the subject in the first three books to her method of making the subject increasingly more annoying and prevalent throughout BD. Emmett's comments and innuendos became almost as annoying as Bella's out of control libido. She can resist the bloodlust but not the sex lust...Is she a vampire or a porn star?3) The pregnancy sent me over the edge. How does a vampire with no seminal fluids impregnate a woman? Bella's 2-month transition from high school senior to wife and mother was too difficult to swallow....and I was a young wife and mother myself.4) Rosalie. We already hated her and making her into a Nazi midwife didn't help.5)The birth. OMFG WHAT WAS THAT???? If I had read that before I had kids I would have scheduled myself for a tubal ligation the next day.6) The name Renesme is so awful that everytime I looked at it (6 million times over) I choked on it. She couldn't have just used Carlie? It might have helped us bond with the beastly little mutant.7) Where did our Edward go? The object of 60 million readers' desires turned into a sulking and helpless sperm donor. THAT'S NOT SEXY.8) Jacob had to be a pedophile? Even as a strong Team Edward supporter, I always loved Jacob just for being goofy and sweet and sincere (mostly) and all the good things about a 16 year old boy. Better off alone or with Leah than with (essentially) his ex-girlfriend's daugher. YUCK.8) Bella's transition from super klutz to super hero was too much. Throwing the shield across the field to defeat Jane and Alec, the two biggest badasses in Italy? Oh, c'mon.9) The battle with the Volturi was no battle at all. All of those vampires and wolves in one place and all they could do was kill Irina? The story was too long and I don't think SM gave the characters their proper attention. It read SO much differently than the first three. We didn't have enough quality time with our old favorites...not enough of Alice after the wedding and definitely not enough sexy Edward.She spent alot of time on the baby, but I found myself completely unable to bond with her....maybe because even Bella spent more time worrying about sex than she did about the baby.

20,50300093,03/24/2009,1.0,"Twilight was bad. Not offensively bad, but where Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse failed, Breaking Dawn succeeded. It managed to piss me off, make me laugh, and offend me.What's wrong with Breaking Dawn? Oh, where do I start? Let's see, inconsistent, dense characters, nauseatingly corny passages, enough plot holes to march a large army through, and a climactic ending that is anything but climactic. The ending did surprise me, but only because I never thought it was possible to write such a terribly pointless story. The beginning of the book is a continuation of the end of Eclipse, with Bella preparing for hers and Edward's wedding. Just how we came to the two of them getting married is bad enough; she wants to have sex with Edward and be turned into a vampire. Edward won't turn her into a vampire until she's his wife, and they both want to wait until after they're married to have sex. Why on earth morals and ethics are playing any part in this story whatsoever is beyond me. Edward claims that, while he believes he's going to hell just for being a vampire, he doesn't want to risk everything by destroying his one last virtue in the hell-fires of premarital sex. He also doesn't want to compromise Bella's virtue. *Cough*. 'Cause, you know, having sex with a creature your religion would consider an abomination is OK, just as long as you're married to it first.Does Bella want to marry Edward? Nope. She's only doing so because of the aforementioned sex and vampirism. But her reasons for being reluctant to marry are just as ridiculous as her reasons for going through with it; she's afraid of what her family and friends will think of her and Edward getting married at the tender ages of 18. OK, so willingly turning into a vampire and disappearing forever is all right, but heaven forbid someone whispers that you're too young to get married? If you're removing yourself from human society, what the hell does it matter? The honeymoon is just fraught with peril as Edward attempts to have sex with Bella without completely cutting loose and crushing her skull in a passionate rage. If I had a dime for every time....Bella gets pregnant and we spend the whole middle third of the book hearing about her condition through the eyes of Jacob the Wolfboy, Bella's best friend who is in love with her. The pregnancy is killing her, but she refuses to do anything but carry it to term (just a hint of anti-abortion sentiment there, huh?). It takes Jacob the Wolfboy to figure out that the baby needs blood to thrive in the womb....an entire family of vampires (one of whom is a 400 year old doctor) couldn't figure out that a baby fathered by a vampire would need blood? She has the baby, a daughter, that she names Renesmee (a hybrid of the names Renee and Esme...stupid fucking name). Renesmee is, of course, perfect. After nearly dying in childbirth, Edward turns Bella. Something I can't quite figure out is why he uses a giant steel syringe to inject his venom directly into Bella's heart...and *then* gives her small bites everywhere. One bite is enough to turn someone, so...Bella supposedly hates lying. Meyer drills this into our heads several times throughout the first three books. She hates lying, she's not any good at it, it makes her uncomfortable, etc. Not to mention the many times Bella became angry with Edward for not telling her the whole truth (his misguided attempt at protecting her from anything unpleasant). You would think that someone who dislikes being kept in the dark by the man she loves would go to great lengths to ensure she never does the same to him. You would think that, but apparently you would be wrong. The process of transformation from mortal to immortal is supposed to be exceedingly painful, stretching out over a period of two to three days. While everyone else who's undergone the transformation has writhed in pain for the duration, screaming for days on end, brave little Bella manages to keep herself completely under control. She never moves, never opens her eyes, never speaks, for fear that if she does, the screaming will commence. Then, when the transformation is complete and her pain is gone, what is her very first act as the newly immortal member of clan Cullen? She lies to them. Yes, she lies. She can't bear the thought of Edward feeling badly...feeling personally responsible for her days of intense agony. So she does the exact same thing that she previously, on many occasions, chastised him for. She pretends the transformation was a cake-walk, that she doesn't remember anything about it...thanks to Edward's brilliant idea of loading her up with morphine before injecting her with vamp juice. Apparently, Bella is much more special than anyone could ever imagine. While everyone else goes through their ""newborn"" phase of vampirism, spending a good year consumed by blood thirst and uncontrollable, unpredictable PMS-type mood swings, Bella is capable of skipping right over *that* unpleasantness. She comes very close to running down humans in the woods to feast on their flesh, but her concentration is broken by Edward and she's able to hold her breath and run away before killing anyone. Edward is just awe-struck by her self control. (By this point, I was wondering how long it would be before the rest of the vampires donned togas, placed a crown on Bella's head, and began bowing at her feet.)The characters are completely different. One expects characters to change over the course of a single story, much less a series of stories, but generally those changes are progressive. They mature and they change, for better or worse. These characters, on the other hand, are just different. The Edward from Twilight is completely absent in Breaking Dawn. Gone is the willful, wise, protective, stoic, quiet, bossy Edward. He's been replaced by his pussy-whipped, Bella-worshiping doormat of a twin. Bella herself has become even *more* selfish than we've ever seen her. The other characters are nothing more than peripheral. Meyer could have done a lot with the characters she introduced in the first book, but she failed spectacularly. There's a slew of new characters introduced in Breaking Dawn, none of whom were capitalized on the way they *could* have been. One of the major plot points in the first book is the Cullen clan's need to move around frequently. Every three or four years, the family moves before the people in the area become suspicious of their non-aging. But at the end of Breaking Dawn, no one seems even slightly interested in leaving Forks. Renesmee will end up with Jacob the Wolfboy, and Bella is perfectly happy that her father knows just enough about her ""situation"" to be able to visit and not be in danger of knowing their deepest, darkest secret. On the other hand, Bella laments that her mother doesn't need to know anything since she's ""too fragile"" to have any hint that her daughter's changed. I still have no idea what on earth they plan on doing if Bella's mother drops in for a surprise visit once she finds out from her ex-husband that they have a granddaughter...that her own daughter never bothered to tell her about.We eventually find out that Bella is referred to as ""a shield"" which is why Edward can't read her mind the way he can other peoples. She's trained to project her shield to protect others from psychic attacks by other vampires. Then there's the *thrilling* ending in which the Cullens and their various vampire friends unite against the Volturi. But there's no battle. After page after page of build-up, absolutely *nothing* happens. Bella, in a fit of intense rage, is able to project her shield to everyone in her group, and the Volturi, without any evidence of any law being broken, give up and leave. The end of the book is so nauseatingly happy it's amazing I was able to keep my gag reflux under control. Edward and Bella are together and they have their little girl child (who, conveniently, will be fully mature at the age of 7 years, then stop aging and be immortal). Oh, Renesmee is also the new object of Jacob the Wolfboy's affection (apparently, shapeshifters/werewolves ""imprint"" to find mates and Renesmee just happens to be the lucky imprintee). So after spending 3 1/2 books pining over Bella, Jacob's affection is rapidly shifted to her daughter. *That* was quick and easy clean up. Constant Bella worship, smarmy ""gag me with a spoon"" Hallmark moments, easy-outs in regards to tying up lose plot ends so everyone can be happy, an overuse of cliche's, and a complete deviation from character personalities. What do all of these things indicate? A book which was written for the express purpose of making more money. It's glaringly obvious. I could overlook it if it were a stand-alone story, but Meyer did a great disservice to her readers by sucking them into a story that started out fairly tolerable, then ending it with this crap.I ""shuddered"" and ""grimaced"" through the entire thing.

The book begins in foreign, even (gasp!) exciting territory... something so outlandish... in the right hands it just might have worked. Or at least redeemed the three prior mediocre novels. Meyer does neither.This belonging in the long, half-assed written series soon fizzles after the first of two or three total anticlimaxes. Two words describes what follows: Freak Show! And not the cool Tod Browning freaks we are accustomed to (""We Accept You! We Accept You! One of Us!""), or the psycho family in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre films. These freaks are here to keep the family values intact, to uphold the freaky status quo. These are the lamest cardboard characters ever! Obviously someone asked to shell out tens of dollars for one of the firstly printed hardcover editions will not be respected: Meyer has fooled everyone... the series is a long and sad disappointment. I can finally put that to rest; the ""Twilight"" series, at least for me, will now become a gauge to check somebody's true literary intellect! Meyer dedicates this steaming pile to her audience: a buncha teen girls hungry for some literary gum for their developing brains to chew on, with ""good taste."" What a joke.

23,179979823,06/27/2011,1.0,"Honestly, if I could give this garbage a rating of negative seven trillion stars, I would. Because that's how awful it is.I'm sorry if you love this book and this series, but friend? You need to read this book CRITICALLY, because it is a fucking trainwreck. Let's break this down because I have a lot of thoughts.THIS BOOK NEEDS EDITING LIKE WHOA- Seriously, the writing is so bad. So clunky. So drawn out. - This thing is 756 pages long. It could have been half that length and still covered everything it needed to.- When, after 600-odd pages, we finally get to ""OMG THE VOLTURI ARE COMING""?? Instead of jumping straight into the action, we're treated to like 75 pages of ""Oh hey, like twenty million more vampires turn up, lemme describe them for you in great detail!"" and ""Then I went to find this guy who may or may not be shady and I'm not entirely sure why Alice is sending me there oh well, let's just dedicate an entire chapter to it anyway tralalalala""- The whole book ends with THE VOLTURI JUST LEAVING?!?!?!?!?! Like...ARE YOU SHITTING ME, MEYER?? Like two thousand fucking pages of this terrible writing and THAT'S how you write the final climax?! I AM SO FUCKING MAD, YOU GUYS. IT'S SUPER RACIST- You can argue all you want that having a Native American character makes everything okay. It really doesn't. - The perfect white vampires call the Indigenous characters dogs. They tell them they stink. They look down on them. They give them their castoff clothing. They give them food in big metal bowls with ""Fido"" on the side of it. It may not be INTENTIONALLY racist, but it reinforces hundreds of years of ""white people are better because of the colour of their skin"" bullshit. - It's full of cultural appropriation. - When other Indigenous characters turn up - this time from South America - they're referred to as savage, as feral, as wild. And Bella's afraid of them before they've even said a word. - Carlisle TOOK JACOB'S BLOOD WITHOUT PERMISSION AND DID ALL KINDS OF TESTS ON IT?!?!?!? THE FUCK. NO. That is waaaaaaaaaaay too close for comfort to all kinds of atrocious medical experiments that were done on minority groups without their knowledge. Waaaaaaaaaay too close to eugenics. N.O.P.E.- And then you add in the fact that Leah basically ends up infertile as a result of becoming part of the pack, and oof. IMPRINTING IS FUCKED UP- The whole ""women basically have no say in the matter but it doesn't matter because these guys are TOTALLY perfect for them"" thing is gross.- Then you add in Quil imprinting on A TODDLER, which is a) hella gross and b) literally grooming.- And THEN you get to Jacob imprinting ON A FUCKING NEWBORN BABY- Except that it goes further than that and basically implies that the only reason Jacob was ever interested in Bella was because the egg that would become Renesmee was hanging out in Bella's ovary??? - Renesmee is repeatedly sexualised, despite being an infant. She's super touchy-feely with Jacob and the way that it's written made me repeatedly uncomfortable because SHE'S THREE MONTHS OLD JESUS FUCKING CHRIST. - A literal infant (chronologically, if not developmentally. But even developmentally, she's not much more than a toddler) is wearing the equivalent of a promise ring. No thank you please.BELLA'S STORY IS A TERRIBLE EXAMPLE FOR TEENAGE GIRLS- She doesn't want to get married. But she goes through with it because Edward refuses to sleep with her unless they're married. So she talks herself into it. - Her reaction to the wedding is basically red flag after red flag after red flag. GIRL. RUN. - The honeymoon is also red flag after red flag after red flag. She's clearly not ready to have sex, and yet she's built it up so much in her head that she feels like she has to.- Her desire to have sex is constantly is constantly belittled and repeatedly shut down by Edward. GIRLS DON'T WANT SEX, BELLA. GOD. - She has no interest in having children, has never spent any time around children, and is kind of thrilled that marrying Edward means she doesn't have to worry about children. And yet ends up insta-pregnant.- The second she gets pregnant, she's all ""OMG I WAS WRONG ALL THIS TIME, I REEEEEEEALLY WANT TO HAVE KIDS!!!!!!!""- The baby literally sucks the life out of her? Like, to some extent, that's what babies do anyway. But this is EXTREME life sucking. - Edward basically plans to drug her and abort the baby?? - When that fails because Rosalie gets involved, his next best plan is to get Rosalie out of the way, drug Bella, abort the baby, and then have Jacob sleep with her a bunch of times so that she can have the children she apparently now wants??? - She has literally no self-worth, to the point where when anybody looks at her once she's a supermodel-worthy vampire, she's still all ""WHY WOULD THEY BE LOOKING AT ME, I'M HIDEOUS??""- In short, literally EVERYTHING that happens to Bella in the course of this book, up to and including her caesarean-by-teeth, is fucked up and not even remotely okay. IN SUMMARY- This book is the worst. - The first time I read it, I literally screamed and hurled it at the wall.- I have thousands of words of receipts on snarksquad.com- Come at me.",82,-0.9936,0.139,0.758,0.104,0.4833028083028083,NEGATIVE,1.0

I didn't like it when I was 15, and at 25 I'm still not at all interested in that part of the book. - Now that I've just burned through all four books in the series, I realized that Bella's personality kind of disappears when she becomes a vampire? Like, the person whose pov we leave as a human, doesn't really match up to the pov we get when she becomes a vampire. Like suddenly she's not clumsy anymore, she's totally fine with having everybody's attention, she's no longer insecure - that one I'm totally fine with by the way, but it's like suddenly all these things that made her Bella, are now gone... Like I don't see how becoming a vampire, would suddenly make her not clumsy? Like ... missed opportunity to have a clumsy vampire, that would have been hilarious. - Forever grateful for the movie to actually show us a battle with the Volturi, even though it's only Alice's vision, the movie has all the action that you expect the book to have.In short I'm happy that I reread the series ❤",75,0.9908,0.063,0.73,0.207,0.6007812500000002,NEGATIVE,0.6018
25,29163593,08/03/2008,1.0,"I'd like to start out this review with three simple words that pretty much give away my feelings for this particular story (for those of you who have no desire to read my rant).I hated it.My friend --who stayed up reading the night it came out -- called me very early the morning of the 2nd and told me quite a bit of the plot. I was horrified. I wasn't even going to read it until she threatened to gouge out my eyes with a plastic spork. Quite honestly, I'm starting to wish I'd agreed to the spork idea. I haven't even been able to finish reading it (not in the 'I'm-a-slow-reader' sort of way either... more in the 'I-have-to-take-a-break-every-few-pages-to-retain-my-sanity' kind of way)I wont even go into the whole awful message stuff -- and there are quite a few awful messages. Truthfully, I'd be totally happy to overlook all the imprinting shit along with the married and pregnant at 18, the way Bella can't survive without a boyfriend (be it Edward or Jacob), or... well never-mind, you get the point. I'd overlook it, if the plot had been good. Quite frankly, calling all the nonsense in that book plot would be pushing it a little bit. Now, I have no problem with Mrs. Meyer's writing style -- in fact, I think she's a very good writer. She has the potential of writing a great book if only she put more thought into her plot. I was kind of hoping that there'd be some big, dramatic plot tie-up -- like Harry Potter. JK Rowling had obviously thought about her plot -- in fact, the plot of all the stories came together for the ending. It was brilliant. That was obviously not the case here. I felt almost like I was reading a bunch of half-hearted fan-fiction -- 600-plus pages at a time. None of the four books had much to do with each-other, save for the characters (scratch that, the characters might as well have been different people for all I recognized them in the end), and Bella's wish to have sex with Edward and then be turned into a vampire. I mean no offense to fan-fiction. I read this book with very little expectation because I didn't much like the 2nd, or the 3rd installment of the series. Somehow, I still managed to be very disappointed. I can't even begin to imagine the utter horror of someone who'd actually expected it to be good.Another one of my huge complaints: the Characterization. Where oh where did it go? We were getting some in the first book -- as in the character's actually seemed a bit like real people -- but it slowly began disappearing. You can't even relate to Bella because she's so... irritating/whiny/clingy/dependent/indecisive/totally unreal. Pick a word -- they all work.My main complaint: the Short Cut -- and by that of course, I mean the baby. Because, admit it! The baby was just a way to wrap up the series and tie it with a pretty, red bow. Jacob gets his girlfriend (never-mind the fact that she's Bella's daughter and less then a year old), and Edward gets to turn Bella into a vampire, guilt-free. I can't even begin to express my unhappiness for this particular plot development. I was shocked when I found out Bella was pregnant -- though, it was more of a 'Please shoot me now and spare me' kind of shocked. I honestly thought (hoped) that it wouldn't happen because it was so unrealistic. Hell, she didn't even try very hard to make it seem plausible. ::cries:: I wanted to see Bella freak out -- because come on! She's 18, just married, and has never expressed any desire to have children of any sort (much less mutated half vampire children). Add in the fact that the baby was totally unplanned and is slowly killing her... But nope, no biggie -- her heart just ""swells to twice it's normal size"" -- and here I'd hoped that that was the start of a heart attack or something.Mrs. Meyer's totally screwed over her own rules -- from start she'd made it quite clear that vampires could NOT have children. Now, while I am aware that Bella isn't a vampire so ok, sure, it's possible that could work... she could have done way better. Couldn't they have introduced the possibility sooner? Like Charlisle could have brought it up? Or Edward could have worried about it? Then it would have seemed more realistic. The two sentences it used to explain the pregnancy revealed it as the desperate short-cut it was. Also, I just have to say... Bella would NOT make a good mother. This is the girl who jumped off a bloody cliff just to hear her boyfriend's voice. Honestly, she should probably work on protecting that poor baby from herself. Perhaps it's lucky that Jacob imprinted on it? Maybe together they can work on not dropping it on it's head? The name also needs to be mentioned (though I promise it will be briefly). Why would they name their daughter after the Loch Ness Monster? If it knew, I'm sure the poor thing would be insulted (the monster, not the kid).I totally see the attraction of this series, it represents every teenager's dream romance -- I really wanted to like it, but Mrs. Meyer made it a bit difficult for me.. Every book became steadily worse -- and every single fan-fiction mistake can be found on the pages of this series, horribly enough. You know the author doesn't know their character well enough when the readers begin to complain about them being out of character. I hate to rain on the parade and all that, but I really did dislike the book. It was slow and boring and the (very small) plot-line was much too drawn out for it to be anything but a painful read.Promising... but very disappointing.

26,75348358,10/22/2009,2.0,"There's a nice progression here, anyway. I lent Twilight to Cate-across-the-road; we gave her New Moon as a present, and she lent it back to me; most recently, she bought Eclipse, and I borrowed it after she finished. I suggested to her father that the logical next step would be for me to sneak in through her bedroom window and steal Breaking Dawn. I'm not entirely sure he found this funny.____________________________________________I am shocked, dismayed, not surprised at all to discover from Usually Reliable Sources that the series has a happy ending. Let's recap. The story so far: Bella, a shy, bookish, unimaginative 17 year old girl who's never been kissed, falls in love with Edward, who once was human but has now been transformed, by means not fully explained in the books, into a robot-like being with an insatiable craving for blood. Edward tries to control every aspect of Bella's life, including stealing into her bedroom at night and watching over her while she sleeps. At one point, Edward leaves Bella abruptly, pushing her into a state of suicidal despair. He in fact believes, on rather slender evidence, that she has killed herself, and, rather than trying to find out whether she really is dead, decides to kill himself too. Bella, who has not died, is forced to risk her life a second time to save his.The rest of this review is available elsewhere (the location cannot be given for Goodreads policy reasons) ",73,-0.9827,0.168,0.766,0.066,0.4437373737373737,NEGATIVE,0.9656

Should I start with the ridiculous name ""Renesmee""? Should I start with Jacob imprinting on the vampire hybrid infant/toddler/whatever of the woman he loves? Or should I go right to the only really good part of the book, which was meeting all the different vampire clans, covens, and nomads, in preparation for a confrontation with the Volturi, only to have it build up to exactly nothing?Stephenie Meyers has betrayed her readers on a scale that I have only ever seen from Laurell K. Hamilton. A series about choice and sacrifice has as its final volume an elaborate piece fanfiction that includes every cliche you can think of, in order to tie up everyone's stories with a neat little bow. Now, I am a married woman with a child, but I certainly don't think that's something to hold up to teen girls as something they should have done by age 18. I was never thrilled with the marriage plot, although considering Meyers' background I could have lived with it, but I found the pregnancy plot ridiculous, and worse, a cop-out. Meyers could have created the same conflict with the Volturi by having Bella decided she wanted a few more years of humanity- as she almost does decide, before the pregnancy angle comes into play. She could have resolved Jacob's story by having him fall for Leah- which would have tied up that poor girl's loose ends, too. She even still could have included Bella's change as a method to placate the Volturi, only to be too little, too late. Unfortunately, instead the author seemed to decided to take the most outlandish ideas she could come up with and run with them.The good: reading the middle section from Jacob's POV. It was refreshing to have a realistic teenage voice and realistic teenage reactions to things. I also appreciated the plot involving the wolf pack, especially Leah and Seth. Unfortunately, this was mitigated by having Jacob's section focus almost entirely on Bella and the pregnancy, and ended with the most horrific delivery scene I've ever read and Jacob's imprinting on baby Nessie (no joke about the nickname, sadly). Another good aspect of the book I already mentioned, which was seeing all the various vampires from around the world, and reading about their interactions. Unfortunately, they came in to prepare for the most anticlimactic scene yet in this series.Overall, I would categorize myself as horribly disappointed. I'm still shocked that what I just read was the real book and the true conclusion to Edward, Bella, and Jacob's stories.

“I want you, and I want you forever. One lifetime is simply not enough for me.” 
I want to start this review with reminiscing my good old days when I was a teenager and had been waiting the movies to come out. Twilight was more than just my childhood imagination, it was likely my second world to escape the truth and live my life in the small town where supernatural creatures are real. Everyone wants to be someone important for those you love. This book also answered each question that I've kept in my mind. Eternity will not important, if you don't have somebody staying by your side.https://youtu.be/rtOvBOTyX00I adored Edward and his heart. In Breaking Dawn, the wedding scene made my cry like a baby by seeing that my beloved characters finally ends up together with flowers, love and many more ! Bella is so strong whether she's pregnant or not, she never wants to give up her child or her heart for anything and that makes her a better person in my opinion since I knew her.
“Now you know,"" I said lightly, and shrugged. ""No one's ever loved anyone as much as I love you.” 
It feels like forever since I started reading Twilight and my life was fulfilled by the idea that love is not only between the pages of the book, but it also exists in real life if you look at it closely.Thank you, Stephanie ! You give my youth a gift and an inspiration to create something beautiful for mankind. Love is real and my memory will stay with this series forever.

Operatic Tragedy Swapped OUT for a Happy Ever After Ending: ""I just shake my head at the missed opportunity."" - The Epic Endings EnquirerI read this book the first time out of curiosity and the second in an attempt to understand its popularity. Unfortunately it only gets 1 star for the worst HEA ending I have ever had the misfortune to read. In fact I hate the ending with a passion. I would have much preferred a titanic battle full of storm and blood with a massive death count across all sides.I.e. Alice's plan would fail, leading to a massive dramatic escalation into the final climax for the highest stakes.Jacob and Edward would fight side by side to defend Bella and 'Renesmee,' (possibly one of the worst names in literature... but trivial vs the missed dramatic opportunity in the story) against the best that the vampire rulers had to offer.It would have been a lot more meaningful for Jacob to cough out his last breaths surrounded by the heaped bodies of slain vampires while declaring to Edward, 'We are just brothers in love with the same woman.'Edward would shed tears, and whisper, 'Fare thee well my brother.'And everyone would cry and cry and cry at the heroic tragedy of it all.Then a devastated Edward would make a last ditch attempt to defend Bella and Res, losing while Bella looks on in ultimate horror.The surviving handful of wolves attempt to save her, but fail while killing the last of the vampires.Much weeping - a poetic, epic, dramatic ending rich in meaning and power...The youngest wolves survive to light the funeral pyres, remember the dead and defend their noble tribe.Sadly, such grand, operatic tragedy was overlooked in favour of drowning in the sweetest of sweet vanilla syrup.EDIT: (12/July/2017): Why do I think these novels were the success that they were? Because they tapped into a basic mythic structure known as the 'The Refusal of Suitors - Joseph Campbell' - Look it up on the web, or youtube. It's a good six minute outline of the trope.I.e. Bella refuses the local lads - they don't attract her, she's looking for something else, and she gets it in spades via two supernatural suitors. She ends up with the positive inflexion of the myth in that her marriage to Edward reveals her supernatural ""shield"" nature that would never have been revealed if she had married a local lad, or remained human with Jacob.If Edward had been a lot darker, we could have had the negative inflexion of the myth, where she would have had to escape a horrific union... but that option was also (in another massive fracking disaster) overlooked...Not Recommended. 1 'Wet Blanket on a Cold Night Ending,' stars.",51,-0.9636,0.184,0.673,0.143,0.5650392817059483,NEGATIVE,0.9995

How Your Dad Stalked Me: A supernatural love story. 
Two young children surrounded their mother, taking a seat on a couch, crusted with spilled human blood. They jumped up and down eagerly for today was the day mother would tell them the most romantic and forbidden story of how she met dad. ""Mother,"" the oldest daughter chirruped, ""Please tell us!""""Yes, mom!"" the adopted son joined in, his bottom lips quivering and his eyes wide. The famous Bella Cullen Puppy Dog Face™The mother laughed, a full and deep sound. Her face glowed, her cheeks flushed with blood. Or at least, in theory her face glowed, because her skin is now the palest of pale and the blood was probably the lunch she had eaten. ""Very well, kids,"" Bella sighed, though her heart was jumping at the thought of recollecting her love story, ""Sit down."" She gestured her children to take a seat. ""It was a very rainy day and everything was damp as I shifted to your human grandfather's house. There was a time I always whined about the weather. Little did I know, this would bring your dad and me together,"" Bella chuckled at the memory, ""During the biology class, I met my classmate. He was tall, pale, bipolar and so so mysterious..."" The mother had a swoony look in her eyes. Ah, how she had been drawn to him from the start. ""Ooh,"" the daughter squealed, ""I have a sexy biology seatmate too!""""Shh. Keep quiet if you wanna hear more,"" Bella said, ""Ah, then I came home and cooked dinner. At night, your father sneaked in my room and watched me sleep even though we hadn't even spoken!"" So charming those days had been, him tracing her jaw and braiding her hair she slept soundly, unaware of a stranger in her room. ""So romantic, mommy,"" the son said, puffing his chest, ""I'll sneak into my crush's room and watch her sleep too."" Bella suddenly looked at him with concern, ""Edward Jr. you will not-""She was cut off by her daughter, Renesmee, crooning, ""Oh she will definitely love you!""Ed Jr. added, his voice rising with enthusiasm, ""Of course she will. If not, then I'll stalk her even if it means she might hit me!""""Son, you can not do that-,"" Bella tried to quiet them down but then she paused, ""Well, technically your dad also stalked me and saved me from vampires...""""I also want to be stalked!"" Renesmee whined, crossing her arms and pouting, ""I will only marry the person who stalks me!"" She said with indignation. ""Do you want to hear or not?"" Bella sighed, though on the inside she was very proud. Her daughter had inherited her whiny nature. The children scrambled to take their place on the dried bloody couch and pressed their lips together. ""After your father saved from from vampires, I only wanted him,"" Belle settled in the story once again, ""I knew he was the one. But I also had another friend called Jacob.""""Uncle Jac?"" Ed Jr. asked, his eyebrows raised.""Yes, your uncle Jac,"" the mother looked into the distance, ""He was very different from your father, warm and protective. And there was a time we loved each other.""""You loved Jac?"" Renesmee frowned, ""But weren't you with dad?"" Then she gasped, ""You cheated on him?""""Oh no no,"" Bella held up her hand to quiet them, ""Your father left me because he thought it was very dangerous to let me mingle with the vamps."" ""But shouldn't he have protected you?"" Ed Jr. cocked his head to a side and looked at her questioningly. This was a question she had pondered over when he had left her. ""I thought so too,"" Bella added sullenly, ""But your father was smarter than me and he was a vampire and a man so he must have been right. But I was so in love with you dad that I was ready to do anything. I went with Uncle Jac and I almost jumped off a cliff!""""Really?"" Renesmee asked, her eyes wide and her blood thrumming with the non-existent adrenaline of the dumb situation, ""I wanna love someone so much that I will throw myself off a cliff.""""Ooh, ooh,"" Ed Jr.'s hand shot up, ""I want a woman to throw herself off a cliff for me. Then only I'll understand if she really loves me!""""Erm-""""Oh yes. The girl will die when you leave her,"" Renesmee shrugged with a cool look on her face that resembled her dad's, ""She'll come running back to you! You are a Cullen afterall. We always get what we want!""""Then what happened?"" Ed Jr. inquired, engrossed in the story. Bella glared at them but continued, ""Then Jacob saved me and I understood I loved him too! Then some shit happened that I don't recall but your dad proposed to me.""""What happened to Uncle Jac? Where is his happy ending?"" Renesmee voiced and Ed Jr. harrumphed in agreement.""That comes later, honey,"" Bella was annoyed. Why did her children care so much about Jacob? Nevertheless, she started, ""I just turned 18 and your dad was a hundred plus. Some people considered it paedophilia but I knew it was true love..."" Her eyes morphed a dreamy look as she remembered that fateful day. ""Then we went for our honeymoon and I got pregnant with you,"" Bella booped Renesmee's nose and smiled, ""I could have died but we miraculously survived. You had a craving for human blood when you were in my belly!"" Ed Jr. wrinkled his nose while Renesmee giggled. ""Ah. You were such a naughty child,"" Bella grinned wistfully, ""You broke my ribs. You dad had to tear my stomach using his teeth!""Renesmee's brows furrowed as she asked, ""What about C-section? Our biology teacher told us.""""Hmm, I wondered that too,"" the mother said, ""You were an unusual child. Because of this bad vampires wanted to kill you. But we saved the day!""""Your dad couldn't look into my mind and many thought that was because nothing went on in it,"" Bella burst out laughing, ""But it was because I had shield powers.""""Ooh,"" Ed Jr. jumped in, acting as if wielding as sword, ""Woosh, woosh. Like a superhero!""""Yes. Like a super hero,"" she chuckled, ""If you had been a boy, I would have named you Edward Jr."" She gestured to Renesmee. ""But I am Edward Jr."" the boy burst out, his expression worried, ""You can not steal my name!""""But you were a girl so I made up a new name,"" Bella smiled, ""Renee plus Esme. Renesmee. Your middle name, Carlisle plus Charlie. Carlie."" Renesmee snorted at the lack of originality but Bella did not catch it. Just as she did not catch anything. ""Then Uncle Jac imprinted on you!"" the mother said, ""Which means you are soulmates. He loved me because you are half of me.""""Nice! I will marry Uncle Jac who loved you for a long time and he is almost the age to be a dad,"" the daughter said, her voice filled with dreaminess, ""Ah, he will stalk me and watch me sleep and make me jump off a cliff. He is so older than me yet love is love! This is not paedophilia. Our babies will be part human, part vamp, part werewolves!"" ""We'll be just like you, mom!""~THE END~edit: i actually for once do not hate what i've written. ",50,0.9991,0.058,0.794,0.148,0.5077626495368431,POSITIVE,0.999
38,21300329,04/29/2008,4.0,"***DEFINITELY contains SPOILERS***Sorry so long, but I had a lot to say about the end of one of my favorite series.This is a hard one. Overall, I got what I wanted – The wedding, Bella’s change, Jacob imprinting, and minimal loss of life. It was the perfect fairy tale ending with a ‘happily ever after’. So I should be happy, right? To begin with, I think the book was too crowded and rushed. It could have easily been 2 books, giving us so much more in every aspect. Everything was too neatly taken apart and put back together, and I really think SM could have been more creative with that if she had more time and space for it. It just seemed a little surreal and disjointed. If she had some of these things planned all along, she really should have prepared her readers a little better. Honestly, this book didn’t feel like her writing; in fact, it felt a little shallow. However, there were a lot of surprises and twists, and I was on the edge of my seat throughout a few of the chapters, which is one reason I won't say it was bad. Bella & Edward – Not enough romance…at least not once the honeymoon was over. Their relationship is my favorite part of the series and it just went forgotten in this book. Part of the reason I read this series is because of the ‘feeling’ I get when I do (you know what I mean), and that was lost after the first 200 pages or so. I’m so happy they got married and she was changed, but it stopped short there…and the rest of the book didn’t really seem to fit with the rest of the series because of this desertion. Edward – Did he DO something to SM? I mean, I feel like she TOTALLY slacked on his character in this book! I always thought he was her favorite as well, but he was just not a strong character in this book at all. Edward is what made Twilight so ‘magical’ for me. He was mysterious, romantic, beautiful, clever, intelligent; he was everything a knight in shining armor should be. Edward stole my heart by the 4th chapter. So much of that was lost in BD. You almost find yourself feeling sorry for him for becoming Bella’s loyal lapdog. It just didn’t feel right.Bella – The clumsy school girl turns perfect vampire in record time? Seriously? Where is the angst, sorrow, pain and sacrifice we were expecting? This is what made the love between Bella & Edward so fantastical, their willingness to sacrifice EVERYTHING for each other. Then there is no sacrifice? How is that fair. Everything was just too easy for Bella in this book. I realize now that Bella is SM’s favorite character, not Edward. Bella gets to have the love of her life, amazing human sex, a baby (and we didn’t have an inkling she WANTED to be a mother), and become a super powerful vamp with no ‘newborn’ stage at all (although I was happy to finally discover her immunity to the powers of others is actually a special talent of her own…even though she did gain control over it a little too quickly for a newborn vamp, it’s nice to have an explanation nonetheless). We should all be so lucky. It was very hard to get past how everything worked out so perfectly for Bella. Even the pain during her change was overshadowed by the fact she was capable of hiding it from Edward, she was that strong already. It was actually a little annoying, I guess. The conflict with Jacob is also easily repaired as he falls out of love with Bella the moment he realizes he has imprinted on her baby daughter. But as much as Bella can’t live without Jacob, this news isn’t good news for her; she’s upset that it’s worked out so perfectly for everyone. Like I said, a little annoying. Renesmee - I actually liked the chapter of Renesmee’s birth the best. I was surprised, shocked, horrified, disgusted, absorbed, hopeful, worried, and much more. I actually felt SOMETHING, which is what was missing the most from this book compared to the others. I am in the minority, I think, in that I was happy to find out Bella was pregnant. Before I realized the fear Edward possessed over this unknown, I thought it would take a different direction. I should have known better. Either way, I still thought the surprise was a good one, and I didn’t focus on the irrationality of a vampire siring a child because, well, come on people, we’re talking fiction…fantasy…supernatural already, our minds should be open to all possibilities. I thought the explanation of why this was ‘possible’ was pretty believable. I also liked her special talent and how it was directly related to the talents of both her parents. However, I am NOT in the minority when I express the opinion that I despise the child’s name. Renesmee? Are you kidding me? Thank goodness Jacob nicknamed her ‘Nessie’ and everyone followed suit, so I had to read that name less. Why not Carlie? I mean, really!Jacob – I actually liked Jacob more in this book than any other, I think. I was always ‘Team Edward’ when it came to Bella, but I still wanted Jacob to be happy. I kept hoping he would imprint on some nice girl and they would go double date with Bella & Edward. I even started to wonder if Leah was imprinting on Jacob and how that would work? I thought that would definitely be an interesting story line. But no. Things are tidied up nicely and Jacob imprints on Bella’s daughter. Are we supposed to believe this is why they cared about each other SO much, because of his already existent attachment to her unborn child? And now he will become their son-in-law. Does that seem weird to anyone else? I expected this once we found out Bella gave birth to a daughter, but it was still a bit disappointing. I think Jacob could have ended up happy without Bella in a much more pragmatic way, personally.The Cullens – First I’ll say I missed Alice tremendously!!! I said before BD came out that someone had to die, it just had to happen, and I speculated it would be Rosalie (I was right that someone had to die, luckily I didn't care about Irina one tiny bit). I figured she would be the easiest loss for the readers to swallow. So I was definitely surprised at the more frontline role she actually played in this book, and disappointed that Alice disappeared for so long. I also wish there was more story around the Cullens helping Bella as a newborn. Having her get control so quickly and easily was actually disappointing. I was looking forward to the expanding roles of each Cullen family member helping her through that time with their different strengths. I also wish we’d had more of the other vampire tribes, I thought it was very interesting having them come together with different talents, histories and personalities. I go back to why this could have been two books, one giving the story of the wedding, the honeymoon, the baby, the change, and more of the newborn years…yes, I wanted years; another giving more of the story of these new tribes and the battle against the Volturi. With all that being said, I want to reiterate that I did enjoy the book and I was very happy with the way it ended. I just wasn’t as pleased with the story leading up to my desired ending. I wanted the ‘happily ever after’, but I wanted it to be more supernatural/vampire/even horror and less ‘fairy tale’ I guess. I hope SM gives us more of our favorite characters though, and that she takes a little more time to do so.",49,0.9998,0.091,0.673,0.236,0.6261666530534453,NEGATIVE,0.9997

40,26476578,07/06/2008,1.0,"Well, I can honestly say this is the worst book I have ever read in my entire life. (No, I didn't think it was possible when I read Twilight that any other book could suck that much, I stand corrected). First, lets begin with the positives:-The pack dynamics. Jacob being Alpha was very interesting, I loved the Clearwaters.-Leah and Jacob. I loved their relationship and how Jacob finally understands how Leah is bleeding inside. Damn, why couldn't he have imprinted on HER!?So, let's begin with the loooonnnnnggggg list of negatives. (Yes, two positives, it sucked that much). Where do I begin? Oh right:-Naturally, the book starts with Bella complaining about the missile proof car Mister Controlling gave her. Even when people are looking at her car, she's terrified of the spotlight being put on her. *rolls eyes*-The wedding was horrible. Not enough detail, and Bella didn't even look in a freaking MIRROR!-Bella tells Jacob that she and his rival are going to have a ""real"" honeymoon? WTF!-The wedding night! This is the ONE thing I've been looking forward to since the beginning, the one thing I knew that would make this series worth while. WRONG! Meyer gives virtually no detail but that Edward ripped the pillows. Okayyyy....-The pregnancy. Meyer has said constantly that vampires can't have children. And now she just ditches her own rule completely. She thinks: Scratch that, I want to put in some type of plot so lets give Bella eternal happiness and a baby! -Bella's transformation. Okay, we get you're burning. Could you actually show us how it feels and not tell us? And the hunting scene. Yawn. I felt as if I was watching some paranormal nature channel: ""The vampire stalks its prey, turning precisely ten inches to the north, turning in a one-eighty and jumps. And did you see Edward's glorious hair?""-Jacob. My favorite character in the Twilight series turns into a pedophile. I knew Meyer was going to ruin him. -The name. Renesmee. That poor poor child! Why would you do such a crime to your own BABY?-The Cullens. There was pretty much no mention of these awesome characters, and Alice turned into this one dimesional character who just likes shopping!-The vampires. Uh, I thought special powers were rare?-The fight and the fact that there was none. All the suspense, building, building, and then, no fight. Aro suddenly decides to be the good guy and leave!And last but not least:-The happy ending. Bella gives nothing and gets everything in return. Particularly, Edward and Jacob. You can't have both. You either choose your human life and Jacob or completely abandon them and live the rest of your life with Edward. You can't have everything you want. Meyer decided to reject every rule she'd created for herself and do everything in her power to give Bella a happy ending. Well, on the bright side, I'm finished with the hell Meyer has created, and I'm DONE with Bella and Edward! (No chance now of me reading Midnight Sun).

I have been slaking my thrist for more of this incredible story by rereading the first three novels over and over. Getting to read number four will be amazing! I can not wait to see what happens to these characters that I feel as if I know personally.Only three hours until I get my hands on this baby!)I have just finished reading this last novel of the Twilight series and I am breathless, emotionally drained and spent. Why isn't there six or ten stars to give this book? What an amazing way to wrap up the series! I was speeding through the pages, reading as fast as I could to find out what would happen next. The twists had me every time (Bella pregnant?! Jacob imprinting on her daughter?!) and what I was hoping (Bella turning into a vampire, her amazing power and control) left me satisfied. The only thing I was wondering about is Bella's reaction to blood. In all the other books she gets woozey and faints but in this one she is drinking it down for the baby before she is a vampire. Maybe because it was not inflicted by a cut she was okay with it, it came in a cup so she did not have to see it? Just wondering.One thing that I was so suprised to learn as I plowed through was that I was no longer thinking of Bella as a teenager, only 18 and so young. She turned into a young married wife and mother as I read on and the transformation make perfect sense. She truely matches Edward's old soul quality. The two of them are never more perfect for each other than in this book. And adding a child to their love intensified their bond for me. Although I would have liked to have seen a bit more interaction between Edward and his daughter (plus I am still mystified at Rosalie's role and why Bella turned to her for help...perhaps on my second read through it will become more clear)I am also very impressed with the tasteful way Stephenie Meyer dealt with the sex in the book. She made it so we all knew what she was implying without coming right out and saying it. Perfectly discreet for her younger readers and enough of a tease for us older ones. :)I admit I was initially disappointed with Jacob's part as narrator. I enjoy seeing things from Bella's perspective. But when I reached the end of that part of the book, after he had imprinted on Renesmee, I understood why it was vital for him to tell his side of the story at that moment. Because that is where his love for Bella finally changed and matched her own, solving the love triangle problem.The last part of the book had me on the edge of my seat. It was so wonderful to meet the other vampires and their unique talents. And the standoff against the Volturi had me alternately bawling and holding my breath. Such drama and passion. I loved it! The resolution, while good for now, makes me wonder if perhaps their may be more books in the future featuring Bella and Edward's young daughter and Jacob as the narrators having to deal with a rebuffed Volturi.All in all, I thought the book was a fitting way to wrap up the series. I know after reading a bunch of comments about this book several people are very disappointed in the turn of events but I think everything fit perfectly. I will enjoy reading it again and picking up things I may have missed. And then in December of 2008 we have the movie and the Twilight Guide to look forward to!",43,0.9984,0.027,0.81,0.163,0.5395463160388534,POSITIVE,1.0

I mean, WHAT THE FUCK??? You can't make that shit up. (Also, what kind of whack ass name is Renesmee???)

In retrospect, there are SO MANY THINGS that make me hella uncomfortable (just to name a few: the white beautiful perfect vampires against the ""savage"" indigenous people; imprinting in general is such a fucked up concept ... I mean it's basically grooming and claiming women without their consent; Bella ignoring all of the red flags and being pressured by Edward to marry her + being belittled because she wants to have sex etc.; Edward wanting to perform an abortion on her without her consent).

45,23277177,05/29/2008,5.0,"Ok now that more people have read this book, here is my long review. Be prepared to read a novel. :D I will divide this into 2 sections. The first part is my original review w/out spoilers. The second part contains spoilers.**No Spoilers**Well, Stephenie Meyer has done it again. I loved this novel just as much as the first three. Let's face it, most of her books are fairly predictable; however, she has a talent of making the predictable happen in unexpected ways. This is exactly what happens in Breaking Dawn. Well done Stephenie. Like her other novels, this took me less than 24 hours to read. The biggest critique I have is one that many have mentioned before, I am bothered by the amount of whining and seemingly ungrateful attitude Bella has most of the time but I have realized this is just her personality. In the 4th book the whining does get less frequent about half way through the novel. Anyway happy reading to those who have yet to indulge in the final book of this saga. **Spoilers Below!**I have loved all the books. I grew very attached to the characters. These books, however, are all fairly predictable. For example in book 1, you knew Edward was going to save Bella from James but you didn't know how. Book 2-You knew Edward had to come back and you knew he wasn't going to die, but you didn't know how it would work out. Book 3-You knew she was going to pick Edward over Jacob but you didn't realize the extent of her feelings. And you knew they would defeat the newborns, but you didn't know the cost of that fight. Book 4-You knew Bella and Edward were going to live happily ever after, but not how this would happen. This is where Stephenie Meyer, in my opinion, shines. The books are fairly predictable BUT she makes the predictable happen in unexpected ways. That takes talent. 1-I loved the first part of the book (although Bella's constant whining about the wedding preparations got annoying. You know you have to wear a white dress so get over it!) I loved the honeymoon scenes. I have heard several complaints that books 3 and 4 were too sexual. Here is my comparison: They are like the Harry Potter Books, each one gets a little darker and directed at a slightly older audience. Meyer's books are no different. I also think her love scenes were very tastefully done, nothing to descriptive, leaving plenty for the imagination if one wants to dwell on it or, if one doesn't, you can read it w/out having to read descriptions. It was great for both sides. I think she played the sex card very well and very tactful.  2-The pregnancy totally threw me. I wasn't expecting this at all. I love how Edward reacted. It was perfect for him to be more concerned about Bella than his child as well as to go into vampire shock. That is just who Edward is. Bella's reaction surprised me though. I guess those maternal instincts kicked in. I was just expecting more of a ""Holy crap I am 18 and pregnant"" reaction. By the way I loved the whole ""Why am I covered in feather's scene?""  3-The book 2 part of Breaking Dawn took a while to get into. I wasn't expecting to jump into Jacob's perspective. But, after I got used to it, I loved the change of pace with how he talks and views things. I loved his chapter headings as well--they were funny. I liked seeing her pregnancy through his eyes. Through Bella's it would have been the same emotions over and over, whereas, with Jacob, we got to experience several different emotional facets. 4-The pack splitting up. Although this was a side story, it threw me but I liked how it ended up. Jacob always needed to be the Alpha. I was glad to see him step up to the plate. 5-The birth was really well done. I liked that it wasn't a perfect delivery, although the earlier chapters strongly alluded to the fact that it would not be easy. The reason I loved this so much is because, in all the other books, Edward didn't want to change Bella because he didn't want to end her life. Well, he didn't have to end her life, he saved it. I thought this was perfect. I do wish that Bella had screamed more during the transformation, not because I want her to be in pain, just because it would have been more realistic. I was also surprised that the baby was a girl...I was expecting a boy. The name is weird but fitting. I am slightly bothered that Renesmee is advancing so quickly. I thought the books have had a great balance between fantasy and romance. Nessie developing so quickly kicks the fantasy notch up a bit and I didn't love that. 6-Charlie's reactions to everything were weird. He was just too calm for Charlie, it was out of character. Maybe he did this because Bella is now married and he no longer has stewardship over her but I still think he should have reacted differently.  7-It bothered me that Bella seemed to have perfect control over her thirst, again, I didn't want to see her slaughter the town, but I wish Meyer had made that first scene with Charlie (after her change) be more tempting. Like maybe have to have Bella leave for an hour because she wants to drink Charlie's blood so badly or something. Meyer just made it too easy. There was the pain in the throat but it should have been more than that especially since the other books had given us a certain buildup of newborn life. On the other hand, if Bella had gone AWOL with blood drinking, it would have not fit either. It is a fine line and I think Meyer erred on the side of caution.  8-Jacob imprinting on Renesmee. Weird but fitting. Jacob can't have Bella but he has the next best thing and now Jacob and Bella's relationship can finally be what I always wanted it to be. Maybe this part will bother those fans rooting for Jacob, but I have always been an Edward girl at heart and this was a nice touch. It makes sense in an odd sort of way.  9-The fight scene was suspenseful. I honestly didn't know how it would play out. Obviously I didn't think Bella or Edward would die but I didn't know about anyone else. Also, when Alice and Jasper ran away I figured they were trying to help but I didn't know how. I figured she was putting her love for Jasper over that of her family, which, considering they are married, makes sense. I liked this twist and I LOVED how it came together at the end when Alice brought the evidence back. I think I would have liked a little more fighting, like with the newborns in book 3, but this works too. The fact that none of the Volturi were killed leaves things open for another book possibly through Renesmee's eyes. I think that would be fantastic! We would still get to ""see"" Edward and Bella again, but we would also get to know Nessie better.  10-Bella's power. I really think it is a great power and perfect for her. She has always felt like she was the burden, she couldn't protect herself or anyone else, well now she can. I loved it.  11-I am torn on this next comment. I feel like Bella just gets everything handed to her in this book. There wasn't quite the emotional pull in this book as in the others, or rather it is different. I am sure in book 2 when Edward left, all our hearts sunk. It was really an emotional experience. I think, in order to write really believable characters, you have to have these types of pain. This didn't happen as strongly in Book 4. I think there needed to be more loss, or at least more struggles. Make her thirst more powerful or have (the thought is scary) but have someone die. Or have her make some type of choice. I feel like Meyer did hand Bella too much without the struggles.  12-This next point is such a minor detail, I shouldn't even mention it but during Bella's first hunt, she is originally hunting elk and she finds a nice big buck (before she catches the hunter's scent). My problem is that male elk are not called bucks, they are called bulls. Male deer are bucks. I know it is trivial but it bugged me a bit because it seems an error like that could have been caught by the numerous editing processes. Oh well, its so trivial. So to gather all my thoughts, I really loved the book. I liked the elements of surprise. I love how Meyer makes the predictable happen in unexpected ways. I like how she tied all the loose ends up and made it a happily ever after but still left the story line open to new adventures with new characters. I love that Jacob is finally happy, even if his imprinting was a bit strange. The twists were great and made the book a page turner. Are there things I think she could have done better, well sure, but that comes with any book. Overall, she did a great job and I am sad to see the saga end. Now I am anticipating Midnight Sun. There won't be anything new because we all know what happens, but it will be interesting to read it through Edward's eyes. Stephenie Meyer has a rough draft of chapter 1 on her website. Check it out, it will be good.  For now, in my head, I will imagine the Cullen family living happily in Forks. I am assuming they will have to leave soon because of their lack of aging, but I'd like to think their travels will always bring them home. Well done Stephenie for a great series. My husband and I are forever fans.",41,0.9998,0.076,0.719,0.206,0.5589986029502158,POSITIVE,0.9986
46,29502148,08/07/2008,1.0,"I wanted to love this book; to read it over and over until my head exploded. I tried to love it, even after page 360, and my complete disappointment of Jacob imprinting--on Bella’s mutant baby, no less. But I kept reading because I just knew that Stephenie was going to make it up to me.The more I read the more difficult it became for me to finish. I am ashamed to say I endured the torture ‘til the bitter end--and, oh, was it bitter! Or rather, so sickeningly sweet it caused me to throw up in my mouth a little. Don’t get me wrong, I am all about happy endings but not at the expense of a good plot.Breaking Dawn could have been a pretty good ending to an okay series. To say I am disappointed with this book doesn’t even begin to describe how I feel. In all honesty, this book ruined the entire series for me. I no longer have the desire to pick up any of the other books--which I quite liked at one time. There is no way I could read them again now that I know the ending is so ridonculous (rE-D'on-kU-lus; Adjective, used when the word ridiculous just isn't enough).This book started off okay, with Bella angst-ing about having to drive a flashy car and getting married at such a young age--Classic Bella, am I right? But after the wedding and even the majority of the honeymoon, things went downhill. Bella, pregnant? Really? But, I was willing to forgive that particular plot twist even though it defied Mrs. Meyers canon about vampires. And she never said it wasn’t possible for a human to get pregnant after having sex with a vampire, so I simply shrugged my shoulders went with it.I’ll admit that I liked the Jacob chapters, despite the fact that Edward offers Bella to Jacob so long as Jacob can convince Bella to abort the abomination that they’ve created with Edwards magical vampire sperm--Edward was watching his 'true love' die and it was torturing him, so of course he lost touch with reality. Totally understandable (although completely icky as well) so I hand-waved that. Forgave it. I started getting aggravated when Bella was totally drawing Jacob back in (unbeknownst to us, the readers, it’s only because she’s pregnant with his future bride. More about that atrocity later) and setting him up for more heartbreak--classic selfish Bella that we love to hate.I really hoped that Jacob would find the ability to move past his love of Bella on his own. I don’t know about anyone else but I am getting sick of the I-cannot-live-without-you kind of “love” (more like freaky obsession) that has been going on in these novels. It is actually possible to heal from a broken heart and, you know, MOVE ON! It seemed as though Stephenie was going to have that happen, that Leah and Jacob might deepen their friendship and discover that they actually care for each other. But that would erase Jacob from Bella’s life and we couldn’t have that. No--Jacob gets to imprint on the abomination that is Renesmee. Lucky him! Now Jacob doesn’t actually have to work to heal his broken heart. Oh, and of course, lucky Bella for not actually having to sacrifice anything. Three books full chalk full of Bella's fears, about having to give up all her human relationships, was really all for not (I hate you Bella Swan-Cullen. And I really hate Little Brown Books for screwing me out of all that money).Now on to the delivery of Renesmee: WOW, talk about a joyous occasion! What with Bella vomiting a--I kid you not--'fountain of blood'; the breaking of bones (Bella's back was snapped); the c-section preformed with Edwards mouth (yes, I just said MOUTH); little Renesmee--who, creepily enough, is actually born with a full set of teeth--gives new meaning to the words 'breast feeding', and mama flat lining after all was said and done. It really is too bad they didn’t get the whole thing on film.Renesmee, hmmm…where to start? I’m not even going to touch the subject of her name with a ten-foot-pole. I’m just going to say that the way she’s described in the novel sounds more like the Bride of Chucky instead of some super cute baby. All the rapid growing, blood drinking and mind-melding was in no way endearing, it was weird.Considering that the romance was non-existent in the last 3/4 of this novel, it totally lacked in cute Bella and Edward moments. All we got was not-sexy, kinky, tantric, vampire sex that had the potential to go for days, or even weeks (yes, Bella actually thinks about that being a possibility). YIKES AND...JUST YIKES!Isn't it just super great that Bella gets to keep Charlie in her life? It proves that you really can have your (disgusting blood) cake and eat it too. I love that the sheriff in town doesn't even want to know anything about the vampires in town--unless, of course, it is entirely necessary. Which, I'm sorry but when a huge group of vampires descend on the area 'round about, I'd say that's a need to know basis. But does anyone tell Charlie? No. Apparently ignorance really is bliss.Oh, and I loved how Renee, Bella's mom, just disappeared into obscurity. She didn't even call when Bella was supposedly in lockdown with some deadly Brazilian disease. Seriously though, when did Renee go from being the overbearing mother who would FREAK OUT about not hearing from Bella every day, to one who couldn't care less what the crap happened to her?The epic battle was more like an epic failure. The whole book was building up to the fight in the woods and then nothing happened. Talk about anti-climatic. I found that I was just as disappointed as the Romanian vampires were. The only casualty was Irina and it's not like she was important enough to be broken up over.Despite the fact that I am a huge Jacob fan, I would have been okay with him dying to protect the little monster he'd imprinted on. I mean, JK Rowling killed DUMBLEDORE for crying out loud. Stephenie could have killed just ONE of her precious characters. By doing so, she would have been able to breathe some life into this flaming pile of garbage.And it seemed to me that by avoiding a fight the Cullens just woke a sleeping giant. Based on the conversation they were having after the ""battle"" it seems to me that they knew the Volturi were going to come back and attempt pick them off one-by-one. Wow, talk about a victory! But why worry when Bella has mad vampire skillz? Am I right?Worst line from this book: ""Goodbye, Jacob, my brother... my son."" *dry-heave* *shutter* *cringe* *shutter* The last few pages when Bella lifted her ""shield"" for Edward, so he could read her mind, wasn't all that bad. I kind of liked that part, to tell you the truth. I also liked learning more about Leah Clearwater (in the Jacob chapters). In all honesty, it was the rest of the book that was full of fail.TWO ENTHUSIASTIC THUMBS WAY DOWN!(Edited on Sunday August 17, 2008)",39,0.9976,0.116,0.719,0.164,0.5538358585858587,NEGATIVE,1.0
47,54492044,04/30/2009,2.0,"It actually took me some time to define my opinion about this book. There are so many people who hate it (seems like about a third of those who have read Twilight series) and even more of those who love it. Few are in between. Although I haven't been a Twilight die-hard fan, I enjoyed books 1-3 quite a bit. Just like everybody else, I skipped through them propably in a week. I never disillusioned myself about SM's quality of writing, but yet, we all have to admit, there is something about these books that just draws you in. And then, I started reading Breaking Dawn. I didn't have any kind of high expectations, but like everybody else, I knew there were things that were destined to happen based on the story lines of previous three books (just the same way we knew that, let's say, Harry Potter would take a stand against Voldemort). This things were: wedding, consummation (don't lie to yourself, this is what we all were looking forward to!), Bella becoming a vampire, Volturi's claim on Alice, Edward and Bella. All these were touched upon in BD, but the that was all, just a touch. These events never became a focal point of the plot of the last book in the series. All these issues did come up and were resolved instantly, without any hesitation or struggle. Nobody opposed the wedding; wedding night went almost without a hitch, lacked romance, intimacy, or any kind of details; Bella became the bestest vampire ever and never experienced bloodthirst everybody was warning her about. So what is left to drive the story? This is where comes in the craziest, most absurd and illogical ""twist"" that so many fans defend - Renesmee (did I spell this right?). Her existance didn't make any sense, her presence killed the romance story we all loved so much. Impossible pregnancy aside, what surprised and disappointed me the most about this last installment was total lack of any kind of believable conflict (peaceful Volturi standoff instead), but abandance of useless narrative (J.Jenks storyline, Jacob'Seth'Leah endless patrols, numerous new vampires with special talents nobody cared about). I won't go as far as to rate this book at 0 or 1. There were few entertaining scenes, and the book did give some semblance of closure. But this closure was similar to the one you get from reading fanfiction. Yes, it shows you your favorite characters happy, but you know it's not the real thing, the real book would have been so much better and truer to the story. But unfortunately, we will never read that ""real"" Breaking Dawn. Many fans defend this books saying that this is SM's story and she wrote it the way she wanted it to be written. That's fine, but looks like this story of hers wasn't all that good. The saddest thing about Breaking Dawn is that it managed to alienate so many dedicated fans. I've never heard of such a thing before, honestly. It pains me to see how many fans now try to find solace in making fun of SM and the entire series. Very sad... Breaking Dawn could have cemented S. Meyer as a great storyteller, instead, this book exposed her (in my opinion) as an extremely weak writer. What does future hold for her? I think next book will be vital in her career. Hopefully rumors about ""cannibal mermaids"" books on the boards are not true... ",39,0.988,0.089,0.767,0.144,0.541051615051615,NEGATIVE,0.9957

But this book read like poorly written fan-fiction - both prose and the plot! - and there was very little to like. The writing was just okay (like the previous books), the plot was beyond stupid, all the ""twists"" were obvious (nothing ""subtle"" about the foreshadowing...), etc. etc. How did this book get published?!? Even the ending was a huge let down; virtually nothing of interest happened and all possibly interesting conflicts were glossed over. Bella wants to become a vampire and should be having difficult as a ""newborn"" and giving up her old life... but that all went smoother than anticipated! What a cop out. In fact, the whole book fell under that category...The characters were less likable than in previous books and it was actually painful to read about Bella, Edward, and Jacob. How, I wondered time and time again, could a person be so stupid? Parts were creepy (not in a good way...), parts were icky, and parts were just so bad that I wanted to burn the book. I am cringing right now just thinking about it all. I can't even begin to list all the times I wanted to put down the book but didn't because I kept thinking it had to get better and that if I wanted to discuss this mess with others, I should finish the whole thing, just to see how it ends. Oh, and the name ""Renesmee""???? A HUGE ""wtf"" is in order here!Aside from the mind-numbing plot and no character development, I also hated the way everything just worked out. Bella didn't have to give up anything to have everything she wanted and the stakes were pretty much non-existent, even though I think I was supposed to feel that all their lives were in danger. Even Bella's dad was kind of like, ""Ok, I'll be kept in the dark about everything! It's all fine!"" Uh, what? No conflict? Nothing of interest? Nope - everything was glossed over. Cop out. It was all just so boring. And pretty weak for what's supposed to be the final book in a popular series. Very, very disappointing. Although in one regard it succeeded - I don't want to read anything more in the series by this author, not after this book! So it did cement the series shut, just probably not in the way the author hoped.I am at least glad I just checked this out of the library; I feel sorry for those who bought it!

I'm literally only refuting the points mentioned in this, nothing else. I don't like comparison, but if the other party does it, be sure that I will respond. 
REBUTTAL POINTS 31-40:
31. has more female fans.Harry Potter has more fans. Period. Also, this is a stupid reason. 32. Harry Potter was mainly focused on children. We are into the more mature books. That have mature elements in them.Do you mean sex? Sure, Twilight has sex in it, but in terms of maturity of the characters and the story itself, Harry Potter is the clear winner. 33. Who wouldn't want two guys fighting over you? :D That just makes a good story. Am I right?I wouldn't want two guys fighting over me honestly. Why would anyone want that? Besides, love triangles are old hat. Wuthering Heights, anyone?34. Bella Swan is a strong character. SHe is brave, caring, forgiving, accepting, and just plain awesome :) She has risked her life many times to save someone she loves, such as Charlie, Renee, Edward, Jacob, The Cullens, Nessie, etc. She went through weeks of pain to save her daughter. SHe was willing to die so her baby could live. She has also formed a huge army and was prepared to fight till the death to protect her child and family. So yes, Bella is a role model. And No, she is not dependent on Edward.Bella Swan is not a strong character. I'm sorry, but she is none of those. What she is, is a selfish person who likes complaining about everything. The only person she cares for is Edward, and mostly because, sex. She was willing to sacrifice herself to save her daughter, I'll give you that. Bella is not a role model. Hermione Granger obliviated her parents so they wouldn't have to suffer lest something bad happen to her. She stuck by Harry even through the darkest of times. She saved Harry's ass (and by extension that of the magical world) more number of times than I can count! She was smart, compassionate, intuitive, and has been an inspiration to girls world across. Hell, I want to be like her. She is a good role model. Lily Potter sacrificed herself to save her son. She saw the good in people, in all people. She is a good role model. Molly Weasley cared for Harry like she would care for her own son. She fed and mothered almost the entire Order of the Phoenix. She was also a brilliant and badass witch. She is a good role model. Ginny Weasley didn't mope after Harry left her for her own good. She picked herself up, reformed Dumbledore's Army, rebelled against the Death Eater regime, and fought in the Battle of Hogwarts. She was also a damn good Quidditch player and a total pro at Bat Bogey Hexes. She was also, like other women here, smart, intelligent, and mature. She was a good role model. Luna Lovegood was quirky, brilliant, brave, and pure and good at heart. She stood up for what she believed in. She was also instrumental in reforming Dumbledore's Army and in fighting the Death Eaters. She was a good role model. Minerva McGonagall was strict, disciplined, caring, understanding, and one of the most brilliant witches of her time. She fought in the frontlines of the Battle of Hogwarts and was instrumental in the victory. She was a good role model. Nymphadora Tonks was intelligent, funny, an Auror no less. She believed in love and in the man she fell in love with. She saw people for the good in them. She died fighting at the Battle of Hogwarts, fighting alongside her husband and her fellow-Aurors. She was a good role model. I could go on, but you get the gist. These were independent, powerful, smart women. Oh, and Bella was totally co-dependent. Specifically, dependent on Edward. 35. Twilight totally had a better, richer, more complex plot line than Harry Potter.The plot line of Twilight revolved around two (not completely independent) plot points: a) Bella wanting to get laid; and b) her wanting to turn into a vampire...because she wanted to get laid. Harry Potter is so much more complex and intricate! Every detail counts. Every word counts. The build from the first book till the end was sublime. Just because good triumphed over evil, it doesn't mean that it was easy. 36. Alice Cullen. She is just awesome! She would probably be considered as the ""Luna"" in Twilight. Am I right? Alice would be the perfect sister. She would make anyone smile if they had a bad day.Okay, I didn't hate Alice. She was the only one with some sense in the book(s). But she cannot be compared to Luna, mostly because her character was never fully developed, while Luna's was. Alice just seemed like a filler, while Luna was integral to the story. 37. All four Twilight books made us teary eyed. As for Harry Potter, some parts made us sad and a little teary, but Twilight was the one that really made us teary.I honestly didn't feel anything in Twilight. I just got bored of the repetitiveness of Bella's va(m)pid thoughts. While I didn't cry in all the Harry Potter books, I wailed and bawled in the last three. However, the entire journey was a tumult of emotions. LET ME LIST MY FEELS!!!38. The Twilight books were so amazing!! We just could not put them down at all! For Harry Potter, some of the books we could not put down, but others made us a bit sleepy.It took me forever to get to the end of Twilight books. I used to read Harry Potter under my sheets, in the dark. The only time I put it down was when Dumbledore died in the sixth book. But that was sheer shock and sorrow. 39. Daniel Radcliffe is doing pornografic musicals on Broadway and Robert Pattinson is singing and acting in other movies...who exactly got the better end of the deal?Daniel Radcliffe starred Equus, which is a critically acclaimed play that has, over the years become a classic. Merely because he was nude in it does not mean it was pornographic. Both actors have had equal success commercially, so this point is moot. Also, why does this randomly keep switching to the actors? Isn't it about the quality of the books?40. Sirius Black can turn into a great, black dog, Peter Pettigrew can turn into a rat, James Potter can turn into a stag, Remus Lupin a werewolf Rita Skeeter can turn into a beetle and Minerva Mcgonagall can turn into a cat. How scary is that?? Not at all. A Twilight shapeshifter would OWN them all :)This is horseshit. Besides, they could just attack your precious shapeshifters as wizards, instead of as animagi? Oh, and Remus Lupin, in the absence of his wolfsbane potion would be a full-fledged, savage werewolf that could probably tear your shapeshifters from end to end. He wouldn't, though, because he's actually nice.

51,28579251,07/28/2008,1.0,"All I can say is, ""What a disappointment."" Everything about this book was such a huge disappointment to me, from the plot to the organization to the writing itself. As I've said before, I don't think Stephenie Meyer is an amazing writer, but at least the first three in the series were entertaining. This book was just plain dull. Nothing ever happened. I should have known this book was going to be boring when Bella and Edward got married in Chapter 3. What was even left to look forward to after that? (Not that I was looking forward to that, because I liked Jacob better, but he's too good for Bella anyway...) Every once in awhile, something exciting would happen, like Bella finding out she was pregnant, Bella giving birth to her monster baby, etc. But for the most part this book was just people standing around talking (or not talking, reading each other's minds, whatever) and agonizing about what they were going to do. Now, I'm not a particularly violent person, but I do like a little action. There is no action in this book. Even when the Volturi show up at the very end, after all the agonizing and plotting and planning that the Cullens and Company do, nothing happens. Bella just launches her dumb shield and everyone is safe. Bo-ring. It feels like Meyer was afraid to take any risks with this book. She couldn't stand to see anyone die. Well, I guess Irina died, but who cares? I would have liked to see her kill off at least one or two of the Cullens. It could have even been Rosalie, the one who no one likes anyway. But she just seemed so hell-bent on preserving every single last one of her pathetic characters. At least JK Rowling was willing to kill a few people off in the last Harry Potter.I also hate what she did with Jacob. Making him imprint on Edward and Bella's daughter??? That is THE dumbest thing ever. I just about had to stop reading the book right there, but I just kept hoping Jacob would turn around and say ""Psych!"" or something. So dumb. Hated that part. If Jacob wasn't going to get Bella, the least Meyer could have done was trot in some new hottie (of his own age) for Jacob to imprint on. I would have even been okay with him hooking it up with Leah, even though Leah bothered me. But no... Before I started the book I was all nervous that Meyer was going to kill Jacob off. (Of course, at that point I didn't realize that she didn't have the guts to kill any of the core characters.) But now I'd almost rather she killed him off. Now poor Jacob is stuck with Bella and Edward and the rest of the Cullens for the rest of his life. Ick.I also agree with other reviewers who hate the fact that Bella pretty much gets everything she wants. There is no conflict for Bella in this book. Throughout the whole series, Bella's choice to become a vampire is made out to be this big deal because she'll be giving up all of these things, like she won't be able to have children (which she never seemed to want anyway) and she won't be able to see Renee or Charlie, she won't be able to control her insatiable thirst for human blood, etc. Well, in this book, she gets to have Renesmee (worst name EVER) and she gets to see Charlie all the time. Since she has such amazing self-control right off the bat, she doesn't even have to worry about attacking her father or her half-human daughter and sucking their blood dry. I personally thought it would have been great to see Bella go crazy attacking people left and right trying to kill them, so that the Cullens had to lock her up. The less I see of Bella, the happier I am. I also got sick of hearing how great Bella was at everything, once she was a vampire. She's like the best vampire ever created. *Snore*Besides that, this book is just badly written. Besides the many typos, it just feels rushed, like Meyer had all of these ideas and she just had to mash them all in there. And yet the book STILL ended up being boring.

These were portrayed beautifully and slightly sentimentally in this book.I liked Edward's love for Bella as he proposed Jacob to get Bella agreed to abort his own child to save her life and to get her pregnant, if she wanted to be a mother again. I do not know how else anyone can prove that their love is true and unselfish.I loved how, in the end, Bella gained her full power as a Shield and got victory over the Voltury.Alice's finding another half-human Nahuel to save Renesmee from the Volturi was a wonderful relief, to her family as well as the readers, that Renesmee was not going to die soon.I especially liked how the love triangle between Bella, Edward and Jacob came to an end with Jacob's getting imprinted with Renesmee. I am not sure if I should describe it as surprising or funny. So, I am going with both. (hide spoiler)]What I loved the most about the book was that it showed that a family is not just a group of people bound by blood relationship, rather a group of people who love each other. The Cullen family was formed with adopted persons or vampires. Renesmee was related by blood to only Edward and Bella. But, when her life was threatened, the whole Cullen family (and also the werewolves connected to Jacob) was ready to be destroyed (as vampires can not die again) to save her. So, this novel proved that a family is bound by love.This book is as romantic as the first one of the series.",32,0.9975,0.03,0.713,0.257,0.6688697318007661,POSITIVE,0.9999
57,28652873,07/29/2008,3.0,"I started reading at 12:30 am and went non-stop until 7pm. Meyer totally outdid herself! Best book in the series, bar-none! She created a completely original plot that flowed perfectly with the other books. All of the characters had depth and substance. Jacob was not a brat any more, although he still had moments when he got on my nerves. But I enjoyed the chance to read a few chapters from his point of view. I had hoped that Meyer wouldn't wait until the end of the book for the wedding. But I was also worried about how far she would be willing to write about other things. While it makes the world of difference to me if those things occur in a book after the couple is married, I still believe all of that is personal and private and does not need to be shared in detail with anyone. Even if it's fiction! So imagine my surprise that the wedding took place at the very beginning of the book--in the first 100 pages! And that she handled the whole honeymoon-Bella-still-in-human-state about 97% tastefully. Still a squeak more than I would prefer, but a landslide better than the 3rd book! Later in the story Meyer still handles well Bella's post-human experiences in her ""second honeymoon.""Yes! She becomes a vampire only halfway through the book! I had not expected so much of the book to talk about Bella adjusting to this new state of existence. It was fascinating! I'm not advocating the undead or immortality of course. But this is a make-believe story, though it still in a round-about way ties into an LDS theme of eternal marriage. :-) I loved experiencing new vampire life with Bella, because it wasn't anywhere what they had all expected it to be. She took to it like ducks to water! So much fun, and much more enjoyable to see her and Edward in an equal relationship with no reservations. He doesn't have to carry her to get somewhere fast. He doesn't have to worry about her breakable nature. She can finally start fighting for herself and her loved ones. She finds unique talents and skills. And you can FINALLY see that she and Edward did have a relationship beyond just the physical. What a relief.But the biggest most unexpected and also most exciting twist for me in this book was Bella getting pregnant! I picked up from the very first hint and started thinking, ""Absolutely no way!"" And do you know how excited I got? I mean, I'd been so angry at Bella for consciously throwing away her ability to have kids because she didn't care. I went to school with too many of those girls, and it hurt even then when I was first learning what was wrong with me. Can you imagine my shock, laughter, and happy surprise to totally connect with a vampire and a female werewolf on this in the book?!?! And the growth that both Edward and Bella make as they're becoming parents, albeit rather quickly. To see the struggles of both during the pregnancy. The pain and yet the happiness. I'm serious, Meyer wrote that all so well I was feeling all of that, too. I especially loved the scene when Edward could hear the baby's thoughts! Oh, it was so tender! I was just upset that we were in Jacob's point of view at the time because I would have loved to have been in Bella's or even moreso Edward's head. Goodness, and the agonizing delivery. Heart-wrenching scene. And then raising the baby. Both Edward and Bella definitely came into their own I was very opposite from thinking that Bella was shallow anymore. Relief, too. Because I'd pretty much not liked her since chapter 4 of the very first book! I admired her so much by the end of this book. And Edward wasn't all that nauseating anymore either. His love and concern for her seemed more genuine and not all barfy-gooshy. Although, he could have cut down on a few of the ""love"" nicknames to Bella. Ug.Oh my word, and the twist with Jacob at the end of his section? Wow! I laughed for 5 minutes when I picked up on what happened there. Absolutely hilarious! But perfect, too. It fit in and connected in places that I just wouldn't have believed. Whoa. Meyer did a fantastic job with that twist. Overall, I am so happy with the book. Grateful that it my fears and worries were all for naught. So excited to have read a great story and plot with fantastic twists and great characters. Even the minor ones were great. And the big climactic confrontation at the end--but hardly any violence! Totally unexpected and yet totally fitting in with realistic. Well, as realistic as a world with vampires and werewolves can be. I certainly sensed Meyer's joy and faith in love, marriage and family from this book. I do believe she has redeemed her self somewhat. I still find the occasional swear word annoying and completely unnecessary. And since they are so rare, they stand out even more. Annoying! She really shot down my respect for her in the 3rd book, but I think with how Breaking Dawn is written, the entire series overall is worth it. If you are hesitant for the same reasons I am in books, just ask me for a summary and then read the last 4-5 chapters of the 3rd book and you won't miss too much.",29,0.9994,0.076,0.716,0.208,0.5362739073544159,POSITIVE,0.9998
58,29414419,08/06/2008,1.0,"If you loved the first three books of the series, take my advice and don't bother with Breaking Dawn. It will seriously ruin the experience. All summer, I worried whether Bella would choose Edward or Jacob........if I had only known that should be the least of my concerns. My chief complaints are:1. Bella sacrifices nothing to become a vampire. In Eclipse, we saw her struggle with her humanity. In Breaking Dawn, we find she gets to keep all those things AND become immortal. She keeps Jake, she gets a baby, she has no difficulty being a newborn and she has a unique power.2. Jacob's character dominates the book. His point of view was interesting, but this was not the right story for him to tell. I like Jake (although I'm Team Edward) and Stephenie turned his character into a pale echo of his former glory. She emasculated him.3. Renesmee. I've never read a book before where the character's name was SO hideous it was actually distracting. Positively atrocious. 4. The plot is full of cop-outs just so that everything ties up neatly in the end. It's almost amateur. Jake imprints on Bella's baby so he gets to stay part of the family. Bella almost dies giving birth so Edward doesn't have to struggle over the sacrifice of her soul when he makes her immortal. There's no fight with the Volturi at the end, so none of the major players have to die.5. Jacob's imprint on Bella's baby was creepy. Just wrong.6. The Cullens are nonexistent. Where are the characters we know and love? 7. Bella and Edward's romance, which kept me reading through the first three books, has the life sucked right out of it. First, the baby situation put a damper on things. However, seeing Edward through Jake's eyes is what really killed the feeling for me. I expect Jacob to feel that way, but I didn't really want to feel that way. I wish I'd never read ANY of the books. This booked totally altered the experience for me. I don't know if I'll even be able to watch the movie this December. Sorry, Stephenie, but this was awful.",9,0.7781,0.104,0.783,0.113,0.5458882783882784,NEGATIVE,1.0

62,3843674339,03/01/2021,4.0,"I can’t tell you how determined I was to hate Breaking Dawn. I had my mind made up. I’ve been losing patience with each successive reread. We get it: Bella is hyperfocused on both Edward and Jacob. She can’t conceive of a future without one or both of them dominating it. Meyer perpetually tries to spin being controlling and forceful as the strongest evidence of a man’s love for a woman. Power dynamic issues only become more pronounced and intrusive as the series progresses. New Moon and Eclipse especially put the romance genre to shame. But the thing is, I don’t think Breaking Dawn is romance at all.I think it’s horror. Pregnancy is presented as grotesque, parasitic, emotionally and physically traumatic, life-threatening. Meyer pulls out all the body horror stops: blotchy bruised skin, snapping bones, projectile vomit that’s human blood, and not even Bella’s. Is this Twilight or Alien? It is truly disgusting. I don’t know why we gave these books to children. And yet, pregnancy is also presented as undeniably worth it. But maybe only because against all odds, Bella survives. So much so that now she’ll never die.Meyer raises fascinating questions about autonomy and parenthood. Plenty of taboo subjects are front and center. Abortion, fertility, surrogacy. If a doctor tells a woman her pregnancy will kill her, who has say in whether to see it through? Her? Her partner? Her doctor? Some combination? When does autonomy begin and end? Meyer almost flips the abortion debate on its head—fighting for the human life of the mother is more pressing than any concerns about the gestating fetus.Is it more cruel to force medical decisions on others, or stand by and watch your loved one choose a path that will kill them? Is it wrong to intervene? Is it wrong not to? How do we protect our loved ones from harm they subject themselves to? If Edward and Bella not only belong together, but belong to one another, are their choices their own? The premise that Edward keeps Bella safe has never held less weight. But for once, and at last, Bella gets to know best. She survives her pregnancy. She becomes a vampire. Despite the fierce opposition of men in her life, her choices work out, better than even she could have hoped. She gets to be right. So then, is Meyer arguing women can only really grow up into adults by giving birth and becoming mothers? Why doesn’t Bella get to narrate her own pregnancy? Is it so Jacob can be looped back in to imprint on a baby (don’t even get me started) named Renesmee (don’t even get me started)?Is Rosalie the only one willing to defend Bella’s agency, or is she living vicariously through her because Bella has choices she wishes were possible for her? (I maintain that Rosalie and Leah are the two most interesting female characters, though both are vilified. Leah is put through so much I wonder if Meyer based her on a real-life nemesis. The best male characters, if you were wondering, are Seth Clearwater and both Bens, Angela’s short king and an Aang-like vampire abruptly introduced in the ninth hour.)It do still be racist though. A superstitious cleaning lady who doesn’t speak English provides us insight about Bella falling pregnant. Jacob is regularly referred to as a dog and mongrel by various vampires, and at one point is brought a meal in a dog bowl. Amun, an Egyptian vampire, doesn’t let his wife speak. Despite being constantly ordered around and not consulted by Edward, Bella finds this off-putting. The Amazon vampires are described as feline-like and uncivilized, clad in animal skins. Bella meets a dark-skinned man (Meyer seems leery to say Black outright except in reference to Jacob’s surname) in the “ghetto” whose eyes bug out at her pale beauty. Another dark-skinned character (his skin tone is described as impossible??) is later introduced whose father is absent and selfish, a man whose violent disposition endangers innocent women. Edward is held up in stark contrast to him, exemplifying a devoted, involved patriarch. Blech.The end of the book is laughably anticlimactic, it’s hundreds of pages too long, and imprinting has disturbing connotations that go unacknowledged. But you know what? Stephenie is right. Pregnancy is gross and scary, and motherhood elicits either the deepest joys or the darkest turmoil, depending on agency and autonomy. Or maybe it does a little of both, regardless. Weird message to end on, but I’m far more compelled than when Edward and Jacob were taking turns touching Bella’s face.",8,-0.4476,0.094,0.814,0.092,0.5547105245182168,NEGATIVE,0.9815
63,29495702,08/07/2008,2.0,"Before I begin my review, I would just like to state that this is a mostly negative review, with Breaking Dawn spoilers in it. I loved Twilight, all of it. I appreciated New Moon, though I disliked how Meyer portrayed how helpless Bella was without Edward. I liked Eclipse well enough, but I felt that Edward went all out of character, and Jacob stole his spotlight in my eyes. But Breaking Dawn is a disappointment from almost every angle I look at it from. If I was to replace Breaking Dawn's character names with something from another book entirely, no one would realize that she was Bella Swan and he was Edward Cullen. They've all fallen out of character, their characters so different from Twilight, that without the name, they're hardly recognizable anymore. That is what I reckon of the characters. But the plot is far, far more disappointing.The wedding itself is fine. I personally liked it, to say the truth - and I'm not one for big weddings with pouffy dresses, but rather a Vegas one. Still, I enjoyed the wedding scene. But right after the wedding, Breaking Dawn's quality begins to fall. The honeymoon is disappointing. There's no chemistry between Bella and Edward anymore. There's no smoldering, there's no passion - it's like a badly-written romance novel that hardly has any feeling of romance in it. Then we find out that Bella has a child. Meyer has once stated in an interview that vampires cannot have children. True, Bella was still a human when it happened, but Edward was a vampire - unless Meyer is to give is some ridiculous explanation on how Edward magically 'turned' into a human, I will not change stand. The actual birth scene is gory. There's blood everywhere, bones breaking from inside Bella's body, and - in Meyer's constantly used words - I cringed just reading it. Call me weak-stomached, but I honestly would have preferred Meyer to have given us less descriptive chapters regarding the birth of Renesmee.I don't have a problem with the name. I'm not exactly against the nickname 'Nessie' either. The hype surrounding the name is simply ridiculous, but what really gets to me is that Jacob imprints on Nessie.So all Jacob's pain gets washed away by how he is imprinted on Nessie. I would have loved to remind Meyer, Renesmee is Bella's child. Bella was the girl that Jacob fell in love with - to have Jacob fall in love with Bella's child is beyond cruel and ridiculous.Then, Alice Sees the Volturi coming. She Sees them coming, and for some reason, she leaves an address for Bella to follow, and runs away herself. There, Meyer creates one unnecessary fuss what with the Denali clan, Egyptian clans, Amazon clans, vampiric clans of every sort suddenly visiting the Cullens. At the end of the day, the clans shouldn't have bothered. The Volturi doesn't do anything - because they're too scared of the skill that Bella'd mastered in a week. A week - whereas vampires generally need centuries to do that. Let alone the way Bella had managed to resist the human scent of hikers. Breaking Dawn's plot is full of holes. Her editor must have fallen asleep halfway, because the most obvious and incredulous mistake was Charlie's breakfast. On the exact same page, on Bella's wedding morning, Bella had apparently cooked Charlie his pancakes. A few lines afterwards, Charlie was 'frowning at his cereal'. It's the mistake that an amateur editor would have made. Then there is the clean, well-cut out Disney-esque ending for Breaking Dawn, which was the biggest problem of all, in my opinion. Even the sick way Jacob has fallen in love with his ex-love's child doesn't compete with that, for me.The part of why I loved the Twilight saga so far was because of all the angst, all the sacrifice, found in Twilight - where Bella began to think about losing her humanity -, New Moon - Edward's leaving - and even Eclipse, where Bella considers what her life would have been with Jacob, comparing it to the eternity with Edward.Her life with Jacob would have included a family. Children. Normality, Her life with Edward would have been passionate (though I highly doubt that, as the readers, we would have felt that way, judging by the way Meyer has been writing the romance scenes between Bella and Edward) - but without normality. Without children.Nessie came along, and Bella had a family. Bella was willing to give up her humanity, because she already had everything she could get from Jacob.Where's the angst of being torn between two? The angst of making the final decision? Of forgetting the passion, of having a family - or, forgetting the family, getting the passion? Where's the sacrifice? But Meyer thinks that Bella can simply have it all. The passion, the family - no sacrifice needed. Everything she had created in the previous three books comes crashing right back down so that Meyer's characters can have their happy endings.Even Jacob is happy. He's no longer in pain because Bella chose Edward over him. He's happy because he has Nessie. It's a happy ending on all sides.It's precisely what's wrong with Breaking Dawn. I would have thought that Breaking Dawn would have had some heartbreak, a lot of angst, a lot of tears - but instead, we are all dragged along on a happily-ever-after, for everyone.If you or your friend likes happily-ever-afters after a trio of dark, angsty books, Breaking Dawn after the Twilight saga is definitely for you/them. If you prefer a dark saga all the way through, it would be much more preferable for you to pretend that the Twilight series end with Eclipse.

So with edward out of the picture I personally hitched myself to bella to make up for his disappearance; to find out that she is now no where near the same person that we followed through this journey since Twilight. No rational,over thought, thoughts, low self-esteem, you name a important ""Bella"" quality, its gone with the wind- along with Alice, Jasper,and all the other major characters, then, Rosalie was suddenly...nice...All I had was Jacobs sudden attachment to there mutant baby-(the only one in the entire book to have a personality) which, to be frank, bugged the crap out of me! Winding up with bella's child was the worst idea possible if she had any hope of salvaging Breaking Dawn! Its disgusting to think about your bestfriend wind up with your baby! I thought that he would get with Leah,they couldn't have the one they loved and would be sad yet happy together. Much better than creepy mutant love. I might have possibley like renesme (or however else its spelled) if originally you didn't hate her. everything up to the birth is how evil the fetus is for killing bella and hurting her etc... then with the flip of a page your supposed to think she's the best thing since sliced bread.Nope. raise your hand if u like to hear mothers go on and on about how amazing and brilliant their baby is. no one does so why would anyone want to read about it.

66,575583372,03/30/2013,2.0,"Actual Rating: 2.5 starsOriginally, Breaking Dawn was my least favorite book in this series. So I was surprised to find that this was the most enjoyable to re-read. It still has major problems, most of them being what I disliked originally, but it also has the most interesting plot. Granted it's silly and melodramatic, but can be fun. So what did I (and still do) hate? Jacob imprinting on Renesmee. Because...1) It's creepy and I had forgotten some of the disturbing grooming things that happen in this book. Like Jacob giving her the equivalent of a promise ring for Christmas when she's a few months old, and getting excited when they find out she will be physically mature in only seven years. *gag* I hated it then, I hate it now.2) It tries too hard to wrap things up neatly, keeping Jacob tied to Bella in some way. And Edward calling him son? Ahhh I just could not with that. Why couldn't he end up with Leah? This could have resolved in SO many better ways. And speaking of Leah, I hate the way she was treated in this series. She deserves better. She's called a bitter shrew, when she's understandably reacting to the trauma of being forced to share space with the person who broke her heart. (again because of imprinting. I just hate all of it.) Then there's the fact that she's the first ever female werewolf, BUT because the author apparently can't have women doing ""male"" things and be feminine, she has a supposedly unattractive short hair cut and is unable to have children. And since the author clearly shows her belief that long hair and bearing children are key parts of womanhood (which is a whole other conversation...)it seems she is masculinizing Leah to be more okay with her being a werewolf. Beyond that, the stuff about the wedding and the honeymoon is silly and melodramatic, but somewhat entertaining. (though it's predicated on a relationship that has been toxic and emotionally abusive so....) The chapter where Bella gives birth and it reads like a bloody horror movie was a CHOICE and I still don't understand why. It's a lot. But then her adjusting to being a new vampire is kind of cool, and the stuff with the Volturi is interesting. The last thing I will say because I saw it multiple times in this book, and saw it REPEATEDLY throughout the series is the equating of whiteness with beauty and whiteness with goodness. The problem here is not those things existing among white characters, the problem is when it is constantly done to the exclusion of anything else. Any time there was some kind of beauty with a non-white character, it came with qualifiers like ""an exotic type of beauty"" or it being in the eye of the beholder despite a character having a nose and mouth ""too broad"" for conventional beauty, or a girl being beautiful because of her fair skin as a vampire DESPITE having Mexican features. This is gross and perpetuates problematic standards of what is considered beautiful. Similarly, in almost every case where a character was not white, they are portrayed as villainous or in some way not good, particularly in terms of vampires from different ethnic and racial backgrounds. When you start to see these things, you can't unsee them. And it tracks with the author's refusal to cast any of the Cullens or ""good"" vampires in the films with non-white actors. (see article here: https://www.indiewire.com/2018/10/cat...)Re-reading these now was a journey and one I'm glad I undertook.

I did it, it feels like this massive journey i've gone through thats been years however in reality it's just been a six of months.  Plot:  I enjoyed this book for the most part even though I really could have done without all the jacob chapters they really did bore me to death and I at one point almost stopped reading it because of these chapters. This entire book is really gearing up for Bella to become a vampire with the wedding and honeymoon it's just pretty much sealed for her and I just wanted to see how the movie and book differ with these scenes. I loved the entire Wedding scene it's one of my favourites of this whole book it just flowed really well and it had some of the best moments for me and it made it easier to read. I really could have done without having to listen to Jacob through his chapters I really wish they were less or maybe we could have had some Edward chapters thrown in because having to see things through Jacobs eyes was frustrating. The whole imprint stuff still throws me off and I find it weird that Jacob has this 'claim' on a baby just doesn't sit right with me and I don't ever will so I'm just going to leave that one alone. The writing at times is pretty lackluster and I was hoping for some sort of huge send off for characters that Stephanie had been writing for some time but this book falls way to short and it's a shame. This book could have been that one book out of the series that could have gone out with a bang and tie things together however the finale just felt like it was missing so much and with a very anticlimactic ending it's just disappointing. I'm also going to say that Stephanie was one of the major players in starting the whole YA genre of books and I think other readers and myself will thank her for what she did with getting young adult books of the ground and creating a whole new generation readers after the world was taken over by Harry potter. So whether you love this series or loathe this series you can admit that if it wasn't for twilight you wouldn't have this whole YA genre. My opinion on this final installment to this series is that I fall somewhere in the middle I don't really love this book nor do I dislike it however this one had some good moments within it but the writing and lackluster finale really let this series and final book down.

77,4095358016,07/04/2021,2.0,"WARNING: FILLED WITH TOO MANY SPOILERS TO PUT THE TAG THINGY*clears throat*Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the biggest load of rubbish that ceases to exist.I have decided that it's time to write my rant review of the entire series. (my parents breathe a sigh of relief)First off, Twilight. The original book. Now, not going to lie this book is actually decent. Yes, reading it may be like watching paint dry but nevertheless it's pretty decent. Bella Swan moves from Arizona to Forks. A place where it rains constantly and sun doesn't seem to exist. On Bella's first day at school, apparently she's some super model that all the boys are into. We LOVE pale, scrawny girls with nice hair. Bella makes a friend called Jessica (great name by the way). At lunch, she sees a group of other pale kids that sit together by themselves. For who knows what reason, Bella is instantly curious about these kids. She asks her friends who these people are and she says they are the Cullens and the Hales. Also, apparently they are all dating each other? Anyway, the one called Edward looks towards her and stares really creepily. Yet Bella is still intrigued. She sits next to Edward in class and he goes all crazy and clenches his fist and looks rather constipated. Next we Eric and Mike talk to Bella.Let's talk about Eric and Mike. When someone expresses no interest in you, you leave them alone. Do these boys do this? Of course not. Unfortunately, Bella is into a 108 year old vampire. Edward has to keep protecting cause she's such a klutz. Bella and Edward start to hang out and he reveals he's a vampire. Also, minor detail, but he's hungry for her blood and could slaughter her at any time. Yet, Bella is still not scared off. I mean, she's literally asking for it. Stuff happens they fall in love the end.Next, New Moon aka Bella being depressed and hopeless because her 109 year old vampire boyfriend ditched her. Bella being depressed for many months is SOOOOO boring. Did Stephenie Meyer really need to waste perfectly good paper just to write one month per page? Short answer: no. Edward ditches Bella and she is depressed. Yay! We just love when Bella is a mess. Now insert Jacob. Yeah, remember him? The guy who was mentioned like once in the first book. Jacob now takes Bella to do dangerous things. Charlie (oh yeah Bella's father) thinks it's good she has a friend and is going out. Oh, and Jacob is apparently a werewolf. And vampires and werewolves are enemies. So yay for Bella!Bella also decided to go cliff diving because, apparently, when she's in danger, Edward Cullen will come to rescue her. She jumps off, risking her life, just to see Edward. An example of Bella's stupidity.Ooh, quick mention to my favourite line of the whole series. Bella, Jacob and Mike (or maybe Eric) go see a movie where everyone dies. Jacob gets sick and Bella offers to take him home. Mike or Eric wants to leave too but Bella tells him to say. *cue favourite line* She says, ""Don't you want to get your 10 dollars worth of carnage?"" Yeah, it was funnier at the time.Anyway, Jacob is kind of in love with her (I think). By the way, Edward thinks Bella is dead so now he wants to kill himself. Alice, who is Edward’s sister, tells Bella this and for some reason Bella decides to catch a plane to save Edward. Insert Volturi who live somewhere in Italy where Edward is. The Volturi are like a head vampire group thing. To wrap up Bella saves Edward. The EndEclipse. The next kind of suffering. We are gonna keep this one short. The whole book leads up to a battle that ends with 3 cracks. Also Jacob kisses Bella and breaks her hand. And all the Cullens backstories are revealed.Breaking Dawn. Urgh- don’t even get me started.First off, BELLA AND EDWARD GOT MARRIED?? Is that even legal? Probably not but who cares.Time for the honeymoon. Woo! Bella and Edward do the nasty and he almost kills her while doing it. Bella then notices that she is getting a round belly and is pregnant. Huh? Oh and it’s a vampire baby apparently. This baby is also hungry for Bella’s blood. (Must run in the family)So the baby is born but to be born Bella had to be turned into a vampire.Anyway the Volturi think it’s some child that is a vampire and stays a child forever and can’t be controlled.This child grows extremely fast and grows from like 0-8 in a few months.Bella tells Charlie something and so he can see are Renesmee. Or however you spell it.By the way, the name Renesmee is a mix between Renee and Esme. Edward and Bella’s mom’s names.So, the Volturi are coming to see this baby because some cousin saw Renesmee and thought she was a weird vampire child. (she may not be wrong) Alice and Jasper disappear and nobody knows why. I still don't and I've read this book.Jacob has imprinted on Bella's daughter which basically means they are soulmates. (yay more pedophilia)Next, it turns out Renesmee can show memories by placing her hand to people's faces. So, Bella and Edward try to recruit vampires to fight against the Volturi with them. They get a bunch of people to join through Renesmee's power. At this point, Renesmee is a better character than Bella in the ENTIRE series.The Volturi then arrive and the vampires they have assembled and the werewolves are ready to fight them. Oh and Bella has an escape plan for Renesmee and Jacob to run away if necessary. (an early honeymoon yay!)They go meet the Volturi and guess what? They all stand and talk to each other like civilised people. The one time a great battle is coming everyone has to be an adult. Renesmee shows the head guy (is his name Aro?) something. Then, the Volturi realise this child is fine (hint: no it's not) and decide they need to kill the cousin. So she dies. Yay! Books over they live happily ever after.This is the one time the movie is better than the book. In the last movie, it actually has a good ending that was so much better than the book.Anyway, thank you for enduring my tortuously long review. Also, I apologise if you had to experience the traumatising experience of reading these books.",7,0.9977,0.096,0.749,0.155,0.4913983886483887,NEGATIVE,0.9999
78,108944777,06/27/2010,1.0,"Breaking Dawn, aka Breaking Down, aka Epic Fail, aka The Worst Book I Have Ever Read Ever. And I Have Read Some Awful Stuff.If I could give it no stars, I would. No, I lie. If I could give it minus stars, I would. Bella ""Mary-Sue"" Swan is preparing for her marriage to Edward ""Sparkle Sparkle Psycho Sparkle"" Cullen. After Jacob ""Werewolf/Shapeshifter/Who Knows Because It's Never Explained"" Black turns up, Bella completely ignores his advice not to marry creepy sparkle man, and goes on her honeymoon with her new husband to the deserted Isle Esme, which just happens to have its own cleaning crew. After Bella incessantly begs Edward ""The Pillow Biter Bruising Machine"" for some “in the lake fade to black” sex, she becomes pregnant with mutant vampire spawn! Oh noes! It's a medical miracle, because Smeyer said vampidoodles don't have any bodily fluids except venom. Coolness!Pancakes turn into bowls of cereal, Bella drinks blood from a plastic cup (obviously she was the one who worked out her half vampire spawn needed blood, the vampire doctor was clueless. And the vampire doctor then thought the best way to get blood in her system was for her to drink it. What medical school did he go to?) Edward “I Believe In Polygamy” offers up his wife to Jacob so they can make werewolf/shifter babies if Jacob agrees to persuade Bella to get rid of the mutant spawn. Jacob is all “Oh noes!” Bella becomes EVEN MORE beautiful after the horrific birth scene when Eddie turns her into a vamp (by the way, in book two Jasper ""Jazz"" attacked her because she had a paper cut. Now he can sit through an entire BIRTH without reacting?) Jacob “Kids Are Kool” then imprints on the lovingly named Renesmee, and nicknames the baby, who actually looks much older than she is due to accelerated aging, “Nessie”. When Nessie the Loch Ness turns seven, she’ll look twenty-one! Yay for Jacob! That’s totally okay! Edward “The Patroniser” calls Jacob his friend/brother/son and lets his daughter gallivant around with him freely due to the fact he just doesn’t give a toss. Bella manages to resist blood-thirst by simply RUNNING AWAY from the humans (how perfect our Bella is) and her cool new power is a love shield! Yay! Many random vampires turn up, so many in fact that we need a glossary-of-sorts at the back of the book just to work out who they are. These vamps just sit around and do nothing for a while until the Volturi turn up. Edward “Fighting Doesn’t Solve Problems, Talking Does” talks the Volturi into not killing them all while Bella protects everyone with her shield of love. The Volturi leave after a while, and everything is fine and dandy! Bella and Edward go have some more epic sex and live happily ever after.Moral of the story: Get married at eighteen, don’t bother having a career, education sucks, have a kid asap and look after it whilst your husbydoodle does everything for you because feminism is evil.Some conversations in Breaking Dawn:Bella: Oh em geedles, Alice, that dress is so perfect! Eddie will love it! Doesn’t it match my ring? Look at my ring Alice, isn’t it pretty? My ring is so amazing. What do you think of my ring Alice, what do you think?Alice: My precious…Bella: Whatsedoodles?Alice: I mean…how amazing and not at all unimportant! I wish I had the precious…I mean ring.Bella: Eddie-poo, I’m pregnant! How wonderful! Funny how you protect me from everything but this!Sparkle-man: This is not possible. It is unheard of. Carlisle is super duper old and has never heard of this before. Ooh, look, some people Alice happened to have found that conveniently have experienced our situation. Coolness.Bella: …and if it’s a boy, he can be called Edward Jacob Worthington Huntington the fourth, and if it’s a girl it…she can be called Gertrude. Or Carlie because it’s Carlisle and Charlie…NO WAIT. Renesmee! It’s so pretty…Sparkle-man: I want to eat you.Jacob: Hey, Nessie.Mutant-spawn: Do you love me, Jakie-pie?Jacob: Yeah. I used to love your mom! She was totally hot. I used to imagine having kids with her. But Eddie daddy got her pregnant so now I’m stuck with you. Second best is all right, I guess.Mutant-spawn: Yay!Volturi: We are here to kill you.Bella: I have a love shield and you don’t, nananana!Sparkle-man: Don’t kill us.Volturi: Okay.Jazz: Jazz hands, everyone!Everyone: -jazz hands-Bella: My life is awesome. I never had to sacrifice everything and I got everything I ever wanted and everything I never thought I wanted too! Yay!Some things you could use this book for: torture, a doorstop, a paperweight, fire, origami, torture, wrapping paper, decorations, torture.I think I’ve expressed how much I disliked this book. I can’t believe it was published. There were so many mistakes in it, I mean, if I, ME, could notice them, then how could an editor not? And the plot was horrific. Horrific. Not to mention badly written and mostly unexplained (SHAPESHIFTERS). Do yourself a favour, and don’t read this. Unless you want to experience slow, painful torture.

80,29700126,08/09/2008,1.0,"If you haven't read Breaking Dawn, be aware that this review contains spoilers. I'm kind of late posting this, but here it is.I've never been a big fan of this series, but this book topped it off for me. Stephenie Meyer's characters have never been anything special (where are the little details/great lines that give characters life?), but in this book the characters become inconsistent as well. (By the way, why are Edward and Bella in love?---as far as I can tell, it's because he's exceptionally good looking, and she smells good---which smell she should lose when she becomes a vampire, but Meyer isn't about following her own rules.) Edward goes from control freak to doormat (but he still seems to retain that one window to his soul---the fact that he likes expensive cars, so Bella gets to continue to whine about driving a Mercedes), but as Jacob's been my favorite character, I think what happens to him is worse. Until the second half of Breaking Dawn, he's the character with the most personality, at least. In fact, though I think it's kinda cheap of Meyer to conveniently go shifting to his viewpoint when it's always been Bella's before, I like getting his point of view because finally her writing shows a little voice. Then Jacob imprints on---I know people say it's non-sexual, but since imprinting's really all about reproduction, I can't help but think ""pedophilia"" here---Bella's baby, and he's done. His personality is totally lost, and he becomes some kind of odd nanny. I guess Meyer is too attached to her characters (flat, though they are) to kill any of them, but having him die for Bella or something would've killed him less than what she does to him in this book. So now we're supposed to believe that the whole thing pulling Bella and Jacob together was Bella's unborn child? I guess before the child was conceived, the egg must've been doing it. Speaking of the rapidly aging child (again, convenient---that speeds the plot along) with the unfortunate name, why not just change all the rules Meyer had set for vampires and have vampire babies with some lame scientific excuse about how men can have babies even when they're old, so that's why male vampires can do it---what? On to Bella---wow, I thought she was annoying as a human, but I could hardly stomach perfect vampire Bella with her cottage, and she loses her one, trite personality trait (other than whiny selfishness)---clumsiness ---when she goes vampire.That brings me to my next point: weak major conflict. I would say the major conflict of this series has been, should Bella become a vampire? Even when I read Twilight, I thought this was flimsy because I didn't see that Meyer had given becoming a vampire enough drawbacks---the sun doesn't shrivel them, they don't lose their souls, and *bonus* they're total lookers. Now that Bella has become a vampire, and it's like she's been resurrected and is in heaven, we can see that, yes, that conflict has always been hollow. Shoot, Bella doesn't even have to give up Charlie (who accepted all the weirdness so easily and didn't even want to ask questions---yeah, right) or having children.People have told me this book has some great surprises. Maybe. But that's because, in fact, Meyer didn't set things up properly. Think of, say, The Sixth Sense, that's good story crafting! Most people didn't see the end coming, but once we got there, we could see that it had been building to that point all along. Or consider Harry Potter, books that I think, unlike the Twilight books, deserve the hype. When we learn all of Snape's history and what he's really been doing all along, we see that it's been there since Book 1. Meyer just kind of forgets how she's set things up, makes vampires into superheroes, and throws this thing at us.Somehow Meyer marketed these books as ""vampire books for people who don't like vampire books"" as though that's something new---what? There are tons of teeny-bopper-vampire-romances and adult-vampire-romances out there. The adult ones are generally really heavy on the sex, but Meyer goes about as far as she can without mentioning a---you know I have to say it---""throbbing manhood"" in Breaking Dawn anyway. I will say the one thing Meyer does well is sexual tension, and now that the deed's been done, I'm not sure the whole nymphomania thing she has going in Breaking Dawn is as good. Look, if you find you like this genre, go check out DVDs of the first couple seasons of Buffy. Joss Whedon pulls off great drama AND great humor (something Meyer almost completely lacks). Or check out some L.J. Smith---her Night World series isn't anything special, but at least she doesn't take herself so seriously, and her work isn't pretentious. Come on, it's teeny-bopper-vampire-romance!",7,-0.9463,0.109,0.801,0.089,0.518344671201814,NEGATIVE,1.0

83,29910406,08/11/2008,1.0,"This book arrived at my doorstep at about 11am on Saturday. At 10:45 pm, I had finished this “book”. I have never hated a story as much as I hated this story. Hate.As a mother - HATE. The way she portrayed pregnancy as some horrifyingly alien habitation. Way to make your 14 year old fans be terrified of every having children ever in the history of ever. Because they might get impregnated with the demon spawn of hell who violently injures you every time you breathe…..but that still really loves you. Yuck. Just yuck.Excellent husbandry, Edward. Worried about your wife’s health as her pregnancy progresses? Concerned that continuing the pregnancy might endanger her life? Offer to CUT IT OUT OF HER AND SET IT ON FIRE and breed with with the local BFF wolfie dude if she just must have a baby. Could there please be more letters in “ew” because 2 isn’t enough to convey my revulsion. I won’t even touch the whole abortion issue, but just FYI? Offering to “breed out” your wife just so’s you can get rid of Abomination Baby DOES NOT FLY.Book Two? Is pretty good because at least Jacob is all snarky & pissed off about life in general. And his chapter titles were loltastic. But SERIOUSLY - DemonSpawn’s birth turns into a scene that was cut out of Hostel 3 because it was TOO GORY?? Stephenie? Your fans are never ever going to want to have children. EVER. Well done. And I know that vampire “venom” is all healing & stuff, but it’s kind of a difficult extension of the whole “suspension of disbelief” thing to believe it can RENEW HER SPINAL COLUMN and heal the huge gaping wound in her abdomen when HER HUSBAND CHEWED THE BABY OUT WITH HIS VAMPIRE TEETH. Because vampire skin (which Damien’s amniotic sac happened to be made of) is so tough that only vampire teeth can break through it. Dreamy. Always wanted my husband to gnaw my children out of my gut.I’m so glad that my children were in the basement as I finished the last 2 pages of Book Two. Because when I realized that Jacob IMPRINTED ON BELLA’S BABY OMG, I let out the biggest stream of disbelieving curses I’ve ever had. Yeah, Jakers. You can’t have Bella cuz she’s in love with the deliciously marbly hard vampire. Next best thing? Mack on her daughter. Yay. That’s awesome. And because even Stephenie agrees that it would be too grody to have Jacob have to wait 18 years for THE LOVE OF HIS LIFE’S DAUGHTER to get old enough to marry, Renesmeé (don’t even get me started with the stupidest, fan-fictiony baby name ever) is a bionic super baby who will be full grown in 6.5 years. And since Jacob’s imprinted on her, they’ll have the truest, soul-matey, friendship and LUV that ever luved. And everyone will forget about how Jacob totally wanted her mom once upon a time. EW.But the bestest part? Of course Bella’s the superhero bestest vampire EVAH. She’s all, like, self-controlled and not killing people and stuff. And her daughter’s a miraculous combination of Kirsten Dunst in Interview w/a Vampire (ringlets?? REALLY??) and a Speak-N-Spell. Who can charm people with a touch of her hand. But really? She’s the most amazingest vampire in the history of vampires? With Violet Incredible’s magical force field powers? I hate you, Bella Swan. You suck. And I want to punch you in the face, ‘cept apparently my fist would turn to powdery resin when I hit your strong, strong jaw. I hate you. And your perfect little love cabin in the woods. You are made of suck.And for those of you who haven’t read any of these and think I have to be making this up?

85,1472593226,12/18/2015,1.0,"2020 update: THIS IS SO PROBLEMATIC. So, I was discussing with a friend about racism in books. Naturally, I felt strongly to explain myself using the Twilight books. As we were talking I found I had forgotten a lot of the story (that was no accident) so I started a reread. It's quite hard to get my thoughts out here but I'll try.The books are incredibly racist, and anyone saying not so are blind and fooling themselves. The biggest problem is the depiction of the Quileute tribes, the existing Native Americans. They are often referred to as a threat to the white society of Forks. In New Moon there is an assumption that the werewolves are responsible for biting/attacking town locals, and this is neither explained or ever acknowledged again.In the old traditional Quileute stories, one of the women sacrifices herself in order to save the tribe from a vampire. It is thought to be a huge sacrifice where all Quileutes are still thankful for, and delivers a nice campside story. In the third book, Bella performs a same kind of action, cutting herself to distract vampires. She performs the same action, but does not kill herself, because she goes about it a little ""smarter"". This draws a racial parallel to the story, but Bella is more succesful. This is some form of glorification of the white peoples and I even call it a form of white supremacy. White supremacy is also depicted in the form of the vampire coven having loads of money, being very refined and classy, described as extremely beautiful. On the other hand, the Quileutes are ""dogs"", ""beasts"" and ""savages"". When they're not in wolf form, they are described as overgrown, shirtless muscled guys. And what also grinds my gears is that in the first three books, it is very clear what Bella gives up if she decides to become a vampire. Her mortality, not able to produce a baby, being a savage for years, her relationship with Jacob, etcetera. And behold - in this book it gets thrown all out of the window and Bella gets everything! She is way more beautiful, she has a nice baby, she is very civilised from the beginning, and there's even a place for Jacob in her life! What a happy end. Does the author think we're all fools? I don't want a happy end like this. I want some closure from the long series she's created and all the buildup she made.And I'm not going to start on the plain-out pedophelia of imprinting. That just grosses me out.2018 thoughts:Well, I finished it.. it left holes in my soul I think. I really didn't hate Twilight, but this book is just horrible.

86,1272713421,05/05/2015,4.0,"*babbling alert, babbling alert.I voted for breaking dawn Best Feminist booksto enrage the feminists that give the name a bad name. If you think that a woman should be able to choose her destiny and fight for it, like Bella did, please give a vote for the twilight saga.You would think that a series that presents a heroine who works hard to get what she wants in life, to overpower the wills of the stronger vampires and werewolves that surround her, that stands her ground against her dad when he wants to end her relationship, and who is willing to do everything she needs to do to have the life that she wants would be consider empowering. But no! The feminists come and complain that a young girl wants to get married and become a vampire without understanding the context. Being a strong female doesn't mean to be heartless, doesn't mean to ignore love, doesn't mean to be a man with a vagina, doesn't mean to be willing to abort your child so you won't risk your life (although I was on Edward's side on this one). Being a woman means to take decisions and to live up to the consequences of them. Like Bella.Bella vampire would kick the asses of every single female heroine out there. I might not think all of Bellas' decisions were okay, but if being a feminist means that you will pretend that love isn't important, that you won't recognize the signs of a depressed woman (Bella in new moon needed serious therapy and a sunnier place, any phychologist would tell you this) if it means you won't sympathize with a girl who is going through depression, I don't want to ever become a feminist. I just want that every woman receives equal payment and has the power to take decisions. Other than that I don't have sympathy for the feminist cause, when it's mostly feminists who come and complain about my favorite books. A real feminist should spend her time fighting for equal rights, not trashing books and judging the people who read it.Sorry for the long rant, I'm very passionate about twilight.",7,0.6549,0.109,0.776,0.115,0.4888713667285095,NEGATIVE,0.9552

This book did have its faults at some points but I honestly can't think of them right now because they were so minimal compared to all the beautiful wonderfulness cheesiness in it.Edward and Bella were just so on point and perfect and cheesy and just wonderful (as usual)... SPOILER DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T READ OR BEEN SPOILED ALREADY OR SEEN  BREAKING DAWN --------------------------------------------...and with Renesmee it was so much better. When Renesmee called Bella ""Mommy"" (which was several times in the book) my heart just freaking melted. Bella kept saying how everybody just adored Renesmee and I honestly feel part of that group of people. And that moment when she called Edward ""Daddy"" was just ... *tear rolls down cheek* I have to say I was freaking crying all the time the last 200 pages because of Bella and her thought of losing Renesmee and Edward was just heartbreaking.And the Alice running off thing!!!!!!!--------------------------------------------Anyway... this book was absolutely brilliant and I loved it so much. I don't understand why we can't rate books 6 stars cause this one deserves it (well in my heart it does).Also I'm reading the series again in a month or so... And the month after that. And in the meantime I'll be watching the movies over and over again.",8,0.9957,0.055,0.755,0.19,0.6173840048840049,POSITIVE,0.9997
88,54807862,05/03/2009,1.0,"I wrote this review in 2008, but it's still true! NOTE: Spoilers below for Breaking Dawn, and for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. First of all, let me just state that I had preconceived notions about this series when I began it. I have never read Fantasy until I discovered Lord of the Rings, and even then, LOTR and Harry Potter were about all I could handle. I am also not a huge fan of romances. For me, happy endings should have a little more depth than 'they all lived happily ever after.' I used to like romances. My favorite book in high school was The Unlikely Romance of Kate Bjorkman precisely for the neat and tidy lovey dovey ending. But I have different interests now, and vampires and romance are not high on the list.However, I forced myself to read Twilight and New Moon, and they really hooked me on the series. I thought Eclipse was great. I was fascinated by Stephenie Meyer's take on vampires and werewolves, and I loved the way she took the conventions of what legendary vampires and werewolves are like and played with them, making them her own. And I have always loved Jacob Black. He is probably my favorite character in the whole series. So while I came into the series with preconceived notions, I came to Breaking Dawn with high hopes.They have been dashed.Bella Swan became boring for me almost immediately. Her personality in the earlier books was a little bit more pronounced - even when she was pining for Edward, even when Edward left her and went off to the Volturi, there were still glimpses into her personality that were unique, that made her a character and not just a name with a voice that spouts dialogue. And there was always suspense, a struggle, something going on that made you wonder whether she was really going to become a vampire. I think that was important too, because it made the reader question whether or not she would go through with it, and whether or not she should. I had serious doubts at the end of Eclipse. And I kind of wanted her not to go through with it. I wanted to see her choose to remain human in spite of her all-consuming love for Edward. Or I wanted some twist where she could compromise, or prolong her decision. Something.What I got was a freakin half-vampire baby named Reneesme. WTF. No, seriously, there are a million ways this story could have gone that would not have pissed me off. A billion even! Bella, even when she didn't have a personality anymore, was at least kind of rebellious and her mom was a feminist, and she wasn't a bad role model for teenage girls. She was a flawed role model, who questioned her beliefs and the beliefs she was raised with. I could live with that. But from the moment she and Edward had sex for the first time, Bella became a disaster.First of all, the bruises. I have to talk about the bruises. I get that the only reason having sex with Edward caused so much injury was that his body is a lot harder than hers. And I know he said he wouldn't do it again, blah blah blah. But come on! A young girl, all alone in a cabin with some guy, with bruises all over her body. In vampire-land, fine, it's an accident. But there are real teenage girls in this world whose boyfriends hit them, who are left bruised and making excuses - he does it because he loves me, he won't do it again, I like it when we're close - NO. The message there is just not right. If Edward loves Bella, Edward doesn't hurt her like that. And if he does knowingly hurt her like that, she needs to be traumatized by that. No boyfriend-inflicted bruises should ever be dismissed that easily by any woman, fictional or not, vampire or not. And I am the last person who normally gets worked up over these things, but MAN that got to me.And then we jumped the shark. A few of them, actually. We jumped them like hurdles.We lose Bella as a believable character when we discover that she is the only person who can do pretty much everything. Only human whose thoughts Edward can't read. Only human who can have a baby with a vampire. (Or one of the only.) And of course she's the only one who can shield her family from Aro & co. when they show up. She is a ridiculously perfect character in every way except that she is clumsy, and then it turns out that she's only clumsy because basically, she was born to be a vampire all the time. Oh, and that crazy newborn vampire stuff? She's immune to that too. Because she is immune to everything!And then the whole Reneesme thing. I found this entire storyline to be totally unnecessary and unenjoyable. I was okay with the marriage part. I saw logical reasons as to why they had to get married, especially since Edward is very old-fashioned and he was stuck at 17 forever. They weren't getting married because Bella believes all women should get married. They had other reasons. But then, suddenly, she's married and it makes her want babies!? She doesn't think about babies at all, and then suddenly, she's having one, so she's fine with it. No woman is going to be fine with an unknown monster trying to break free from her womb. But do we get to see Bella's pain firsthand? Of course not. Just when you might see Bella Swan have to suffer for a second, we switch to Jacob's point of view.And you know what, thank God for Jacob. His section of the book is the only truly well-written part of the entire book. And that's because Jacob really is flawed. Jacob acts without thinking, takes a stand at great cost, and spends lot of time whining and moping over what he can't have. It's annoying, but it's at least somewhat more genuine than Bella's fleeting moments of discomfort that are never fully explored. Jacob almost saved this book for me, until the ultimate 'jump the shark' moment. He imprints on Reneesme.Are you kidding me?! First of all, in the rules of Stephenie Meyer's vampire/werewolf universe, imprinting is rare. But then she turns around and has every single werewolf we care about imprinting on some girl. Why say it's rare, then? Why not just have imprinting be a part of werewolf life, and let Jacob whine that it hasn't happened for him yet? And then she has him imprint on Reneesme!? I threw the book when that happened. I looked up from it, my jaw dropped, and I just shoved it away from me. I was done. From then on, I skimmed. I got through the ending, but I didn't care anymore. She had broken her own rules. I felt how I did when I read the HP epilogue. And JKR broke her rules too. Harry died and came back, when the rule of her universe is that the dead stay dead.What a waste. What a waste of a perfectly good idea. I am just dumbfounded by how poorly she wrapped things up. It was a big mess of cliches and contrived crap, and I found myself tripping over all these problems just wanting to know how it ended. And the ending wasn't even satisfying. Of course it turns out that Bella's daughter will hit a certain point and then age. And of course Bella and Edward are happy and in love. Never mind how we're going to explain this to poor Renee, who was kept in the dark the whole time, or what happened to her soul. What happened to all those concerns about being immortal, about ruining her and sending her to Hell? Those went away because her boyfriend is sparkly and her best friend imprinted on her daughter?I was ready to defend this book before I read it. Now I'm ready to chuck it in a dumpster.",5,0.9978,0.102,0.75,0.147,0.5567639027639024,POSITIVE,0.9838
89,24992613,06/20/2008,3.0,"(** Warning spoilers**)Now that I have had time to step back and think about Breaking Dawn, here is my review. I am actually going to review the Twilight series as a whole.I love Stephenie Meyer for three major reasons. First, she knows how to develop a character. I love how she defines each of the unique dispositions of Bella, Edward, and Jacob. For example, because Bella was the “adult” in her relation between her and her parents, it allowed her to be put in situations in which she must grow up faster than a typical teenager. And yet, she has an innocence and naiveté which presents an opposition to her internal makeup. Edward is, by nature of being a vampire, complex. Woman love the tortured beautiful man. And Edward is tragic, and oh so beautiful. Meyer has a way of making Edward strong and abrasive but weak and gentle at the same time. Moving on to Jacob, Jacob, Jacob. I love Jacob, for me he is the Yin to this story’s Yang. He is the very essence of a teenage boy. However, I believe Jacob has the most insight out of all the characters. You may be saying, “What?” But, without writing a novel myself, I have to leave it at that. And by the way, I love when he was rough with Bella! She had it coming. I don’t know why people give Jacob so much crap? Furthermore, Jacob’s fate with Renesmee takes away from Jacob’s character. I find it hard to believe that Jacob would be content in having Bella as a mother-in-law (and that Edward would be ok having Jacob hang around), since he once loved her in a romantic way.The second reason I love Meyer is because, through her character development and the emotion she pours into her stories, she can make you escape into the world she has created. While I was reading, I was in Forks! And when I wasn’t reading, I was thinking about Forks. I craved to walk along the rocky beaches that hugged La Push. I wanted to feel the damp air while hiking through the lush green forest behind Bella’s house. I even wanted to be sitting in a Biology class! WOW, she’s good!The third reason I am drawn to Meyer’s series is her ability to create an epic conflict. The first conflict of a vampire who is in love with the one person he wants to kill the most. Second, the conflict between Bella’s two loves. I think it was great that Meyer made Jacob an actual candidate to be Bella’s love. It not only gave the story more texture, but it made Bella’s choice for Edward much more valid. Bella knew what human love was and she could see the possible human life she could have at her fingertips. Not only could she see it, but there was a part of her that craved it. This posed the question, what and how much would you give up for your one true love? The third conflict takes the cake; vampire boyfriend has one mortal enemy, the best friend werewolf. How fun is that!?! I was a kid in a candy store with this one. It was so tragic, and the bond Bella had with them both was so real to me. I truly had a broken heart for Jacob. But when Edward left Bella, I was holding the hole in my stomach right along with Bella. THAT is a mark of a good writer, someone who makes the emotions so real you feel what the characters are feeling.Why then, why did Meyer take this conflict that felt so real and drop it into a big glass of Alka-Seltzer only to watch it fizzle out? Let me explain: The first three books were slow. The internal monologue inside Bella’s head took us through each of Bella’s steps. We felt every emotion that Bella felt and were there for every experience she had. That is one reason why these book are so estrogen-charged. We, as women, like to go through our thought processes, and of those we seek to know, through analyzing their actions. That is what makes us great and severely annoying at the same time(Bella). In Breaking Dawn, we lost out on a lot of Bella’s internal dialogue, in part, I think, because Meyer bit off more than she could chew. Therefore, the book felt rushed. I did like how the book jumped right into the wedding. It was a little creepy the way Jacob came and danced with Bella on the porch though, then proceeded to ask about the “honeymoon”. I know Jacob can be overbearing, but give me a break! This was the point in the book when I knew for certain that Meyer was going to resolve to be creepy (Renesmee), rather than take the less creepy, but more realistic, road. I can’t say I have the perfect ending in mind for my beloved Twilight characters; however, as a devoted fan there were a couple of things I would have liked to have seen happen. For starters, boyfriend and best friend needed to duke it out! What better time than at the wedding? By so doing, the wedding/transformation would be postponed, thus bringing about a visit from the Volturi. And, in a heroic effort to save Bella, Jacob is killed by Aro. Then all the Jacob haters could see him as vulnerable and endearing as Bella does. And,the Jacob fans would always be able to look back and love Jacob even more for his selflessness. He could have been Twilight’s Sydney Carton (from “A Tale of Two Cities”). This end would have been truer to Jacob’s character, in contrast to the vampire lapdog Meyer made him. Second, one of the strong themes of this book was making sacrifices for the one you love. This could have been Jacob’s sacrifice for Bella. That leads me to the sacrifices Bella makes for love - oh wait, there were none! Needless to say, I was not a fan of the pregnancy; but, that was what she could have given up. (We could have avoided the alien child with the hybrid name altogether.) After all, isn’t Edward prize enough? I know some may say that this sounds morally wrong for an upstanding Mormon, like myself, to ditch the kid. However, please remember this is a story about a vampire! On a positive note, I thought the time we had with Bella as a vampire was well worth the wait. I thought her first time hunting was great, and her encounter with the humans was fun to see through her new eyes. I also enjoyed her transformation. But, I did wish that Bella wasn’t able to control herself as well. It would have been nice to see her go through the same process the rest of the vampires had to endure. And, of course, Meyer made Bella the super-vampire who was able to pass over the “newborn” phase. Again, an obstacle diverted. It would have been so fun to see Bella go nuts. Within the context of the story, the way in which Bella was turned into a vampire was interesting. However, the way Bella transformed was a missed opportunity for a romantic moment between Bella and Edward. Okay, I know that may sound a bit weird, let me explain. It would have been validating to finally have Edward choose Bella for eternity. And, there is something kind of sexy about the deadly/immortal kiss of a vampire. I wanted that moment. Not the one where Bella is birthing E.T. and she’s going to die, giving Edward no CHOICE…key word: choice. On a side note, I think it would have been so cool if Bella's ""after car"" was her Chevy truck, restored to it's original 1950's condition.In the end, even Charlie gets to be part of Bella's life. And, convieniently, he wants no information regarding the strange goings-on in Bella's new life and her mistery child. It's frustrating to me that this story was able to resolve so many obsticles with so much ease. Meyer has an amazing imagination and I admire her for the stories and the characters she is able to create.Ultimately, I will read Breaking Dawn one more time, so I can fully grasp what is happening. However, Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse will be books I will read over and over again.",5,0.9997,0.07,0.735,0.195,0.5100610972951402,POSITIVE,0.9995

I did try to read this from the perspective of my 13/14 year old self - I felt that was only fair, as per the below - and, in her opinion, I actually thought this was enjoyable and a pretty good end to the series. So I read Twilight when I was, I think, 13? And I absolutely loved it, as did all my friends. I begged my mum to buy me New Moon immediately (I didn’t have any money, obviously) and I was SO happy when she did, and so excited to start reading it, I rushed straight to my room... and I don’t think I’d ever been so disappointed in my entire short life. I hated it. It was so cringeworthy - and that’s coming from a 13 year old girl - and disappointing. I still read Eclipse when that came out, although I didn’t rush to buy it on release day or anything, and I actually loved Eclipse but my care for this series had so badly waned after New Moon and that wasn’t enough to revive it. I intended to read Breaking Dawn but felt no need to rush out and get it as soon as it was released and so time passed and before I knew it, over a decade has passed and the release of Midnight Sun has suddenly reminded me that I still hadn’t read this.So here we are.

91,29281539,08/04/2008,1.0,"Blegh. [SPOILERS]I think Meyer had a tough line to walk here. I think she wanted to give fans what they wanted, but also felt a sense of responsibility to ""set a good example"" or something for the teenaged girls who read them.That is a bad idea. I understand why she felt the sense of responsibility, but really, the thing got so utterly polemic that any ""artistic"" value it could potentially have (mostly as an entertaining distraction) went out the window. What did fans want out of this book? It's essentially a fantasy novel, and it's meant to be a distraction. It isn't freaking Tolstoy. It's squeely vicarious drooly junk. It shouldn't pretend to be more than it is. In order to be the best it could be as a ""fun distraction"" novel, it should have delivered what we wanted: sex and violence. It delivered neither. First, Bella and Edward GET MARRIED even though she's 18 (yes, excellent example for young girls). You would think that Meyer would feel free to open up a little in the now-sanctioned-by-God zone of marital sex, but no. All we get is fade to black and some amusing descriptions of the aftermath (i.e. broken headboard, shredded pillows). THEN, as if to add insult to injury, she promptly slaps Bella (and the reader) upside the head with GIANORMOUS CONSEQUENCES (i.e. demon spawn baby that kills her). How is this fair? Meyer punishes us for sex we didn't even get to enjoy. The whole baby thing is meh/whatever... there are some interesting elements to it, but it feels more like Meyer is trying to write a love letter to motherhood, ""setting an example"" to the girls about how parent-to-child love can be EVEN MORE MAGICALLY POWERFUL than the uber-magical romance between soulmates. Give me a break. WE DON'T CARE. WE WANT SEX AND VIOLENCE.And then there's the fizzle of a conclusion. The gang prepares for an epic battle against the Big Scary Bad Guys. They call All! The Vampires! In the World! To stage an uprising against the Volturi. Bella trains to use her ""shield"" gift in battle. She prepares a backup plan complete with fake passports and lots of cash for her daughter and Jacob. Everything is dramatic and apocalyptic for a few chapters, and you plow through the boring crap just to get to the big fight where the Volturi get their asses kicked. They're on the battlefield! Bella gets mad! Her powers explode into awesomeness! The fight is about to begin! The good guys might win! And then! Nothing! Happens!NOTHING. HAPPENS.No sex. No violence. Nada. Zip. Zilch.Now. I don't want to be a stereotyping jerk and say that just because Meyer is a Mormon she has to be a big prude and have backward notions about gender relations.But she's a big prude and has backward notions about gender relations. The message she thinks she's delivering to her impressionable fans:1) True love is more powerful and important than anything!2) You should get married before you have sex because it's the right thing to do! And it means you really love each other!3) If you have sex you will get pregnant! Because that's the point of sex, and anything other than Man + Woman = Baby is wrong. 4) Motherhood is the best thing that could ever happen to (even better than the relationship you just threw your life away for) and you should sacrifice everything, including your life, in order to protect your baby!5) Violence isn't necessary! As long as you have the truth on your side, everything will work out fine!The message she's actually sending:1) You should throw your life away on the first hardcore crush that comes along when you're in HIGH SCHOOL, before you're even sure about what you want out of life (or un-life). 2) It is preferable to make a religious and legal commitment that will affect, if not determine, the rest of your life rather than have sex with someone you love without someone else's permission. Even if you're 18. 3) If you have sex you will get pregnant. And die. Even if you didn't think you could, and even if you do everything right (i.e. getting married). Because that is what sex is for. Women are for making babies. The end. 4) Death is preferable to aborting unplanned demon spawn. Women are for making babies. Priority to babies. The end.5) I am boring. Anyway. Like I said, it's clear that she's trying to moralize the hell out of her young fans, and basically advocates the female life path of get married/have kids before you have a chance to grow into an independent human. Originally, I didn't find Bella's complete deference and passivity towards her boyfriend a big nuisance; I just brushed if off because, hey, this isn't a serious novel. Now that I see where Meyer was going with it, it gets more and more disturbing. Sacrifice self, obey master/husband, make babies.I could go on for days. But to get back to why the book sucks (besides it's patriarchal brainwashing), I think the answer is that it sucks *because* of the polemic. Meyer pulled the strings to push her message, not to take the characters through an engaging and enjoyable journey, as she did in the first ""Twilight"" book. The first one was silly, yes, but but it was an enjoyable fantasy. ""Breaking Dawn"" tries to pull messy things like 'consequences' into the fantasy, and, ironically, makes it less and less believable. Vampires aren't supposed to be normal, so why does Meyer wrestle them to the ground and force them to play nice with her notions of what human domestic tranquility should look like? She took the characters out of *their* universe and tried to shove *her* morals down their throats. Of course it didn't work. Though I doubt I'll be using vampires as a vehicle for promoting patriarchal oppression anytime soon, her blunder is a good one to keep in mind. You can't use your characters as puppets for animating your own belief system unless it makes sense. If you're going to do it, it has to seem natural. I can't think of a more incompatible combination than erotic-vampire-romance-action meets prudish-family-oriented-nonviolent drivel, but for some reason she thought she could make it work. She probably only succeeded in alienating all the thousands of fans who made her work a success to begin with.",5,0.9966,0.118,0.711,0.171,0.5133708900226759,NEGATIVE,1.0

I listened in one-hour chunks while I did my dishes and made dinner, which made my listening spread over like 6 weeks. (Also this book is long as hell!) I lived for the chunk of every day where I listened to Bella being an absolute dumb bitch. Breaking Dawn is the glorious conclusion of the Twilight saga where all rules of the ""real world"" and basic narratives fly out the window. The first half is vampire sex and nightmare pregnancy. The second half is a bunch of vampires and werewolves gathering on a field for what turns into nothing more than a long chat. Almost every non-mythical character from the previous books are totally dropped. So many new vampires are introduced in the book's last quarter. Jacob famously imprints on a literal newborn. Bella continues to hate humanity and herself, even after she transforms. Nothing makes sense. The dialogue is clunky. The happily-ever-after conclusion feels hellish when you really examine it. I hadn't reread this book since it came our when I was in high school, and as a 31-year-old reviewer who frankly hasn't been leaving her apartment very often in 2021, my official blurb is: This book rules so much. 10,000 stars.

93,29076360,08/02/2008,4.0,"First of all, I really enjoyed this book. That doesn't mean I thought it was perfect, but I really think it deserves more than one puny little star. *Beware- there are spoilers*Before I defend the book, I will say that I do have some grievances with it. I think it was too long. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed reading every page. But I think SM could have and possibly shoud have cut the book in half, making the saga 5 books long instead of 4. There was so much that happened, and at points, I did get the slightest feeling she was just trying to end it as easily as she could. For example, I kind of feel like the scene with the Volturi ended too easily. There was so much build up and then...nothing. I would have enjoyed a cool battle. Bella made a really cool vampire, and I enjoyed the parts where she used her new powers. She could have made it so no one died, if that was the reason she avoided the battle. Oh, well. It didn't bug me so much that it ruined the story for me. Also, because the book was so long and so much happened, there were some minor plot holes. Like, the whole Leah thing. She was developing somthing and then, again...nothing. I also think because the book was so long, it wasn't as well written as the others. I admit too that I didn't love the name Renesmee. Couldn't she have come up with something better. But, after a while, it did grow on me a little. I'm with Bella- Nessie is a dumb nickname. Anyway, I'm not going to obsess over these things to the point that they ruin the story for me. Here's why:I thought it ended perfectly. Some are annoyed that it was too perfect. But, isn't that what happens in a fairy tale love story? I think SM is too much of a romantic herself to have had any other ending. Before the book came out, I was very skeptical of how she could make a happy ending for Bella and Edward. But, I think she did a fantastic job. There was no way she could please everyone, but I love what she came up with. What's so wrong about a happily-ever-after ending, anyway? Why are people so negative about that? I think some are mad because Bella got everything she wanted. So what? She had to work pretty hard for it. I love that Bella and Edward got to have a family. I know some people thought that was a stretch, but I was so happy. That's one reason I didn't want her to be a vampire. Some seem to be annoyed that she all of a sudden was so maternal and ready to be a mother. I think, just like most first time mothers, she was surprised herself to find that she wanted it. Yes she's only 18, but has she every acted her age? Her mom always told her how old she acted, and even Edward said that in Twilight. Other people think the whole thing is too weird, especially the birht and everything. What do you expect? The father is a vampire! Some people are grossed out by how Edward got the baby out, like they think he was enjoying having to bite through her uterus. Give me a break!People also seem bugged because she chose family over an education. Where does it say in the book that she was never going to learn anything ever again? Was she just going to sit around for eternity staring into space? Edward himself told her why he was so smart- because he had so much free to time read! Duh! And, in order to blend, she'll have to go to school, just like they all have. Grrrr! It really bugs me that people act like she's stupid for having a family and not going to school. It's very insulting to me as a mother. Like they're telling me I must be uneducated and stupid for being a stay-at-home mom. Well, I'm not!!!! I am a mother ! (thank you Jane Clayson) I better get off this subject before I get too upset. I also loved where SM took Bella's character. I admit that in ther other books I didn't know how I felt about her. I wanted to like her but I felt like I didn't have much reason to. But in this book Bella finally found who she was inside. She herself said that in life she wasn't anything special. She was never really really good at anything. Then when she became a vampire, she was really good at it. It gave her more confidence in herself. She truly was happy too. I wasn't sure she would be, but she was. I always thought that the reason Bella and Edward were so attracted to each other was that he was a vampire and she was human. I was relieved to find that it wasn't and their love only grew. It wasn't just becoming a vampire that made Bella find herself. It was having her daughter. She became a different person because of Renesmee, like every mother does after having a child.I also liked, contrary to many, that Jacob imprinted on Renesmee. I was shocked at first because I didn't see it coming at all. But was happy. I do not agree with the people who think it's disgusting. SM makes it clear in the book that's not what it's about, at least at first. I didn't want the book to end with Jacob the loser and I didn't want it to end with Jacob imprinting on some random person because he would still always miss Bella and she him. I really wanted Jacob and Bella to be able to be together somehow. I really love how it worked out.There were a lot of other things I loved. I loved the surprises, although there were a few things I predicted. I loved the part in Jacob's perspective- it brought some humor into the book (don't get me wrong- I love the Cullens, but sometimes they can be a bit too negative and serious). I loved that things worked out with Bella's Dad. I didn't really understand what he thought happened to her, but I'm just glad she was able to have him in her life.I'd really like to read the book again. I think the one-star givers should too and give it a second chance. I think it's the perfect ending to a wonderful story. I was sad to have it be over, but I'm content knowing they did live happily-ever-after (again, why are people so annoyed by that?

Chances are you either a) have already read it and are very opinionated (loved it; hated it) b) are planning to read it and have already read other spoiler reviews (like all the ones on Amazon) c) are planning to read it and are avoiding all reviews just in case they have some spoilers d) have no interest in reading it at all. (So far--on Amazon--as of Wednesday, September 13th 10AM Central time, it has received 2, 251 reviews: 925 5 star reviews, 317 4 star reviews, 197 3 star reviews, 250 2 star reviews, and 562 1 star reviews.) There will be spoilers.I have extremely mixed feelings on Breaking Dawn. Probably the biggest problem with the novel is that it defies logic. And I'm not just talking because they're werewolves and vampires. In the first three novels, Meyer has created--for the most part--a very realistic accounting. Yes, there are vampires and other supernatural beings, but they're written in such a way that they feel real. It reads like typical realistic fiction. It's not hard to swallow, to suspend your disbelief. Yes, Meyer's fictional world doesn't quite match up with reality, but it has its own set of rules to go by. Its own logic. Not in Breaking Dawn.Breaking Dawn reminds me of the movie Soap Dish. It almost seems to be a spoof of the first three novels. The rules are being rewritten as you go. The rules and logic are very slippery. Almost all of the logic that has evolved in the first three novels and in the first few chapters of Breaking Dawn even will be tossed out the window by book two. The only explanation used by the characters are that they didn't know. They're just as surprised as the rest of us at the strange goings on in the plot. Meyer really doesn't give us much more to go on. We're just supposed to believe so thoroughly that Bella--both as human and vampire--was so one-of-a-kind, so unique, so magically supernatural that of course she can do anything she wants. She's had the power all along. In New Dawn and Eclipse and even Twilight, Meyer backs up her supernatural beings with supernatural mythology and logic. She explains why they exist, how they exist, gives them purpose, defines their limitations, explores their needs and intents. Not so with Breaking Dawn. There are no answers to the questions.The other reason is that Breaking Dawn is just so weird, so very very weird. The fast-acting, miracle-gro vampire sperm that compacts a nine month pregnancy into three or four weeks. The wonder-baby that develops from a newborn to a preschooler (almost looks 5) in just five months. We're told in the end that she'll be fully grown (an adult) in just seven years. Jacob's imprinting on the baby. Edward calling Jacob both ""brother"" and ""son."" Jacob's living in the Cullen house. Edward asking Jacob at one point to have sex with Bella and give her some pups. The all-night sex marathons just a week after giving birth. I could go on and on and on.Bella. I've had my fair share of issues with Bella. She was whiny. She was too dependent. She was too immature. She was manipulative (though to be fair all the characters have been manipulative.) Bella has never been the ""role model"" teen in my opinion. Her whole world is Edward, she idolizes him. She places him so far above herself in the first three books--and in half of this book as well--that it's just too unhealthy. She sees him as perfect, flawless, the one and only reason for her existence. And that's just dangerous as we saw in New Moon. In some ways, becoming a vampire corrects some of these Bella-flaws. She's more of his equal now. But the doting has only intensified. The scary thing for me is the portrayal of their love. For me it isn't their age. It's not that they're 17-and-18 and getting married. They're going to be trapped at those ages for eternity. And age is just a number after all. (Though I must say that if it was any other ""human"" experiencing that much panic and anxiety and cold feet and still going to go through with the wedding anyway it would be a big mistake. I don't typically buy into the hidden-or-not-so-hidden messages in books. But the message of this one early on could be frightening; ignore your own feelings, ignore your intuitions and judgment, and get married anyway. That would be frightening for any age.) No, the issue for me is how sickeningly sweet, perfectly perfect, oozing in euphoria the happy couple is at all times.""Happiness was the main component in my life now, the dominant pattern in the tapestry."" (527)""And then Edward hugged me tightly, because nothing pleased him more than my overwhelming ecstasy in this new life. And I was euphoric the vast majority of the time. The days were not long enough for me to get my fill of adoring my daughter, the nights did not have enough hours to satisfy my need for Edward."" (527)I believe that people can be happy in their marriages. But overwhelming ecstatic and euphoric the vast majority of time on a day in day out forever and ever basis? Not likely. Problems happen. Arguments happen. You get annoyed. You get frustrated. You have bad days. You have good days. You have so-so days. Life happens. Life is not perfect. No one gets everything they want. But I don't think its possible--single or married--to go through life ""overwhelmingly ecstatic."" Some of Bella's descriptions are just over-the-top sickeningly sweet.And it's not like I want Bella to be miserable. Or for Edward to become un-perfect in her eyes. Or vice versa. But still.Yet, if you could go outside yourself you could find yourself enjoying it in a very amusing way. Yes, it's not believable. Yes, it's very very weird. But entertaining? I must say that it is.",5,0.9949,0.09,0.781,0.129,0.5832516725698543,NEGATIVE,0.9805

97,119523255,08/31/2010,2.0,"“The Addams Family” OR “The Cullen Coven”, which would I prefer as a next-door paranormal neighbour?Without a doubt, I would go for the deliciously macabre Addams. They put the G in Goth; were fun, flawed and had morbid fun in their gory pursuits.The Cullens on the other hand continue in their irritatingly perfect ways. I had hoped that the title “Breaking Dawn” signified a new dawn for the hidden facets of the Cullen Clan, but sadly (and teeth-grindingly), they played true to form.My particular peeves: a)	Perfect patriarch Carlisle could have ditched his eternally compassionate stand and have a moment of self-doubt. Should he support his family or play-nice with the Volturi? But no, he “furrowed his brows” and “clenched his jaw” and basically played Donald Trump of the newly-risen.b)	Esme could have been assigned some kind of pivotal role besides being relegated to interior-designer for the self-absorbed undead honeymooners.c)	Emmett, Mr. My-massive-biceps-are-rusting-with-disuse didn’t get one measly opportunity to display his insane strength and fighting prowess. He deserved at least one hands-on combat with the Volturi vanguard. Losing to newly-turned obnoxious vamp Bella in a bout of arm-wrestling was the straw that broke this buff-vampire’s back.d)	Rosalie, who uncharacteristically helped Bella through her pregnancy with the sole purpose of letting the fledgling immortal live, could have displayed a grey area by being overtly possessive of Renesmee and resenting the bond that birth-mother and daughter share. But no, she was relegated to guessing the punch lines of Jacob’s lame blonde-jokes.e)	Alice, the Tinkerbell of the undead, fulfilled her wedding-planner aspirations, and played a pivotal role of saving Renesmee’s undead butt (for which, the perennially ungrateful Bella whined some more).f)	Silent assassin, Jasper didn’t get a flicker of action. What’s the point of having a rich and scarred history of brutally fighting undead newborns if all he did in the ultimate book is play supportive metrosexual mate to Alice? g)	Renesmee frankly freaked me out. A vampire baby that matures at an alarming rate and transcends thoughts by touching your cheek?!? This is one baby that scared the living daylights out of me! h)	And finally,*reluctant drumroll*i)	Edward and Bella :  How do I loathe thee? Let me count the ways. The nauseating couple stoop to new levels of self-absorption, selfishness and pure disregard for anything outside their hallowed circle. They have no compulsions about messing with also-ran Wolf boy, Jacob’s emotions. Whole covens can be decimated so that their precious offspring can survive. A sizeable (and regrettable) chunk of the book was devoted to their combined yuckiness. Yep, real charming protagonists…NOT!!!Moving on to the likeable factors:a)	Jacob Black: I feel for ol’wolf-breath. Renesmee as a future love-interest didn’t go down well with me. It was downright creepy and a poor ending for a cocky, charming second-lead. Leah, the temperamental but spiky she-werewolf would have made such an ideal match for Jacob. She was strong, had a pained history but a newly developed staunch loyalty towards Jacob and above all, she had gumption (something which Madame Blah-Bella could use a transfusion of). It didn’t help that the “blood-drinkers” kept oscillating between treating him like an untouchable and then relying on his loyalty to save the day. Despite all that, he is the most endearing character in the series. b)	Garrett: the Nomadic vampire with a spirit of reckless adventure. His monologue at the end of the book had the right touch of revolutionary fervour and his eventual pairing up with the fiery Kate was something that appealed to me. c)	The steady build-up of tension to the moment when the Volturi finally makes it’s sinister appearance. Very well-written. You could almost taste the metallic hint of oncoming evil.I read the book because I wanted to know how it all ended. I didn’t want to read it enough that I went out and bought the book. I waited a good two years and picked it up from the library. I wish that all the pots of ink that were wasted on Edward and Bella’s wedding, their honeymoon and the birth of Renesmee could have instead been devoted to a healthy offering of back stories on the various Covens. Their histories, their agonies of leading a damned life and an elaboration of their individual powers would have made for engrossing reading. The Volturi and their sinister army should have got an adequate chance to exhibit their individual shades of wicked-nasty. No such luck.The majority of the book was all about the “perfection of Edward” and the newly discovered mightiness of Super Powerful Bella (which grew real tedious, real quick).USA Today (which I believe was put under Jasper’s mood-enhancing spell) smugly stated on the blurb at the back : “Move over, Harry Potter”.No, Potter….stay right there.

107,29301171,08/05/2008,2.0,"I’ve been calling the Twilight series a teen Harlequin, but after reading Breaking Dawn I don’t actually think that entirely covers it. It’s more of a Harlequin-Soap Opera hybrid, combining the euphemistic, soft-focus of romance novels with the pacing and gasp-inducing twists-of-narrative that keep televised serial narratives going (and going and going) for decades at a time. Breaking Dawn prefers the latter ethos—doling out equal measures of lovey dovey tranquility and dead-end plot threats in a substantive effort to apparently just keep the page count up. This book could have ended about four times before it finally got around to it, and could have ended definitively, at that. It could have grappled with more ‘realistic’ (in the scope of a vampire novel, people) complications, even. I mean, Bella does finally become a vampire (gasp!), so you’d think that any combination of the following problems could have occurred:1. Bella develops an insatiable bloodlust for human snacks, violently eradicating her former family, friends, and small, innocent children. (This had, of course, been floated as an almost unavoidable consequence for three books, and I for one, was really looking forward to it.)2. Bella’s parental units must deal with the untimely ‘death’ of their daughter, or at least think she’s disappeared into oblivion. Sadness is inexplicably felt by all.3. Bella can’t adjust to her new life. Has horrible regrets. Realizes that this Edward fellow has absolutely no personality whatsoever. Is irritated by his constant paternalizing and mooning. Eats Edward in epic battle. Is sad. 4. Bella cannot suppress her new super strength and sexiness. Abandons Edward in search of more sex-positive, lusty partners. Edward weeps silently. (Is sad.)5. Edward realizes that he’s made a horrible mistake. Bella is awful and now he’s stuck with her. For-Ev-Er. Eats her in epic battle. Is sad. But only until he finds a new teenage object-of-desire. But none of these issues—or even more prosaic complications—ever come up. Why? Because none of these issues would fit with the Soap Opera model. Meyers wants her narrative to ebb and flow, to be immediately dramatic (her characters gasp, and turn white, and go cold, and drop things in shock with relative frequency) and then be immediately resolved. Because treating your narrative/character psyches in any other fashion would be, well, really hard. And we don’t want that do we, Steph?I will say, though, that—yay!—Bella does finally get some. Actually, lucky girl gets to lose her virginity twice—once as a human and once as a vamp-ire—and has sublime experiences both times. (Or so she says—Meyers fades to ocean and fades to morning instead of expending the effort coming up with a nice symbolic word for Edward’s sparkling manhood.) The pre- and post-cursors to these scenes are almost worth reading for hilarity’s sake, though. Turns out, Kinkmaster Edward is one rowdy dude in the sack. And notably, a pillow-biter, when in the throws of passion. Oh, and yes—Bella gets knocked up. Dramatizes all of my worst fears about childbearing in a supernatural, blood-drenched fashion. Her half-human/half-vampire spawn actually does start consuming her from the inside, comes to term in two weeks, and supposedly will have to chew its way out of her womb. In a birthing scene that makes Alien look like a fuzz-fest, Bella chokes on blood, has her spine broken in delivery, is C-sectioned without morphine (with a fingernail), and her husband has to rip open the baby’s placenta with his teeth. All is forgiven when Bella holds her child for the first time. The miracle of life. Horrifying. It’s all pretty smooth sailing from there. Bella becomes graceful and talented and wields amazing mind-powers. Vampire wars are averted. Love triangles are dissolved and Bella’s super-baby girl is immediately destined to be loved forever and ever by another obsessive man. The cycle repeats, threatens further development. Methinks that Meyers will churn out a sequel series but soon. Oh, the horror. ",5,-0.9794,0.155,0.725,0.121,0.5349198506807202,NEGATIVE,0.9986

The best character awards in this book go to Edward obviously and Renesmee. Edward needs no explanation. he’s perfect in all of the books and is perfect in every way shape and form. Renesmee didn’t do much because she was just born but she is so cool so there is that. I was really expecting there to be more action in this book than there actually was but even so i’m not disappointed. the dialogue was so intriguing it was like both sides just mentally fighting with each other. I feel like this book was written better than some of the others because of how well thought out it was. i was definitely not expecting alice to come back with another half human half vampire person. speaking of alice IT MADE ME SO SAD WHEN SHE UP AND LEFT I DID NOT LIKE SHE HAD TO LEAVE.✋ When bella was finally a vampire and she found out jacob imprinted on renesmee and jacob was all like YoU sAiD wE wErE sUpPoSeD tO bE fAmIly SoMe HoW😑 i just wanted to 🤜🐺 that was literally the worst way you could have put it but instead you said it in the weird creepy pedophile way.

109,489033954,12/29/2012,2.0,"I would say I liked the first third of this book, but I still didn't enjoy it anymore than my first reading in high school. The book opens up pretty quickly into wedding preparations for Bella's nuptials to her frozen bag of peas, Edward. It's always exciting to see how authors interpret the something borrowed, something blue into pop culture weddings. It was cool to have all the characters we met along the way pop up as wedding guests like the Denali clan, Bella's high school friends she dumped for Edward, and the werewolves, yuck. I like the Lykae in Immortals After Dark and the Weres in Bon Temps, but the werewolves in Twilight are just so painfully juvenile that I could never form an attachment. They just pale in comparison to sheer virility of these adult paranormals.I liked the honeymoon at Isle Esme but from all the paranormal romance I have read I don't know why they chose to keep Bella human. Edward is a supernatural virgin and you can't expect him to exert control over a fragile blade of grass like Bella with a personality to match. I understand the pregnancy was the whole plot of the book but I wasn't that invested. I usually lose interest when babies are introduced in books because I don't have baby fever and I would rather focus on the couple. It was interesting to see the baby accelerate so quickly but the book went downhill once Renesmee was born. No babies for me, vampire hybrid or otherwise!I really hated reading from Jacob's perspective as Bella neared the end of her pregnancy/ human life. He was very jarring and incredibly rude. I skimmed those pages like the last time I read it. He's not my favorite character to read and I just find him really annoying. He's pushy and I really hated his imprint on Renesmee. It borders on pedophilia and made me uncomfortable. The other paranormal romances I've read had age barriers in place until they were 18. The transition from brother to eventual mate is just nasty. It kind of ruins his relationship with Bella because he was just attracted to her eggs instead of her all this time they've known each other. Yuck. Nessie and Jacob are gonna be a no from me, dog.The big vampire battle in the end was just as anticlimactic as I remember. It was all theoretical and there was no payoff. I loved the changes they made in the movie to provide action and shock value. It was neat to see vampires from all around the world with various powers come together but they were too jumbling to remember. From the movie standpoint, it was lovely to see some of my cinematic crushes like Rami Malek, Lee Pace, and Joe Anderson all lend a hand to the Volturi standoff. All in all, it wasn't that impressive. I still stand by that the Twilight franchise is comforting garbage. It won't win any Pulitzer but I mostly just keep it around for nostalgia. I've got The Chemist on my shelf and a preorder of Midnight Sun coming in the fall. I'll try to pick up The Host the next time it is safe to thrift at Goodwill. I prefer the movies to the books and my Twilight Trash TM will be forever stamped on my forehead.

110,179831252,06/26/2011,2.0,"Dear Jacob Black,Hi. How are you doing? Me? Not so good. You see, I have a bone to pick with you (tacky pun intended).Okay, first of all, why on God’s green Earth did you ever fall for Bella? I mean, really. Even the most fanatic of Twi-fans can’t understand what you see in her. You are so much better than Bella Swan-Cullen (insert gagging noises here). No, don’t get down on yourself, you are! Look at you; you’re a hulking stack of gorgeousness both on paper and on-screen. You’re also really sweet and funny and strong and... swoon... Did I tell you that my husband is Indian—mind you, he’s not the same kind of Indian as you, but yeah, I appreciate that look (wink, wink, Jakey boy).Back to my point... I don’t think I ever would have finished the entire Saga if it hadn’t been for you. You are just the kind of guy I would love to be friends with. You made Twilight so, so interesting. And that scene at the end of Eclipse when you told Edward that Bella loves you too? I almost died. I mean, that was one of the best scenes in modern fiction. Seriously, Jacob, it was, and that was because of you!It’s cool how you were always there for Bella, no matter what the consequences—not that she deserved your unwavering loyalty. It is also cool how you not only ride motorcycles, but you also fix them. You’re a man’s man and a ladies’ man, Jacob Black.But do you wanna know what’s not cool? It’s so not cool how you fell in love with baby Renesme. So. Not. Cool!I understand that there was some kind of cosmic imprinting thing going on, but yuck! I mean, she’s a baby, and she’s not even interesting anyway. I personally think your saga would have ended much better if there had never ever been a Renesme. She shouldn’t’ve existed not only from the freak of nature standpoint (cus let’s face it, you’re a freak of nature too, and I like you a whole lot), but from a literary standpoint. I don’t feel like she contributed to the plot at all. It was kind of a mess. But what do you know about that? Did I just rock your world by revealing that your whole existence takes place within the pages of a book? I am so sorry. I didn’t mean to reveal this secret. Darn it! I have to be more careful.But now that you do know and hopefully you’ve recovered from the shock a bit, I have to say this: the imprinting business with Renesme, that’s not really the universe playing games with you. It’s Stephenie Meyer. Oh, in case you didn’t know, Stephenie Meyer is the name of your God. She created you.Anyway, I believe she had you imprint on Renesme for two reasons:  1. She didn’t want you to be alone after Bella rejected you but also decided to keep you hanging around on a tight leash (another bad pun, sorry) – but this bit shows that your God does love you – yay!2. She was sick of people saying that 100ish-year-old Edward diggin’ on 18-year-old Bella was disgusting. She wanted them to be like Romeo and Juliet, so innocent, so fated. So what does she do? She takes the heat off of them by giving you an even more disgusting love affair. Gee, thanks, Steph. I personally think you should be with Leah Clearwater. Maybe if the two of you both gauge out your eyes all Oedipus Rex-style, that horrific imprint will go away, and you can just be together.I also think there’s a chance you could find happiness with Shapri Teak—she lives inside of my book, Farsighted. I’d be more than happy to introduce you...So...In summary, while Ms. Meyer clearly loved you, she loved Edward more. Just like Bella. Ha, burn!I come from a place of kindness. Eternally yours,EmlynPS Edward sucks! Team Jacob!PPS Do you know a guy named Sirius Black? If so, are you related to him?

111,34843990,10/08/2008,3.0,"This book is just as addictive as the first three. I couldn't stop reading, and stayed up MUCH later than my work schedule permits just so that I could finish the story and know what happens. Honestly, I sometimes am really annoyed when books suck me in like these did. And, we all know that these aren't great literature. Yeah, they might be around in 50 years, with all the teenage mothers handing it down to their daughters to drool over (and that's scary, isn't it?), but these are not classics. But all the same, they hooked me and I didn't even know it until the third book was under my belt. I knew that Bella was going to get pregnant all along. (Don't think that I have some magical knowledge of things that haven't yet happened or that I'm trying to sound like I called some twist that nobody could have called. I'm saying that this little plot point was spoiled for me thanks to the Never-Ending GR quiz. I don't hold it any grudges though. It's not the quiz's fault that users make up spoilerish questions.) Anyway, I knew it was coming, somewhere in the story, I just didn't know when it would be. Or HOW it would be. But I'm getting ahead of myself here. Bella gets married, with no Volturi interruptions, and no Jake storming down the aisle and demanding for her to not make the mistake of her life... I was waiting for that, and so it shocked me even more that it didn't happen than it would have if it did. Oh, I must say that I was concerned about Edward's reaction when he heard that Bella was pregnant. He scared me a little. His abrupt assumption that it must not be something that she wants (even though she had done her best to assure him that having no children would not be an issue that she would have trouble overcoming) concerned me. But I'm a woman, and I know how easy it is to see something that you want once it's in front of you and unavoidable rather than some hypothetical maybe theory wavering all fuzzy in the distant future. Just a bit more about the pregnancy. It was NOT believable that it should be such a shock to the Cullens that the half-vampire baby would want blood. Really, I had to roll my eyes at that one. Doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that one out. Anyway, moving on. After Bella's change, she felt like a different person to me. Of course I know that this is because she really IS kind of a different person, but it's strange to see someone so insecure and shy and awkward all of a sudden become sure of herself and confident. She was still Bella, still thinking of everyone else first, still trying to make sure that if anyone should suffer, it should be her and her alone, but it's strange to think of her as the strong, confident type. I wanted to see more of Jasper and Emmett in this book, and I was disappointed that they did not have bigger roles. I also wanted to see the Volturi get their asses handed to them, but that was not to be. The ending was actually kinda lame. ",5,-0.8793,0.113,0.796,0.091,0.5194444444444445,POSITIVE,0.994
112,29363298,08/05/2008,1.0,"I do not believe that Breaking Dawn deserves even one star. The word disappointment does not even begin to describe how I felt as I read. I thought that Twilight and New Moon were amazing, and although I saw problems with Eclipse, I still enjoyed it. Stephenie Meyer tells an amazing story in the first three books. Twilight, New Moon and Eclipse exhibit the rare ability of a writer to keep the reader turning the pages--literally not being able to put the book down! She was able to do what so many other authors aspire to do, but can not. I am 32, yet I felt a connection with 17 year old Bella in Twilight. I was able to relive that ""first love"" experience through Bella's experience. As so many other of my friends and family members, I could not get enough of the Twilight series. With Breaking Dawn, not only was I not compelled to turn the page, but I had to put it down. I had to stop because I was so frustrated. My disillusionment with the book began the morning after Bella and Edward's first night together as husband and wife. Edward was so angry the morning after, and I understood the why, but not how he handled his anger. I also imagined my 9th grade students reading that, and how upsetting that would be for so many of them. I mean, breaking headboards and biting pillows? Really? This is for young adults? And Bella begging for sex? PLEASE. I am seriously nauseous as I remember her waking up from her dream and BEGGING. The inconsistencies with the characters when compared to the other books drove me insane. Bella drinking blood? Really? Is this the same girl who almost fainted at the sight of blood in the first book? And don't even get me started on the delivery of RENESEMEE (or that ridiculous name for that matter!)I have many more gripes with Breaking Dawn, but my biggest is Jacob and Renesemee imprinting. I can't talk about that without crying (literally). I found it beyond disturbing. Sure, Jacob is immature, but I couldn't help but to love him! I've always been one to root for the ""underdog,"" and I adored Jacob. I was hoping that, if he wasn't going to be with Bella, he would end up with Leah, or imprint on some other nice girl (and am I the only person who believes that Meyer lead us to believe that something was going to happen between Jacob and Leah?). I just wanted Jacob to be happy. I was NOT prepared for him to say something about how many times he had pictured Bella nude, and in the next moment imprint on her newborn child! Meyer lost me there, and I honestly don't think that I could ever forgive that.  ",5,0.8718,0.103,0.778,0.118,0.5443775995246584,NEGATIVE,0.992
113,23690251,06/04/2008,2.0,"**Spoiler Alert!**I'm disappointed. Even though I didn't pay as much for this book because I was smart and waited two days before waltzing into Wal-mart to get it. Stephenie Meyer had great potential with this storyline - it got worse in Book 3 and totally tanked in Book 4. The characters were shallow and got everything they ever wanted, all conflicts were resolved in a happy-sappy ending (Poor little Renesmee has 7 years to grow into maturity so that she can live FOREVER with that terrible, horrible, no good, very bad name but it's okay because now she and Jacob can be 2-gether 4-ever), and it all happened in 700+ pages. This book sounded like the imaginings of a shy, awkward, adolescent girl. What if I was beautiful? And immortal? And had a perfect, handsome, unbelievably strong and god-like man who worshiped the ground I walked on? What if I could buy designer clothes and look hot ALL THE TIME? What if.... and so on and so on. I felt like I was reading a tired, worn-out romance novel. Honestly, publishers, we'd be willing to wait a little longer for a book if you would just do your part and make it worth our while! Call me old-fashioned, but I think books like this can be a little ill-advised for teenage girls. As I was clicking around on reviews to make sure I wasn't a total dweeb for disliking this book, I saw so many sappy reviews with ""I just LOVE Edward!"" and ""I was SO UPSET when this happened because it made Edward sad!"" I don't like Edward. He's an unrealistic character. He is TOO PERFECT! The love story in these books could have been spectacular - and it was in the beginning (which is why we were all so excited about book 4), but SM cheapened it by throwing in innuendos and more-detailed-than-needed descriptions. I'm pretty sure I gagged when I read the word ""little nudger."" In fact, I gagged multiple times because I had to go back and make sure that I had read the word correctly. Stephenie - why did you do this to your characters!? Why!? You could have done so many great things, but you chose to get rid of their conflicts and make their lives all happily-ever-after! We wanted conflict! We wanted to see Bella get a backbone! We wanted action and a really good showdown with the Volturi! We wanted a succinct, interesting account that didn't contradict ideas that you set forth in the first three books. Sigh. ",5,0.9978,0.09,0.674,0.236,0.6604395604395605,NEGATIVE,1.0
114,29031938,08/01/2008,4.0,"I'm actually happy to see that on goodreads the overall review is higher than on Amazon. I read through some of the reviews there and was a little taken aback at how many people seemed to think this most recent book was an aberration from the previous books and that the message is bad, etc., etc. The accusations about how anti-feminist the message is irks me; the whole point is for Bella (any woman) to have the opportunity/courage/tenacity to achieve whatever she wants to achieve. Despite great opposition from her father, her mother, her society, even at times her vampire beau/fiance, Bella overcomes the adversity and through personal sacrifice becomes the person (being) she wants to be. Just because she gets married and then has a baby (in that order--very bad message indeed) at that point in her life does not make her less of a modern feminist woman. Keeping in mind this story is FANTASTICAL, is it so terribly difficult to imagine she will at some point attend school, especially with such a precocious daughter who is not going to need her constant attention for the next 25 years, let alone throughout eternity, if school truly is necessary to round out a woman into a feminist?I also cannot completely understand why so many negative reviews mentioned how ""nothing"" happens at the end. Um...so it would have been much better to have an all-out war with death, blood, destruction, irrevocable conflict, loss, instead of the lengths everyone goes to ensure a peaceful, almost bloodless resolution of the conflict?? Especially considering everything going on in the world right now, I applaud Ms. Meyer (through Carlisle and Edward and the others) for maintaining Peace as the objective and doing everything in all their powers to do so without loss of life. If that is not a message worth propagating, I don't know what is.Certainly there were moments when Edward seemed nothing short of a wet dishrag, and Bella was rather wrapped up in the whole life-threatening pregnancy thing more than I was enthralled to read, but I think the conclusions Ms. Meyer wrote made sense (including the Jacob/Nessie thing) and were not entirely shocking or surprising, seeing now the foreshadowing throughout the previous three books. It was a lovely fairy tale and I look forward to reading the story from Edward's perspective.",5,0.2612,0.085,0.843,0.072,0.4595804988662132,POSITIVE,0.821
115,1661488845,06/07/2016,1.0,"I still don't know what to say about this series. Still a huge disappointment. Yet, people were telling me that I needed to read the whole series and it will ""change my life for the better."" However, this book left a lasting, horrific impression on me. I really can't be reading these ""vampire fiction"" books. They seem to just anger me. However, I am truly thankful that the series is over (I hope). Personally, I feel that Meyer should not be an author. Her books are really bad... But, here's my review:I can't even find a place to start. Shall I begin with Bella? I suppose... Bella is an AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL character. Just saying, Meyer really found a way to irritate the HECK out of me. She is so selfish, and that was really shown in this book. Not that Bella was very good to start, but as the series progressed, she went completely off the rails. She acted like a snob when Edward gave her the car. I don't like Edward either, but it was a nice gesture. Bella could be more appreciative. She whined about everything involving the wedding. Poor Bella, you get to marry the man of your dreams. I am so upset for you! Plus, she seems to treat Jacob like her puppet. He is a teenage guy, so cut him some slack and stop playing with his emotions and manipulating him. Plus, with the unborn baby, Bella must have what she wants. Name, etc. But of course, Bella gets what she wants. What a surprise. To be honest, I wonder if Meyer had the intention of making Bella REALLY annoying. I feel bad for Edward. I never liked him in any of the books and I still don't like him. But, I feel REALLY bad how Bella is treating him. That troll that Bella is...The thing that I would really like to bring up is the birth of the baby. I am pretty horrified. Bella vomiting, the constant snapping of bones, popping of blood vessels. This really made the book enjoyable. Can you sense the sarcasm? Then there was all of the biting going on that was also quite disturbing. I am pretty much HORRIFIED from reading this book and I can't believe I wasted my time reading this series.

116,89400258,02/12/2010,2.0,"The more time passes since I've read Breaking Dawn, the more I think it was a total disaster. I absolutely LOVED the Twilight series up to book 3. I was obsessed with the first book (I think I read it ten times) but then came Breaking Dawn and ruined it all for me.It felt like Stephenie Meyer wanted to please all the readers by granting Bella everything. While reading, I got more and more upset, cause the story just kept getting more and more ridiculous. I mean, Bella dies and becomes a vampire and there's absolutely no price for her to pay? She still gets a kid, even though the concept of how this worked is beyond me (Edward's dead, right? But his little sperm buddies are still alive or what?!? And how did they even do it? He has no heart to make the blood circulate and pump it into certain, um, body parts so how does he get a hard on? Does he always have one?).Then she's not facing any problems at all when she's turned into a vampire, she's super controlled right from the start and because of that she can still see her family. Oh, and Jacob doesn't need to be depressed either, because he can just move on to her daughter, which is just plain gross. And how did Stephenie come up with such a ridiculous name?? Renesmee Carlie! Gah! And don't even get me started on the birth scene! That was disgusting!And what's with the different POVs all of the sudden? I hate when authors are doing that. I mean, we were in Bella's head from book 1 to 3 and now we are also in Jacob's?

Because no sex or vampirism until he's made an honest woman of her, right? I don't have a problem with abstinence as a lifestyle choice, but the reasoning behind all this is so vapid that it makes me want to punch people.Once again, nothing happens. Bella marries Edward. Edward impregnates Bella. The mutant baby grows really fast and gnaws her way out of Bella after a few weeks with the help of Edward's gnawing. Edward turns Bella into a sparkly not-vampire just before she dies. Bella is a super-not-vampire! OMGWTF!! She has self-control so she won't go all bloodlusty on hapless humans like her parents or her mutant baby. And now Bella has superpowers, yay! O noes! The Volturi are coming to kill my baby! And enslave those of us with magical powers! O noes! Then we gather the vejjo-vampires and other allies, talk about our cool magical powers, and have a show-down with the Volturi, but we don't even have to fight because pretty psychic Alice brings OTHER mutants in!
