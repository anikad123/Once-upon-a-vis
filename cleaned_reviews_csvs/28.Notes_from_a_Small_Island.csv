0,1646422733,05/23/2016,5.0,"Newsflash: I have a new entry into my Top Ten Authors (past and present) that I would like to invite to a night out at the pub for a session of heavy drinking and tall tales.  Bill Bryson, with his sly humour and irreverent atitude towards tourism, is a strong contender for the top position right after my first experience of travelling in his company through the twisted back lanes of historical hamlets of his cherished island. Being both a personal journal and a travel guide, his Notes have been voted as the book that best represent Britain to the world. I believe the praise is well deserved.The secret of Bill Bryson success is easy to discern from the pages of this journal: He fell in love with the island from the first moment he landed in Dover in 1973, and his enthusiasm is as fresh and as catching two decades later as he prepares for a farewell trip before returning to America. Everything that lay before me was new and mysterious and exciting in a way you can't imagine. England was full of words I'd never heard before - streaky bacon, short back and sides, Belisha bacon, serviettes, high tea, ice-cream cornet. [...] I spent a long day wandering aimlessly and happily along residential streets and shopping streets, eavesdropping on conversations at bus-stops and street corners, looking with interest in the windows of greengrocers and butchers and fishmongers, reading fly-posters and planning applications, quietly absorbing.  Sometimes it takes a long trip away from home or the perspective of a stranger to make you realize the beauty of the land and of the people around you, and Bill Bryson is for me the best kind of guide possible. He shares my love for walking, an impulsive nature that can change routes on the spur of a moment, and equal interest in the highbrow amusements of historical monuments or art galleries and the popular amusement parks and drinking pubs, for the statistical trivia and for the scandalous bit of gossip about the local worthies. There is something awfully exhilarating about riding on the top of a double-decker. You can see into upstair windows and peer down on the tops of people's heads at bus-stops (and when they come up the stairs a moment later you can look at them with a knowing look that says: 'I've just seen the top of your head') and there's the frisson of excitement that comes with careering round a corner or roundabout on the brink of catastrophe. You get an entirely fresh perspective on the world. Time and time again the words that describe the places, the people, the cuisine and the culture of Britain turn into a song of joy at the chance to witness the marvels of his adopted country. Not even the constant bad weather (roughly about two thirds of his out of season journey by my count) can keep his buoyant mood down for more than one evening. Inevitably, the next stop on the railway line or the next hill to be climbed will bring back the cheerful hiker who likes to remind the reader to count his blessings and be happy to be alive, to be healthy and to live in a peaceful period of history that makes lonely travelling an attractive proposition. Beyond the headland, the path climbed steeply to Ballard Down, a taxing slog for an old puffed-out flubba-wubba like me, but worth it for the view, which was sensational - like being on top of the world. For seven weeks in 1994, Bill Bryson will try to rediscover Britain from the southern Downs to the last desolate northern moors, travelling alone on foot or by public transport, a decision that I will let him explain with his usual mix of militancy and self-deprecating humour: Motorized vehicles are ugly and dirty and they bring out the worst in people. They clutter every kerbside, turn ancient market squares into disorderly jumbles of metal, spawn petrol stations, second-hand car lots, Kwik-Fit centres and other dispiriting blights. They are horrible and awful and I wanted nothing to do with them on this trip. And besides, my wife wouldn't let me have the car. With great enthusiasm comes also great indignation at the carelessness and disrespect for the heritage of Britain, as witnessesd in the ugliness of modern cement office blocks, proliferation of cars and highways, loss of diversity and globalization, mass tourism and the trivialization of history. In a way, Notes from a Small Island is also a snapshot of a world in danger of being swallowed up and zombified into a characterless, generic shopping mall. It gets me a little wild sometimes. You have in this country the most comely, the most parklike, the most flawlessly composed countryside the world has ever known, a product of centuries of tireless, instinctive improvement, and you are half a generation from destroying most of it for ever. and, What made Weston feel familiar was, of course, that it was just like everywhere else. It had Boots and Marks&Spencer and Dixons and W. H. Smith and all the rest of it. I realized with a kind of dull ache that there wasn't a single thing here that I hadn't seen a million times already. and, ... it was wonderful to be in a great ecclesiastical structure so little disturbed by shuffling troops of tourists. When you consider the hordes that flock to Salisbury, York, Canterbury, Bath and so many other great churches of England, Lincoln's relative obscurity is something of a small miracle. Speaking of shopping malls, did you ever go shopping with you better half? If so, you will know what the author is talking about: Shopping is not, in my view, something that men and women should do together since all men want to do is buy something noisy like a drill and get it home so they can play with it, whereas women aren't happy until they've seen more or less everything in town and felt at least 1500 different textures. I have a small suspicion that Mr. Bryson had more on his mind than the perils of shopping with his wife when he decided to travel alone through the island. How else can one explain the detailed descriptions of going every night to the pub and sampling the best the Island has to offer in terms of draughts and dark ales and strong spirits? After all, a serious tourist guide must study and include details about the nightlife attractions of the places he visits . Case in point: on his very first day in Britain in 1973, our young author decided to go watch an R-rated movie called ""Suburban Wife Swap"" in order to improve his language skills and his knowledge of local customs. Which is another reason to trust his judgement on worthy travel spots :-)  Now the second rule of excessive drinking (the first, of course, is don't take a sudden shine to a woman larger than Hoss Cartwright) is never to drink in a place on a steep slope. I thought about mentioning some of the places described in the Notes, and what makes them memorable, but there are too many tempting propositions and Bill Bryson does a much better job than me in selling their charms to the readership. I confess I have never visited England, and if anybody asks me what is my favorite holiday destination I will still answer without hesitation : Paris! Even after 15+ visits, it is still my first choice for a visit. But Bill Bryson's small island is making a compelling case for a revision of my priorities. If I were hard pressed to choose only one of the hundreds of interesting places mentioned in the guide, I think I would settle for Liverpool. It might not be obvious why, at first or second glance, what Liverpool offers more than the Lake District or the Cotswolds, but I grew up with the tales of Jules Verne and Joseph Conrad, and more recently Douglass Reeman and Patrick O'Brian, and I always dreamed that one day I will embark for a voyage around the world's blue lanes: Once there was infinite romance in the sea, and the Merseyside Maritime Museum captures every bit of it. [...] J. B. Priestley called them the greatest constructions of the modern world, our equivalent of cathedrals, and he was absolutely right. I was appalled to think that never in my life would I have an opportunity to stride down a gangplank in a panama hat and a white suit and go looking for a bar with a revolving ceiling fan. How crushingly unfair life can sometimes be. The rest of my review is a series of footnotes and little details that reinforce the good impression and the fun I had on my travels with this incredible guide. Do you know what the most important quality of a tourist is? Curiosity: Why do they call it a grapefruit? Why do the British call them jumpers? Why do they call them milk floats? They don't float at all. Why do we foot a bill rather than, say, head it? Why do we say that our nose is running? (Mine slides). Who ate the first oyster and how on earth did anyone ever figure out that ambergris would make an excellent fixative for perfumes? Do you know how to prepare for your trip? Read as much as you can about the places you are going to see (and write about): I spent a little time watching the scenery, then pulled out my copy of Kingdom by the Sea to see if Paul Theroux had said anything about the vicinity that I might steal or modify to my own purposes. what sort of equipment you need for your trip? The fun begins well in advance of the actual departure: I can spend hours looking at rucksacks, kneesocks, compasses and survival rations, then go to another shop and look at precisely the same things all over again.  (I wonder what his wife thought about men and their shopping habits now?)Are you worried the locals and the other tourists will laugh at you? It's better to be ready for anything than wet and cold, so relax, and enjoy the view: I remember when I first came to Britain wandering into a bookstore and being surprised to find a whole section dedicated to 'Walking Guides'. This struck me as faintly bizarre and comical - where I came from people did not as a rule require written instructions to achieve locomotion - but then gradually I learned that there are, in fact, two kinds of walking in Britain, namely the everyday kind that gets you to the pub and, all being well, back home again, and the more earnest type that involves stout boots, Ordnance Survey maps in plastic pouches, rucksacks with sandwiches and flasks of tea, and, in its terminal phase, the wearing of khaki shorts in inappropriate weather. Is it worth your time and effort? And then, just as I was about to lie down and call for a stretcher, we crested a final rise and found ourselves abruptly, magically, on top of the earth, on a platform in the sky, amid an ocean of swelling summits. I had never seen anything half so beautiful before. 'Fuck me,' I said in a moment of special eloquence and realized I was hooked. Why would you go to a place on the map that everybody seems to run away from?(view spoiler)[ ... you might learn some dirty war songs: This fucking town's a fucking cussNo fucking trams, no fucking bus,Nobody cares for fucking usIn fucking HalkirkNo fucking sport, no fucking games.No fucking fun. The fucking damesWon't even give their fucking namesIn fucking Halkirk.  (hide spoiler)]When is the journey ended? when you have seen everything the world has to show you. In other words, never: ... and returned to the station feeling simultaneously impressed and desolate at just how much there was to see in this little country and what folly it had been to suppose that I might see anything more than a fraction of it in seven flying weeks. The good news is that Bill Bryson has already written a sequel   The Road to Little Dribbling   and that I have already ordered two more of his other books - the one on hiking through the Appallachians, and the one on popular science. I must thank all my friends here on Goodreads who recommended this author to me.

1,61784244,07/01/2009,3.0,"After 20 years in England, Bill Bryson decided to tour Britain in 1995 by public transport over ~6 weeks and write a book about it.HUMOURThere are snippets of humour and insight: “a young man with more on his mind than in it”; “carpet with the sort of pattern you get when you rub your eyes too hard”; “They were having a festival of litter... citizens had taken time off from their busy schedules to add crisp packets, empty cigarette boxes and carrier bags to the otherwise bland and neglected landscape”. However the last, of Liverpool reminds me of Wodehouse's snappier “Whit Monday, which to so many means merely one more opportunity of strewin Beauty Spots with paper bags” in A Day With the Swattesmore.There's an amusing anecdote of him asking for directions having forgotten he was wearing pants on his head. But as the book progresses, they become fewer as the amount of repetitious moaning increases. For a self-confessed Anglophile, he often seems to dislike the place, though the weather gets off surprisingly lightly, especially given that he made the trip in late autumn.BRYSON HERUMPHINGThe lack of trains in remote areas is a particular bugbear, but what I don't understand is his outraged surprise - he'd lived in and travelled around the country for 20 years! He argues that they shouldn’t have to be profitable because traffic lights, drains and parks don’t. And at a practical level, he often changes his mind about where he's going once he's on the station platform or even on the train itself (i.e. after he should have bought a ticket), yet he never mentions encountering any problems with ticket collectors etc. Modern architecture and urban planning are his other pet hates. He bemoans the homogeneity of high streets full of chains (rather than family shops), yet is annoyed at the lack of 24 hour opening and gives Marks and Spencer so many favourable mentions, I wondered if they sponsored him in some way.ME HERUMPHINGReaders are treated to endless descriptions of hotels and stations, but without enough comment about actual people (with a few notable exceptions: Mrs Smegma, a lunatic in Weston, and an ancient train buff), which makes it increasingly dull. Mind you, the way he chose his wife is described in very detached terms, so maybe he’s just not really a people person. On the other hand, he occasionally throws in gratuitous expletives, which I don't find offensive, but they don’t fit the general style of the book.Bryson claims an oddity of Manchester is that it has no motif. It's not a city I know well, but it has had The Manchester Bee for more than a century. However, the worst offence is the lack of index or map – both of which should be essential in any travel book (an index for any non fiction book). Overseas readers might also appreciate a glossary, as it's clearly written for an audience who, if not English, are at least familiar with the country.THE GOOD BITSBut there are plus sides, and Bryson is at his best when he goes off at a tangent and riffs on some unexpected topic. He explains why the British would have coped well under Communism (good at queuing, tolerant of dictatorships (cf Mrs Thatcher) and boring food). He throws in potted history about the founder of Sainsbury and his mansion (but doesn’t bother to find out why it was left to rot) and the fact that the bicycle pedal was invented in Scotland. He points out that the US has no equivalent of “taking the piss” and that while US soaps are about glamorous people who can’t act, British ones are the opposite. Rather than extolling the innovation of the tube map (which isn't in the book), he suggest tricks to play on tourists e.g. by getting the tube from Bank to Mansion House (1 change, 6 stops) to end up 200 yards from where they started. Best of all, he delights in words: the odd and romantic place names, the differences in usage between the US and Britain and the florid language of menus. He ponders replying in kind and requesting “a lustre of water freshly drawn from the house tap and presented au nature in a cylinder of glass”!CURATEOverall, it’s like the famous curate’s egg: “parts of it are excellent”. I think there's a good book struggling to get out, but it needed a decent editor to make that happen.",80,0.9263,0.093,0.806,0.102,0.4731216931216931,NEGATIVE,0.9995
2,2819957537,05/21/2019,4.0,"I first read this book back in the late 90s, 20 years ago and thoroughly enjoyed. This is my first re-read, and it was enjoyable, as good as the first read ? Hmm, probably not (which was a little disappointing), but still fun. I shall write more thoughts anon but shall leave you with Bill’s thought “ Hae ya nae hook ma dooky ? “Ok, so in the last couple of days I have been thinking about why this was a tad disappointing, and I think it was because it was 20 years old, and it was really of its time. It was about Britain 20 years after he had arrived in the UK, but it was also 20 something years old, and that really showed. As someone who lived through the 90s, and even the 70s I loved the book originally and laughed my fao, at an American championing and challenging us Brits.Now though this feels a little dated, we have moved on, and some of our cities have been regenerated and some have probably degenerated as well.I have this vague memory that he has written fairly recently a new critique of Britain and I will be interested in reading it as soon as.All of that said, this is outrageously funny, as Bill is very perceptive about us Brits, and most of us like nothing more than people pointing out our quirks in an admiring manner. He lived here for 20 years and so was almost an honorary Brit and this comes across in the book, his love of living here, and how much he was going to miss moving back to the States.",74,0.9905,0.04,0.8,0.161,0.4363203463203463,NEGATIVE,0.7818
3,3256878564,04/11/2020,4.0,"Notes from a Small Island by Bill Bryson is an ode to Britain, lovingly written by an American who lived there for almost twenty years and wanted to revisit it before departing for his home country. I have especially enjoyed the audio version. If you do not like curmudgeons, this will not be the book for you. Bryson, with tongue firmly planted in cheek, will take you on a tour of all things great and not so great. His grumpiness, sometimes endearing, sometimes not, will accompany the reader while visiting the UK, from countryside to big cities, to small villages. His love of this country is visible in both his criticism and his praise of it. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and it made me wish I was there.

4,1088071232,11/21/2019,4.0,"Taking a trip with Bill Bryson is always a crap shoot. Am I getting the funny self-effacing Bill? Am I getting bilious Bill? Am I getting drunken Bill on a murderous rampage? Okay, that last one, sadly, was never published.Here, Bill wants to get a last look at Great Britain before he moves back to the good ol’ U.S. of A., so he schleps around that island nation taking in the sights. As someone who has been to those environs or thereabouts a few times, Mr. Bryson gets it right and then some. Plus, I laughed out loud on a number of occasions. Good on you, Bill!This is my fifth Bryson book and his approach/mood is generally all over the place, depending upon the subject of his writing or the type of medication he was currently taking, I suppose.The crotchety scale looks kind of like this with the books listed from most cantankerous to least tetchy:1.

5,2825008635,05/24/2019,5.0,"Britain viewed through an American's eyes.Although both the British and American speak English, their words and cultures are hilariously different.A quick look at the local magazines at a boarding houseI'd intended to turn in early, but on the way to my room I noticed a door marked RESIDENTS' LOUNGE and put my head in. It was a large parlour, with easy chairs and a settee, all with starched antimacassars; a bookcase with a modest selection of jigsaw puzzles and paperback books; an occasional table with some well-thumbed magazines; and a large colour television. I switched on the TV and looked through the magazines while I waited for it to warm up. They were all women's magazines, but they weren't like the magazines my mother and-sister read. The articles in my mother's and sister's magazines were always about sex and personal gratification. They had titles like 'Eat Your Way to Multiple Orgasms', 'Office Sex - How to Get It', 'Tahiti: The Hot New Place for Sex' and 'Those Shrinking Rainforests - Are They Any Good for Sex?' The British magazines addressed more modest aspirations. They had titles like 'Knit Your Own Twinset', 'Money-Saving Button Offer', 'Make This Super Knitted Soap-Saver' and 'Summer's Here - It's Time for Mayonnaise!'Fun at the Hazlitt hotelHazlitt's is a nice hotel, but the thing I like about it is that it doesn't act like a hotel. It's been there for years, and the staff are friendly - always a novelty in a big city hotel - but they do manage to give the slight impression that they haven't been doing this for very long. Tell them that you have a reservation and want to check in and they get a kind of panicked look and begin a perplexed search through drawers for registration cards and room keys. It's really quite charming. And the delightful girls who clean the rooms - which, let me say, are always spotless and exceedingly comfortable - seldom seem to have what might be called a total command of English, so that when you ask them for a bar of soap or something, you see that they are watching your mouth closely and then, pretty generally, they return after a bit with a hopeful look bearing a pot plant or a commode or something that is manifestly not soap. It's a wonderful place. I wouldn't go anywhere else.Communism - British styleIt has long seemed to me unfortunate - and I'm taking the global view here - that such an important experiment in social organization was left to the Russians when the British would have managed it so much better. All those things that are necessary to the successful implementation of a rigorous socialist system are, after all, second nature to the British. For a start, they like going without. They are great at pulling together, particularly in the face of adversity, for a perceived common good. They will queue patiently for indefinite periods and accept with rare fortitude the imposition of rationing, bland diets and sudden inconvenient shortages of staple goods, as anyone who has ever looked for bread at a supermarket on a Saturday afternoon will know. They are comfortable with faceless bureaucracies and, as Mrs Thatcher proved, tolerant of dictatorships. They will wait uncomplainingly for years for an operation or the delivery of a household appliance. They have a natural gift for making excellent jokes about authority without seriously challenging it, and they derive universal satisfaction from the sight of the rich and powerful brought low. Most of those above the age of twenty-five already dress like East Germans. The conditions, in a word, are right.Please understand I'm not saying that Britain would have been a happier, better place under Communism, merely that the British would have done it properly. They would have taken it in their stride, with good heart, and without excessive cheating.Appreciating life British styleI used to be puzzled by the curious British attitude to pleasure, and that tireless, dogged optimism of theirs that allowed them to attach an upbeat turn of phrase to the direst inadequacies - 'well, it makes a change', 'mustn't grumble', 'you could do worse', 'it's not much, but it's cheap and cheerful', 'it was quite nice really' -but gradually I came round to their way of thinking and my life has never been happier. I remember finding myself sitting in damp clothes in a cold cafe on a dreary seaside promenade and being presented with a cup of tea and a teacake and going 'Ooh, lovely!', and I knew then that the process had started. Before long I came to regard all kinds of activities - asking for more toast in a hotel, buying wool-rich socks at Marks & Spencer, getting two pairs of trousers when I only really needed one - as something daring, very nearly illicit. My life became immensely richer.The unbelievable building of StonehengeI was particularly interested in the Stonehenge Gallery because I was going there on the morrow, so I read all the instructive labels attentively. I know this goes without saying, but it really was the most incredible accomplishment. It took 500 men just to pull each sarsen, plus 100 more to dash around positioning the rollers. Just think about it for a minute. Can you imagine trying to talk 600 people into helping you drag a fifty-ton stone eighteen miles across the countryside, muscle it into an upright position and then saying, 'Right, lads! Another twenty like that, plus some lintels and maybe a couple of dozen nice bluestones from Wales, and we can party'!' Whoever was the person behind Stonehenge was one dickens of a motivator, I'll tell you that.Bill discovers the actual floor of an ancient Roman houseI knew that I was in the villa. In one of the relict chambers, the floor had been carefully covered with plastic fertilizer bags weighted with stones at each corner. This is what I had come to see. I had been told about this by a friend but had never really believed it. For underneath those bags was a virtually complete Roman mosaic, about five feet square, exquisitely patterned and flawlessly preserved but for a tiny bit of fracturing around the edges.I cannot tell you how odd it felt to be standing in a forgotten wood in what had once been, in an inconceivably distant past, the home of a Roman family, looking at a mosaic laid at least 1,600 years ago when this was an open sunny space, long before this ancient wood grew up around it. It is one thing to see these things in museums, quite another to come upon one on the spot where it was laid. I have no idea why it hadn't been gathered up and taken away to some place like the Corinium Museum. I presume it is a terrible oversight, but I am so grateful to have had the chance to see it. I sat for a long time on a stone, riveted with wonder and admiration. I don't know what seized me more, the thought that people in togas had once stood on this floor chatting in vernacular Latin or that it was still here, flawless and undisturbed, amid this tangle of growth.What RubbishI took a train to Liverpool. They were having a featival of litter when I arrived. Citizens had taken time off from their busy activities to add crisp packets, empty cigarette boxes and carrier-bags to the otherwise bland and neglected landscape. They fluttered gaily in the bushes and brought colour and texture to pavements and gutters. And to think that elsewhere we stick these objects in rubbish bags.Animals need more protection than childrenDid you know that the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children was formed sixty years after the founding of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and as an offshoot of it? Did you know that in 1994 Britain voted for a European Union directive requiring statutory rest periods for transported animals, but against statutory rest periods for factory workers?How's the weather?It's a weather forecast from the 'Western Daily Mail and it says, in toto: 'Outlook: Dry and warm, but cooler with some rain.'There you have in a single pithy sentence the English weather captured to perfection: dry but rainy with some warm/cool spells. The Western Daily Mail could run that forecast every day - for all I know, it may - and scarcely ever be wrong.Art for Art's sakein one of the salons I noticed that there was a man, accompanied by a boy of about thirteen, who didn't need the labels at all.They were from what I suspect the Queen Mother would call the lower orders. Everything about them murmured poorness and material want - poor diet, poor income, poor dentistry, poor prospects, even poor laundering - but the man was describing the pictures with a fondness and familiarity that were truly heartwarming and the boy was raptly attentive to his every word. 'Now this is a later Goya, you see,' he was saying in a quiet voice. 'Just look at how controlled those brush strokes are - a complete change in style from his earlier work. D'ye remember how I told you that Goya didn't paint a single great picture till he was nearly fifty? Well, this is a great picture.' He wasn't showing off, you understand; he was sharing.I have often been struck in Britain by this sort of thing - by how mysteriously well educated people from unprivileged backgrounds so often are, how the most unlikely people will tell you plant names in Latin or turn out to be experts on the politics of ancient Thrace or irrigation techniques at Glanum.In a pub in Glasgow unable to speak the local dialect...The barman appeared, looking unhappy and wiping his hands on a tea towel.'Fuckin muckle fucket in the fuckin muckle,' he said to the two men, and then to me in a weary voice: 'Ah hae the noo.' I couldn't tell if it was a question or a statement.'A pint of Tennent's, please,' I said hopefully.He made an impatient noise, as if I were avoiding his question. 'Hae ya nae hook ma dooky?'I'm sorry?''Ah hae the noo,' said the first customer, who apparently saw himself as my interpreter.I stood for some moments with my mouth open, trying to imagine what they were saying to me, wondering what mad impulse had bidden me to enter a pub in a district like this, and said in a quiet voice: 'Just a pint of Tennent's, I think.'The barman sighed heavily and got me a pint. A minute later, I realized that what they were saying to me was that this was the worst pub in the world in which to order lager since all I would get was a glass of warm soap suds, dispensed from a gasping, reluctant tap, and that really I should flee with my life while I could. I drank two sips of this interesting concoction, and, making as if I were going to the Gents', slipped out a side door.Britain - an amazing countryWhat other country, after all, could possibly have come up with place names like Tooting Bee and Farleigh Wallop, or a game like cricket that goes on for three days and never seems to start? Who else would think it not the least odd to make their judges wear little mops on their heads, compel the Lord Chancellor to sit on something called the Woolsack, or take pride in a naval hero whose dying wish was to be kissed by a fellow named Hardy? ('Please, Hardy, full on the lips, with just a bit of tongue.') What other nation in the world could possibly have given us William Shakespeare, pork pies, Christopher Wren, Windsor Great Park, the Open University, Gardeners' Question Time and the chocolate digestive biscuit? None, of course.How easily we lose sight of all this. What an enigma Britain will seem to historians when they look back on the second half of the twentieth century. Here is a country that fought and won a noble war, dismantled a mighty empire in a generally benign and enlightened way, created a far-seeing welfare state - in short, did nearly everything right - and then spent the rest of the century looking on itself as a chronic failure. The fact is that this is still the best place in the world for most things - to post a letter, go for a walk, watch television, buy a book, venture out for a drink, go toa museum, use the bank, get lost, seek help, or stand on a hillside and take in a view.We may never go to Britain, but we can thank Bill Bryson for bringing Britain to us.Enjoy!",52,0.9989,0.084,0.788,0.128,0.514261658308688,POSITIVE,0.9996
6,3732428,07/29/2007,4.0,"It took me forever to read this because I was constantly picking it up and putting it down, not because I wasn’t enjoying it, but because it’s one of those books where it works to read it in this way, and I read so many other books during the times I took breaks from reading this book.Sometimes I just don’t like Bill Bryson as a man. There’s a smattering of things he writes that are cruel, crass, and otherwise makes him unappealing to me, and he sure drinks a lot of beer, but the nasty material is a tiny minority of the book’s content. He’s basically a likeable and interesting guy who is an explorer, much of it done via walking, and he has a refreshing sense of what constitutes adventure.He’s a skilled writer. He’s very, very funny; I laughed out loud and chuckled many times.I’ve always wanted to go to Britain so for me this was a bit of armchair traveling. Unfortunately, much of this book made me wish I’d visited the place (and most other places) at least a few decades ago. Bryson makes clear the homogenization that’s taken place at various British locales, and this book was written 15 years ago so who knows what he’d say now. I’d still love to go but I’d skip some of his destinations. He also writes much about the history of his destinations and I found most of the information fascinating.One thing that tickled my funny bone is that when he was in one small English town, he saw the old “This is Cinerama” movie, a movie I remember from my childhood, and brought me right back to the United States of America. I hadn’t realized the movie was already old the first time that I saw it, but I do remember loving that film and other Cinerama movies.There’s a glossary of English (vs. American English) words in the back of the book. Given that I’m a bit of an Anglophile, I already knew the definition of most of the words, but having it in the book was a fun touch.",50,0.9927,0.04,0.81,0.15,0.4252998236331567,POSITIVE,0.7319

Subjecting an employee to shaming sarcasm because you're having a crappy day isn't my idea of humor. It's not even my idea of being a basically acceptable human being.I read a bit further on to see if the author ever expressed any sort of awareness that the scene above describes an overbearing bully belittling a employee in the middle of a rush for executing their job as required by their employer. He didn't. There were some good laughs in the book, but nothing that could make up for my disgust at this. In particular given that it was preceded by another bit where he totally blows up on some poor hotel clerk, this seems likely to be pattern behavior. I gave the hotel scene a pass since he owned some chagrin for that one. But this, this is completely unacceptable behavior. If you aren't bothered by this, you are part of the problem.I DNFed shortly after this scene even thought there were only 37 pages left.

I hadn't realised, until I read the book, that Bryson had lived in the UK for many years. It gives him a rather unusual perspective on the place and makes for interesting reading.It also helps that I enjoyed his sense of humour. It's a little morbid at times; he makes a joke about the Zeebrugge ferry disaster at one point that a lot of people may find to be in bad taste; but I'm not easily offended, so it didn't worry me too much. I laughed quite a bit while reading this book and, as I read about half of it out walking myself, that lifted my spirits and helped me stay the course. (I'm desperately trying to shift some of this excess weight I've been carrying around for years, so I'm trying to do a 90 minute walk every day. It seems to be working; I've lost about 28 lbs so far...)On occasion, he portrays himself in a less than sympathetic light, being downright rude to various customer service folks across the country who were only doing their jobs as the company they're working for asks them to do it. Here's a tip for folks out there: if you have received bad service from a customer service employee, please feel free to complain. If you have a problem with a company policy that the employee has absolutely no control over, ask to speak to their manager; don't be a complete fucking arsehole to the poor bloke/lass who is only doing their job. If you do that, it's YOU being a shitty human being, not them.To Bryson's credit, he usually realises he's being a dickhead on these occasions; usually when it's too late to do anything about it.Anyway, it was a real pleasure to see the UK through Bryson's eyes for a while. It almost had me feeling patriotic for a second... but then I slapped myself in the face and started thinking like an intelligent human being again.

Actually, it is hard not to like his dictionaries, travelogues, or explorations of: the Universe, the home, Shakespeare, etc. He is, essentially, our Falstaff. He stumbles from bus to train, from pub to pub, from city to city exploring Britain one last time before he and his family leaves. Bryson's insights and digressions are always amusing. I believe this book sits in time (and in form almost) next to one of his other great travel books A Walk in the Woods. They share a similar Brysonesque tone and lightness. Again, I would bring back my Falstaff comparisons. Bryson uses humor, self-mockery, and a slight sneer to convey information and truth. One of the ""truths"" that Bryson pushed heavily in this constructed memoir (there has to be a better term for writing about an event that is designed to be written about). He is pissed that the Brits don't take better care of their heritage. They spend little money on their parks, seem to let their beautiful architecture get torn down, and seem apathetic to hedge rows. Bryson would argue that the Brits are almost blind to their own beauty. They are too close. Sometimes it takes a stranger (and a fool) to whisper the truths you KNOW are true, but are just to close to see.",36,0.7635,0.062,0.848,0.09,0.5066919191919192,POSITIVE,0.9879
11,452648675,11/10/2012,2.0,"Mr Bryson has an entertaining line of patter, a nice, wry humour and he works very very hard to endear himself with the reader. Look, I'm a regular guy from Iowa who sometimes gets really narked at owners of undisciplined dogs and thinks hedgerows are A Good Thing and cars aren't. But that doesn't quite compensate for the fact that this is basically a catalogue of towns, hotel rooms and meals in restaurants - an amusing catalogue, but a catalogue all the same. Where BB gets right up my nose is with his quaint idea that Britain should have remained in a seventies time warp, preserving all those quirky little British things like red pillar boxes and old-fashioned red telephone boxes merely, it would seem, because they appeal to regular guys from Iowa. Has it escaped his notice that even British people now have mobiles, and no longer need to use smelly phone booths and, oh wonder, now write e-mails or post updates on social networks, which renders pillar boxes surplus to requirements, no matter what colour they are? And I got heartily sick of his rants about modern town architecture, he sounds like Prince Charles with a less annoying accent. I'm sure that Britain is not always a model of sensitive town planning, but what does he expect? Filling station forecourts with mock-Georgian carriage gates? Boots the chemist with all its products in brass-handled mahogany drawers? Ask those Thurso ladies he met taking the six am train for the four hour trip to Inverness to buy knickers and get their hair done.

13,473229072,12/08/2012,2.0,"Since I moved to England this fall, I haven’t done too much travelling around the country. I’ve been to London a couple of times, neither of which I did much that could be described as a touristy; the same applies to my trips to Cambridge. I went up to Scotland during the half-term and had a good time there, but I’m looking forward to visiting a few other places around the UK. Until I do, travel writing like Notes from a Small Island will have to serve to whet my appetite.Bill Bryson is a brilliant writer. 
A Short History of Nearly Everything
 is one of my favourite books. Bryson has a deft touch to description that makes him an apt writer of non-fiction; he manages to make something that could be dull and make it come alive through anecdotes and humour. I knew he had done some travel writing, a genre that’s been on my mind while teaching AS Literature. So I picked this up during a trip to Waterstones and settled into what I hoped would be a very unique perspective on Great Britain. Bryson didn’t grow up here but has lived here for decades. Preparing to move back to the United States with his family, he tours the island one last time. The result is certainly unique, but not in the way I wanted.The prologue chapter is every bit as brilliant and entertaining as I had hoped it would be. Bryson relates his first days in England, in 1973. He describes butting heads with the formidable Mrs Smegma, the proprietor of a boarding house and perpetually disapproving of whatever Bryson does. He reminisces about his youthful awe over the differences between Britain and the United States, and it’s a delightful prelude to the beginning of his tour of the country twenty years later.I’d be exaggerating if I said that the book goes drastically downhill after that strong start, but it would not be wild hyperbole. Notes from a Small Island suffers from two chief defects. Firstly, as I noted above, Bryson is a brilliant writer—and, unfortunately, he knows this. Secondly, it turns out that his reactions to various places in Britain are very similar and often involve a lot of unfavourable comparisons to how things used to be.Bryson’s wit often seems to get the better of him here. Of course, there are plenty of moments when that humour works well and livens up what might otherwise be a mundane description of his travels through Brighton or Yorkshire. Unfortunately, it often seems like his humour is there to distract us from the fact that he isn’t actually talking about the particular place in question. There are segues into sexist ruminations on the differences between men and women (and he himself labels at least one such episode as sexist, as if that somehow excuses it). At least twice during visits to Chinese restaurants he makes comments that are, if not racist, then culturally insensitive. Such moments were enough to make me feel uncomfortable, particularly because I had so wanted to find this book funny. And throughout the book, he manages to portray himself as a short-tempered, intolerant, rude person who would probably make a terrible travelling companion. To be fair, he seems to be aware of these shortcomings and occasionally even apologizes for them. But he also seems to labour under the delusion that this makes him even more interesting rather than less.The second defect concerns how Bryson describes the way the places he visits have changed over the decades. In almost every case, he manages to point out how development and change has ruined a city. He laments the arrival of indoor shopping malls and the slow destruction of Britain’s hedges. He complains about the motorways, about the rail system, about the distribution and diversity of restaurants. It wouldn’t be so bad if each successive chapter weren’t just more of the same. It’s as if he set out not just to tour Britain but to find as much fault with it as possible in order to justify his relocation to the United States. For someone who claims to love the country—and he does make several keen observations in favour of Britain and its people—he spends a lot of time sounding like someone who doesn’t want kids on his lawn.It’s not all bad news. There is charm to be had in Notes from a Small Island. Bryson shares in common with certain humour writers that talent to transform what are assuredly mild incidents in their lives into wild, slightly absurd anecdotes that nevertheless have the ring of truth. These otherwise excellent moments are spoiled by how repetitive Bryson manages to make the book feel. After the first few chapters, the novelty has worn off. As I approached the end of the book, I was paying very little attention to what he was actually saying, because it felt like more of the same.Notes from a Small Island doesn’t replicate the sense of wonder and enjoyment I derived from A Short History of Nearly Everything. It doesn’t quite give me a sense of the country in which I’m living either. Instead, it’s more like a catalogue of Bill Bryson’s unfavourable experiences across Great Britain. It’s occasionally funny and occasionally charming but not the encomium of travelling through Britain that I want or need.

In this journey he travels through England, Wales and Scotland (but the last two probably make for only one-quarter of the book).Even though, aside from a few days in London some years back, I have not ventured in the British Isles I thoroughly enjoyed and felt a part of this trip with Bill Bryson. It was like I was sitting or walking beside him on the trains, buses and hikes he took. But I would certainly not be the one to go to pubs. I am sure the expense would be prohibitive and I much prefer having a glass of wine or beer on my deck outside (weather dependent) or inside on the living room couch whilst reading a book and quietly listening to music.This book does contain many British expressions (car park, crisps, chips (what we over here call French fries) and references to British personalities unknown to me.I much enjoyed the erudite writing style and the informative presentation of his travels.Bill Bryson is never afraid to criticize or mock anyone. He loves, praises and admires the British landscape and the country villages, but these too, do not escape his biting wit.Page 129 (my book)As I left the gardens and walked back towards the palace, I took the opportunity to study the miniature steam train. It ran over a decidedly modest length of track across one corner of the grounds.

I went to London only but I do like a number of things about Great Britain (Brexit not being one of them - surprise!). So of course I had to read our favourite grumpypants' take on it. Especially since it was yet another funny buddy-read with Jeff (read his review here).The interesting thing I wasn't aware of is that Bryson isn't a Brit living in exile the US, but an American who married a British woman and lived in England for a while! Considering his grumpiness, neurotic behaviour and stinginess, he can pass as a native amongst Her Majesty's subjects and no problem.Well, actually, there are a few problems. Such as Bryson despising the whole notion of royalty and kings and queens still existing nowadays. He's also unappreciative of Oxford and the University of Cambridge. To say nothing of - brace yourselves - his refusal to drink tea!Then again, he does seem to like at least some old architecture like the original Natural History Museum in London. And then there is (or was until this trip) his romantic notion of train journeys.Long story short, this is Bryson returning to England after not having lived there for quite a while and this time, even more than upon arriving for the very first time, he notices all the little and not-so-little things that make the British quintessentially British.We're talking about history by architecture as much as famous politicians and artists. We're talking about the humble way of dealing with all that history (such a stark contrast to the pomp the afore-mentioned royals represent and drag through the streets). We're talking about, shall we say, interesting food. We're talking about unique names for said food as well as places and more. We're talking about 900-year-old hedges. We're OF COURSE talking about queuing (and other manifestations of good behavior).When talking about this author, the word travelogue comes up a lot. I usually don't like those but prefer to experience a place for myself. But Bryson has this way of writing more than just an account of his trip through a country. It's usually a 360°-view with references to current political issues, history, social topics, nature and more. All packed in his signature grumpy and somehow funny way of complaining about everything.Nevertheless, after reading about his ambitious hiking trip as well as his fearfulless tackling of the most venomous continent on Earth, I have to say that this was not his best - though it still made me chuckle quite a few times.",26,0.9904,0.05,0.817,0.133,0.46171875,NEGATIVE,0.8956

Yet I can't believe he was only 45 when he wrote this because he sounded like a frumpy, dorky, grumpy, curmudgeon throughout the whole travelogue. And not one of those cute curmudgeons, actually...kind of mean.I just read a ton of reviews and ""Liked"" a few. The GR reviewers did a better job than I will here in trying to describe it. The first 10 pages were excellent and I was so excited! Maybe because it's one of the only times PEOPLE are described or involved in this story (because it was a brief prologue of him arriving in England in 1973 at age 22). After that prologue, it's this weird trip. He keeps acting like a hiker, yet is in terrible shape, but not really self-effacing about it. It's more like ""why is this damn ground so uneven!"" He complains constantly about modern buildings, and other things he doesn't like, but then says, I like this place. You do? I've been on tour groups before with people like this - awful. I read someone say that it was like he didn't really want to take this trip, but his publisher said he needed to do it. Of course, at the end is the famous ""McDonald's scene"".

However, it becomes tedious to read, no matter how many funny stories it is sandwiched between.Bryson can be extremely witty (I know I have greatly enjoyed many of his other books) and has a knack for ferreting out extraordinary little factoids and anecdotes and fondly poking fun at the British identity.

Now very much the Anglo-American (having lived at times in the UK and now holding dual UK/US nationality) Bryson writes here very much as ‘a young American abroad’ – with all the cultural and language based misunderstandings that predictably ensue. Whilst all this could certainly have been trite, pedestrian and clichéd as well as probably unfunny and verging on the xenophobic, what Bryson does here though is very much far from that – the joke more often than not is on him and just as importantly, the jokes are more often than not very funny.What also comes across in addition to the humour, is the open mind and love (although admittedly occasionally hate) that Bryson has for travel and exploring other countries and cultures.Bryson’s more recent books are now no longer limited to the ‘travel’ genre and have been of varying quality; he still however produces some great reads every now and then (most recently see: ‘One Summer: America, 1927’) – but this was where it all started.

For these are the books I treasure, in the absolute certainty that whenever I feel bored, depressed, tired, lonely, miserable, or just over-whelmed by daily life I can pull them out and indulge in the healing power of the written word. And Bill Bryson's “Notes from a Small Island” must be recorded as the ultimate comfort re-read for an expat Brit; providing on every page diversions that are fascinating, enlightening, humourous, or just plain nostalgic. I must confess that in general I find Bryson's travel writing merely mildly entertaining, and inferior to his other non-fiction. Notes from a Small Island is the one, outstanding exception. Bryson finds his true metier and calling when he is explaining to the British what makes them British, and why he adores them.Bryson rants about things which deserve a rant such as preserving hedgerows, the petty annoyances of driving, the money spent on national parks, British attitudes about American English, and hideous modern architecture.He treasures the things which should be treasured: queuing, politeness, puddings, or three dozen English people having a picnic on a mountaintop in an ice storm.He's widely knowledgeable and well-researched in Roman history, utterly insane and reclusive members of the gentry, pit painters, cursed homes, Victorian industrialists, and the numbers of motorboats registered on Lake Windemere.He's a talented comedian, turning every little story from his past into a humourous gem.He's (mostly) aware enough of his own personal character flaws – grumpiness, irrational disklikes, shyness on public transport – as to be able to make fun of them.And best, he’s so full of wonder, curiosity, and joy. He's curious about placenames, linguistics (why did they call it a 'grapefruit'?), the potato marketing board, psychology, gender differences, and the timetabling abilities of the Blaenau Ffestiniog railway.From the underpants-clad-head at the start, to the Seattle-Carlisle railway at the end, I know I can open this book anywhere and find something entertaining, edifying, or enlightening.",18,0.9887,0.087,0.732,0.181,0.4829613095238096,POSITIVE,0.9989

At first the reading was amusing, and there are good passages that contain great cultural observations from an outsider's perspective, but Bryson is a biased, self-absorbed liberal, and his narrow-minded perspective often gets in the way of what could have potentially been a greater book. True, clever little observations about various iconic landmarks gave the prose a lighter feel, but they became merely the sprinkles upon a disappointingly dry and tasteless text.Bryson randomly skips over, or writes one boring paragraph about, certain towns he visits and doesn't happen to like. I was looking forward to learning all about the culture and quirks of different places in Britain and its people, but Bryson's rants ended up as an annoyingly preachy, mediocre diary. I was hoping for another The Mother Tongue: English and How It Got That Way, and was disappointed; but, determined to finish it, I did appreciate the parts where I actually learned something. I definitely will read more of Bryson's books, simply for his unique, if random, perspective.

27,200620240,08/20/2011,4.0,"Bill Bryson, originally from Iowa, had lived in England for the last twenty years. When he and his wife decided to move their family back to the States, he took a last trip around Britain. Except for a few days, he took only public transportation and hiked for seven weeks. Bryson traveled to Dover, London, the southern coast, then headed north through England, Wales, and Scotland, then back to his home in North Yorkshire.I especially enjoyed the beginning and the end of the book, but thought the middle bogged down a bit as he hit some unremarkable villages off-season in the rain. Although he carried rain gear, he never mentioned an umbrella. The poor guy was constantly getting caught in downpours walking unfamiliar streets in search of a hotel or a cafe. Bryson is one of those men that almost never asked townspeople or the hotel receptionist for directions or recommendations for a restaurant. Then he complained when he had to eat Indian or Chinese food again after wandering around for hours looking for a restaurant.Bryson's writing was humorous, poking a bit of fun at the British while also exhibiting very warm feelings for them. Like Prince Charles, he rants when beautiful old buildings are replaced with modern concrete cubes that don't blend in. The book was originally published in 1995 for a British audience, then published in the States a year later. He used lots of British expressions I hadn't heard before, but I just went with the flow instead of looking them up. Although this book wasn't quite as funny as A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail, it still had plenty of humor. Bryson also had moments when he enjoyed the simple things in life--a beautiful view, a warm cup of tea on a chilly day, and reuniting with his wife and four children in his beloved Yorkshire.",15,0.9828,0.041,0.836,0.122,0.4072045855379189,POSITIVE,0.9146

31,1351477418,08/01/2015,2.0,"So, about a month ago, I moved to England from the U.S., to London. (Recently enough that it still feels a little bit preposterous to say.) One of the things we had to do, in packing our suitcases, was select which books we'd carry with us for the next several weeks and which would travel the long way inside a shipping container. If my count is correct, we brought 16 books with us, and this was one of my picks.I like Bill Bryson and I figured this would be fun to read as a new resident of England, as a sort of joking but genuine guide to people I'd like to get to know, as well as to some places I'm eager to visit. As soon as I started reading, though, I found that I wished I had done it another way: I got the sense that I didn't much agree with him at all, and wish I had read this instead after accumulating some years of my own, when I'll be able to articulate why.This book is 20 years old (indeed, it's been so long, he is about to publish a sequel) and in many ways that makes it a really interesting historical perspective on modern England. Bryson settled in the U.K. in 1977, two years before Thatcher came to office, and he decided to leave (and wrote this book) in 1994, four years after she was ousted. The outlook from where he sat, in the mid-90's, was bad. So the book, then, is positively drenched in this pessimism, the hope lost that anything kind or fair or reasonable will ever be restored to the country, because the government is stone broke with no end in sight. In quite a lot of the places he visits, Bryson basically observes that everything is stupid now, and surely only going to get worse, before it ultimately disappears altogether. It's extremely sad. I'm curious whether the sequel will be interested in addressing the discrepancies between these expectations and the realities of British life in these past 20 years (a majority of which he's spent as a resident again). The country Bryson moved away from in 1995 isn't one I'd have been eager to try living in. But in 2015, on balance, I feel optimism.It isn't Bryson's dated facts that prevented me from enjoying the book, though. There are other things about its 20 years' age that really no longer flatter him. The negative, cranky character he casts of himself is incredibly unpleasant. He writes as an observer of absurdities, but really he is doing almost nothing but complaining about people and places and things until I could hardly stand it. I nearly tried to keep count of the rants that began ""Now here is something I've never understood,"" or ""I have simply never seen the appeal of,"" etc. I guess that these are funny to some readers, because they're sure written as if they're a hoot. He also both repeats and contradicts himself a lot, and I started to think he didn't really have principles about anything, but just liked to hear himself opine.But often, there's something so much darker and weird about it: he'll say the nice hotel receptionist has a brain the size of a bean, he'll call someone's wife stupid for no reason, and he'll spend a full page talking about the eating habits of overweight people as if they are cartoon zoo animals. (If you think I might be overreacting, read that, I mean it. Make sure you make it to ""their chins glistening with chocolate."" It's a disgusting way to describe people, satire or no.) And for goodness sake, for someone spending a solid 7 weeks as a full-time tourist in order to write this book, he sure has some kinda disdain for tourists, doing the exact same things he's doing -- it's just that they're being mindless buffoons about it, of course, and he's gonna get paid.I couldn't get past this mean-spirited attitude, however much self-satire was sometimes involved, and it impacted my enjoyment of the entire book. There's a dated quality to Bryson the narrator that just doesn't gel with a contemporary tone. I kept thinking about the ""typical 90's dad"" brand of humor, the Dave Barry and hapless sitcom sorts: the way he talks about his wife here as if all she cares about is shopping and the car, but calls her lovely all the way through so it's all fun. Giving the benefit of the doubt, I'm deciding that I only really dislike ""1995"" Bill Bryson, in particular. However, this is also the first of Bryson's travel books I've read, and humor and travel are genres that rely wholly on the author's personality. I'm a little warier than I was before.I'm not sorry I read this, and it did make me laugh, and I did make a nice list of places I hadn't heard of before that I'd like to visit myself: Virginia Waters, Corfe Castle, Snowshill Manor, Welbeck Abbey, Morecambe, Near Sawrey, Durham.

32,37580240,11/12/2008,5.0,"Before returning to his native United States after a sojourn of some twenty years in England, Bryson decided to take a trip around that ""small island."" The hysterical comments in this book are the result. The British loved it so much it was a best-seller for months, and they turned it into a TV series. The book even includes a glossary of English terms. For example, do you know the difference between a village and a hamlet? One is a small town where people live, the other a play by Shakespeare!Bryson is certainly not your average travel writer - as anyone who has read my reviews of his other books knows - and despite his often scathing wit, it's never done with malice, even when very critical of a subject. What astounds me is Bryson's vigor and willingness to put up with all sorts of cold and wet weather. He made his trek during the off-season, i.e., late October, not an especially delightful time of year in Britain. He did not take a car, relying solely on buses and British Rail, a decision that often forced him to make long, out-of-the-way walks of as far as twenty miles, either because schedules didn'tcoincide, or the irregular bus did not run during the off-season.He delightfully intermingles political commentary with travelogue. He visits Blackpool, for example, where there are long beaches - that officially don't exist. ""I am not making this up. In the late 1980s, when the European Community issued a directive about the standards of ocean-borne sewage, it turned out that nearly every British seaside town failed to come anywhere near even the minimum compliance levels. Most of the bigger resorts like Blackpool went right off the edge of the turdometer, or whatever they measure these things with. This presented an obvious problem to Mrs. Thatcher's government, which was loath to spend money on British beaches when there were perfectly good beaches in Mustique and Barbados, so it drew up an official decree -- this is so bizarre I can hardly stand it, but I swear it is true -- that Brighton, Blackpool, Scarborough, and many other leading resorts did not have, strictly speaking, beaches. Christ knows what it then termed these expanses of sand -- intermediate sewage buffers, I suppose -- but in any case it disposed of the problem without either solving it or costing the treasury a penny, which is of course the main thing, or in the case of the present government, the only thing.""Then there's British Rail. On his way to Manchester, ""we crept a mile or so out of the station, then sat for a long time for no evident reason. Eventually, a voice announced that because of faults further up the line this train would terminate in Stockport, which elicited a general groan. Finally, after about twenty minutes, the train falteringly started forward and limped across the green countryside. At each station the voice apologized for the delay and announced anew that the train would terminate in Stockport. When at last we reached Stockport, ninety minutes late, I expected everyone to get off, but no one moved, so neither did I. Only one passenger, a Japanese fellow, dutifully disembarked, then watched in dismay as the train proceeded on, without explanation and without him, to Manchester.""

33,1151690140,01/02/2015,5.0,"This was a stumble-upon reread from back in the day. After getting past the considerable start that broke me up with weird hilarity that only Bryson can manage to make me appreciate, I began to remember more about this book and my first read. It was my first Bryson, and once my flashbacks began I realized I had read this in paperback on the way to England, pretty close to the time thus was written. So there was nostalgia for the read, for the time (not always fond nostalgia) that now seems long ago—Bryson is bellyaching about Thatcher, it’s that old!—and for the memories of the few places from this book that I got to visit on that trip. Bryson spends this book in his own, planned, nostalgia, since he is about to leave England after spending maybe 20 years and his early adulthood there. He retraces his own earlier entrance to the British Isles, around to his then-home that he was just beginning to see in his own rear view mirror. His view of the changes in the various parts of his England is a great deal about how much it had all changed, and hadn’t. Since I reread this in my own rear view mirror, I realized how much I knew the island had changed and how much it has to have transformed in ways I don’t know. Reveries aside, this might have been a four star read if I experienced it for the first time now, not as a star-struck introduction to Bryson’s particular comic sensibilities and absent the timely relevance to my own travels. The humor is still there—side splitting at the start, tear-rolling near the end, and intermittently chuckle-worthy at nice intervals throughout. It hasn’t aged perfectly, sensibilities being different today. But I could read it again in a decade and still appreciate it. Bryson, as I remembered, can roam from a hilarious to tiresome curmudgeon, with spots of the intentionally un-charming 12 year old boy, to keen-eyed observer, intelligent and curious critic, and big-hearted human. He’s a complicated guy in a complex world who gives you a fun and smart ride through the quotidian, uncomfortable, and spectacular moments of being right there with him wherever he is.

Now I have read it and can wholeheartedly endorse this reputation: I loved it.In case there is anyone out there who is totally unfamiliar with the subject of this book, I shall explain. Bill Bryson is an American from Des Moines, Iowa, who had, at the time of writing, lived in the beautiful county of Yorkshire (in northern England) for many years with his English wife and children.Bill and his wife decided to move to the States for a few years to give their children a new experience and to see what the USA has to offer but before they left Bill traveled alone, apart from his trusty backpack, all around Britain, on a sort of farewell tour. This book is his travelogue and, as it turned out, a love letter to his adopted country.Bill is like a mature student backpacker; he travels mostly by public transport and stays in small, cheap hotels and guesthouses, just like ‘real’ people, often foregoing luxury, comfort and, sometimes, edible meals in his quest to investigate Britain as a whole and sort out his feelings for the nation he had adopted as his own.The result is a book filled with hilarious anecdotes about the British people and British life. Bill does not hold back in revealing many of his personal habits and traits that not only add to the humour but endear him to the reader – he is a man difficult to dislike; he is modest in his tastes, undemanding (how very un-American) and endowed with good taste in architecture, food and a sense of history.The barbs on his pen are mainly reserved for people who overcharge customers; town planners who have ruined some of our cities with hideous and inappropriate structures and adaptations to buildings not in keeping with their design; British Rail (always a good target) – though he is also fair and praises them too; and some restauranteurs. He also comments on how it is impossible to understand anything spoken by a Glaswegian (join the club![sorry, Glasgow]) and some hoteliers are also singled out for their appalling treatment of or contempt for their paying customers. Overall, however, Bill is kind and forgiving towards the errors and foibles of his fellow man.What I love about this book is not only the humour, which as it says on the back cover, will make you emit loud snorts and uncontrollable laughter on a regular basis, but also the beautiful language he uses. Despite delving into the vernacular on occasions, Bill uses lovely turns of phrase to describe the places he visits and the views and people he sees along the way.One reason this book is so popular, I believe, is that Bill highlights the wonderful things that Britain is, and has achieved, which is enough to make even the most modest of Britons proud of our country. We kind of always felt that we were an innately good people, but Bill spells this out and, as a ‘foreigner’, we are permitted to believe him.This is a wonderful book that I will re-read. It gets five stars all the way. If you have any interest in Britain: read it – you will want to come here and have a fair idea of what to expect.",11,0.9986,0.043,0.765,0.192,0.5593600339054884,POSITIVE,0.9997

You know, fairly wholesome and genial, maybe a touch of cornball, the sort of guy who might eventually parlay his silliness into a kids book. I think this impression had something to do with his author photo:





Not only does he look like he has lived in a cozy part of Britain and might enjoy ambling and training all over it as he does in this book, he looks exactly like the sort of man I'd want to be my grandpa.The real Bryson is much more cantankerous than either of my existing grandpas. This yields plenty of funnies in its own way. For example:""I took a train to Liverpool. They were having a festival of litter when I arrived. Citizens had taken time off from their busy activities to add ice cream wrappers, empty cigarette boxes, and plastic carrier bags to the otherwise bland and neglected landscape. They fluttered gaily in the bushes and brought color and texture to pavements and gutters. And to think that elsewhere we stick these objects in trashbags.""But what it also means is that when he gets annoyed -- by the rain, by less than pleasing hotel accommodations, by having to eat breakfast at McDonald's because the high-class Scottish hotel he knowingly booked ahead of time also has a costly restaurant (who'd have guessed?!) -- he is sometimes inexcusably mean or superior. I'm talking about the way he treats the McDonald's cashier who asks him if he wants to try an apple pie with his breakfast or the hard of hearing old man who gives him inadequate help getting to Port Sunlight, who Bryson tells to ""die soon"" as he walks away.Look, I don't mean to sound wizened at 24 or anything, but there was a time when I enjoyed mean humor and probably could have told someone who'd annoyed me to ""die soon"" for laughs without it weighing too much on my conscience. Shocker: in that time, I was also pretty unhappy myself. I don't look back fondly on being miserable and will never understand why other people are pleased with themselves for instances of acting like total jerks. If it weren't for those two moments, I would have given this book four stars. Bryson's got a keen eye for picking out and sharing unusual bits of history and culture, such as the reclusive Duke who built an interconnected tunnel system from his house and sealed himself up in his coach so that he could travel without having to talk to anyone, or the stuff that makes up headlines in provincial newspapers (""WOMAN, 81, DIES""), or how Yorkshire neighbors will walk right into his home, sending him running into the pantry in his underwear. He's an unequaled tour guide -- that is, if you keep him in an amiable mood.",10,0.9082,0.072,0.828,0.1,0.5644266917293232,POSITIVE,0.9844

How could I not love a travelogue written by a self-proclaimed Anglophile? A few sentences did make me chuckle, and I will say that Bryson is a pretty good writer. But overall, this book was a big disappointment. From the other reviews I've read on GR, it seems like I'm not the only one with these specific gripes:1. Constant whingeing: it seemed fitting to use that word for a book set in England. At least once per chapter, Bryson rants at length about how much England has gone downhill--specifically in terms of how modern architecture is ruining England. I'm all for historic preservation and certainly don't enjoy the concrete look either, but does it need to be mentioned in the same exact way on every other page of the book? His negativity really set the tone for the book.2. Lack of depth: each chapter of this book is exactly the same. Bryson arrives in a town, finds a hotel that is either extremely cheap and awful or overpriced and extravagant, walks around the town, whinges about the architecture, gets drunk alone in a pub, and then eats at an Indian or Chinese restaurant. He then takes a train to the next town and repeats everything. Apart from a few stereotypical comments about English people, there are almost no meaningful observations about life in England. Some of the history that he throws in was interesting, such as the parts on mining towns, but I found there wasn't enough of it. 3. Bryson himself: based on the very limited number of human interactions he mentions in his book, Bryson doesn't come across as a very likable person. He wrote at length about how disgusting it was to watch an obese family eat their dinner in a restaurant. He berated an innkeeper for locking the door of the inn at 9pm (which I understand would be frustrating, but the harshness of Bryson's comments to him were unwarranted). My least favorite of all is when he snapped at a McDonald's employee for asking if he wanted an apple turnover with his meal, yelling ""why would you ask me such a thing?"" and ""if I wanted an apple turnover, wouldn't I ask for one?"" - to which the poor employee explained that he was required to ask if people wanted an apple turnover. Doesn't everyone know that restaurant employees are told to ask things like this? And more importantly, who cares enough to berate some poor kid like that? It was strange that Bryson added all these rude interactions to the book, but I can only guess he thought people would find them funny. Maybe some did, but certainly not me.I hate giving a book a bad review, and I kept wishing I could push this up to three stars--but a few funny sentences can't save a repetitive, shallow book. Bryson mentions Paul Theroux's book about England several times, and I kept wishing I were reading that instead.

But this time his location is Great Britain and it is a farewell tour of the country he called his home for over 20 years.Not being British and having never been to any part of Britain I must admit I was at a total loss for many of the references he makes about the culture (pop to political) and the language. I constantly felt like a bit of an outsider listening in to some great inside jokes that flew right over my head.But the sections where he described human nature in general, or the portions about Scotland where I did have some personal frame of reference thanks to a Scottish roommate in college, I found to be very funny and entertaining. It is obvious this book was written about Britain for a British audience and because of it I had a nice descriptive tour of the geography, the people and, of course, the wet weather.I was a little surprised by the sudden brash insertions of vulgarity and showy tell-offs of people who happened to annoy him. I don't really recall that style from my reading of ""A Walk In The Woods"" but maybe I just don't remember it because I was laughing too hard. I swear myself all the time so it wasn't offensive personally, but it felt like it was thrown in there purposefully to fit in or something.I also tired of his constant criticism of the architectural horrors - even though I agree with his frustration and anger about it. Just hammered that point a little too often for my tastes. I get it - stupid architects destroyed pieces of history left and right for shopping plazas which is blasphemy. More about the human interest please, which he writes very well.Overall the book was an easy read that could be picked up and put down without problem so it would be great to read on a commute or in between other books. It was entertaining enough but I would recommend more for people not completely clueless like me about Britain - the humor would be appreciated much more.",10,0.9904,0.082,0.744,0.173,0.4700360750360749,NEGATIVE,0.9798

44,1358516256,08/08/2015,3.0,"Unfortunately for me, I’ve never been to England, nor have I even met a great many English people in person. Yet like so many Americans, for my whole life I have been quietly enamored of British culture. Monty Python, The Beatles, John Milton, “English Breakfast Tea” (which I imagine is not what the English call it), Mr. Bean, Indian Pale Ale, the custom of tea and digestive biscuits (which I came to love during my time in Kenya), pronouncing schedule with a “sh” at the beginning—all of these have convinced me that the British really have it together. So as a kind of substitute for actually going there—which I earnestly hope to one day—I happily picked up this book, in order to learn more about this distant beacon of sarcasm and silly walks which has so enriched my life. Putting aside Bryson’s wonderful writing for a moment, I must say that he makes for an odd travel guide, to say the least. For someone who seems constitutionally cheerful and genuinely happy, he can be astoundingly misanthropic. Bryson loves everything about humans except humans themselves. He can get lost in local history, spend hours gazing at splendid architecture, comb through maps with rapacious glee, wax poetic about museums and tourist attractions—and yet every time he comes into contact with an actual person, he is exasperated beyond words. Each interaction he relates in this book, whether he was talking to someone on a train or asking for directions, ends with him thinking or saying something rude and insulting. He even indulges in some rather violent fantasizing about people who only cause him a minor inconvenience. The man is not gregarious. The result of this tendency is that you “meet” very few Brits in this book. By way of compensation, Bryson gives you a marvelous picture of the English public transit system, if that’s what you’re looking for. It is indeed rather ironic that at one point he says something incredibly disparaging about train enthusiasts—considering it a sign of insanity to be interested in trains—but fills up so much of this book complaining about trains, as if that’s any more interesting. Bryson will also describe for you the nicest and the ugliest buildings in the major cities of Great Britain, as well as relate his adventures eating Chinese food and sleeping in hotels. In short, the focus often strays from his topic to banalities and needless bitching. Having recently read In a Sunburned Country (called Down Under in the UK), published 5 years after this, I can tell that this represents a more immature phase in his writing. At the very least, this book could have used more vigorous editing. Despite all these flaws and shortcomings, I still had a great time reading this travelogue. In the early chapters especially, Bryson’s infectious love of the English language is on full display, as he rattles off lists of made-up English locales. There is also much autobiographical information here that I found charming. He tells us of his first arrival in England, and how he met his wife; he tells us of his days as a newspaper editor and of Murdoch’s takeover. And as usual, Bryson is adept at finding quaint, odd, pleasing bits of local history. But most of all I just enjoy seeing the world through Bryson’s curious and curiously misanthropic eyes. He is a delicate man, very sensitive to his surroundings, so it’s always a pleasure watching him notice things, little things, that I wouldn’t normally observe. Considering all this, perhaps I should say that he’s not such a bad travel guide after all. ",20,0.9954,0.064,0.79,0.145,0.5182770745428972,NEGATIVE,0.9932
45,3164996874,01/28/2020,4.0,"I have to say, first of all, I've been a big fan of Bill Bryson for some time now. I enjoyed his ""A Walk in the Woods"" and ""A Short History of Nearly Everything""--and the story of his Iowa childhood, ""The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid."" I want to read his latest, ""The Road to Little Dribbling"" but I understand it's the sequel to this book published in 1995. So I had to read this first! Bryson writes about his farewell tour of Britain, in 1994 I think it was, 20 years after first coming to the UK. He writes with his usual wit-and I found myself laughing a number of times, causing my wife to ask what I was reading. He has some real insights into British society and underlying it all is a genuine affection for the British.  It was especially interesting for me as a fellow Midwesterner (from Illinois) who is about the same age and who also lived in Britain (2 years in the 70s). I can agree with him about a lot of things. There is no better city in the world than London, especially if you enjoy walking, as I do and Bryson does. I once wandered about the North of London and went onto Hampstead Heath, a completely wonderful place, feeling so far away from the city. Wonder if he ever made it there? I stayed there too long and had to find my way out in the dark... Like Bryson, I appreciate the dry wit of the British and their politeness and understatement.  It was very interesting to compare where we've been and NOT been--according to the book. He did a fantastic hike along the Dorset coast. I didn't go there but did go to the ""English Riviera"" at Torquay, in Devonshire. Memorable for me as it was not only my first time on the British seashore but the first time I went swimming in the Atlantic (the English Channel being an extension of it). One of my best walks was along Hadrian's Wall, which he may have had no interest in as he didn't seem to have much interest in pre-modern British history. He did go to Glasgow, a place I didn't go to as my guidebook said to give it a miss (this was in the 70s). But he says that the Burrell Collection in Glasgow is ""incomparable""-- and I had never even heard of it until I read this book. If I'm ever back in Scotland... What keeps me from giving the book 5 stars is that I cringed several times when he insulted people and behaved in a manner that could have gotten him a punch in the nose in America (or shot). Among the polite Brits, he could get away with it. Anyway, I now look forward to reading the sequel.",9,0.9961,0.024,0.834,0.142,0.4197916666666668,POSITIVE,0.9971
46,60230385,06/18/2009,4.0,"Bill Bryson knows that absurdity is present in everybody and can be found in almost every situation if you try to find it. He also knows absurdity is mostly lovable. And so Notes from a Small Island chronicles Bryson's tour of Britain from Dover to Glasgow, traveling generally north and almost always by public transport, not in search of the absurd but certainly quick to point it out. There's plenty to draw the reader's attention to, though what he sees as absurd he likes and is more than willing to accept. Bryson also knows a nation is its people. He writes about the English people with great warmth and affection while at the same time being aware of their eccentricities. He loves what he sees, too. He takes time to visit the sites individual towns and regions are noted for, whether it's Stonehenge or the Ashmolean in Oxford or Princes Street in Edinburgh. All along the way he has interesting things to say about almost everything Britain is famous or notorious for, including British weather, British food, the congeniality of British pubs, British Rail. In the end he's full of praise for a country responsible for cricket, pork pies, Christopher Wren, and the chocolate digestive biscuit. All those things and more Britain has given us, he writes, but they also had the farsightedness to create a comprehensive welfare state and to efficiently dismantle an empire. Nearing the end of his journey, alone again on a train gliding through the Midlands, he closes the book with a paean to a characteristic of Britain he feels is undervalued, the bucolic nature and astonishing beauty of the countryside. Bryson is absurdly in love with Britain. ",8,0.9959,0.019,0.787,0.193,0.4410493827160494,POSITIVE,0.9992

Bryson claims that he loves Britain and thinks it’s amazing, but all I heard was a bunch of whining and complaining about it. Every building that wasn’t the original “Georgian” style he deemed as an ugly renovation done by idiotic architects. It seemed every town he traveled to was a dump. He doesn’t really do much but travel around by bus or train (of which he also complains), and then book a room in a crappy hotel for the night after which he “ambles” to some pub to drink a few beers and eat some “adequate” food. I swear if I heard him use the word “amble” one more time I was going to puke. He hates cars so he walks everywhere he goes and then complains when he gets rained on. HELLO. You’re in Britain. It rains there all the time! Bring a damn umbrella! Or how about some rain boots! GASP! Every so often he’d interrupt his soaked “ambling” to mention the Marks and Spencer jackets people were wearing or yell at some random person for a minor infraction. The thing is, the only time he says anything good about Britain is when mentioning how it was 20 years ago. I kid you not, the most excited he ever got about anything was when talking about an IMAX movie he went to… about AMERICA.

He is funny sometimes but most of the time he is rude, mean, makes fun of other people, does things that I don't quite like.This was my second book and even this failed to give me much information. I picked this book up since England is on the top of my ""must-visit"" places from a long time. I have been imagining about this country ever since I picked my first Enid Blyton's book and after re-reading Harry Potter books umpteen times. I wanted to know what was ""good"" about this country and what were the places that I must visit, if I visit this country sometime in the future.But this book failed to give me any of this information. It was more of a memoir than a book on travel. He kept comparing England with how it was in 1970s and kept complaining how it had changed for the worse. It looked more like he was on a budget trip. He was not interested in paying for even a single entrance fee or take a tour of the palace if it costed even 2 pounds. I mean, you are writing a travelogue for God's sake. So you must visit all the good and famous places in England and let the reader know what is good about the place. But it looked like he felt at peace only in the cities which had a good pub and a cheap hotel. He hated almost every human being he met on the trip and all he did in most places was eat and drink beer.It appeared to me that he did not like most part of England. At least that is what I felt after reading the book. After finishing the book, I got a feeling that it is a pretty boring country where people hardly do anything other than eat and shop.

That is its glory, you see - that it manages at once to be intimate and small-scale and at the same time packed to bursting with incident and interest. I am constantly filled with admiration at this.With this delightful travelogue I've had a circumstantial stroll through much of Britain, albeit without any maps or pictorial evidence I'm still drawing a blank as to my own whereabouts. Bill Bryson does well in portraying Britain's splendors and regress as a resident and a traveler. As a reader, I too have settled for ""certain idiosyncratic notions that you quietly come to accept when you live for a long time in Britain."" From the prowess of giving unasked directions in all its exhaustive and indecipherable forms to apologizing so frequently within a sentence that one forgets the real inquiry, from quaint villages with their cozy cottages to insipid and alienated building structures, from mild weather in which one decides to embark upon a casual promenade around the hotel to getting caught in an icy storm cutting through the skin with rage on the way back to the same hotel - this book indeed embodies most, if not all, aspects of British life a visitor might get to experience. A blizzard, I explained, is when you can't get your front door open. Drifts are things that make you lose your car till spring. Cold weather is when you leave part of your flesh on doorknobs, mailbox handles and other metal objects.And with much unbound pleasure I can assuredly say that the claims made by this book don't stray from what I've imagined so vividly in regards to life in Britain for a wayfarer. Coupled with humor, satire and sharp wit Bill Bryson revels in the excessive natural beauty of Britain, but also doesn't shy away from citing the reasons as to why many cities have fallen from grace, why buildings and monuments are in a state of odd disrepair and meals are often quite different from what you expected. Mostly what differentiated the North from the South, however, was the exceptional sense of economic loss, of greatness passed, when you drove through places like Preston or Blackburn or stood on a hillsideIt's a charming read, one which I might refer to in the future if I ever find myself stepping on the little island, with plenty of time to spare and preferably in an idyllic countryside. I just hope the paperback version comes with a map and a few photographs so I don’t get lost as often as the author did. All I can say is that the Dales seized me like a helpless infatuation when I first saw them and will not let me go. Partly, I suppose, it is the exhilarating contrast between the high fells, with their endless views, and the relative lushness of the valley floors, with their clustered villages and green farms. To drive almost anywhere in the Dales is to make a constant transition between these two hypnotic zones. It is wonderful beyond words. And partly it is the snug air of self-containment that the enclosing hills give, a sense that the rest of the world is far away and unnecessary, which is something you come to appreciate very much when you live there.A selection of my favourite passages from the book'Idiosyncratic Notions' of the British People	• The fact is that the British have a totally private sense of distance. This is most visibly seen in the shared pretense that Britain is a lonely island in the middle of an empty green sea.	• All those things that are necessary to the successful implementation of a rigorous socialist system are, after all, second nature to the British. For a start, they like going without. They are great at pulling together, particularly in the face of adversity, for a perceived common good. They will queue patiently for indefinite periods and accept with rare fortitude the imposition of rationing, bland diets and sudden inconvenient shortages of staple goods,	• One of the charms of the British is that they have so little idea of their own virtues, and nowhere is this more true than with their happiness. You will laugh to hear me say it, but they are the happiest people on earth.	• For the benefit of foreign readers, I should explain that there is a certain ritual involved in this. Even though you have heard the conductor tell the person ahead of you that this is the Barnstaple train, you still have to say, 'Excuse me, is this the Barnstaple train?' When he acknowledges that the large linear object three feet to your right is indeed the Barnstaple train, you have to point to it and say, 'This one?' Then when you board the train you must additionally ask the carriage generally, 'Excuse me, is this the Barnstaple train?' to which most people will say that they think it is, except for one man with a lot of parcels who will get a panicked look and hurriedly gather up his things and get off.	• I took a train to Liverpool. They were having a festival of litter when I arrived. Citizens had taken time off from their busy activities to add crisp packets, empty cigarette boxes and carrier-bags to the otherwise bland and neglected landscape. They fluttered gaily in the bushes and brought colour and texture to pavements and gutters. And to think that elsewhere we stick these objects in rubbish bags.	• One of the primary reasons so much of the British landscape is so unutterably lovely and timeless is that most farmers, for whatever reason, take the trouble to keep it that way.	• Deference and a quiet consideration for others are such a fundamental part of British life, in fact, that few conversations could even start without them. Almost any encounter with a stranger begins with the words 'I'm terribly sorry but' followed by a request of some sort Bryson's Portrayal of the Small Island	• I do like the Underground. There's something surreal about plunging into the bowels of the earth to catch a train. It's a little world of its own down there, with its own strange winds and weather systems, its own eerie noises and oily smells.	• I have never bought into that quaint conceit about London being essentially a cluster of villages - where else have you seen villages with flyovers, gasometers, reeling derelicts and a view of the Post Office Tower?	• This business of corporate sponsorship is something that seems to have crept into British life generally in recent years without being much remarked upon.	• There are villages without number whose very names summon forth an image of lazy summer afternoons and butterflies darting in meadows: Winterbourne Abbas, Weston Lullingfields, Theddle-thorpe All Saints, Little Missenden. There are villages that seem to hide some ancient and possibly dark secret: Husbands Bosworth, Rime Intrinseca, Whiteladies Aston. There are villages that sound like toilet cleansers (Potto, Sanahole, Durno) and villages that sound like skin complaints (Scabcleuch, Whiterashes, Scurlage, Sockburn). In a brief trawl through any gazetteer you can find fertilizers (Hastigrow), shoe deodorizers (Powfoot), breath fresheners (Minto), dog food (Whelpo) and even a Scottish spot remover (Sootywells). You can find villages that have an attitude problem (Seething, Mockbeggar, Wrangle) and villages of strange phenomena (Meathop, Wigtwizzle, Blubberhouses). And there are villages almost without number that are just endearingly inane - Prittlewell, Little Rollright, Chew Magna, Titsey, Woodstock Slop, Lickey End, Stragglethorpe, Yonder Bognie, Nether Wallop and the unbeatable Thornton-le-Beans. (Bury me there!) You have only to cast a glance across a map or lose yourself in an index to see that you are in a place of infinite possibility.	• I couldn't say where I went exactly because Manchester's streets always seem curiously indistinguishable to me. I never felt as if I were getting nearer to or farther from anything in particular but just wandering around in a kind of urban limbo.	• It is remarkable to me how these matters have become so thoroughly inverted in the past twenty years. There used to be a kind of unspoken nobility about living in Britain. Just by existing, by going to work and paying your taxes, catching the occasional bus and being a generally decent if unexceptional soul, you felt as if you were contributing in some small way to the maintenance of a noble enterprise - a generally compassionate and well-meaning society with health care for all, decent public transport, intelligent television, universal social welfare and all the rest of it.	• And so I went to Edinburgh. Can there anywhere be a more beautiful and beguiling city to arrive at by train early on a crisp, dark Novembery evening? To emerge from the bustling, subterranean bowels of Waverley Station and find yourself in the very heart of such a glorious city is a happy experience indeed.Humor	• Much as I admire sand's miraculous ability to be transformed into useful objects like glass and concrete, I am not a great fan of it in its natural state. To me, it is primarily a hostile barrier that stands between a car park and water. It blows in your face, gets in your sandwiches, swallows vital objects like car keys and coins.	• There's nothing like having nothing to drink to bring on a towering thirst.	• Standing as it does in the midst of flat fenlands, it has a kind of menacing, palpably ancient air, but also a feeling of monumental folly. It required an immense commitment of labour to construct, but it didn't take a whole lot of military genius to realize that all an invading army had to do was go around it, which is what all of them did, and within no time at all the Devil's Dyke had ceased to have any use at all except to show people in the fen country what it felt like to be sixty feet high. Still, it offers an agreeable, easy stroll along its grassy summit, and on this bleak morning I had it all to myself.	• Bradford's role in life is to make every place else in the world look better in comparison, and it does this very well.	• 'Have you been here long?' I asked. He exhaled thoughtfully and said: 'Put it this way. I was clean shaven when I got here.' I just love that.	• When the man in the window passed them to me he said: 'The ticket's free . .. but it's eighteen-fifty for the receipt.'	• And that is what I like so much about Liverpool. The factories may be gone, there may be no work, the city may be pathetically dependent on football for its sense of destiny, but the Liverpudlians still have character and initiative, and they don't bother you with preposterous ambitions to win the bid for the next Olympics.	• There is almost nothing, apart perhaps from a touching faith in the reliability of weather forecasts and the universal fondness for jokes involving the word 'bottom', that makes me feel more like an outsider in Britain than the nation's attitude to animals. Did you know that the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children was formed sixty years after the founding of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and as an offshoot of it? Did you know that in 1994 Britain voted for a European Union directive requiring statutory rest periods for transported animals, but against statutory rest periods for factory workers?	• For the benefit of foreign readers, I should explain that as a rule in Britain no matter how many windows there are in a bank, post office or rail station, only two of them will be open, except at very busy times, when just one will be open. Points to Contemplate	• Now everyone drives everywhere for everything, which I don't understand because there isn't a single feature of driving in Britain that has even the tiniest measure of enjoyment in it.	• To an American the whole purpose of living, the one constant confirmation of continued existence, is to cram as much sensual pleasure as possible into one's mouth more or less continuously. Gratification, instant and lavish, is a birthright.	• Second, you are alive. For the tiniest moment in the span of eternity you have the miraculous privilege to exist. For endless eons you were not. Soon you will cease to be once more.	• When a nation's industrial prowess has plunged so low that it is reliant on Korean firms for its future economic security, then perhaps it is time to re-address one's educational priorities and maybe give a little thought to what's going to put some food on the table	• But now, no matter what you do, you end up stung with guilt. Go for a ramble in the country and you are reminded that you are inexorably adding to congestion in the national parks and footpath erosion on fragile hills.	• One thing I have learned over the years is that your impressions of a city are necessarily coloured by the route you take into it.	• What other nation in the world could possibly have given us William Shakespeare, pork pies, Christopher Wren, Windsor Great Park, the Open University, Gardeners' Question Time and the chocolate digestive biscuit? None, of course.Beautifully Constructed Sentences	• The world was bathed in that milky pre-dawn light that seems to come from nowhere. Gulls wheeled and cried over the water. Beyond them, past the stone breakwater, a ferry, vast and well lit, slid regally out to sea. I sat there for some time, a young man with more on his mind than in it.	• For much of its length, the beach is reserved for naturists, which always adds a measure of interest to any walk along it, though today, in fact, there wasn't a soul to be seen along its three fetching miles; nothing before me but virgin sand and behind only my own footprints.	• You have in this country the most comely, the most parklike, the most flawlessly composed countryside the world has ever known, a product of centuries of tireless, instinctive improvement, and you are half a generation from destroying most of it forever. We're not talking here about 'nostalgia for a non-existent golden age'. We're talking about something that is green and living and incomparably beautiful.	• But the paintings provide a compelling record of life in a mining community over a period of fifty years. Nearly all depict local scenes - 'Saturday Night at the Club', 'Whippets' - or life down the pits, and seeing them in the context of a mining museum, rather than in some gallery in a metropolis, adds appreciably to their lustre. For the second time in a day I was impressed and captivated.	• I spent a long, happy afternoon wandering through the many rooms, pretending, as I sometimes do in these circumstances, that I had been invited to take any one object home with me as a gift from the Scottish people in recognition of my fineness as a person.",7,0.9997,0.054,0.819,0.128,0.4802537800363891,POSITIVE,0.9999
62,52195404,04/10/2009,4.0,"This is the first Bill Bryson book I’ve read, although I’ve had several on the TBR list for a while including this one. Having finally gotten around to reading it, I really enjoyed it and found a surprising amount of it to be laugh-out loud funny (including the description of the humble multi-story car park!), especially in the first two-thirds of the book.I wonder if this is because he has a more ‘British’ sense of observational humour, having lived over here for so long, or whether I just have the same kind of slightly cynical outlook that he does. (For the record, I also like Jon Ronson, whose style is somewhat similar). And he had a good line in one-liners, like “It is an interesting experience to become acquainted with a country through the eyes of the insane, and, if I may say so, a particularly useful grounding for life in Britain” and “Correct me if I’m wrong, but you would think that if one nation ought by now to have mastered the science of drainage, Britain would be it”. Living in the UK I can visualise a lot of the places, situations and types of people, which may also have added to my positive view on the book. I’m also a fan of ‘random acts of tourism’, as you can come across some amazing gems that way, although I would probably have been one of those who told him “gosh, you’re brave” when he proposed touring Britain on public transport.he can be exceedingly and unnecessarily rude at times (I thought the hotelier in Weston had exactly the right response – to be so polite the following day that Bryson was ashamed of how he’d behaved), and it is a bit dated in places (but then, it was first published in 1995, so I guess it would be), which is why I only gave it 4 stars, instead of 5. But overall I really enjoyed it, and I’ll almost certainly read more of his books. First on the list is his biography of Shakespeare, in this 400th anniversary year of Shakespeare’s death.",7,0.9453,0.052,0.845,0.104,0.5366050616050616,POSITIVE,0.9997
63,167715364,05/12/2011,1.0,"I can't believe I just gave a Bill Bryson book one star. I feel like I should be ashamed but this is just one of the most tedious books I've ever read. Normally Bryson's books are filled with interesting/weird/funny anecdotes, history pieces, and good old fashioned fun facts. Usually I'm smiling, nodding along in agreement, laughing out loud, and/or finding the person closest to me and going ""OMG listen to this!"" There is none of that here. This book is literally just Bryson walking from one tiny, obscure English town to the next and describing either how glorious it is or how much it sucks. These declarations are based 90% on how pretty he found the town to be. This book is the equivalent of someone describing their vacation pictures to you after leaving the actually photos at home. Spoiler alert: the pictures are all of scenery and food. Occasionally they will mention such and such person and how amazingly [adverb] they are/were .... but never elaborate. Highlights: Chapter 12: Directions. These are actually in a lot of the chapters, but he spends paragraphs and paragraphs telling you the exact directions of where he is going. Are we expected to follow him?Chapter 13: This is a 9 page rant that basically boils down to ""HOW DARE some moron change the benches from alabaster to eggshell at the corner of Nowhere and Obscure! Don't they know the history they've destroyed?!"" This also happens in a variety of chapters. The book seriously could have benefited from some before and after pictures if the changes are really so mind blowing. Chapter 14: 3 pages on the importance of hedges. He even threatens to punch the next person who tells him hedges aren't that important. Chapter 17: Another 3 pages describing an IMAX movie. I would only recommend this book for someone who has lived/been to a lot of these rural places but also does not live in England anymore. I can't imagine enjoying this book if it doesn't send your nostalgia meter to max. ",7,0.9738,0.063,0.821,0.115,0.5008986928104576,NEGATIVE,1.0
64,351266938,06/19/2012,3.0,"I enjoyed this book less this time around, and I can't quite pin point why. Perhaps it's that the book is 20 years old now, and it feels like it. The prices listed are staggeringly low, and the fact that he navigates almost the entirety of Great Britain by public transport without being forced to sell an organ to British Rail is astonishing. It's less humourous than I remembered, possibly because a lot of the (now 20 year old) humour makes little sense to those who weren't there at the time, or comes across as a wee bit racist/sexist/insert-other-ist-here/generally cruel. There's Bryson's usual ranting, and oddly specific descriptions of hotels and hotel rooms to the detriment of details on the actual towns/cities in which those hotels are located. And he seems to have an odd idea that Britain should be locked in a time bubble where nothing ever changes because modern buildings are a blight on the landscape. Which I kind of get, especially when those buildings are concrete monstrosities from the 1970s. But there are solid reasons behind all the changes he bemoans, and these rants rapidly headed towards ""Ugh, again?"" territory for me. There is, however, a lot of good stuff in here. Bryson's personal memories of what England was like when he first moved there and his anecdotes about working as a newspaper editor through industrial action and meeting his wife while working at a psychiatric hospital etc etc are pretty damned fabulous. Similarly, his tangents full of random historical titbits about people no one's heard of (particularly the Fifth Duke of Portland) are fascinating. So yeah. Parts of it are great, and are still highly relevant today (the ""you want to drive from WHERE TO WHERE?!?!"" parts especially), and other parts are ranty and a little dull and can make you feel slightly icky.",7,0.979,0.053,0.815,0.132,0.4806201550387598,NEGATIVE,0.9992
65,62334273,07/06/2009,2.0,"I really struggled with this book. The first book I read from Bryson was A Walk in the Woods, a fabulously funny and ironic account of his attempt to walk the Appalachian Trail. I've read several other things by him since and really liked most of what I read.That is why I was so surprised and how utterly mediocre this book turned out. Don't get my wrong, there are several funny and witty spots and some excellent observations. The opening pages are the best of the book.But it felt like Bryson didn't want to go on this trip. It felt like he could care less about meeting people. Most of the book is him just describing what he did while moving around ALONE. I don't mind that he complains about modern architecture or crumbling cities. I don't mind the criticisms of the trains and buses. That is all part of traveling. What bothered me though was how few people he interacted with and how the UK was reduced to a catalogue of hotels and cafes disconnected from the people and cultural idiosyncrasies that make up a modern nation. He had no plan. Nothing he wanted to learn and explore. No questions to ask.I just don't think he wanted to do this. He publisher probably pushed him to do it, gave him some money and off he went. And that blasé comes through in the text.Perhaps most annoying is the fact that there was no map in the book. Oh sure, I couldnt have pulled out my atlas every night when I laid down to read but lets me honest. That is a pain. Any travel book needs a series of maps. One for each chapter almost. I want to know where he is going. Where he walked.Again.

Ireland in this bit) and that's why I loved this book so much. I did think some things were a little far-fetched and made a haughty scoffing noise in their direction, before remembering that things like that do actually happen over here and acting nonchalantly again. I would recommend this book to someone who knows enough about England (well, Britain really) to appreciate the references. Now I'd better go and make a cup of tea.

72,466549741,04/04/2017,3.0,"Wikipedia informs us that, according to the opinion of listeners expressed in a poll initiated by BBC in 2003, Notes from a Small Island is the book that represented Britain best. Indeed, even though I can’t remember who recommended this book to me, I understand why I put it on my to read list: learning that its author was an American, I was curious to see how he perceived the British way, expecting a light and humorous reading, with many a linguistic and behavioural clash. Well, the book answered and not my horizon of expectations. There are funny scenes, mentality contrasts, vocabulary misunderstandings and so on, but they do not always rate high in quality, sometimes the intended humorous observations are flat, or even vulgar or simply doubtful, like in this quote about names (although I found further ahead some very interesting study about the same subject):I don't remember his name now, but it was one of those names that only English people have Colin Crapspray or Bertram Pantyshield or something similarly improbable.By the way, he same opinion was expressed by Mordecai Richler in his New York Times moderately enthusiastic  review : “Mr. Bryson's book is astute and funny, but sometimes relentlessly so, his appetite for stand-up comic one-liners a tad exhausting. Some of them just manage a pass mark. Of Blackpool, for instance: ''It has more public toilets than anywhere else in the world; elsewhere they call them doorways.'' Others land with a dull thud, as in ''And do you know the difference, by the way, between village and hamlet? It's quite simple, really: one is a place where people live and the other is a play by Shakespeare.'' “Nevertheless, here are some reasons that may convince you to read this travel book. First, despite the unfortunate quote above, the Prologue, describing his arrival in Britain is a fresh and vivacious introduction to the subject, recalling the words he didn’t know the pronunciation (like 'scone' or 'Towcester'), or words he completely misunderstood (like “counterpane”, which he thought it was some part of a window, and which is in fact another British word for quilt), customs or events he never heard of (like railway cuttings, Christmas crackers, bank holidays, floats, trunk calls, Scotch eggs) or inappropriate behaviour in public places (“I sat for half an hour in a pub before I realized that you had to fetch your own order, then tried the same thing in a tearoom and was told to sit down”).To his first years in Britain belongs also the memory of his job in the lunatic asylum near a village named Virginia Water, village where healthy people and crazy ones happily mixed and where locals did not find strange at all that “a man with wild hair wearing a pyjama jacket was standing in a corner of the baker's declaiming to a spot on the wall or sitting at a corner table of the Tudor Rose with swivelling eyes and the makings of a smile, dropping sugar cubes into his minestrone.” A memorable figure he encounters here is Harry, an idiot savant who, although in any other way he had the mind of a small child, he could tell the day of the week of any date in past or future. He proved also that he could see the future because after annoyingly asking everyone for near a decade if the hospital was going to close in 1980, a storm that provoked a fire that very year made the place inhabitable and the authorities were forced to shut it down. Other peculiar characters that are brought to the attention of the narrator during this farewell trip before relocating to United States after twenty years of living in England, are inter alia, Gordon Selfridge and the fifth Duke of Portland Gordon Selfridge, “the department store magnate”, whose former home, Highcliffe Castle, the narrator visits, was a fellow American who led an exemplary life until his wife died, in 1918, to fall “into rakish ways” after that, spending all his money with the Hungarian-American twins and music-hall celebrities known as the Dolly Sisters:In ten years he raced through $8 million, lost control of Selfridges, lost his castle and London home, his racehorses and his Rolls Royces, and eventually ended up living alone in a small flat in Putney and travelling by bus. He died penniless and virtually forgotten on 8 May 1947. But of course he had had the inestimable pleasure of bonking twin sisters, which is the main thing.On the other hand, the fifth Duke of Portland, one W.J.C. Scott Bentinck, who lived in the 19th century, gave new and deeper meanings to the word “recluse”. Although he had a big home, he occupied only a small corner in it, he never spoke to his servants but send them notes and if someone encountered him was instructed to ignore him completely or be punished by skating on his private skating rink until exhausted. He was suspected to have had a premonition regarding the nuclear war, for he built a second house underground, full of tunnels and secret passageways, not dissimilar to a bunker.When the duke died, his heirs found all of the aboveground rooms devoid of furnishings except for one chamber in the middle of which sat the duke's commode. The main hall was mysteriously floorless. Most of the rooms were painted pink. The one upstairs room in which the duke resided was packed to the ceiling with hundreds of green boxes, each of which contained a single dark brown wig.Of course, England would not be England without ghosts or at least haunted houses. The narrator visits the site of Milner Field, where in 1870 stood a mansion built by the head of a very wealthy family, Titus Salt Junior. Twenty years after, the Salts bankrupted and had to sell the property that became cursed for the subsequent owners: one died of septicaemia after hurting his foot with a golf club, other shot his cheating wife and was hanged, and so on, until the house could not be sold anymore because of its bad name and in 1950 was demolished:Less memorable is the visit in Manchester both for the narrator and reader (I however learnt how are named its inhabitants: Mancunians – I bet you didn’t know this either), because for him it represents only an airport (“with a city attached”), without a central motif, like other places: Newcastle has its bridge, Liverpool has the Liver Buildings and docks, Edinburgh its castle, Glasgow the great sprawl of Kelvingrove Park and the buildings of Charles Rennie Mackintosh, even Birmingham has the Bull Ring (and very welcome it is to it, too).A bittersweet evocation is the rise and fall of Ashington, once the biggest mining village in the world, also famous because of its pitmen painters: an enthusiastic artist founded in 1934 the Ashington Group, consisting of miners who had never held a brush in their hand, but nevertheless made some very gifted paintings that were mentioned in magazines and exhibited in London and other cities. Ashington became very prosperous before the second world war, having “a thriving theatre, a ballroom, five cinemas, and a concert chamber called the Harmonic Hall.” Unfortunately, all these cultural institutions disappeared one by one, the last one being the Ashington Group which in 1982 had only two members who renounced membership when they were informed that rent was to be raised from 50 pence a year to 14 pounds. Nowadays the hut that sheltered the club is only a memory, for it was demolished soon after the group dismantling. There are, of course (what narrator could have resisted it?), some parallels between English and American, mainly concerning the differences in education and behaviour. Thus, the narrator remembers having once watched a challenge between British and American scholars which the British won by far (“The final score was something like 12,000 to 2”) and stereotypically presumes that every member of then humiliated American team is now probably winning many thousand dollars a year, “while the British are studying the tonal qualities of sixteenth-century choral music in Lower Silesia and wearing jumpers with holes in them.”As for the national approach, many a British encountered shared the same prejudice about the lack of culture and or manners of the Americans, complaining about their shortcomings in front of the narrator: I never understand what people are thinking when they do this. Do they think I'll appreciate their candour? Are they winding me up? Or have they simply forgotten that I am one of the species myself? The same thing often happens when people talk about immigration in front of me. These are only some of the best passages in the book. Moreover, the final page is written with such feeling, with such tenderness that you cannot doubt neither the love of the narrator for its adopted country nor his enthusiasm in accepting its best and its worst. And this is why the last paragraph is merely a farewell, not a goodbye:Suddenly, in the space of a moment, I realized what it was that I loved about Britain which is to say, all of it. Every last bit of it, good and bad Marmite, village fetes, country lanes, people saying 'mustn't grumble' and 'I'm terribly sorry but', people apologizing to me when I conk them with a careless elbow, milk in bottles, beans on toast, haymaking in June, stinging nettles, seaside piers, Ordnance Survey maps, crumpets, hot water bottles as a necessity, drizzly Sundays every bit of it.  What a wondrous place this was – crazy as fuck, of course, but adorable to the tiniest degree. What other country, after all, could possibly have come up with place names like Tooting Bee and Farleigh Wallop, or a game like cricket that goes on for three days and never seems to start? Who else would think it not the least odd to make their judges wear little mops on their heads, compel the Lord Chancellor to sit on something called the Woolsack, or take pride in a naval hero whose dying wish was to be kissed by a fellow named Hardy? ('Please, Hardy, full on the lips, with just a bit of tongue.') What other nation in the world could possibly have given us William Shakespeare, pork pies, Christopher Wren, Windsor Great Park, the Open University, Gardeners' Question Time and the chocolate digestive biscuit? None, of course. How easily we lose sight of all this. What an enigma Britain will seem to historians when they look back on the second half of the twentieth century. Here is a country that fought and won a noble war, dismantled a mighty empire in a generally benign and enlightened way, created a far-seeing welfare state in short, did nearly everything right and then spent the rest of the century looking on itself as a chronic failure. The fact is that this is still the best place in the world for most things to post a letter, go for a walk, watch television, buy a book, venture out for a drink, go to a museum, use the bank, get lost, seek help, or stand on a hillside and take in a view.All of this came to me in the space of a lingering moment. I've said it before and I'll say it again. I like it here. I like it more than I can tell you.

Bryson spent a little more than the first 50% of the book exploring just the south (and probably parts of the midlands?) of England, which was a bit worrying, but as he himself realised during the trip, he had underestimated the total amount of time it would take to cover the whole of Britain and ended up spending a lot of time in one part of England in the beginning itself. He spends 20-25% talking about the rest of England and Wales and the final 20% talking about Scotland. He did not cover the Cairngorms, which is basically the highlight of the Scottish Highlands and I found that very surprising!A lot of times I wondered if he really liked Britain, or if he hated it. But then again, his individual sense of humour + the self-deprecating British humour that might have rubbed off on him (he being an 'honorary Brit' as someone said) surely explains why he writes of some places the way he does (or probably, he just hates them). I would not have appreciated it if the whole book was replete with ONLY moans about certain aspects of the places he visited, so I greatly valued it when he talked seriously about a lot of things: the beauty of the Lake District, the changes in Oxford, the importance of maintaining the traditional architecture of cities and towns that make Britain what it is, and the likes. What I did not appreciate is the couple of times he spoke (and interestingly, admitted it) rudely to people; I saw no need of it. It made me like him a little less.... but I don't know him and am ready to give him the benefit of doubt. I also wish he named the chapters instead of calling them 'Chapter One, Chapter Two', etc. It would have been helpful for people who want to go back to a chapter pertaining a particular town. Different people may perceive this book differently, depending on whether they live in Britain or not. All in all, I think it gives a decent insight into what living in Britain is like. There are a lot of places mentioned in the book that I have not been to. I will take Bryson's 'review' of those places with a pinch of salt (also this book is at least 20 years old and places change over time), but the reviews are definitely helpful to some extent if you'd like to know what to expect in a place. It is rare for me to give a book which I 'complain' about to so much extent 5 stars, but as I said, I cried in the end.",6,0.9941,0.074,0.772,0.154,0.5064251941911516,POSITIVE,0.8083

""The next town on my itinerary is just 30 miles from here, surely I can travel directly there on public transport with no inconvenience whatsoever....What?!? You mean there's not a direct route from small village A to small village B, and I'll have to spend hours travelling hither and yon on trains and buses to reach my destination?!?!? I curse you, Margaret Thatcher!""4. ""Walk near me on the beach with a dog, will you? Charge me more than I want to pay for a hotel breakfast, eh? Ask me if I want to add an apple pie to my McDonald's order, hmm?...How dare you! Ready yourself, sir, for the tongue lashing of a lifetime!""5. ""I see fat people eating nearby.

Must be a Parkinson's convention...""""...Why won't this bloody annoying person stop going on and on about trains? Must have Aspergers...""""Aren't I just hilarious?”Well, honestly.

In a way it was and occasionally it wasn't. The latter typically occurred when Bryson made the book more about himself than his subject. Meaning...this is essentially a grumpy man's journey around England and Scotland. Mind you, Bryson is erudite and funny, two qualities I normally value enough to overlook a variety of shortcomings, but every so often he is just an unbearable git. He's the sort of man who firmly believes himself to be more clever than the next person and unleashes his wit like flatulence irrespective of aim or company, which just comes across as obnoxiousness (despite the much lauded British manners). Something about making fun of obese while himself being overweight or unleashing his rage on help, particularly some helpless kid at McDonalds is just unpleasant and mean, no matter how funny the author finds it to be. Bryson is also miserly with occasional splurges, curmudgeonly and ornery, which are all presumably part of his charm, but it does get to be too much now and again. Aside from that, it's a lovely book, albeit now dated. The man obviously knows and loves his adapted country and so this sort of farewell tour he takes around (using notably mostly public transport) before leaving the country for US is quaint and lovely. The descriptions are terrific. I would have liked to see more history (at one point actually dismissed as Who gives a F by author) and less personality as it were, but it is what it is. Plenty funny, very entertaining, occasionally annoying. The peculiar thing is that Bryson is often very midwesternly American in his insights, while having a distinctly English droll humor. Makes for some interesting cultural observations. Pretty good for an armchair trip because and in spite of the author at the same time.

Nevertheless, this book was sometimes hard to follow because I'm not super familiar with the geography of Great Britain beyond the biggest cities. For the most part, I enjoyed his insights on British culture, but often his comments about things ""you only find in Great Britain"" would actually be true about all of Europe. For example, he said (quoting from memory) ""Nowhere else can you find so much history in such a small space"". That is really some BS. It's not a comparison of US & UK, but of US and many other countries in the world with a longer history. (Think: Italy, Greece, Egypt, China, Japan, etc.) Despite some downsides, this was still an enjoyable book. Still, I would NOT recommend it to people who have never been to Great Britain. It is not written for outsiders to learn about the country. It's written for the British to get a well-informed quasi-outsider's perspective on their own country.Oh yea, I listened to this as an audiobook, which was a bad choice.

I picked this book up not because I am an Anglophile or struck by wanderlust, but because I'd read Bryson's impeccable and charming writing before and I wanted more of where that came from. In the process, though, he did stir an incredible fascination for British culture and history within me, and scratched a travel itch I didn't know I had. This travelogue is filled with humour, beautifully written observations about both the subject at hand and of human folly in general, and with plenty of delightful historical, cultural and architectural trivia. There's never a dull moment with Bryson, although if you are as clueless about certain iconic and not-so-iconic British locales as I was, parts of the book are a little (very little) hard to get through.

Except for a few positive impressions, he mostly seemed happy only when drinking heavily or gorging himself. Even then, he often criticized the beer and food. Twice he described berating people (an innkeeper and some poor kid behind the counter at a McDonald's) without any suggestion of shame for his boorish behavior. In one stunning bit of irony, he talked about British people who have visited America and then regale him with their negative views of it. ""I'll never understand why people do that,"" he complains. Um, got a mirror, Bryson? I've traveled very widely, in both developed and developing nations, and can give you a list of everything wonderful or fascinating about each place.

In several places he talks about the loss of things - green fields, old buildings, community - and reading about them now, you kind of wish we were back in the 90s, when the losses were nowhere near as huge as they are now.

Bill Bryson lived in England for 20 years after marrying a British woman, and before moving to the United States, he took a 6-week trip traveling around Britain and chronicling his trip. I read this for my book group, and we had a great evening discussing the book, especially as we have a British woman in our book group. It's a love story to Britain--even though it was published in the mid-1990s, so much still applies. Here are some memorable thoughts from the book:--The charming way the British react to tea and a plate of biscuits: ""ooh lovely!""--Bryson writes about how unfortunate it is that communism was left to the Russians instead of the British, who ""clearly would have managed it so much better."" He talks about their ability to go without, how they are great at pulling together in the face of adversity for a perceived common good...how they ""queue patiently for indefinite periods and accept with rare fortitude the imposition of rationing, bland diets, and sudden inconvenient shortages."" He goes on about how they are ""comfortable with faceless bureaucracies, tolerant of dictatorships (as Margaret Thatcher proved), will wait uncomplainingly for years for an operation or delivery of a household appliance."" They have a ""natural gift for making excellent, muttered jokes about authority without ever actually challenging it...they derive universal satisfaction from the sight of the rich and powerful brought low...most of those above the age of 28 already dress like East Germans. Britain would have done it properly, taken it in stride, with good heart, and without excessive cheating.""--He says that the British are easy to please: ""They have so little idea of their own virtues, and nowhere is this more true than with their own happiness. Easy to please...like their pleasures small...so many of their treats are cautiously flavorful...they are the only people in the world who think of jam and currants as thrilling constituents of a pudding or cake...offer them something genuinely tempting (a slice of gateau or a choice of chocolates), and they will nearly always hesitate and begin to worry that it's unwarranted and excessive, as if any pleasure beyond a very modest throshold is vaguely unseemly. 'Oh, I shouldn't really...'""--In the late 1980s the European Union issued a directive about standards of ocean-borne sewage on beaches, and nearly every British seaside town failed to come anywhere near the minimum compliance levels. So instead of cleaning them up, the Thatcher government decided that Britain would not have any ""beaches."" Nowadays, they are labeled beaches, but they still have a serious sewage problem. I'll remember this next time we go to a British seaside!--One of my favorite anecdotes was when he visited a pub in Glasgow and couldn't understand a thing the bartender was saying...such as ""D'ye hae a hoo and a poo?"" ""D'ye nae hae in May? If ye dinna dock ma donny."" ""Doon in Troon they croon in June, wi' a spoon.""I actually enjoyed the anecdotes and thoughts about Britain and the British more than the traveling bits. Bryson gets a bit grumpy at times, but it's clear that he really loves Great Britain. He ends the book with this:“Suddenly, in the space of a moment, I realized what it was that I loved about Britain - which is to say, all of it. Every last bit of it, good and bad - Marmite, village fetes, country lanes, people saying 'mustn't grumble' and 'I'm terribly sorry but,' people apologizing to me when I conk them with a nameless elbow, milk in bottles, beans on toast, haymaking in June, stinging nettles, seaside piers, Ordnance Survey maps, crumpets, hot-water bottles as a necessity, drizzly Sundays - every bit of it.What a wondrous place this was - crazy as fuck, of course, but adorable to the tiniest degree. What other country, after all, could possibly have come up with place names like Tooting Bec and Farleigh Wallop, or a game like cricket that goes on for three days and never seems to start? Who else would think it not the least odd to make their judges wear little mops on their heads, compel the Speaker of the House of Commons to sit on something called the Woolsack, or take pride in a military hero whose dying wish was to be kissed by a fellow named Hardy? ('Please Hardy, full on the lips, with just a bit of tongue.') What other nation in the world could possibly have given us William Shakespeare, pork pies, Christopher Wren, Windsor Great Park, the Open University, Gardners' Question Time and the chocolate digestive biscuit? None, of course.How easily we lose sight of all this. What an enigma Britain will seem to historians when they look back on the second half of the twentieth century. Here is a country that fought and won a noble war, dismantled a mighty empire in a generally benign and enlightened way, created a far-seeing welfare state - in short, did nearly everything right - and then spent the rest of the century looking on itself as a chronic failure. The fact is that this is still the best place in the world for most things - to post a letter, go for a walk, watch television, buy a book, venture out for a drink, go to a museum, use the bank, get lost, seek help, or stand on a hillside and take in a view.All of this came to me in the space of a lingering moment.

I've put some of his funny quotes below, but there were many more that made me laugh aloud. He notices architecture and city planning in particular, bemoaning the way that incredible, ancient buildings have been razed to make way for what seem to be intentionally ugly shopping centers and buildings that look, as he says, like big toasters. He's also keenly aware that almost all industry in England is gone, and wonders how people still survive economically in places that used to thrive (like Liverpool, or small mining towns). He notices everything from beautiful landscapes (not-so-beautiful as well), museums, cinemas, and anything else that he happens to fancy (or not).Bryson also is very enamored of the English temperament, the understated humor, the ""mysteriously well educated people from unprivileged backgrounds"" one meets frequently, etc.This book makes me want to visit other places of England -- many other places! -- and Wales and Scotland. In fact, one of the odd effects on me of reading this book was a melancholy sense that life just isn't long enough, and I undoubtedly won't ever be able to take seven weeks to tramp around the UK like Bryson did.

In one section, he finds a town distinctly unlovely, but then admits that it is a pleasant enough place, but he had seen zillions of towns exactly like it and so it was probably more his own boredom, or oversaturation, that made the town disagreeable to him.Anyway, read this! It's delightful, funny, perceptive, informative; both Bryson and England come across as very endearing. He mentions more place names than you can imagine, and if you delight in words in general it's always entertaining. In Sutton Courtenay, he visits a graveyard where George Orwell and H.H. Asquith [Wikipedia: ""a British statesman of the Liberal Party who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1908 to 1916. He was the last Prime Minister to lead a majority Liberal government and played a central role in the design and passage of major liberal legislation""] are buried in typically understated and humble graves. He then sees another: Next to Asquith lay one Ruben Loveridge 'who fell asleep 29th April 2950' and near by was a grave shared by two men [one died in 1930 and the other in 1993]. . . . What an intriguing little community this was - a place where men are entombed together and they bury you if you fall asleep. . . . I think we Iowans would be content to let you keep Orwell and Asquith as long as we could have the guy who was buried alive. 161I had to read it again (and laugh again).Visiting Wales, he says:It was an odd experience watching people who existed in a recognizably British milieu -- they drank tea and wore Marks & Spencer's cardigans -- but talked in Martian. . . . [I]n one memorable encounter a character said something like 'Wlch ylch aargh ybsy cwm dirty weekend, look you,' which I just loved. How sweetly endearing for the Welsh not to have their own term for an illicit bonk between Friday and Monday. 258Sounds like Welsh to me! And a typical (Brysonian) description of a town made me chuckle, because he is such a good noticer:Ludlow was indeed a charming and agreeable place on a hilltop high above the River Teme. It appeared to have everything you could want in a community -- bookshops [he loves bookshops], a cinema, some appealing-looking tearooms and bakeries, a couple of ""family butchers"" (I always want to go in and say, ""How much to do mine?"")an old-fashioned Woolworths, and the usual assortment of chemists, pubs, haberdashers, and the like, all neatly arrayed and respectful of their surroundings. 264A few other quotes; and keep in mind, I'm not giving away all the best parts, because all the best parts occur throughout the book:Oh, never mind. Pick it up yourself. If you don't laugh aloud at his explanation of the difference between a village and a hamlet (page 286) or his recollection of the name of a particular Ford model (page 330), then this probably isn't the book for you. Except that if you just read those without any context, they probably aren't as funny, so you really need to read the whole thing.",5,0.9993,0.05,0.762,0.188,0.4864598108747044,POSITIVE,0.9998
99,317903980,04/24/2012,5.0,"Firstly, I should note that I'm extremely glad I didn't wait any longer to read this book. Over fifteen years have passed since it was first published which, coupled with the fact that Bryson reminisces often about his first trip to England (another twenty years previously) lends a lot of the prose a somewhat nostalgic air. Many of the observations he makes are no longer relevant as town centres become increasingly homogenised and many sites of cultural and historical significance are largely either bastardised or done away with entirely. I’m inclined to both agree and empathise with the sad ‘things ain’t what they used to be’ passages.A large portion of the book focuses on the seaside town of Bournemouth (where, coincidentally, I spent most holidays as a child in the mid nineties). As a result I remember fondly the piers and pleasure gardens he describes; in particular the wooden frames erected in the latter, to which are attached coloured glass jars containing candles which, when lit, form charming motifs of flowers and boats and so on. They really are quite wonderful. While Bill Bryson has lived for some time in England he seems to remain an observer on the fringe of participation, rather than a participant who happens also to observe. The quirks of ‘the English’ and their semantic peculiarities are not treated as entirely confounding, merely somewhat curious. Dialectal incongruities are often a mystery to regional outsiders in any case. Bryson also remarks upon how remarkably gifted the British are at naming things, particularly places. Nether Wallop, Wigtwizzle and Yonder Bognie are just a few examples picked at random. This is one of his many digressions into linguistic miscellanea, all of which I enjoyed thoroughly.Written in a time before a mobile phone and internet connection became human rights in all but name (and one gets the feeling Bryson would have ignored both anyway) there is an exploratory, rather happy-go-lucky approach to his travels. On more than one occasion he finds himself poring over bus and train timetables, planning his time meticulously in order to best use the hours between the arrival and departure of various irregular and unreliable public transport services. I can attest that this is all fact. Public transport is a law unto itself and a royal pain in the butt.Although he can often come over as somewhat curmudgeonly, I’m quite fond of Bryson’s penchant for scathing sarcasm. I believe that everybody is judgemental occasionally, whether they choose to be vocal about it or otherwise; I appreciate the combination of honesty and wit with which he shares his opinions. This book paints a picture of Britain, particularly England, which I imagine can be truly appreciated only by the (mostly) British. It also serves as a reminder to not take oneself too seriously; of course certain characteristics are exaggerated for comic effect and to take offence at generalisations in this context would be foolish.Admittedly, were it not for my childhood recollections and at least passing familiarity with many of the places mentioned I would have enjoyed this book rather less. Overall I absolutely loved most of it and really liked almost all the rest. But now I can’t stop wondering: just how do they make sticks of rock?!",5,0.9925,0.043,0.837,0.12,0.4497853239656519,POSITIVE,0.9996

Miracles do happen and what a joy it was to read again. For me there were many laugh out loud moments and reciting passages to anyone that would listen.Bryson talks about his first trip to England in March 1973 which was a year of industrial strikes by civil servants, teachers, newspapers, car manufactures plus inflation going up to a whopping 28%. Decimalization had just come in and a packet of crisps cost 5p. What a culture shock that must have been.Let's see if Bill visits where you live or have lived:Now, in 1994, he and his family are about to move to the US and Bryson starts his trip in Calais just like in 1973 and gets the ferry to Dover and a train on to London where he marvels at the A-Z map and mentions some unsavoury street names like Cold Blow Lane. How dare he. Home to the best football team in the land.Bryson worked for The Times in Fleet St until 1986 when they moved to Wapping causing all sorts of issues including print workers being layed-off and riots in the streets. He goes and visits a friend at the News International compound.Train to Windsor and Virginia Water where he used to live. The lake at Virginia Water where we have walked round many times was created by the Duke of Cumberland. When Bryson first came to England he worked at Holloway Sanatorium in Virginia Water and met a nurse who he married 16 months later.Goes onto Bournemouth where he also used to live for a couple of years and worked at a local newspaper called the Bournemouth Evening Echo. Then off to Christchurch, Salisbury, Stonehenge, Sandbanks where he walks to Corfe Castle, Lulworth and then Weymouth, Lyme Regis, Axminster, train to Exeter and on to Weston-Super-Mare, Chepstow, Monmouth.It then jumps to him being in Oxford. Abingdon and Sutton Courtenay. Hires a car to go round the Cotswolds. Visits Woodstock and Blenheim Palace and then Broadway (which sounds lovely). Visits Snowshill Manor owned by the National Trust, Cirencester and then Winchcombe where he visits a Roman Villa.Milton Keynes, Cambridge, train to Retford which is a Nottinghamshire market town, Worksop, Lincoln, Bradford and then onto Skipton and home in the Yorkshire Dales. Saltaire (built by Titus Salt between 1851 and 1876), Bingley, Harrogate, Manchester, Wigan and Wigan pier (like an old coal shed on the side of the Leeds-to-Liverpool canal).

Train to Llandudno, bus to Blaenau, cab to Porthmadog, train to Ludlow, Blackpool, Morecambe, Bowness-on-Windermere and Lake District. Durham, Ashington, Newcastle, Edinburgh and then onto Aberdeen (the Granite City), Inverness and then Thurso which is the northernmost town on the British mainland.

101,3444250978,07/15/2020,4.0,"That's the thing with adjectives and adverbs, they are familiar to all and yet their essence and importance is understood by so few of us. On the surface, they are mere descriptors or rather depictors of virtue. But rarely do we come across this epiphany that they are the custodians of time and beauty in a language. If we look at them closely, we'd find that every adjective and each adverb by its essential nature has the preternatural ability to hold a moment for a little longer.To say that life is unfair is so fleeting a thought that we can't fully fathom the the depth to which it scathes our hearts unless someone uses the armour of descriptors and calls it to be crushingly unfair. Adjectives and adverbs are the only things that actually let you live in the moment, doesn't matter if the colloquial meaning is exactly contrary to it.When you read Bill Bryson's writing you can't help but notice how he utilizes the two as his magic wand. His command on words is plenipotentiary; squeezing out the last drop of each emotion for the reader to savour. Now imagine he writes a travelogue. Imagine the same person travelling all across a country at a pace that is only paralleled by his writing - slowly and steadily soaking in each experience thoroughly without caring about the next.Just like his writing, there is no rush in his travels too, and that's where the book would lose upon young readership. The book was first published in 1995, when the YOLO generation was still figuring out their lost teeth. I don't see most of them to be able to find joy in this book, for it is slow and Bryson doesn't feel the need to ""cover"" as many destinations off his ""bucket list"". Bryson simply goes on to cherish both the beautiful and the ugly parts of his journey without throwing any life changing perspective at us. It's all about completely living in the moment while being yourself, no matter what comes your way. Cruising along Bryson I realised - and so he confessed later - that how much he loves this country and that how much he loves his life.And that's the thing about love. You don't love a place, a thing, a person or even life DESPITE its eccentricities and anomalies. You really love them BECAUSE of the latter.Contrary to what the synopsis tells you, this isn't a funny book that would set you laughing your hearts out. If you seriously think about it, this isn't really a book about travelling either.

102,3224017674,03/10/2020,4.0,"For years I've been living under a totally mistaken impression of Bill Bryson. Seeing his books in bookshops I had the idea that he was a neo-Victorian polymath, with doctorates in fields like astrorphysics, geology, botany, zoology and history. Anyone who could could write A short history of nearly everything must know everything that's worth knowing about anything, right?So I grabbed this book from the library because nothing else had taken my fancy, and thought I could always bring it back if I found it too erudite. And it turns out that it's a rather idiosyncratic and funny travel book about his own wanderings around Great Britain, with observations on the weird customs of the natives (Bryson is American, and a journalist). So his book was a much lighter read than I had been expecting, and some of his experiences rang bells for me too -- such as working on a small-town newspaper with hot-metal press, and writing about the exciting doings of the local Women's Institute. The things I liked about this book were the familiar things, where he described places I had visited or lived in, like Durham, where I was a student for a couple of years, and Blaenau Festiniog, where he spent a wet Sunday waiting for a train, and we spent a wet Saturday afternoon driving up and down the main (and apparently only) street looking for an Orthodox Church that we were sure was there but couldn't find, and couldn't ask the priest because he was in Turkey that weekend. So the book is full of all the personal touches of things that delighted and disgusted and bored Bill Bryson, which could be amusing or confusing. It was definitely the work of a journalist and not a polymath. I could imagine it being bashed out on flimsy copy paper on a worn-out old manual typewriter with uneven keys in a busy newsroom with a couple of dozen other typewriters clacking away in the background with the guy at the neighbouring desk interviewing a fashion model and the bloke on the other side swearing as he rummages through his wastepaper basket looking for page 4 of his six-page story.

103,1160823982,01/08/2015,2.0,"-Did not finish-Many recommended Bryson to me when I sent out a request for ""Books I should Read before going to the UK"" and it makes sense! Bryson lived in England for 20 years, and in this memoir he is returning to all of his favorite spots and writing about his memories and experiences there. This should be a good book--I should have finished it. But I did not, for the following 3 main reasons (and 1 solidifying reason). 1. Bryson is old. This effects the pacing of the novel--it seems like every 10 feet he's stopping to catch his breath, or he's checking in to some hotel and taking a bath. Yet he describes himself as a hiker. I do not want to read about old men pretending to be adventurers taking baths. 2. He is also rude. He yells at people, acts very clever in public, as though he is a step above the rest, and makes insulting remarks about those different than himself. He is very confident in his opinions, which some might find appealing, but I found insulting. He really doesn't like fat people, which is funny because he can't possibly be in the best shape himself. 3. Bryson is not a good writer. To explain--I had to read this book with Google Images pulled up on my phone to figure out what the heck he was talking about because he doesn't describe anything. Basically, this is how a chapter goes: ""I woke up in Salsbury and decided to rent a car to Mantex because I lived there 8 years ago. The Greensview Castle is also nice to climb that time of year, because from it's spire you can see the Duke's Death Drop just over Lake Adrian. It is very beautiful."" But he doesn't tell you what any of these things are or where they are or why these are notable places besides being the home of a friend or place he once lived or worked. I think people who live in England and do not have to look every city up on their phones would have a better time with this. And, finally, the clinching reason: Chapter 13 is basically about why Oxford is ugly and dumb and everyone is wasting their time studying philosophy and thinking Oxford is a great place. Granted, Bryson has been to Oxford and I have not, but no. You don't get to say that. You need to get back to Iowa, Bryson, because you are not worthy of England. But who knows, maybe you will like this book! ",5,0.9643,0.074,0.809,0.117,0.6177419354838709,NEGATIVE,0.9985
104,1204456131,02/18/2015,3.0,"In trying to review this book, I'm completely torn between irritation at the repetitive moaning of a middle-aged man who wishes things could go back to the way they were, and the fact that it did make me do a big loud snort-laugh at several points during the narrative. I am British, and of the right sort of age to recall boarding house landladies like the dreaded Mrs Smegma. That's not to mention the sort of casual racism that existed in the 1970s almost like background noise (I believe that the sitcom which Bryson watched and which he remembers as ""My Neighbour is a Darkie"" was probably the prejudice classic ""Love Thy Neighbour"", and it was far from being the only example of its type). A lot has changed since then, but Bryson's problem seems to be that he thinks it has been more for bad than good.Britain is a country with a large population, where people have to live and work and access services just like anyone else. It's not a heritage theme park which should be preserved in some kind of 1950s bubble just to keep tourists happy. Sadly, this often means that buildings and even whole towns have to be designed to be utilitarian, and beauty takes a poor second place. But what else are we expected to do? Go back to the days when you had to travel miles to the nearest big city when you wanted to buy something that wasn't stocked by your local, hideously overpriced corner shop? I suspect that most of us like having better access to more kinds of shop, and if that means that our high streets are somewhat homogeneous, well, that's the price you pay for living in the modern world. And I would rather have modern architecture than mock-Georgian stuff pretending to be something it isn't. For all of that, Bryson can be very funny. His description of Dover in 1973 is a hoot, as is the chapter about the psychiatric hospital he worked in at Virginia Water. I enjoyed his visit to see the Roman mosaic covered by a few animal feed sacks (bet it's been taken away and put in a museum since then, though, but most of all I liked his extended eulogy to Yorkshire and its people, since I'm one of them myself. Yorkshire is much more fashionable now than it was when this was written, but it's still gratifying to see nice things being said about it...",5,0.9707,0.076,0.805,0.119,0.4863571428571429,NEGATIVE,0.8218

On my way home to Canada, taking the familiar train route to London, I was despondent, and looking for something to do, I pulled out this book, but thought it was a little silly to read a travel memoir on my way out of the country it described. It would make me sad, I thought, and regretful about all the places that I hadn't gone during my time here. But I'm glad I read it.Bill Bryson's love for Durham, from the way it captivated him and led to him being chancellor and having the beloved main library named after him, made him immediately trustworthy to me, because Durham is so obviously charming and simply the best and he was clever enough to see it. I read on in anticipation of his description of Durham, but my goodness can this man write. I was skeptical of the warning on the book to not read it in public for fear of snorting, which, I have to say, is true - I laughed on the train and on the plane and at home, because Bill Bryson's writing is absolutely wonderful. It was so fun seeing places I had been through his eyes, reading his careful and studied anecdotes about British history, and feeling like I knew exactly what he was talking about when he discussed places I hadn't been. He's a very familiar and simply fascinating narrator and it was a pleasure to have him as a guide through this book, through our beloved England. I think he and I would get along quite well. His end passage, describing these innumerable little things that make Britain unprecedentedly nutty and delightful and so easy to fall in love with, was exactly what I have been thinking and feeling for months, especially in the past week as I have prepared to leave and come back to find myself in a beautiful country, but albeit not Britain.

The opening pages, in which Bryson parodies British pub regulars conspiring to give you 'advice' on how to get somewhere by road, before concluding that you're never going to get there in time. Then there's the classic recollection of the unaccountably strict and mean landlady at the Dover guesthouse where he'd stayed upon arrival in England as a youth many years previously.

Yes, Mr Bryson is funny, but I had been lead to believe this was a work of wit on the level of Three Men in a Boat, and while it fits the structure it lacks the cleverness and Britishness that I adored in Jerome K. Jerome's classic. Bryson occasionally comes up with an amusing observation but a good deal of his humour is of the toilet variety. This is a man who has since held the position of Chancellor of Durham University, and had a library named after him. I'm flabbergasted as to why.What really surprised me, however, was that for a travel writer, he doesn't much seem to enjoy travel. In fact, part way through the book he goes home for a few weeks break. He seems neither capable of reading a train timetable nor booking a hotel before arriving, and is frequently disappointed when it rains (which begs the question I had from the start of the book - why go on a tour of the UK in October of all months?) I have been to at least two thirds of the places he mentions in the book, and while he found the prospect of one or two days in a town or city daunting (he always seems to end up browsing gift shops and complaining about the architecture) I rarely left a place without feeling like there was more to see and I'd simply not been able to fit it all in. Britain is so dense in cultural, historical and natural sights that I can't imagine how one gets bored if at all able to get outside. I would comfortably recommend this to anyone born before the 60's who has lived most of their life in Britain and enjoys an easy laugh, but not to anyone planning on going there for the first time.

He cruelly mocks just about everyone he meets, loses his temper and yells obscenities at people, and makes derogatory comments about just about everywhere, even the places he professes to like.

I decided on the lowest rating because after only 100 pages I was ready to fling this book against a wall and forget all about it, and because Bryson's travels and description thereof are, for the most part, mind-numbingly boring. This is not to say that there is absolutely nothing of merit. Bryson is by no means a horrible writer. He can be very clever and witty, though jokes can only carry you so far. Half the time he merely came off as an asshole or the very type of old curmudgeon that he was so fond of belittling. He does present some worthwhile gems while contemplating the nature of Britain and its people, though these were few and far between. In essence, my main problem with this book was that I found it to be more about Bryson than Britain. I also did not realize that this book was first released almost twenty years ago, which means that the vast majority of his descriptions in relation to specific cities and attractions may no longer be relevant. I can recommend this book to you if by chance you enjoy the observation of practically every car park there is to be found in Britain, the verbal abuse of McDonald's employees, and the value of a city to be based entirely upon one man's views of what constitutes as aesthetically pleasing. Even Bryson says of himself at one point, ""But enough of this tedious bleating"", and I have to say I wholeheartedly concur.",5,0.5227,0.094,0.801,0.105,0.6244047619047619,NEGATIVE,1.0
112,1582807140,03/17/2016,5.0,"Truly, I laughed out loud more, I think, than in most any book I've read previously. Bill Bryson certainly has his own unique outlook. Here, he essentially traipses all over Great Britain (after having lived there for 20 years), shortly before moving back to the states. It is delightfully refreshing, at times, as he sets out for a good walk through some wonderful places. Other times, he encounters likely events for an impromptu walk in a strange place: inclement weather, hostile hotels, language difficulties, getting lost, transportation problems, and the like. Unfortunately, there are no maps accompanying the chapters, which becomes understandable when you attempt to follow his rambles, as I did, by writing down the places he visits or passes through. Took up both columns on three pages of a Steno notebook, single spaced, with chapter numbers and page number references. There are disappointments, occasional heartbreaks, but much that is uplifting and wonderful. A lot is finely touched with humor, but occasionally BB does get a bit nasty and even mean spirited. I'm guessing in Wales, there are railroad stations with posters of him that read, ""If you see this man, toss him out on his ear."" However, when I considered it, don't we all have a bit of a dark side, and in writing a book he was just being more honest than some of us might. Truly, I do enjoy Bill Bryson the author, and look forward to reading even more of his adventures!",5,0.9795,0.075,0.76,0.165,0.563346171802054,POSITIVE,0.9977
113,2951429563,09/02/2019,3.0,"Bryson's travels around England in 1994 are charming and amusing. He and I share the same fondness for tacky exhibits, and tiny obscure museums, and the same layman's approach to yelling at bad architecture and city planning. We like small pockets of little-known local history, and well-organized queues. So there was quite a bit of Bryson's travels I enjoyed. The back cover blurb did not lie: there are bits of this book that are laugh-out-loud funny. And in general, Bryson's got a deft way of painting vivid pictures of places and buildings that's enjoyable and undemanding. But... he's also deeply unpleasant.In addition to the bog-standard misogyny that I've found before in Bryson's writing, in this book he also takes shots at the unemployed, the disabled, people with Parkinsons, the Chinese, Beatrix Potter, fat women (more so than regular women), hotel staff, and fast food workers. He's like a super-mean Tim Cahill. And there's this phenomenon I think we're all going to be dealing with for quite a while, in which we have to decide the ultimate merits of art created with deeply problematic viewpoints.

Bryson writes about the seven weeks he spent wandering all over Britain, using public transportation to visit mostly small, uncelebrated towns. At each stopover he finds a hotel, eats a few meals, has a few beers, and roams around town on foot, often without glancing at a map or asking for directions. His opinion of each locale seems to depend largely on the weather and the quality of the hotels, restaurants and pubs he chooses at random in whatever neighborhood is within walking distance of the bus or train station.There is some really funny stuff here, and the subject matter is of interest to an Anglophile, but the author just seems, well, irritable. He complains constantly, and he's annoyed, rather than charmed, by the eccentric people he meets. It took me a long time to finish this because I kept putting the book down, hoping that I was just in the wrong mood to appreciate it. Every time I picked it back up I would be amused for a while, and then his querulous tone would sour on me again.

Bryson excels at writing detailed & apt descriptions - and I really did enjoy his turn of phrase. Some description was really hilarious - like the bit about driving in England or the trainspotter with the interesting facial hair. I do have some concerns about some tiny bit of a mean streak - he talks about wishing to kick a tiny dog just to see how far it would fly and responds ""I hope you die soon"" to a gruff and unhelpful old man. There were more than a few of these ungracious bits that weren't really funny to me - but perhaps to someone more familiar Bryson, they might be.

He doesn't make it over to Northern Ireland but he hits all the big, and sometimes obscure spots throughout England, Wales, and Scotland. Since I usually listen to the audiobooks, I can't ever quote all the hilarious moments, but one of my favorites was when he was trying to understand the Scottish people in the bar. I'm glad I'm not the only one that hopelessly struggles to hear past accents. In all his books, it's usually the people he meets that create the most humorous situations. It's always amusing.

He also seems particularly persnickety about architectural harmony, often condemning whole neighborhoods and towns.

It was written over 20 years ago and at that time Princess Diana was still alive and from the descriptions it seems like Britain was undergoing a recession. There were a lot of empty store fronts and depressing towns that lacked employment. This book lacked the humor of A Walk in the Woods or The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid.

(Though stopping to do this does not speed up my reading progress.) This is the next best thing to spending tons of money and time to get to and walk around these cities. I'm an architecture nut, so I can just click and look at buildings indefinitely. It's also nice reading this book - which is Bryson's 1995 goodbye to England as he's about to go live in the US - knowing that in around 2005ish he moved back and lives there currently. He's really wonderful at summing up everything you love about the country and the people, while pointing out the things that make you slightly crazy. And tossing out the odd historical story here and there. Bryson can get a tad preachy at times, mainly about protecting historical architecture, which for Americans seems like a no-brainer. But then America doesn't have a vast amount of very old buildings compared to the amount of land we have, whereas in the smaller amount of space in the UK you can't toss a stone without hitting something historic. So while I'm in complete agreement about protecting historic architecture, I can see why it's a completely different problem in the UK.Bryson can also complain/whine quite a bit, but usually this is amusing, especially when he's cold and wet and uncomfortable, and in a situation most people would never get themselves into - in other words, it's mostly his own fault. Unless you're the type of person who never calls ahead to book a place to stay when traveling somewhere out of season, for example - in which case you might relate to his adventures too well. (Also the internet makes all research and booking vastly easier now than in the late 90s.)This isn't a book for historians to cite - just so you know that. Chapters aren't named or in any way set apart by name of the area where he's traveling, and there's no index or bibliography. This means that if there's a particular place or story you're looking through you have to skim the whole thing. Or use the internet.Now that I've reread the book - I'm dying to visit Edinburgh (Ch. 26-27) again. And any UK town with multiple bookstores, because I never did get enough of that.Some quotes and ponderings:p. 77: ""Selfridge was an interesting fellow who provides a salutary moral lesson for us all. An American who spent his early career at Marshall Field in Chicago, he moved to England in 1906 with the intention of building in London the greatest shopping emporium in Europe. The British thought he was mad, particularly when they learned he was to build his store on Oxford Street, far away from the main shopping areas of Knightsbridge and Kensington, but by dint of hard work and total dedication he succeeded. For years, Selfridge was a model of decorum. He led a life of stern rectitude, early bedtimes, and tireless endeavor. He drank lots of milk and never fooled around. But in 1918 his wife died and the sudden release from marital bounds rather went to his head. He took up with a pair of Hungarian-American cuties known in music hall circles as the Dolly Sisters, and fell into rakish ways. With a Dolly on each arm, he took to roaming the casinos of Europe, gambling and losing lavishly. He dined out every night, invested foolish sums in racehorses and motorcars, bought Highcliff Castle, and laid plans to build a 250-room estate at Hengistbury Head nearby. In ten swift years he raced through $8 million; lost control of Selfridge's; lost his castle and London home, his racehorses, and his Rolls-Royces; and eventually ended up living alone in a small flat in Putney and traveling by bus. He died penniless and virtually forgotten on May 8, 1947. But of course he had had the inestimable pleasure of bonking twin sisters, which is the main thing.""p. 100-101: ""A couple of miles beyond Kimmeridge, at the ar side of a monumentally steep hill, stands the little village of Tyneham, or what's left of it. In 1943, the British Army ordered Tyneham's inhabitants to evacuate the community as it wanted to practice lobbing shells into the surrounding hillsides. The villagers were solemnly assured that once Hitler was licked they could all come back. Fifty-one years later they were still waiting. Forgive my disrespectful tone, but this seems to me disgraceful, not simply because it's a terrible inconvenience to the inhabitants (especially those who might have forgotten to cancel their milk), but also for the poor sods like me who have to hope that the footpath through the firing range is open, which it is but occasionally. ...When I was last there in the late 1970s, Tyneham was forlorn, overgrown, and practically unknown - a proper little ghost town. Now the Dorset County Council has made it into something of a tourist attraction. It put up a big parking lot and restored the school and church as small museums, which rather suggests that Tyneham's abandonment is considered permanent.""[Flickr group photo pool for Tyneham, Dorset, England]p. 107, on Weymouth: ""...In 1348 it was the place where the Black Death was introduced into England, and in 1789 it became the world's first seaside resort when that tedious lunatic George III started a fashion for sea bathing there.""p. 136, Oxford: ""...Above all, I like to drink in the pubs, where you can sit with a book and not be looked on as a social miscreant...""Oddly Bryson doesn't mention Oxford's Headington Shark, which is definitely on my Must See List if I ever get to Oxford.

(And thanks to a nice photo on that wikipedia page, it's now my desktop)p. 145-146: ""The view from the top over the broad Vale of Evesham, was, as always from such points, sensational - gently undulating trapezoids of farmland rolling off to a haze of distant wooded hills. Britain still has more landscape that looks like an illustration from a children's storybook than any other country I know - a remarkable achievement in such a densely crowded and industrially minded little island. And yet I couldn't help feel that the view may have been more bucolic and rewarding ten or perhaps twenty years ago.""[Google images result for the Vale of Evesham]p 148: ""...I bought an entrance ticket to Snowshill Manor, now in the hands of the National Trust but from 1919 to 1956 the home of an eccentric character named Charles Wade, who devoted his life to accumulating a vast and unfocused assortment of stuff, some of it very good, some of it little more than junk - clavichords, microscopes, Flemish tapestries, snuff and tobacco boxes, maps and sextants, samurai armor, penny-farthing bicycles, you name it - until he had filled his house so full that there was no room left for him. He spent his last years living happily in an outbuilding, which, like the house, has been preserved as it was on the day he died.""Here's the section I reread the book to find, in its entirety. Frustratingly Bryson seems to be citing a source (""in the words of one biographer""), but then makes no mention of it.p. 166-7: ""My target was Welbeck Abbey, former home of the Portlands and reputedly one of the finest stately homes in England. The Portlands haven't lived there since 1954 on account of a similar unfortunate lack of prescience with regard to adventure playgrounds and petting zoos. The fifth Duke of Portland, one W. J. C. Scott-Bentinck (1800-1879), has long been something of a hero of mine. Old W.J.C., as I like to think of him, was one of history's great recluses and went to the most extraordinary lengths to avoid all forms of human contact. He lived in just one small corner of his stately home and communicated with his servants through notes passed to him through a special message box cut into the door to his rooms. Food was conveyed to him in the dining room by means of a miniature railway running from the kitchen. In the event of chance encounters, he would stand stock still and the servants were instructed to pass as they would a piece of furniture. Those who transgressed this instruction were compelled to skate on the Duke's private skating rink until exhausted. Sightseers were allowed to tour the house and grounds - ""so long,"" as the Duke put it, ""as you would be good enough not to see me.""For reasons that can only be guessed at, the Duke used his considerable inheritance to build a second mansion underground. At its peak, he had fifteen thousand men employed on its construction, and when completed it included, among much else, a library nearly 250 feet long and the largest ballroom in England, with space for up to two thousand guests - rather an odd thing to build if you never have guests. A network of tunnels and secret passages connected the various rooms and ran for considerable distances out into the surrounding countryside. It was as if, in the words of one biographer, ""he anticipated nuclear warfare."" When it was necessary for the Duke to travel to London, he would have himself sealed in his horse-drawn carriage, which would be driven through a tunnel one and a half miles long to a place near Worksop Station and loaded onto a special flatcar for the trip to the capital. There, still sealed, it would be driven to his London residence, Harcourt House. When the Duke died, his heirs found all of the above ground rooms devoid of furnishings except for one chamber in the middle of which sat the Duke's commode. The main hall was mysteriously floorless. Most of the rooms were painted pink. The one upstairs room in which the Duke had resided was packed to the ceiling with hundreds of green boxes, each of which contained a single dark brown wig. This was, in short, a man worth getting to know.""Bryson wanders into the grounds, past a No Entry sign, and is met by a man:p 169-170: ""...As he neared me, I could see his jacket said MOD Security. MOD is Ministry of Defense. Oh-oh.""Hello,"" I said with a big foolish smile.""Are you aware , sir, that you are trespassing on government property?""...In a small, respectful voice, I told him about my long fascination with the fifth Duke of Portland and how I had ached to see this place for years and couldn't resist just having a peep at it after coming all this way, which was exactly the right thing to do because he evidently had an affection for old W.J.C. himself. He escorted me smartishly to the edge of the property and kept up something of a bluff manner, but he seemed quietly pleased to have someone who shared his interests. He confirmed that the paved area was the skating rink and pointed out where the tunnels ran, which was pretty much everywhere. They were still sound, he told me, though they weren't used any longer except for storage. The ballroom and other underground chambers, however, were still regularly employed for functions and as a gymnasium. The MOD had just spent a million pounds refurbishing the ballroom.""What is this place anyway?"" I asked.""Training center, sir"" was all he would say, and in any case we had reached the end of the drive....I was pleased to know that the Ministry of Defense had maintained the tunnels and underground rooms, but it seemed an awful shame that the place was so formidably shut to the public. It isn't every day after all that the British aristocracy produce someone of W.J.C. Scott-Bentinck's rare and extraordinary mental loopiness, though in fairness it must be said that they give it their best shot.""File the following under ""you don't read this expressed in quite this way any more;"" after going on about bad architecture:p. 288: ""Of the buildings that I would deeply love to blow up in Britain - the Maples building in Harrowgate, the Hilton Hotel in London, the post office building in Leeds, a random selection among almost any of the structures owned by British Telecom - I have no hesitation in saying that my first choice would be either of these two.""

136,1832900098,12/19/2016,3.0,"I picked up Bill Bryson’s Notes From a Small Island expecting the same chatty, funny, slightly bitchy travel commentary that I enjoyed in his latest book, The Road to Little Dribbling. Unfortunately, every humorous, wry comment in Notes is overshadowed by Bryson’s frequent outbursts of outright dickishness and prolonged complaints. Bryson says he loves Great Britain and its people, but he is often excessively and unreasonably rude to the Britons he encounters in his travels. If he is not unpleasant verbally, he silently vents his spite in his book. This Bryson of twenty years ago is downright mean and an uncomfortable companion. This is really a 2.5 star book: more blah than not.The book starts off well enough with Bryson humorously describing how Britons give driving directions and recounting his first exposure to England (via Calais) twenty years ago. After living in England more or less continuously since arriving, Bryson and his wife have decided to move back to America so their children could experience living in another country. Before leaving, Bryson decides to embark on a six or seven week exploration of the island he’s called home. He visits cities: London, Dover, Oxford, Manchester, Liverpool, Edinburgh, Glasgow and smaller villages: Virginia Water, Cirencester, Lyme Regis, Llandudno, Ashington. Even if staying only overnight, Bryson tries to get out and explore the area and say something interesting about it (or, if there’s nothing interesting to say, he says that too). I enjoyed his difficulties with his first British landlady, Mrs. Gubbins of Dover. Bryson’s struggle to follow all of her rules and his worry about the counterpane is amusing. When he is in London, he indulges in nostalgia for his days working at The Times with very odd (and, in the case of Vince of the wire room, menacing) coworkers. I loved his story of working at the sanitorium in Virginia Water and how the patients were allowed to wander around town and the townspeople didn’t mind: “Each day you could count on finding a refreshing sprinkling of lunatics buying fags [cigarettes] or sweets, having a cup of tea, or just quietly remonstrating with thin air. The result was one of the most extraordinary communities in England, one in which wealthy people and lunatics mingled on equal terms. The shopkeepers and locals were quite wonderful about it, and didn’t act as if anything was odd because a man with wild hair wearing a pajama jacket was standing in a corner of the baker’s declaiming to a spot on the wall, or sitting at a corner table of the Tudor Rose with swiveling eyes and the makings of a smile, dropping sugar cubes into his minestrone soup” (67).Pleasant moments of Bryson’s exploration of geography and his observations of the British character are interspersed with longer passages of his complaints about shoddy modern architecture, poorly designed and badly placed shopping centers, restaurants and pubs not conveniently located (for him), and the puzzling fondness of BBC1 for Cagney & Lacey reruns. For someone who has lived in England for the greater part of his adult life, his complaints about the oddities and inadequacy of the British Rail system is weird. Did he never notice this before? At least the UK has a rail service that will take you across the country and drop you a lot of cities and villages. The United States, a large country sorely in need of a national rail service, has none. Don’t even mention Amtrak. It’s in no way comparable to the British Rail service. Bryson has a problem with overgeneralization. He’s cheerfully sexist while describing how “all women” are never prepared to pay their bill when they reach the cashier. Apparently, we all seem surprised and spend quite a bit of time searching through our purses for money or checkbooks. “All women” also don’t squeeze toothpaste tubes in the correct manner, can’t change a light bulb and bother men when they’re enjoying a long, peaceful interlude on the toilet. We’re also great with children, vomit, and freshly painted doors—hurrah for All Women! Fat People (as in All Fat People) are greedy and rapacious and dine by lowering their heads and Hoovering up anything on the plates in front of them. These particular Fat People pissed off Bryson by eating all of the best desserts off the sweet trolley. Damn those greedy fat piggy people with their chins glistening with chocolate! Old People also earn Bryson’s ire by being, well, old, and daring to express opinions on matters that differ from his opinion. It’s not that I can’t understand why he’s annoyed, it’s just that the vehemence of his annoyance borders on psychotic. So what if the old lady and her equally old husband think Americans talk funny? Jesus. Get over it, Bill. Americans (the ones who aren’t anglophiles) probably think the British talk funny. It’s Bryson’s over-the-top-nastiness in response to minor irritations that soured the book for me. While out walking around a small village, he encounters a couple walking dogs he describes as large. However, in the next sentence, they are “nipping at my dancing ankles” (99). Large dogs don’t nip at ankles. They aim much higher. When the owner arrives and attaches leashes to the dogs, he explains to Bryson that the dogs don’t like walking sticks. Bryson responds by calling the man’s wife “stupid,” accusing the “crazy” dogs of “attacking” him and, in a petty parting shot, told the dog owner that his “hat is stupid” too. Bryson tells this story as if you should be on his side. Nope, I’m really not. A brief thirty or so pages later, Bryson has a full-on crazy fit when locked out of his hotel at nine o’clock on a rainy night. So, yeah, I can understand his being miffed about this, but he’s lived in England for over twenty years! He, who delights in the eccentricities of large and small British towns, should not be surprised by this. Not only that, but because he’s such a cheap bastard, he seems to pick hotels that are more isolated and not in the city center—but they’re cheap! So his walk in a downpour to his “distant hotel” is his own fault. When the hotel proprietor finally opens the door to Bryson’s shouting and pounding, he is polite and apologetic. Bryson calls him an “imbecile,” calls the town a “godforsaken hellhole,” the hotel a “fucking dump,” and is exceedingly nasty despite the man’s apologies and offers to bring a tray of tea and sandwiches and to dry and press Bryson’s wet clothes. The next morning, Bryson is apologetic and that’s the only thing that saves him from being a complete wanker. Of course, he’s not through. Once again, his unwillingness to depart from his cash causes him problems. In Edinburgh, he treats himself to a lovely, expensive hotel. In the morning, he’s horrified to discover that breakfast is not included and expensive too! Crazy! So rather than part with £14.50 for breakfast, he bitches out the waiter and grumpily takes his leave. Edinburgh, which had previously seemed delightful to him, now was dreary and disappointing. Unable to find somewhere to eat (somewhere cheap enough probably), he goes to a McDonald’s and unleashes a torrent of viciousness on the cashier because the guy has the audacity to ask Bryson if he wants an apple turnover with his order. What an ass. Just say, no, I don’t want the apple turnover. All this grumbling and unhappiness because this man—who describes himself as being wealthy—wouldn’t part with a measly £14.50. Bryson’s pride in his skinflint ways continues as he tours the Royal Scottish Academy and complains that he’d have to buy a separate catalog of the artwork for an additional £2. Then, pissed off to discover that he couldn’t buy any artwork he liked for £50 or less, he left. Bryson is such a hypocrite. He spends so much of the book complaining about how Britain isn’t improving the rails, doesn’t keep up heritage sites, doesn’t build architecture pleasing to him, but when he’s asked to pay the cost of these things, he’s grumpy and bitchy. If he loves the country so much, as he professes he does, then cough up some money and support its institutions, you cheap wanker. As a writer, Bryson should be more sympathetic to the idea that knowledge is a wonderful thing—that education doesn’t necessarily have to be a drudge-filled means to an end, but should and can be undertaken for the pure joy of knowledge itself—of knowing something about the world in which you live. However, when visiting Oxford, he says he doesn’t know what all the intellectual toil of Oxford is for, that it’s self-indulgent, and maybe Oxford should be more practical. Well, Bryson, I would turn that around on you—are YOU practical? What purpose do your books serve? Who cares about the history of a small village in the UK? He sounds like people who hold the despicable idea that studying art and literature is a waste of time. Instead, what we need is to train people to be mere cogs in the wheels of giant corporations…yeah. Art and literature is what helps people survive their “practical” lives. It doesn’t have to be an either/or situation. You can learn a practical skill (mechanic, engineer, bookkeeper) and still be exposed to Shakespeare. It’s not crazy. Bryson also seems surprised that the lower classes would enjoy and understand art. While in the National Gallery of Scotland, he notices a man and a boy about which everything “murmured poorness and material want.” Bryson finds it heartwarming and intriguing how well-educated poor people can be, how they can appreciate art and identify plants by their Latin names. I mean, wow. It’s like poor people know how to read and visit libraries and art galleries! Non-wealthy people have intellectual curiosity and a desire for knowledge! That’s just…mind-blowing. While Notes From a Small Island is sort of a travel book, it’s not a helpful travel book. He doesn’t really give the potential UK traveler any helpful information or even a vivid image of the places he visits. I don’t consider him to be a great writer, he doesn’t have strong descriptive skills, and he never provides a damn map to go with his travels (once again, I pulled out my Great Britain map). If you want information you can actually use, see Rick Steves. While Bryson’s chatty commentary about his adoptive homeland is still engaging, it is marred by his obsessive tendencies to describe how cheap he is and be proud of it, to denigrate the towns he visits because their food or architecture isn’t up to his standards, and his outbursts of incredible dickishness. He also says Goodness me! a lot and it’s annoying as shit. I’m surprised that he visited Chepstow and couldn’t be bothered to visit the castle or nearby Tintern Abbey (both amazing) or say anything about the delightful Welsh village. This book left me with a sourness towards Bryson and I think it’ll be a while before I read him again. ",4,0.9956,0.108,0.76,0.132,0.5690409309791337,NEGATIVE,0.9787
137,1772418978,10/21/2016,1.0,"I've read quite a few of Bill Bryson's books. This is the first one I didn't really enjoy and I'm sad to say that.I picked this one up, quite appropriately, I thought, during my honeymoon to the UK. There was something marvelous about reading about traveling in the UK while doing so myself, particularly when the Welsh town of Lladudno makes a brief appearance. We stayed there for a few days and it was quite lovely, so it was a thrill to see it get mentioned. Bryson is a witty writer and at his best, his observations earn laughs or at least smiles.However.I'm not sure if it's because this was one of his earliest books and he refined his style or if it's because he was just in a bad mood during a lot of these journeys or if he mellowed out later with age, but the Bryson in this book is . . . well, mean. He seems like a jerk. There were exchanges earlier in the book that made me wince a little bit, but I wrote down the exact moment he lost me:(view spoiler)[From Chapter 26:In the end, fractious and impatient, I went into a crowded McDonald's, waited ages in a long, shuffling line, which made me even more fractious and impatient, and finally ordered a cup of coffee and an Egg McMuffin.""Do you want an apple turnover with that?"" asked the young man who served me.I looked at him for a moment. ""I'm sorry,"" I said, ""do I appear to be brain-damaged?""""Pardon?""""Correct me if I'm wrong, but I didn't ask for an apple turnover, did I?""""Uh, . . . no.""""So do I look as if I have some mental condition that would render me unable to request an apple turnover if I wanted one?""""No, it's just that we're told to ask everyone, like.""""What, you think everyone in Edinburgh is brain-damaged?""""We're just told to ask everyone, like.""""Well, I don't want an apple turnover, which is why I didn't ask for one. Is there anything else you'd like to know if I don't want?""""We're just told to ask everyone.""""Do you remember what I do want?""He looked in confusion at his cash register. ""Uh, an Egg McMuffin and a cup of coffee.""""Do you think I might have it this morning or shall we talk some more?""""Oh, uh, right, I'll just get it.""""Thank you."" (hide spoiler)]Where do I even start? He complains about the kid behind the counter wasting his time, when he was the one that prompted the ridiculous exchange by being an asshole in the first place. A simple ""no, thank you"" to the question would have had him right along on his way.We all have bad days. I get that. And he notes before and after this passage that he was feeling ""fractious."" But here's the thing. I've been that teenage kid, working a shitty entry job that I didn't want to do, because I needed to be able to afford to drive myself to school. I've had stupid corporate requirements and disinterested managers force me to use scripts, force me to pitch things that I knew customers didn't want, forced me to upsell, etc. I know that this isn't the kid's fault. And anyone who's been on the other side of that cash register knows it, too. If you've ever worked food service or retail or any other job where you're the public face, you know that the guy or girl at that register has no power. They don't make any of these decisions. Why upbraid them, except to make them feel worse and to make yourself feel better? Everyone knows this, except, apparently, for Bryson. But all I felt after reading this passage was a reminder of all the goddamn times a customer has been an asshole to me over the years and how much it sucks, how much it ruins the rest of your day, and how much you despise people that do that to you. A simple ""no, thank you"" would get everyone on with the rest of their day. Hell, if you really felt the need to make a point, ask to talk to a shift manager, who only has slightly more power than the poor kid, but at least there's a chance they have some control over it (although, having been the shift manager too, I can say that it's unlikely).Here's the thing. It's only a few pages and it comes towards the end of the book. But were this a fiction novel, this would be a character defining moment. This is the sort of thing that shows us who a person is, by how he treats his perceived lessers. And this, compared with earlier comments, makes me feel as though Bryson is a mean person, a jerk, the kind of tourist I cringe when I see, the kind of person who would embarrass the hell out of me doing exactly this kind of thing, all because he feels so fucking smart that he has to point out all the little bits of bullshit in the world around him, when the rest of us just want to get through that bullshit as intact as possible, without breaking character.Fortunately, his later books don't cast Bryson as this much of a churl, but rarely have I been so turned off in a book such as this. Skip this one. Read his other, better work. How the hell this chapter made it past his editor is beyond me.",4,-0.9963,0.115,0.822,0.063,0.5157750979179551,NEGATIVE,0.9984
138,1565021563,02/29/2016,3.0,"I will caveat my review by first saying I am decidedly an Anglophile. I like anything from the United Kingdom and Ireland. If something has even a hint of British, Irish, Scottish, Welsh, James Bond, Harry Potter, Top Gear, Premier league football, pubs, or Sherlock Holmes, I'm in. Ok, not One Direction or Spice Girls, I am a bit of a music snob. Or their food, it is not my first choice. Google Jim Gaffigan's bit about ketchup. You can thank me later. But other than that, I am more than mildly interested in a book about traveling around the old country. Heck, I have even been known to watch British Parliament on C-Span (its way smarter than our government and more entertaining by far).My husband, who is a Bryson fan, warned me this is not his best work. As I read through, I imagined Notes was written by either Statler or Waldorf (the old guys on the Muppets) while they were still middle aged, had not found their jeering soul mate, nor had they hit their full sarcastic stride. Bryson has a dry British-ish wit, but not that biting. I also alternately imagined the book being read by Stephen Fry, any of the boys from Top Gear (especially during the driving bits), or Patrick Stewart. That made the experience more enjoyable to say the least. Bryson wrote the book in 1995, so I had to constantly remind myself that the internet had yet to be the thing it is today. I was consistently frustrated as he meandered and got lost or visited another place that was closed or boring. Does he not know about google, trip advisor, foursquare? Oh right, those were not around yet. There were not iPods yet . There is something romantic about Bryson just wandering into cities on a whim, gambling on a hotel of some sort (probably losing) and then hiking near and far. I have also traveled a fair bit by myself, and throughout the book felt a longing to take a trip soon. There is entirely too much about malls and sad buildings made of concrete in the 60s and 70s. Part of the appeal of the book is he has no plan, but it would be a more engaging book if he had a plan. I found much of the book wanting in specifics. While trying to dabble in travel book and writing a love letter to the United Kingdom, I feel like Mr. Bryson never really achieves a good version of either. Is he on an extended business trip and is forced to give a long review? There is too much talk about small hotel rooms and the Indian food he has before an early evening. He throws out enough history that we know he is knowledgeable, but I'm never really quite satisfied with the few specifics he provides. Bryson's writing does shine through the subject. There are points when I laughed out loud and had to read a few passages out loud to my husband. For example:""In the morning, I was roused early by my alarm clock and rose reluctantly, for I having my favourite dream - the one where I own a large, remote island, not unlike those off this section of the Scottish coast, to which I invite carefully selected people, like the guy who invented the Christmas tree light that go out when one bulb blows, the person in charge of escalator maintenance at Heathrow Airport, nearly anyone who has ever written a user's manual for a personal computer, and of course John Selwyn Grummer, let them loose with a very small amount of survival rations, and then go out with braying dogs and mercilessly hunt them down - but then, I remembered that I had a big exciting day in front of me."" Yes, that is one long sentence, but who has not thought of a handful of people they would want to hunt down with braying dogs. And he uses the English spelling of ""favourite."" So cute. While I cannot recommend this book to first time Bryson readers specifically, I can recommend Bryson overall. I think A Walk in the Woods is in my reading queue (see what I did there) and that would be a better place to start. As I read, I will imagine he sounds like Hagrid and he acts like a proper British version of Drunk Uncle from SNL. I also cannot help but plan a trip to Britain or Ireland in the near future.",4,0.978,0.071,0.822,0.107,0.4381949531949531,NEGATIVE,1.0
139,385174363,08/06/2012,2.0,"Notes from a Small Island: http://readwithstyle.wordpress.com/20...In two months I will say goodbye to the UK after having spent nearly 3 years here. To say that I am sad will be an exaggeration. However, to say that I will not miss it is just plainly unfair. After all, the UK has taught me several important life lessons, which I will never forget soon:1. How to pass an exam, when you haven’t attended a single lecture and you have two days to learn everything2. Yes, it is possible to be rainy and windy 364 days of the year.3. Never be surprised when a total stranger calls you “love” or “mate”.4. “Cheers” is the ultimate word. It can substitute absolutely anything you want to say.5. Cider is cheep and fairly disgusting6. Burger&Chips CAN be a national dish.7. You can always start smoking after you have successfully passed the “wanna be” phase of your life (in my case you can start smoking not at 13 but at 20).If you feel a sense of bitterness, irony, and sarcasm…well you are absolutely right. To be honest, I don’t only have bad memories from my time here. Of course, I am now expected to share that my life abroad has made me more responsible, more organized, and more self-sufficient. Well, it did. It is quite obvious. Leaving the comfort of your home behind, where your mum and dad take care of every disgusting chore and moving on to live by yourself, having to learn how to cook, wash your clothes, manage your finances, etc will ultimately transform you from a careless teen into a mature individual. It is not the UK that did this. It is merely the living abroad, which could have happened in exactly every other country.However, I have two things to be thankful to the UK. Firstly, I started this blog here. I realized how much I love books and how much pleasure dedicating time to reading and writing gives me. Secondly, I realized I want to write a book about my life (I wouldn’t have anything to write about if it wasn’t for the UK but that is another issue). So, England, this is my big thank you for releasing my literary talent and for giving it a subject to write about.Maybe sensing my feelings towards his home country, my flatmate provided me with a book to change my opinion (or at least attempt to do so). After spending nearly 20 years on the island, Bill Bryson (a born American) is about to leave it for good and move to live with his family in the US. Feeling nostalgia, the author decides to take a journey around the fields of England starting from the south and finishing in the north. Bryson enters the UK through Dover, the same way he did in the distant 1970s and starts a trip, visiting not only every major UK city, but also going to relatively unknown places and villages. The book is funny, entertaining, and clever. It is not merely a trip through the fields of UK, it is a trip through a whole life time. There is as much about England and its miracles as about Bryson and his life. The author is sarcastic and funny; his elaboration on the Britons and on their island is straight to the point. The author not only describes the absolutely astonishing parts of England; he also attempts to draw a rather comprehensive picture of its public face. What are the key characteristics of the Britons? What made them so? What transformed some prosperous industrial towns into deserted and isolated places? What makes the green green grass of the UK so lovable? Bryson answers all of these answers from his own perspective, as an immigrant for almost 20 years. His imagination, sense of humour, and wittiness make Notes from a Small Island more than a road trip book. They actually make it a guide to understanding England. When I read it, I kept thinking “This is absolutely the way it is”.Read more: http://readwithstyle.wordpress.com/20...",4,0.9975,0.042,0.815,0.143,0.5523809523809523,NEGATIVE,0.9993
140,1699743801,07/16/2016,3.0,"Bill Bryson's journey through and homage to the British Isles has attained fairly mythical levels of fame and renown. It's the kind of book that you've heard anecdotally from numerous friends and family who've read it and retold it's funny little set pieces. That doesn't stop it being funny. Bryson can tease a laugh out of anything. He has a knack for the snappy one-liner as well as the killer punchline (the unflushed turd being the best example of his wit) and Note from a Small Island does make you laugh out loud constantly. Part of that is due to your empathy with Bryson, your own nostalgia and understanding of the eccentricities of Britain, and kind of head shaking, quiet chuckling, laughing alone as he outlines the beauty and nobility of Brits in a queue, or softly takes the piss out of dull English biscuits that he can't help but love. Part of it is due to a talent for humour and observation. Bryson is, first and foremost, a superlative observer of people and places.But Notes from a Small Island is a strange travelogue. He goes up the country through places famous and unknown, through towns and countryside, without the aid of a car, aiming for John O' Groats. The pattern is very repetitive and does grow boring - visit a dull town and complain about the terrible post-War architecture and shopping streets that have ruined the idyllic post-War buildings, then escape to the countryside for a bit of over the top eulogising on the sheer uniqueness and perfection of the English countryside. Neither of those points I would argue with, but in some ways Bryson's commentary on Britain is rather limited to those two topics. Within them he discovers some fascinating things - comparisons of places like Bradford and Saltaire, for example, are very interesting, and he manages to balance his critiques of Britain's ugly towns by always finding something of value that remains. His romps in the countryside are adventurous; he is always looking for hidden treasures, like the Roman mosaic he stumbles upon.One can't help but be a bit cynical about the audience Bryson is aiming for. It works of course, his books sell like hot cakes. One could say that's because of the universality of his voice and his humour. Or is could be because he targets Middle England with Robin Hood precision. There is nothing dangerous in his journey, nothing that might upset or cause conflict. Britain is dissed and mocked, but only lightly, in a way the British would appreciate it. And whenever it is critiqued, Bryson balances it out with some very dramatic praise. At times it's hard to stomach - waxing lyrical about the booming harbour years at Liverpool without mentioning the slave trade, or praising England first for having such a marvelous Empire and then for so benevolently dismantling it - a statement that perhaps some parts of the British Empire might like to content with.As an ode to Britain it has more nostalgia than Tolkien for days gone by. It's not that I doubt Bryson's love for the place. It's not that I don't agree with him on many things, the dreariness of British towns, the cloning of its shopping streets, the beauty of its countryside. But as the journey goes on, it's hard not to get a little jaded with the monotony, like an old man going on and on and not always seeing the bigger picture. 6",4,0.9931,0.107,0.72,0.173,0.5352107728337236,POSITIVE,0.8642
141,1816869009,11/20/2016,4.0,"Review title: Small island, big placeI've spent a total of 9 months on two different work assignments in England over the last six years, and reading Bryson's cross country ramble has convinced me of two things. First, that I want to read his second recently-published ramble on ""The Road to Little Dribbling."" After all, much has happened in the world and Britain in the twenty-plus years since Notes; that's nearly a generation of change for good (better railroads, more sensitive conservation of history and architecture, an economic recovery in many parts) and bad (more traffic and skyrocketing real estate anywhere near London, more ugly modern architecture at the expense of history and architecture, worsening economic stagnation in other parts). It will be interesting to read what he makes of the progress or regression, and see how much of the country is recognizable from my time there about the same period he was writing this follow up. And second, if given the opportunity for new job assignments there, I will gladly go back. Like Bryson, although for much shorter stints, I find living and working in a place is much different, and better, than visiting a place as a tourist. You understand not just the breathless rush of sightseeing the things tourists do, but the daily humdrum of existence that goes with living in a place: the annoyance of bad weather, shopping for groceries, finding a place to get a haircut and get dry cleaning done. Bryson, an American college student, entered the United Kingdom in 1973, found work and a wife, and stayed for 22 years. Now, in 1995, before he moves his family to the United States, he decided to recreate his entry from Calais to Dover and spend seven weeks exploring the country, making his way northward with no set itinerary, few advance reservations, no car, and just a backpack of essentials. Walking, riding railways and busses, and renting a car in just two places trains can't take him on, he zigzags on his way and writes about the good and bad of his adopted home. Much of it is funny, some poignant, serious, or even angry. It is always entertaining. He has a way of puncturing the inflated ego or arrogant assumption, but usually in the genial way of an outsider who is at the same time a careful observer. When he criticizes, it is done with pointed but not painful humor, and those things he finds positive he praises, sometimes with gentle humor but always with genuine love and respect for the people, places, language, culture, and idiosyncrasies of that small island. I was reminded of a running (usually) friendly debate I started with a casual question for two coworkers, one British and one German: is the UK a part of Europe? The German, with a hearty laugh, would always argue ""Of course not"", while the British coworker would with classic self depreciation and conciliatory waffling sometimes argue both ways. As Bryson put it, his British friends were always surprised when he would point out that Bournemouth on the south central coast was closer to Cherbourg than to London, and express gentle shock when shown the proof on a map. Indeed, no matter how close to any other place, England stands all on its own, and the world is better for it. Bryson helps us understand and appreciate that special relationship with the world and its history. ",4,0.9934,0.084,0.758,0.158,0.423938223938224,POSITIVE,0.7704
142,80103065,12/06/2009,3.0," Last summer I was reading one of Fabio Volo’s witty love stories,""IL GIORNO IN PIU' "", and I discovered that all around the world there are nice cafés called Starbucks where you can comfortably sit and just have coffee – especially long American coffee, big mugs of it – reading, writing, or just looking around for hours if you like. The atmosphere he described was so inviting I heartly wished to go to one of those cafeterias somewhere in the world some day. It came true and I found myself alone in a Starbuck’s café in London about 3 weeks ago during the Easter holidays. Why am I telling you about that? Because I read part of the book I want to tell you about just in that place, for 2 hours, sipping a very huge quantity of English/American coffee. I was sitting there alone waiting - unlike Fabio Volo who was waiting for a beautiful Italian girl in New York to make her a surprise- for my husband and son who were visiting the Stanford Bridge, the stadium of the Chelsea football club. So, all alone there, I spent some time leafing through Bill Bryson’s NOTES FROM A SMALL ISLAND, which I finally completed last night. It was odd to read this travel book about England, written by an American journalist/writer, while I was an Italian tourist visiting London for some days… After nearly two decades in Britain, Bill Bryson, took the decision to move back to the States for a while, to let his kids experience life in another country, to give his wife the chance to shop until 10 p.m. seven nights a week, and, most of all, because he had read that 3.7 million Americans believed that they had been abducted by aliens at one time or another, and it was thus clear to him that his people needed him (!)Bill Bryson is considered a master of witty prose and indeed he made me amile more than once and laugh out loud even at some of his humorous anecdotes. He tells about his last trip around Britain before leaving his much-loved home in North Yorkshire, a sort of valedictory tour of the green and kindly island that had so long been his home. His aim was to take stock of the nation's public face and private parts and to analyse what precisely it was he loved so much about a country which had been home to him for so long.A short excerpt from pp. 98-99 of 1995 edition:""One of the charms of the British is that they have so little idea of their own virtues, and nowhere is this more true than with their happiness. You will laugh to hear me say it, but they are the haappiest people on earth. Honestly. Watch any two Britons in conversation and see how long it is before they smile or laugh over some joke or pleasantry. It won't be more than a few seconds. (...) I used to be puzzled by the curious British attitude to pleasure, and that tireless, dogged optimism of theirs that allowed them to attach an upbeat turn of phrase to direct inadequacies - 'well, it makes a change', 'mustn't grumble', 'you could do worse','it's not much, but it's cheap and cheerful', 'it's quite nice REALLY' - but gradually I came round to their way of thinking and my life has never been happier. I remember myself sitting in damp clothes in a cold café on a dreary seaside promenade and being presented a cup of tea and a teacake and going 'Oooh, lovely!', and I knew the process had started"".",4,0.9939,0.033,0.843,0.124,0.4843006993006992,POSITIVE,0.9922

I was interrupted by a young British man in an expensive-looking suit who asked me what I was reading. I turned the cover towards him. ""Oh, Small Island,"" he said. ""I've not heard of that. I thought it might be Notes from a Small Island by Bill Bryson.""""Bill Bryson?""""Yes, an American author from, I don't know how to pronounce it exactly, Des Moines, Iowa.""He had pronounced it exactly as you might if you'd only read the city's name, sounding the ""s"" in ""Des"" and the ""es"" in ""Moines.""""It's Des Moines,"" I said. ""Terribly sorry,"" he said. And then he quickly shifted the subject.""Are you particularly interested in classical music?"" he asked. ""Yeah, I like it fair enough.""""Did you come tonight for anything in particular?""""Yeah,"" I said. ""I'm looking forward to Beethoven's Eighth.""""Looking forward?"" He asked. ""Yes,"" I said, hesitatingly.""You mean the one they just played?""""Oh, was that Beethoven's eighth?""The man tried to hold a straight face, but I could see the sliest chuckle breaking at the corner of his mouth. ""Yes, the orchestra just finished playing Beethoven's Eighth.""""Hmmm . . ."" I said. It had been a twenty-minute piece of music and I hadn't recognized a single note, hadn't even realized it was Beethoven. I blushed, realizing I'd exposed my full ignorance.""Terribly sorry, terribly sorry."" He said. And then he stood up, walked off to use the restroom or purchase concessions, and didn't return. *The aftertaste of embarrassment from the Albert Hall blunder caused me to look up Bill Bryson when I got back to American, and I'm glad I did. Every book I've read of his, except for this one about his travels around England, has been nothing short of exceptional. This one? It's just too repetitive. Bryson travels via train to several small towns around England and he details, in every instance, his time alone at pubs and his time alone in hotel rooms. Well, that gets boring. Not to mention that this book is the most crass of the stuff I've read from Bryson. (The blurb on the back uses the euphemism ""irreverent."") It's overkill; it gets tiring. If Bryson weren't such a master of the sentence I'd say to avoid this one altogether. On second thought, I'd still say to avoid this one altogether.Read The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid instead. No book has made me laugh harder. It's the only book I've ever read that caused me to stifle my face with my arm to keep from bursting out in uncontrolled giggles in a public library.

While this book was a well-written and accurate depiction of Bryson's extensive traipse through England, I have to say... it was painful. I slogged through it in much the same fashion that Bryson makes his way through the foggy countryside.My biggest problem with this book? Bryson is a bit of a hypocrite. He spends page after page discussing how boring his fellow travelers are. He dreads being caught in discussion with a train spotting pensioneer who goes on at length about rivets and engines. Bryson seems oblivious to the fact that he, himself, resembles Buzz Killington more than a little. He praises the politeness of the English people and yet relays his dressing down of a poor McDonald's employee who dared to ask if he wanted an apple pie. Well, he is an American in England- but STILL!I very much enjoyed Bryson's description of Liverpool (""They were having a festival of litter when I arrived. Citizens had taken time off from their busy activities to add ice cream wrappers, empty cigarette boxes and plastic carrier bags to the otherwise bland and neglected landscape"") True.

Various towns, villages and major cities are on his itinerary throughout England, Wales and Scotland. He describes the people, their habits, manners and speech, and makes incisive and often humorous observations about the architecture of the major office and apartment buildings.	He discusses the London Underground Maps displayed on the walls of stations and how they portray only relative locations instead of actual distances. He gives an example of how someone can take an extensive journey through many different places and wind up in almost the same spot.	Bryson comments on the the English and how they queue up in patient and orderly ways for long lines at sporting events such as rugby or tennis at Wimbledon. He also visits Stonehenge and marvels at the efforts that must have been marshaled to gather some 600 citizens and drag a fifty-ton stone across eighteen miles of countryside. Once at the Waterloo station, he learns that his train has been delayed because of a fire at another station. He sees a man with a long red beard, waiting patiently for the tracks to be cleared. Bryson asks the gentleman if he’s been waiting long and the fellow answers, “I was clean shaven when I arrived here.”	Towards the end of the book, he reports an encounter with a young worker at a McDonald’s restaurant in Edinburgh. The fellow asks Bryson if he wants an apple turnover with his Egg McMuffin and our author gets all huffy about it, saying that if he wanted one he’d ask for it.

I often pick up books I've been eyeing for a while but never got around to buying or by authors I've heard of or liked in the past. Notes from a Small Island is one such. I am pretty sure I have read one of his other books but I am not certain which. This fit with my current mania for travel books. To summarize, Bryson is moving to the US after a long spell in England. He decides to travel the country by public transport and on foot as a way of saying his good-byes. He clearly loves England so why return to the States? ""I had recently read that 3.7 million Americans, according to a Gallup poll, believed that they had been abducted by aliens at one time or another, so it was clear that my people needed me."" Also his wife needed a few years of being able to shop until 10 PM seven days a week.  His entire trip continues in that vein. He picks places to visit based on their historical value or on whether the next train is going there. On his rambles he sees many lovely sites and manages to rant about many other less attractive ones. In fact, nearly every town, according to Bryson has been desecrated by some ugly modern architecture.  At times Bryson is deeply funny, at others a bit sophomoric in his humor. Some jokes run a bit too much in to the bodily fluids for my taste. On the other hand, I found the book, a great read. It made me want to book a flight to London and hit the road or trail immediately. It also made me want to consult a map or two to place the various locales he visited.

This is about traveling through Britain circa mid-90's -- the good, the bad, the ugly. An American who married an Englishwoman, he'd lived in England a good many years at that point, and was doing a farewell tour before uprooting the family and going to live in America for a few years -- Hanover, New Hampshire, to be exact. Currently he's Chancellor at Durham University -- and I wonder if the kind words he says about Durham in the book made them think of him when they were looking for a new chancellor. He travels by train and by foot, and only occasionally by car. He has a funny run-in with a train enthusiast, and stays in hotels and guesthouses by turns grand and dingy. He clearly loves Britain and in the manner of those you love, finds it equally infuriating. He rails against the stupidity of planning commissions who approve the tearing down of everything old and beautiful and replacing it with all that is concrete, ugly, and disfunctional. This is the Bryson book that made the BBC's list of 100 must read books: I quite liked it, but enjoyed ""neither here nor there"" - about traveling through Europe a bit more. Probably because I've been to more places in Europe than in Britain. But he goes to places in Britain that I've never heard of, and travels to Wales and Scotland -- going to the northernmost end of Scotland.

He hits well-known spots like London, Blackpool and Glasgow, little-known towns such as Bradford, Morecambe and Truso, and places like John o'Groats which only exist as tourist attractions. Along the way, he bemoans architectural monstrosities and jerks with cell phones and lovingly exposes all the quintessential British quirks and foibles.There were times when Bill had me laughing so hard that I was wiping tears from my eyes - when he described his first encounters with human life in Dover in 1973, when he discussed the oddities of British television, when he made fun of Scottish accents, and pretty much anytime he met up with or even thought about his family.

It makes sense, since he lived in England for so long, that a book about exploring Great Britain would be more personal than historical, but there is very little insight into the history of any of the wonderful British cities and places he visits, which is something I was looking forward to. I went to some of the places he visited this summer (which is why I decided to pick up this book now) and granted he was travelling during winter (which I get, the cold sucks!), but at times, the tone was just a bit off-putting because while he loves Britain and made it his home for so long, there are lots of parts in the middle where you forget this based on his random diatribes about people on trains or how things used to be (a recurring theme throughout). As for an exploration of Great Britain, there are lots of English cities visited, but Scotland (and also Wales but I care less about Wales as I haven't been there) is delegated to the end and not done proper justice- I might be a bit biased as Edinburgh (in summer) is my favorite city, and I was disappointed with how unexceptional he made such a magical city seem. I still really enjoyed parts of this book immensely, but if you're looking to recommend Bill Bryson to a friend, start them off with In a Sunburned Country if they want a travel book or A Short History of Nearly Everything (if they like history and science) or The Life & Times of the Thunderbolt Kid (if they like memoirs and you want to really endear them to Bryson.)

While I enjoyed this, I actually think I liked his follow up better. I can't explain why except for the fact that perhaps Bryson had been in the U.K. so long that some of the British politeness rubbed off on him. In the 2015 follow-up, he reverted back to being an impatient American which made him funnier.That's not to say there were not some interesting and obscure stories connected to the places he visited which were certainly off the beaten path. And it was kind of fascinating to see the beginnings of the discontent that would fuel Brexit 20 years later (he visits a lot of declining seaside resorts which were once bustling with coal miners on holiday).There was one thing that drove me crazy though, when he visited Manchester and observed that ""nobody famous really came from here.""

I found his descriptions of the landscape to be compelling, painting vivid mental imagery. The narrative was frequently repetitive: Bryson arrives in town X, finds substandard accommodations for the evening, reflects on how the town's glory days are long past, observes how the modern buildings are far uglier than the old ones they replaced, then finds comfort in the basic decency of its people and British-ness of the town. The parts I enjoyed least were of the ""this town isn't something I personally like, so I can't see how anyone would like it, so I'm going to feel superior to it and its inhabitants"" sort, and I didn't care for those.After reading and enjoying other Bryson volumes, I was really looking forward to this one, and I was sad to find this one to be a mixed bag.

He winds his way through town after town, describing his method of travelling, his choice of hotel, his every meal and his every stroll through city streets, criticizing the decline of the art of arcitechture and so on and so forth, to the point where everything becomes .. stale. It seems like the author himself almost turned on autopilot at some point, and just left it on for the rest of the journey, and it started dragging so much towards the end that I found myself struggling to muster enough enthusiasm to actually finishing it. I did, though, and was rewarded for it, because one of the more touching moments of the book is in the very end when he comes home to his beloved Yorkshire valley.The author clearly knows his prose, and his humourously wry way of writing can make for a very funny read, alhtough it sometimes falls flat, like the author is trying too hard.

While parts had me actually cackling outloud, I'd say those parts are pretty few and far between.

My father in law was a big fan of Bill Bryson; he read this book and another about England before going there, and the book about Australia that Bryson wrote-and enjoyed them all. This book did not disappoint in that regard as Bryson is an engaging and humorous writer who understands his subject. The book is a great introduction to Britain, with discussion about the major cities and even more about the countryside and visits to villages like Farley Wallop and Titsey, with ruminations on Britons like Shakespeare and Robert Burns, the Queen Mother and Winston Churchill, and on British words for items such as zebra crossing (cross walk). The book was written in 1995, with observations about Thatcherism and Princess Diana somewhat dated, but the discussions of British history, geology, and psychology are timeless and applicable now My biggest disappointment with this book was that so little of it was devoted to Scotland. Bryson did not get to Scotland until Chapter 24, something I could not know while reading an audiobook. The Scotland portion focused on Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness and Aberdeen and not much else. I am an Anglophile so I love anything about Britain but Britain includes Scotland and I was disappointed that more of the book was not devoted to Scotland",4,0.9724,0.032,0.829,0.138,0.4491666666666667,POSITIVE,0.901

So yes, I know what a counterpane is.Despite his obvious affection for England he seems grumpier than usual perhaps because this was his farewell tour of the island before he returned to the states (although he subsequently returned in 2003 and presently lives in Norfolk). Even his hatred of tedious train enthusiasts became... well tedious in itself. I also found that there wasn't much reference to important historical events, perhaps having lived in Britain for so long he was too close to his subject to look at it from a fresh angle? He hit the nail on the head when he said Bradford existed to make everywhere else look good! I was pleased that he visited Saltaire and Exeter but I wished he had written more about Oxford and the Cotswolds as they were the two places that captivated me the most. He delights in the strange so maybe they weren't weird enough for him. He did what most people seem to do especially the English media and almost ignored Wales. The tales of his early career in journalism were amusing. The story about the Earl of Portland convinced me that a book on great British eccentrics would be my thing. In conclusion, I didn't enjoy this book as much as some of his other travel books. I think in this case he was too close to his subject.",4,0.9754,0.04,0.813,0.146,0.4803763440860215,NEGATIVE,0.9998
159,9528007,11/25/2007,5.0,"Downloaded from Audible.comNarrator: Bill BrysonPublisher: Bantam Doubleday Dell Audio, 1999Length: 6 hours (abridged)Publisher's SummaryAfter nearly 2 decades in Britain, Bill Bryson, the acclaimed author of such best sellers as The Mother Tongue, Made in America, and A Walk in the Woods, decided it was time to move back to the United States for a while. This was partly to let his wife and kids experience life in Bryson's homeland - and partly because he had read that 3.7 million Americans believed that they had been abducted by aliens at one time or another. It was thus clear to him that his people needed him.But before leaving his much-loved home in North Yorkshire, Bryson insisted on taking one last trip around Britain, a sort of valedictory tour of the green and kindly island that had so long been his home. His aim was to take stock on modern-day Britain, and to analyze what he loved so much about a country that had produced Marmite, zebra crossings, and place names like Farleigh Wallop, Titsey, and Shellow Bowells.With characteristic wit and irreverence, Bill Bryson presents the ludicrous and the endearing in equal measure. The result is a hilarious social commentary that conveys the true glory of Britain.",4,0.9698,0.026,0.845,0.129,0.4225490196078431,POSITIVE,0.9975

Bryson's observations of people and places seem trite and sometimes mean-spirited, perhaps because he seemed to spend more time on trains and in hotel rooms than actually visiting anywhere or talking to anyone. I'm amazed that he spent 7 weeks traveling for this project -- it feels like he could have seen as much in 2. I also generally disliked his voice -- he alternated between sounding more English than the English and playing the bemused outsider when it suited. The best bits were his recollections of his early years in the UK -- I wish he'd just written about his memories and experiences living there for 20-odd years and skipped the tour entirely, since it didn't seem to add much.If you're interested in reading a truly funny book about English people that delves into and beyond the stereotypes, you can't do better than Kate Fox's ""Watching the English"". For a travelogue of the UK, Paul Theroux might be a better choice.

So we get a lot of ""society has gone downhill"" grumbling, along with the requisite ""boy this rain is annoying"" grumbling and the ""i don't much like this town"" grumbling. Makes it hard to see why he stayed there for 20 years. Actually, i do believe he loves the country, and since this book was written just before he & his family were to move to the US, a lot of his negativity probably came from knowing he was leaving ""home"". but did that make it fun for me to read? not so much as i had hoped.i'm not giving up on Mr. Bryson just yet; I still want to read A Short History of Nearly Everything (just waiting for it to come out in paperback) but it does make me want to find another book that lets me revel in my Anglophility...",4,0.942,0.067,0.807,0.126,0.4316666666666667,NEGATIVE,0.9999

I almost expected him to mention the birthplace of my great, great grandmother Isabella Pygott in Swinefleet, particularly as Bryson was in the Yorkshire area at the time I also loved his comments about the British personality, for apologizing for everything even when not their fault, it is so true and I'm prone to it myself. As for his trip around the country, he didn't go for the things I would want to take in; Penzance, Stratford upon Avon, King's Lynn, druid forts, celtic ruins.

It produced frequent laughs out loud, yet told me a lot about Great Britain. Bryson, who lived and worked in England for 20 years, has insights that should be reliable, except for the fact that the book was written in 1995 and the additional fact that he just may exaggerate a bit for comic effect. It is a good mash-up of exasperation with and love for British priorities and ways.

For his entire farewell journey, Bryson generalizes, complains, insults fat people, and seems surprised by the rain. He dislikes all local architecture, restaurant choices, pedestrian accessibility, shopping malls and expensive inns. He seems to want England to fit into his ideal of England rather than being itself. Did he ask the USA if they want him back? I keep trying Bryson books although I usually find them disappointing. The blurb used the word 'uproarious' which doesn't match my experience at all. This is travel book of England without a map (none in my ebook edition) which essentially made his travels meaningless. If perhaps someone wanted to come to their own opinion about these quirky villages and towns, it would be almost impossible to copy his path. Perhaps that was by design.In some ways, Bryson is ahead of the times with his low carbon footprint, as he takes the bus and train everywhere rather than driving alone, and, in his pre-pandemic social distancing, since he seems to refuse to talk with locals unless giving his food order. He generally thinks that people are not worth talking to since only the crazy ones will give you the time of day and then pester you with trivialities.

293,111577349,07/14/2010,5.0,"""After nearly two decades in Britain, Bill Bryson took the decision to move back to the States for a while, to let his kids experience life in another country, to give his wife the chance to shop until 10 p.m. seven nights a week, and, most of all, because he had read that 3.7 million Americans believed that they had been abducted by aliens at one time or another, and it was thus clear to him that his people needed him.But before leaving his much-loved home in North Yorkshire, Bryson insisted on taking one last trip around Britain, a sort of valedictory tour of the green and kindly island that had so long been his home. His aim was to take stock of the nation's public face and private parts (as it were), and to analyse what precisely it was he loved so much about a country that had produced Marmite, a military hero whose dying wish was to be kissed by a fellow named Hardy, place names like Farleigh Wallop, Titsey and Shellow Bowells, people who said 'Mustn't grumble', and Gardeners' Question Time.""Please permit me a short aside to explain picking up this book. For the last week or so I have been travelling - first to the States and then to France. On my flight out to the States I read Bill Bryson's Notes From a Big Country, helping to immerse myself in the culture of the country I was visiting. To celebrate my return home, I decided to book-end my trip with his Notes From a Small Island to prepare myself for coming back to our green and pleasant land.As you can no doubt tell from the publisher's blurb on the back of the book, Bill Bryson takes a very irreverent look at England and the people who inhabit it. The humour is of a gentle teasing nature, however, and it is clear that Bryson has an enormous fondness for the country he is leaving.The nature of the book is distinctly episodic, as Bryson uses public transport to take him to various locations around the country. Some of the places he visits are very personal to him (the only reason for some of them featuring in a book supposedly meant to represent England). These interludes are interesting and often funny, but don't add a great deal for someone who is reading this book to gain an impression of England. He skips some regions entirely - the Midlands really don't get a look in, which is sad considering there are such lovely towns and cities littering the middle of England.I would also take issue with some of his complaints. If he tells us once, he tells us one hundred times that he feels the town centres have not been developed with any sensitivity to the original buildings. I happen to agree with his point, but sometimes this is all he mentions about a couple of the locations he visits. I would have liked to hear more about the special features of these places - this is loosely supposed to be a travel guide after all! And Bryson's mood on the day that he arrives does tend to influence his opinion of the city unduly.If you take on board these criticisms, then the book is a very pleasant, easy read with some wonderful flashes of humour. In fact, the parts of the book I liked especially were where Bryson interjected his wry observations on matters as diverse as train spotters, the creation of chopsticks (why?!), and a little flirtation with some sexist commentary on the difference in the sexes as they shop.It was exactly what I needed as I returned home, especially the following quote: ""It looked so peaceful and wonderful that I could almost have cried, and yet it was only a tiny part of this small, enchanted island. Suddenly, in the space of a moment, I realised what it was that I loved about Britain - which is to say, all of it. Every last bit of it, good and bad - Marmite, village fetes, country lanes, people saying 'I'm terribly sorry but', people apologizing to me when I conk them with a careless elbow, milk in bottles, beans on toast, haymaking in June, stinging nettles, seaside piers, Ordnance Survey maps, crumpets, hot-water bottles as a necessity, drizzly Sundays - every bit of it.What a wondrous place this was - crazy as fuck, of course, but adorable to the tiniest degree.""Seriously, makes me proud to be British!",2,0.9968,0.058,0.795,0.147,0.5337476487476488,POSITIVE,0.6688
294,3300744054,04/25/2020,5.0,"Notes from a Small Island by Bill Bryson was a recent Christmas gift. Published in 1995, it is a travel diary of the author's trip throughout Great Britain. Bryson ventured from Dover to Dunnet Head by all means of public transportation. Only in Oxfordshire and at the end of his trip, when he visited the northernmost point of Scotland, did he find that he needed to rent a car. Above all he covered countless miles on foot, sweating up and down hills and getting soaked to the skin on more occasions than I'd have put up with. I have read Bryson's work long before I started to write book reviews (The Mother Tongue: English and How It Got That Way) and enjoy his writing style. It is an oral style and I can picture the author and me sitting in a café while he tells me his impressions of the place we're at, with hushed asides as he covers his mouth to tell me something not so nice about the people at the next table. As I read this at home I laughed out loud I don't know how many times and had there not been a state of coronavirus self-distancing I surely would have burst into titters several times while reading this on public transit. I can identify with Bryson in that I do not rely on a car to travel. I do not have a driver's licence, so I must find my way around all the places I visit either by public transportation or my own power (walking or biking). In 1995 Bryson would not have had the benefit of GPS and thus armed himself with guidebooks and maps. He often had to retrace his steps when planned routes turned out leading nowhere yet just as often he made lemonade out of his navigational lemons and made new discoveries when paths didn't lead where he thought they would. He also had many spur-of-the-moment changes of mind, where the sudden sight of a destination sign on a bus or a train platform inspired him to drop his plans and go off on a whim.Bryson has a gifted imagination for description, and my notes were crowded with page numbers showing his best similes and comparisons:""The man nodded a good-morning as I drew level. 'Might turn out nice,' he announced, gazing hopefully at a sky that looked like a pile of wet towels.""""Britain still has more landscape that looks like an illustration from a children's story book than any other country I know...""""The colonels were all shortish, round men with tweedy jackets, well-slicked silvery hair, an outwardly gruff manner that concealed within a heart of flint, and, when they walked, a rakish limp. Their wives, lavishly rouged and powdered, looked as if they had just come from a coffin fitting.""While in Wales:""We followed a coastal route past broad estuaries and craggy hills beside the grey, flat expanse of Cardigan Bay. The towns along the way all had names that sounded like a cat bringing up a hairball: Llywyngwril, Morfa Mawddach, Llandecwyn, Dyffryn Ardudwy.""""It was a wonderful, spacious house, the kind you could imagine riding a bicycle around in...""Small Island deserves its five-star review, but nevertheless there were two minor criticisms that only a merciless nitpick like me would make. While I wouldn't have expected the book to have an index, I wish at least its chapters indicated the places Bryson visited. Instead, the chapters were merely numbered. It therefore made it difficult to find the destinations he visited in the text. Bryson also heaped praise on his travelling companion, friend and artist David Cook:""Thus it was that on the third morning I picked up my good friend and neighbour, the kindly and gifted artist David Cook--it is his painting that graces the jacket of this book--and went with him for a day's walk through Saltaire and Bingley, his native turf.""However I could tell simply by looking at the cover of my Anchor Canada 2015 edition that there was no such painting, unless Bryson was referring to the wobbly phone box and a quick check of the cover illustrations credited that to someone else. Thus I had to look for the original cover and in order to give Cook his due credit I include it here:My notes were full of passages that elicited laughter and continue to do so upon numerous rereads. I list the rest of them here, in fond memory of a read that I will definitely share with others. I plan to circulate this book among friends with the note attached, ""Must Read"":""As a result, we were in Newquay in time for breakfast and had to wait around for seven hours before the holiday park would let us have one of their wretched chalets. And the worst of it was that I'd only agreed to go there because I thought the town was called Nookie and I wanted to stock up on postcards.""I would have gone there for the very same reason. I even travel to places in order to get a certain postmark cancellation on the postcards I send.""I had an amble through Soho and Leicester Square, spent a little time in the bookshops on Charing Cross Road rearranging books to my advantage...""The rascal, checking for his own books in the bookstores he visited. He also generously praised the stores that featured his books in their own displays. Bryson ridiculed the flowery language of menus:""The menu now was richly endowed with ten-guinea words that you wouldn't have seen on a menu ten years ago--'noisettes,' 'tartare,' 'duxelle,' 'coulis,' 'timbale'--and written in a curious inflated language with eccentric capitalizations. I had, and I quote, 'Fanned Galia Melon and Cumbrian Air Dried Ham served with a Mixed leaf Salad' followed by 'Fillet Steak served with a crushed Black Peppercorn Sauce flamed in Brandy and finished with Cream,' which together were nearly as pleasurable to read as to eat.""I was greatly taken with this new way of talking and derived considerable pleasure from speaking it to the waiter. I asked him for a lustre of water freshly drawn from the house tap and presented au nature in a cylinder of glass, and when he came round with the bread rolls I entreated him to present me a tonged rondel of blanched wheat oven baked and masked in a poppy-seed coating. I was just getting warmed up to this and about to ask for a fanned lip coverlet, freshly laundered and scented with a delicate hint of Omo, to replace the one that had slipped from my lap and now lay recumbent on the horizontal walking surface anterior to my feet when he handed me a card that said 'Sweets Menu' and I realized that we were back in the no-nonsense world of English.""It's a funny thing about English diners. They'll let you dazzle them with piddly duxelles of this and fussy little noisettes of that, but don't fuck with their puddings, which is my thinking exactly.""While acquainting himself with the car he rented in Oxfordshire:""This car had the usual array of switches and toggles, each illustrated with a symbol designed to confound. Really now, what is one to make of a switch labelled |Ø|? How can anyone be expected to work out that a rectangle that looks like a television set with poor reception indicates the rear window heater? In the middle of this dashboard were two circular dials of equal size. One clearly indicated speed, but the other totally mystified me. It had two pointers on it, one of which advanced very slowly and the other of which didn't appear to move at all. I looked at it for ages before it finally dawned on me--this is true--that it was a clock.""While in Wales:""I made a cup of coffee and, while the kettle boiled, changed into dry clothes, then sat on the edge of the bed with a coffee and a rich tea biscuit, and watched a soap opera on television called Pobol Y Cwm, which I enjoyed very much. I had no idea what was going on, of course, but I can say with some confidence that it had better acting, and certainly better production values, than any programme ever made in, say, Sweden or Norway--or Australia come to that. At least the walls didn't wobble when someone shut a door. It was an odd experience watching people who existed in a recognizably British milieu--they drank tea and wore Marks & Spencer's cardigans--but talked in Martian.""",0,0.9991,0.024,0.858,0.118,0.475535403294024,POSITIVE,0.9677
295,2127047338,09/17/2017,3.0,"This comic travelogue-cum-love letter to Britain was a calculated ploy by a bestselling author to make its readers feel good about themselves. Because praise from an American, more than from any other kind of foreigner, is what Middle Englanders most like to hear. The ploy worked: the book sold 2 million copies and was reissued twenty years later. I thumbed through it when it first appeared and found it amusing if patchy. Returning to it now I had the same reaction, only more so. Bryson’s brand of humour consists of latching onto a cultural oddity and exploring all its comic possibilities, with heavy doses of exaggeration for effect. At times this works very well, as when, at a hotel in Dorset, he riffs on the absurdly ornate language that upscale restaurants began in the ’90s to use in their menus, and then addresses his waiter with similar floridity. (Did he really do so? It doesn’t matter because the passage is deliriously funny.) At other times the effect is laboured. I found the laugh-out-loud parts fewer as the book progresses, a trait that reminded me of Bryson’s first book, The Lost Continent, about a trip along the backroads of America. Travel books have to do something more than romanticize or poke fun if they are going to go the distance. Bryson does offer insights – asking questions that the English don’t because “it’s always been like this” – but the one that lingers most is his admission that Paul Theroux was much more adept than he at striking up illuminating conversations with train passengers. Bryson records very few interesting (as opposed to comical) exchanges indeed. And he probably made a mistake by journeying in the autumn, as the repeated image of the rain-soaked author, bumbling along desolate streets muttering sarcasms, wears thin by the half-way stage. Well-informed meditations on Blackpool and Durham enliven the latter chapters, but the whole adventure peters out and little of it lingers in the mind.",2,0.9096,0.021,0.905,0.074,0.4742543859649123,NEGATIVE,0.9846

It has detailed descriptions of the all the places he visited and also how he went there, most of the travel was done on trains, buses and on foot.

However, I really liked this one because of the style of writing. It kept me interested till the very end. I kept chucking every few minutes while reading the book. One of the highlights in the book is a short description of the British people somewhere early in the book and why these people and why they are ideal candidate citizen for a communist nation.

Whom he was only moving because it was for their own good (his wife likes shopping, and he has promised her a land of 24hr malls)* and his ‘fellow Americans needed him.’ Oh and if this isn’t enough to put you off, you still have the pleasure of reading his appraisal of every pretty waitress who serves him coffee in villages/ towns he passes through, and his morbid fascination of watching and describing in minutiae the fat people, who mischance to pass his way, going about their everyday lives.
