0,13905853,01/28/2008,1.0,"God have mercy, I finally finished this horrific book! Honestly, it wasn't so bad, just tedious and repetitive. I picked it because (a) the movie was coming out and (b) I recognized the title as a popular book, albeit a couple years ago. The premise to the book is that a young woman takes a Junior Assistant position at a high-fashion magazine and the She-Devil who runs the show. The movie had the same premise, but that's practically where the similarities end.  Andrea Sachs takes the job, even though her dream job is an Editor position for the New Yorker Magazine, with the promise of getting said dream job much easier after devoting a year of her life to Miranda Priestly (the She-Devil). One year is all it'll take to bypass several years of grovelling, or so she is led to believe. But the year is spent instead in the most belittling, degrading and de-humanizing environment that, frankly, pissed me off more than the main character. If you've seen the movie, dont' think you know the book. Meryl Streep is overly demanding, despicable, and down-right evil to snarky, quirky Anne Hathaway. Eventually Anne's character loses her fashion victim status and transforms into one of her dreaded Clackers. She reaches a point where she understands Meryl's character -- even sympathizes but makes a break when enough's enough.Andrea, instead, distances herself from the fashionistas, makes futile spiteful jabs at Miranda and Co. at every chance, and still loses herself. She doesn't become the trendy girl (not until she's far from the scene) but does lose her identity by placing the needs of a neurotic insomniac before herself, her friends, and her family. The book delves into her relationships on a completely differnt level (actually the movie doesn't even touch them). Let's do a short list of comparisions, shall we?


    
       The book  Andrea has a steady boyfriend Ales, and lives with her best friend from childhood, Lily  Takes the job because it's the only magazine in New York that offered an interview  Puts her personal life on hold to be the beck-and-call girl for a Bitch  Meets a hot writer who is totally jonesing for her and offers her several opportunities to, ahem improve her social standing  She kinda ignores her failing love life and her best friend's alcohol addiction until it's too late to reverse either  Goes to Paris with Miranda because the Sr. Assistant gets Mono  When is Paris she gets the call that her best friend's drinking caused a terrible accident and she must come home  Finally has her fill and tells Miranda off, then gets fired  Kinda blah ending in which she gets freelance work and gets to waltz back into the Runway office for a potential writing assignment  

    
       The movie 
      

         Andrea lives with her boyfriend, and has a small group of friends, one of which happens to be a black girl we could assume is Lily 
        
         Takes the job because it was available 
        
         Puts her personal life on hold to be the beck-and-call girl for a Bitch 
        
         Meets a hot writer who keeps popping up in her life when she desperately needs help and a little pick me up, flirt-wise 
        
         Her boyfriend eventually gets fed up and sorta calls for a 'break' 
        
         Goes to Paris with Miranda because the Sr. Assistant gets hit by a car and is then fired (by Andrea) because her mind is too adled when sick at an event to immediately recall a guest's name 
        
         Discovers a plot to overthrow Miranda (after she recently viewed a vunerable side) and does her best to warn her, only to learn Miranda knew all along and didn't need her help. This is when she decides she's had enough and litterally walks off the job  
        
         Happy ending ensues with her getting a crap job and, unknowingly is seen by Miranda, who approves of her own fashion sense 
        



If I had read the book then saw the movie, I think I would have been pissed off at the screenwriters. As it was, I did the opposite, but am still pissed. I thought the book sucked large portions of ass. There was quite a bit that was humorous, I'll grant you and the author that much, but it was so repetitive when describing her tasks (which I guess was the point) that I simply felt beat down. Gotta give that to her: she did know how to make her readers relate to her misery.Did I like the book? No.Would I read another by her? Not likely.Would I recommend the book to others? Not a chance. Go rent the movie and at least laugh at it all.",168,-0.965,0.141,0.735,0.124,0.5132729991425645,NEGATIVE,1.0
1,6559883,09/21/2007,1.0,"This is one of the only books I have ever read in my entire life where the film actually improved my perception. It took me about three years to read this, and the only reason I ever finished it was because everyone else seemed to think it was so great, I thought I must be missing something. I am generally bothered by books and films wherein the main character is offered an incredible opportunity, but because they are worried they are sacrificing themselves, they toss it out the window. (I am willing to add the film ""What a Girl Wants"" to this general category). I had no sympathy for the lead character in this novel... if she had true sense of self, she could keep her job while not becoming her boss. While I realize that these stories are supposed to be inspirational tales of right triumphing, I always feel vaguely disgusted when I finish them-- to a great extent, they remind me of what we are told at the beginning of law school. If you go into your first year with good morals, an awareness of right and wrong, and a need to help people, you can come out of law school and make a difference, despite the grueling courses and backstabbing classmates. If, however, you are scum, law school will refine your techniques. If the heroine in Prada was truly strong, she would not have had to sell her soul, she could have kept the job and realised it was just that... A JOB. Just plain disappointing. Do yourself a favour... if you feel you MUST muddle through this, rent the movie. Streep plays a truly inspired bitch. ",117,0.9896,0.082,0.73,0.188,0.6135989010989011,NEGATIVE,1.0
2,1708501376,07/25/2016,4.0,"The Devil Wears Prada (The Devil Wears Prada #1), Lauren WeisbergerThe Devil Wears Prada, is a 2003 best-selling novel, by Lauren Weisberger, about a young woman who is hired as a personal assistant to a powerful fashion magazine editor, a job that becomes nightmarish as she struggles to keep up with her boss's grueling schedule, and demeaning demands. It became the basis for the 2006 film with the same name, starring Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway, and Emily Blunt.

3,1664936446,06/10/2016,5.0,"I read this a few years ago, and still remember what a rollicking good ride it was. I was mesmerized by the horror. It was like watching a train wreck in slow motion. In a good way, that is. I'm sure there's a good way to watch a train wreck if we think about it long enough. In the interest of full disclosure, I spent several years in what we shall charitably call the fashion industry. So young, insecure, underpaid, working for creative tyrants, living on coffee and celery, and not being able to afford the clothes one must wear (and loves) whilst working 12 - 14 hour shifts are familiar memories from my younger days. So is fear of boss after boss after boss. Abject fear. if there was ever a time in your life when you worked in high-end retail or designer fashions, this one's for you.

4,2382663972,05/11/2018,2.0,"As everyone knows, the book is almost always better than the movie. But there are a small number of books that are not as good as the movie. I keep a rolling list on my profile page (I think about this question more than a person should) but they generally fall into three categories: great books turned into all-time masterpiece-level movies, solid books turned into great movies, and flawed books turned into good movies. You can probably guess why I’m bringing this list up here. 😄 The only question is which category The Devil Wears Prada falls into.Andrea Sachs is hired to work as a personal assistant for Miranda Priestly, fashion magazine editor extraordinaire. You would think that only a moron would fail to notice all the clues that Miranda is a super-demanding, difficult boss. Andrea is not a moron, yet she misses them anyway. Andrea hates the job, and considers it beneath her, but she doesn’t quit. Instead, she just chooses to do her job poorly, which only results in more friction with Miranda and the other assistant, Emily.And ... that’s most of the book. Some of the scenes are funny, but overall it gets repetitive. I’d assumed that the book would end with Andrea taking down Miranda in some kind of 9-to-5 revenge scenario, or with Andrea either persevering through the job or realizing what she really wants and leaving the job on her own terms. Neither happens. Instead, just when Andrea has made a decision about her future, she gets mad about one thing and makes the opposite choice in a fit of anger. The Devil Wears Prada is apparently based on the author’s real-life experience working as an assistant for Anna Wintour at Vogue. What’s odd is that you would expect that the author would have written her stand-in character in a positive light. But Andrea is whiny. She’s not a good girlfriend to Alex, her boyfriend of three years. She’s not a good friend to Lily, her best friend and roommate. Andrea is a ridiculously unsympathetic character. So I guess the author gets points for portraying a version of herself in an unflattering light?Meanwhile, the movie takes this strange, flawed story and spins it into something much better. Miranda is portrayed as an actual person. Andrea is earnest and hardworking, and grows as a character over the course of the movie. Andrea’s ultimate decision about Miranda is considered, not rash, and makes sense. Plus, the movie has national treasure Meryl Streep, Stanley Tucci, Anne Hathaway, and Emily Blunt. So, while the book is not recommended, the movie is breezy fun and well worth watching.",70,-0.9745,0.154,0.737,0.11,0.5292723149866008,NEGATIVE,0.9999
5,8409319,10/29/2007,2.0,"A woman came up to me while I was reading this book and said, ""Oh, how is that book? I've been meaning to read it."" I answered, ""Um, well, it's kind of fun."" She raised her eyebrows at me. ""I see."" I added, ""I wouldn't pay full price for it. I got it on sale for, like, a dollar."" She nodded as she began to walk away, ""Okay, I know what you're saying.""I can explain more if you still feel like reading this book. Honestly, I won't stop you from reading The Devil Wears Prada, I just don't suggest you push off absolutely everything else in order to do it. There are many, many more worthy books.The main character, Andrea/Andy, is just really not likeable. I wish she was. I kept trying to see her point of view. But she really bothered me. She had a great opportunity to get into the publishing business, fashion business, or whatever else. She just had to hold out for a year. Fine, she's getting four or five hours of sleep a night. I really don't care. Fine, her boss is ridiculous. But Andrea defiantly sighs at her to show her how she feels, which really, just makes her a big baby. I didn't like a lot of the people I worked for, but if you're a hardworker, you're not going to huff and puff to prove your point that all of this is beneath you. You're going to suck it up and do it. Andrea acts like the super expensive, fashionable clothes that everybody wears are ridiculous, and yes, she sells what she has at the end, but she also puts down Franco Sarto shoes and Ann Taylor (or was it Express?), which made Andy pretty hard to relate to since most people reading the book are probably wearing those things. She doesn't treat her best friend well the entire time, which okay, sometimes these things get left behind when you're busy, but come on, she was an alcoholic. Pull it together, Andy, and be a friend. And when she tells off Miranda at the end, God, I really think the author was going for that whole, Yeah, sock it to her, Andy! thing, but that's really not how I felt. I wanted to tell Andy to grow up. Wouldn't a decent person and adult have said, ""Look, Miranda, my friend has been in an accident. I'm sorry if you want me to stay, but I have to go."" Which, okay, that's not the best ending either, but really, don't bring up the whole friend in an accident thing, and then have Andy blow up and quit because she couldn't get Miranda's two kids some passports. (Yes, I understand that in the back of her head Andy was probably upset about her friend, but that really didn't come out at all.)

7,2586713241,11/13/2018,3.0,"“Millions of girls would die for this job”OK, I know what you’re saying, “you’re that knuckle dragging redneck from Tennessee, what’re YOU doing reading about high fashion in New York and Paris”???Fair question. I’d say it’s important to read different books, try on diverse genres from talented writers I’ve never explored before, think outside the box. My wife bought the 2006 David Frankel film starring Meryl Streep and I’ve seen it multiple times and liked it. The book seemed interesting, fresh and vibrant.And it was. Lauren Weisberger’s prose is witty and endearing, funny but also poignant. I liked her erudite use of language, she can turn a phrase with the best of them.For any out there who don’t know what this is all about, quick summary: college grad with aspirations of being a writer lucks into “the dream job” as the personal assistant to the editor of Runway magazine, a thinly disguised roman e clef about Vogue magazine and Weisberger’s time there. Most notably it is about her off-the-charts difficult boss, Miranda Priestly.Fans of the film, and especially of Streep’s superb portrayal of Miranda (she was nominated for an Oscar but that award went to Helen Mirren) will know about the diabolically aloof and condescending editor. But Streep’s performance and Frankel’s direction gave us a more human character. For all her cold heartedness, Streep’s Miranda is ultimately approachable and strangely likeable. Weisberger’s Miranda is a Nietzschean machine, ruthless to the core, reminiscent of Jack London’s Death Larson (the more purely evil brother to Wolf Larson).Ironically, Weisberger’s Andy is not as likeable. While Anne Hathaway’s role gave us a vulnerable and dynamic portrayal, Weisberger’s protagonist is not just seduced by a demanding job with a domineering boss, but she is demonstrably self-centered to boot. And the whining about the fashion job got old by the end of the novel making me want to scream “fer Chistsakes either work or quit!”More than the surface story, though, this book made me wonder about our propensity towards hero worship. Why do we put up with arrogance and pitilessness? Weisberger notes how teenage girls (and grown women) fall over themselves for Miranda, Runway and fashion in general. Why? And guys, you’re not off the hook either. How many boys and men (and men who act like boys) will damn near grovel for sports stars? For all the ridiculous sums paid for a Louis Vuitton product, how many testosterone and beer soaked males drop big bucks for tickets and sports apparel? Why would we stand in line and pay hard earned money to people who care nothing for us and don’t even pretend to?Weisberger also makes me think about and question our work ethic. Andy’s new job takes all of her time and energy and causes riffs in her relationships with family and friends. Certainly work and a career is vitally important, but so are bonds of affection and through Andy we can get a glimpse at priority and what is important.Good book.",56,0.9897,0.094,0.749,0.157,0.5760559375265258,NEGATIVE,0.9713

Still, I sought out the book because I felt that, as with most film adaptations, a lot of depth had probably been jettisoned, and rightly so, in the translation to the screen. After all, a novel can tackle a lot more than two hours of screen time can.Imagine my surprise to find that the movie had more depth than the novel did. One of the most charming and fully-realized characters (relatively speaking, here) in the movie was nothing more than a throwaway gay joke in the book. And whereas there's growth and change among most of the major players in the movie, the novel pays only lip service to ""your characters must change by the end of the book,"" and then only to the protagonist, whose ""change"" is telegraphed from page 1. The boss, the ""devil"" of the title, remains exactly the same from beginning to end—possibly intentionally, but I thought the Hollywood treatment of her, though formulaic, was more satisfying.These things would have cheesed me off more if I hadn't discovered that the whole thing was written by a 22-year-old, because lord knows I never could have written something as impressive as this at that age, so I'm willing to cut a great deal of slack.

(seriously, I could talk to the screenwriter of the movie for literally hours about the process of adapting the book and how she arrived at some of the brilliant choices she made)I can't get over how night and day the two versions are. To show just one example: the character of Christian, in the book, functions purely as a temptation for Andy, teasing the reader with the threat that she'll cheat on her boyfriend (who, in the book, is so tooth-achingly perfect that I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop and find out that he's been having an affair the whole time or something). And she (view spoiler)[never even sleeps with Christian in the book, so his character is ultimately pointless and should have been cut from the novel entirely (hide spoiler)]. But in the movie he actually has a function outside of just being the guy Andy might cheat on her boyfriend with - the book still has the challenge where Andy has to get a copy of an unpublished Harry Potter book for Miranda, but she just finds some rando at a publishing company to get it for her. Having Christian be the connection that gets her the book in the movie version was, frankly, a stroke of brilliance and I bet Lauren Weisberger is really mad that she didn't think of that. The sad truth about The Devil Wears Prada is that it could have functioned perfectly well as an in-depth magazine article. Because ultimately, this novel is attempting to shine a light on the toxic work culture at Vogue, and specifically to show the world that Anna Wintour is straight-up abusive to her underlings. But when the book came out, all of that got lost as people just scrambled to read all the dirt about what it was like working inside the hallowed halls of one of the most influential fashion magazines running today. There were probably (and probably still are) plenty of garbage people who considered ""Andy"" ungrateful, and thought that she should be forced to pay her dues by working a shitty job for a shitty boss. What people lost sight of - including Weisberger herself, because she's mostly concerned about how her job affected her and isn't interested in seeing the bigger picture - is that no one should ever have to go through what Andy goes through in this book. The sad thing is that I don't think Anna Wintour ever faced any significant backlash for how she's portrayed in this book. If anything, The Devil Wears Prada actually benefited Wintour, because it made her a household name. (We would not have The September Issue without The Devil Wears Prada) Which, when you think about it, is really fucked up: that Wintour became more famous thanks to a book that portrayed her, in no uncertain terms, as a horrible human being, and there were never any real consequences for all of that ugliness coming to light. There is almost certainly some girl at Vogue working today who performs all of Andy's former duties, but that person is probably an unpaid intern now. And how did this all shake out for ""Andy"", aka Lauren Weisberger, who wanted to write for the New Yorker and scoffed at the idea of Vogue having ""literary articles"" (a skepticism that goes unchallenged in the book, because the screenwriters had to scrape five book characters together in order to create the movie's version of Nigel)? At the end of the book, Andy publishes a magazine article about a recent college grad who gets hired at a super demanding job, and almost loses herself in the process. Weisberger tries to lampshade this by having Andy's family joke about how closely this skews to her real life, but it seems to be a pretty accurate estimation of Weisberger's post-Prada career. A quick look at her author page shows that she managed to wring two sequels out of her star-making novel, and most of her other books seem to follow the same formula of a simple, good-hearted girl who gets swept up in a world of glitz and glamour that she's fully unprepared for. For better or for worse, Weisberger has built her career off of that one terrible year she spent at Vogue. Anna Wintour made Weisberger's writing career, and Weisberger gave Wintour widespread fame.

19,959946468,06/06/2014,5.0,"I first read this book in my first year of high school for a book report (we could choose ANY book we want, and I was obsessed with the film version of this novel at the time). Since it's been...well, years...it's about time I finally give this book a review to add it to my collection!This book was super popular and a sequel has come out (which is currently sitting on my to-read shelves waiting for me to dig into it) in recent years. For those who don't know about the first book in this series, we are following Andrea (or Andy) who gets a job at a famous, fashion magazine (similar to Vogue) which is run by the insane workaholic Miranda Priestly. Andrea believes this is the step she needs to get into her journalism career! A job at a high end fashion magazine! But, as we all know, nothing is ever that simple.The movie is not the same as the book, but I like the think the quality of both are insanely good! Despite being different in plot, tone and character personalities, both works were fantastic! If you haven't read the book, I highly suggest it. It's unique and dramatic!Andrea's journey involves her changing (and sometimes growing) along the way, as she encounters all of the antics of being in the fashion world: uptight assistants, overbearing bosses, deadlines, insomnia, and work/life balance.This book is in it's own niche market - it became really popular, but it's not for everyone. The humor is a type of special, especially since you are following Andrea's life fall apart. For me, it's a five star book! It's interesting to watch the plot spiral out of control as your begging the author to give Andrea some type of happiness in the end. But honestly? It's kind of how life is - not perfect. Andrea is NOT perfect and she's definitely not the most likable character, but I grew to like her knowing all of the horror she was going through.

21,1067016613,09/29/2014,3.0,"2.5 starsI’m going to be quite honest here: I saw the movie before I read the book. Several times, in fact. The movie came out in 2006, when I wasn’t a reader yet. The Devil Wears Prada is one of those movies that they play on TV quite regularly, and is one of those movies that I almost always watch when it is. Because it’s a really great and entertaining movie – Anne Hathaway’s, Meryl Streep’s, Stanley Tucci’s and Emily Blunt’s performances are absolutely top notch. So when I saw the book in the library, I thought, “Why the hell not?” and brought it home with me.I think everyone knows the story by now – Andrea Sachs, who knows absolutely nothing about fashion, is thrown into a world where anything bigger than a size zero is frowned upon, carbs are the devil, and you should never wear that top with those shoes, or you’ll get lynched. Then there’s Miranda Priestly, head of Runway magazine, and also the most exigent person on the planet. The new Harry Potter book that’s not in store yet? Get it, now. Also, make a reservation at that one place I went to last month. And get my lunch. The only reason Andrea puts up with it, is because working as Miranda’s assistant for a year opens many doors. Only slowly but surely, she’s turning into a Clacker herself, and finds her personal life tumbling down in front of her very eyes.While the book was enjoyable, I didn’t like it as much as the movie. First of all, there are several subplots that differ from the movie that I didn’t appreciate, like the fact that Andrea has an alcoholic best friend who’s also a total slut. I know that slut-shaming is wrong and that I shouldn’t be judging, but when you can’t remember having slept with the guy who is currently smoking crack in bed next to you, you need to re-evaluate your life choices. Just saying.There was also the case of Nigel. Thank God that they gave that role to Stanley Tucci, because he turned it into something fantastic. But book Nigel is a major homo who wears cat suits and HE TALKS IN CAPITALS ALL THE TIME WHICH IS REALLY ANNOYING AND GIRL THOSE SHOES ARE SO LAST SEASON. I think you get the idea – annoying, shoot him, please.While I read the book quite quickly, I still found it too long. This material works perfectly for a movie, but in a book, I really don’t want to read about the main character getting coffee every day. That gets old very quickly. Nevertheless, I really liked the storyline in general, and it had some funny bits. While it’s an enjoyable story, you do need to take this with a massive grain of salt, because it deals with very sensitive topics like women starving themselves just to look good in the eyes of the fashion world. If you can handle that, then I see no reason why you should not enjoy this book. It’s just that, when you compare it to the movie, it’s a little underwhelming.",22,0.991,0.065,0.799,0.136,0.5403773786126728,NEGATIVE,0.9949

It’s definitely an anecdotal, character driven novel, rather than a plot driven one, and there was a lot of detail about things I don’t really care about.I also think I took the opposite message of what the author was trying to convey as I totally disagree with a particular decision that Andy, the MC made, I think she was incredibly stupid at the end because her friends and family were unbelievably unsupportive and un-understanding (that’s not a word, is it?). And the author tried to make out like certain things she did were really bad, and I just don’t think they were. But it was amusing in parts and anyone interested in the fashion or magazine industries would really enjoy this. Personally for me this is one of the extremely rare cases where I thought the movie was better (though I haven’t actually seen it since not long after it came out about 12-13 years ago, and I was 13-14 at the time so maybe it’s not that great either lol, who knows).

If you've never read this book, do so in order to gain a glimpse into what total suffering can be.Regarding Miranda Priestly, it is rare that I have come across a character that deserves a slow a horrid death, but she deserves to die slowly. No matter the talent the woman had in editing, I would argue that her knee caps be shot out, one at a time, six months apart, then followed by her thumbs being removed with piano wire. Lastly, her tongue should have been removed with acid. Once finished with these (perhaps one year later, maybe two), poisoning by strychnine would be administered in order for her to suffocate and die of asphyxiation.Or, on the lighter side, simply putting several ounces of glass dust into her damned Starbucks's latte would be enough to grind her internal organs into hamburger over several months of a painful and slow death.No human being like Miranda should be allowed to live on Earth.",16,-0.9889,0.194,0.719,0.088,0.5228110599078343,NEGATIVE,0.9999

I had some trouble getting into the book, those first descriptions of Andrea's adventures before joining the magazine were really not that interesting to me. After she enters the magazine world I became more interested in her relationship with everyone else. Meaning I'm not that into fashion so some people might actually appreciate the fashion angle in this book more than me.Andrea Sachs, a small-town girl fresh out of college, lands the job ""a million girls would die for."" Hired as the assistant to Miranda Priestly, the high-profile, fabulously successful editor of Runway magazine, Andrea finds herself in an office that shouts Prada! Armani! Versace! at every turn, a world populated by impossibly thin, heart-wrenchingly stylish women and beautiful men clad in fine-ribbed turtlenecks and tight leather pants that show off their lifelong dedication to the gym. With breathtaking ease, Miranda can turn each and every one of these hip sophisticates into a scared, whimpering child. After Andrea starts working at the magazine she has to deal with her boss's impossible requests, rude manners and every hour calls. She feels compelled to try to answer every request because everyone tells her that after one year of putting up with Miranda Priestly she will be able to choose the job she wants.As the action progresses Andrea is more and more into the Runway spirit, where everybody wears designers clothes, is sickly thin and lives in fear of the boss. Her relationship with Priestly's Senior Assistant Emily shows exactly that - either Emily is defending her boss and her rudeness or, when she is also a target, she is bad mouthing her in secret.Although she becomes more of a Runway girl Andrea keeps herself focused on the real job she wants - to write for The New Yorker, and can't resist sometimes feeling superior to everyone else who works for the magazine. With that goal in mind she keeps accepting Miranda's demands thus hurting her relationship with family and friends. The climax come during a trip to Paris where Andrea is preparing to help Miranda organise a party even though her best friend is cometose in the hospital. Miranda makes one more impossible demand - to removate her daughter's passports in 3 hours - and Andrea finally tells her F*** ***.That's the end of the job and she comes home to be with friends and family even if her relationship with her boyfriend is already damaged.I thought this was a fun book to read after I made through those first pages because Miranda's rudeness and everyone else's reaction too it are actually really fun and make for some LOL moments.However once you close the book there's really nothing that stands out. As an example of chick lit I think it lacks some growth of the main character, in the end Andrea only learned to dress herself better and maybe to pay better attention to her family. But she already had her own set of values and principles at the beginning of the book.A C+.",13,0.9893,0.068,0.797,0.135,0.5377465127465126,POSITIVE,0.9041

The other main issue was Andrea herself. I know she is supposed to be treating her friends badly but in the movie I felt she was able to do this and still remain likable. This book version of Andrea was not likeable in my opinion.

The role of Miranda/the devil was one which easily lent itself to major overacting, a la Bais Yaacov-girl-plays-Nazi-in-camp-play. Meryl Streep truly did the role justice in all her evil chilliness, without making you want to snort and roll your eyes.2. I thought they did something cute with the devil symbolism which I don't remember from the book (although it may have been there). There was one interaction between Miranda and Andrea (note, just ONE -- they did not overdo this, for which I give them credit) where Miranda points out to Andi that she had become cutthroat as a result of working for her, in choosing to stiff her colleague. It was clearly reminiscent of all that Faustian literature, ""The Devil and Daniel Webster,"" etc. Like I said -- had they kept emphasizing this aspect of the story, it would have been way overdone, but the fact that it happened just once made it subtle and powerfully symbolic. Speaking of overdoing things, I don't want to overdo this and suggest that it was more than a chick flick, but things like this made it better than the average chick flick, in my opinion.3. I suppose this was conveyed in the book as well, but I don't remember relating to it as personally -- maybe that 's just the difference between reading about something and watching it onscreen, or maybe this really was done better in the movie. I really empathized with that experience of starting a new job, feeling overwhelmed and incompetent, getting yelled at, feeling depressed, and eventually getting good at what you do. It just felt so real for me in the movie -- I so know what that process is like, and I could really feel all aspects of it as I watched the movie.Overall, if you're looking for a fun movie that's enjoyable and not too deep or demanding, yet not ridiculously dumb, I recommend this.",8,0.9831,0.085,0.755,0.16,0.5217707376798285,NEGATIVE,0.9959

This is supposed to be skewering the fashion industry but the least likeable character in the whole book was the protagonist. Not only did she come off as whiny, entitled and more of a snob than the snobs she was complaining about, she was quite humorless. One would think the fashion industry would be a gold mine of comical materials but if this book was supposed to entertain the reader, it quite failed. Helen Fielding managed to make me laugh out loud at the absurdities of the celebrity world and the entertainment industry in books like Bridget Jones and Cause Celeb.

As a horribly unfashionable person myself (at least, that’s what I believe, as Prada does nothing for me and I can’t for the life of me walk in heels, oh, and I like my hips), picking up The Devil Wears Prada with all of its fashion stereotypes meant indulging in a guilty pleasure. Andy, a freshly graduated aspiring writer, ends up landing an unlikely job as junior assistent to Miranda Priestly, fashion editor and bitch extraordinaire. I say unlikely, because Andy doesn’t care about fashion; she hopes one year as Miranda’s assistant will open the doors to her future as a writer for The New Yorker, a magazine the polar opposite of Miranda’s Runway magazine. While taking on the most ridiculous tasks (from drycleaning to coffeeruns to more coffeeruns because the other coffee had slightly cooled off), Andy tries to keep herself afloat in the superficial pool that is the fashion industry according to Miranda, trying not to let everything take its toll on her personal life – though inevitably, Andy’s carreer does wreak havoc in certain relationships. Although Andy might have done herself a favour if she’d put up an ‘Whatever, it’s temporary, I’ll just suck it up’ attitude instead of allowing herself to rage on the inside, Miranda really is a foul woman and I sympathised with Andy. I couldn’t quite muster up any sympathy for her boyfriend Alex or her best friend Lily, as I found both of them to be the selfish ones, as opposed to Andy. This book is satirical to the max, definitely what I longed for when I started the first page (re: fashion stereotypes), though I somehow feel cheated. Here I was, a naive unfashionable person, and having finished this book I somehow seem to know a whole lot more about Prada and Manolo’s than I really care for. Weisberger, with her no-mercy descriptions of her various shallow characters, wants me to be repulsed by the fashion industry and its rather ridiculous standards, but in the meantime she is effectively trying to seduce me into admiring, and perhaps even desiring this pair of Jimmy Choo’s. I remember completely drooling over eleborate descriptions of Andy’s make-up case, sponsored by Runway. What? Why? That wasn’t supposed to happen. This was supposed to be... satire, mocking the fear of eating three calories more, stuff like that. ...I feel dirty. Quite possibly, a little cheap too. Lauren Weisberger: Choo’s your alliance. 3/5.

Andy is fresh out of college and has no job prospects when she receives a call for an interview at Runway, an elite fashion magazine. Surprisingly, she is offered a job as Miranda Priestley's assistant and quickly learns that in the world of fashion, there aren't enough hours in a day. Her patience, relationships, and sanity are tested to the very limit as she endeavors to use this job to become a writer within a year. So right out the gate, this book has a lot of great sarcastic humor in it, which I really liked. It kept things very light and easy to get through. Andy had a very clear and vivid POV and was consistent and humorous in getting her point across. That being said, at certain points Miranda didn't seem as brutal as she did in the movie, and Andy received an alarming amount of support from her coworkers in hell. These aren't really cons, just observations. Overall, my decrease in rating is due to the fluidity of things. I felt personally that there weren't enough big events in the book to keep me going for more at a fast and steady pace, which drew out my reading of this book.

Andrea Sachs, a small-town girl fresh out of college, lands the job “a million girls would die for.” Hired as the assistant to Miranda Priestly, the high-profile, fabulously successful editor of Runway magazine, Andrea finds herself in an office that shouts Prada! Armani! Versace! at every turn, a world populated by impossibly thin, heart-wrenchingly stylish women and beautiful men clad in fine-ribbed turtlenecks and tight leather pants that show off their lifelong dedication to the gym. With breathtaking ease, Miranda can turn each and every one of these hip sophisticates into a scared, whimpering child. THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA gives a rich and hilarious new meaning to complaints about “The Boss from Hell.” Narrated in Andrea’s smart, refreshingly disarming voice, it traces a deep, dark, devilish view of life at the top only hinted at in gossip columns and over Cosmopolitans at the trendiest cocktail parties. From sending the latest, not-yet-in-stores Harry Potter to Miranda’s children in Paris by private jet, to locating an unnamed antique store where Miranda had at some point admired a vintage dresser, to serving lattes to Miranda at precisely the piping hot temperature she prefers, Andrea is sorely tested each and every day—and often late into the night with orders barked over the phone. She puts up with it all by keeping her eyes on the prize: a recommendation from Miranda that will get Andrea a top job at any magazine of her choosing. As things escalate from the merely unacceptable to the downright outrageous, however, Andrea begins to realize that the job a million girls would die for may just kill her. And even if she survives, she has to decide whether or not the job is worth the price of her soul. ",5,0.8568,0.097,0.77,0.133,0.715270562770563,POSITIVE,0.9996

113,229211080,10/30/2011,1.0,"Um,"" says Andrea Sachs, that boring and undeveloped accessory of the ""devil,"" Miranda Priestly who is the editor of Runway fashion magazine. ""Um,"" Sachs repeats as prominent literary people insist how eloquent she is. ""Um,"" shouts Andrea Sachs as I turn another page in a novel that appears to have very little to do with the devil or with Prada.The Devil Wears Prada by Lauren Weisberger is a novel that I have been considering for my World Literature class on the devil in literature (and includes novels that I have been exploring in my ""The Devil is a Woman, but only Momentarily"" blog series). Having finally gotten around to reading it, I will most likely never teach this text but it does make an interesting installment in my blog series as I continue to grapple with the devil and gender representation in literature.The first aspect of the novel that struck me was its nonexistent devil references. Weisberger does not make any witty connections between Priestly and the canon of other literature that takes up the devil. In fact, the devil aspect seems to have been added in at the last minute with a quick change of the antagonist's name to ""Priestly"" and one key scene in which she appears in a very red ensemble. Sachs takes a job that ""a million girls would die for"" but that is about as far as the threat goes. Only in the very last scene of the novel, when a victorious (because she tells Priestly to fuck herself) Sachs -- who has returned to her doughnut-inhaling and Big Mac-munching persona -- walks back into the fashion building is there any deep connection to devil imagery. The cheeky check-in clerk, Eduardo, is singing ""Bye, bye Miss American Pie...this will be the day that I die"" as he buzzes Sachs into the building without authentication. She feels, finally, like she is someone who ""matters."" When someone is let into the gates without penalty after a song about dying, one is forced to think about heaven and hell. The Runway building is obviously supposed to be hell, but the ending imagery paints it like heaven. Sachs feels empowered by getting let in ""for free,"" as Eduardo shoots her a wink. I was confused about the metaphor of the location, but I was relieved that at least I could see some kind of landscape forming with some kind of connection to the discourse of devilry.The second connection between the discourse of devilry and The Devil Wears Prada is religion. Both Sachs and Priestly are Jewish, yet Priestly has apparently forsaken her family -- along with her heritage. Sachs titters dangerously on the edge of doing the same (living ""in sin"" with her soggy do-gooder boyfriend, and being told by Priestly that she reminds her of herself when she was young) but then when her best friend almost dies in a car crash caused by her drunkenness she realizes that the morality of her religion has merit. In the end, Judaism conquers devilry.But then, Priestly doesn't really seem like the devil. First of all, we are told by the title that the devil wears Prada. Priestly does not wear Prada, she wears Hermes. Prada appears on several characters at different points but the brand name is lumped with others in a few of the numerous lists of brands that streak the pages. Sachs wears Prada for the longest time and with the most attention from Weisberger.Is Sachs the devil? Priestly is bitchy and unhappy, successful and brilliant. Some devils are like this. Yet Priestly doesn't really ever tempt anyone, she doesn't seem to want anyone's soul. In fact, when little Anita Alvarez writes to her about how she would give anything to be like one of the models in Runway, Priestly doesn't care. She receives millions of letters from people willing to ""sell their souls"" for a kind word from her. The devil would move on this.But Priestly doesn't. Sachs does.Sachs takes it upon herself to tempt Alvarez with fancy clothing. Sachs handles all of the soul-selling.The devil has no soul. Neither does Sachs. As a character, she is one of the most flat characters that I have encountered. There is really very little development of her character. At first, I think that she is going to increasingly become like the shallow, fashion-slinging moguls around her. That would have been interesting. But she really never does. Instead, she maintains her eye-rolling, soup-slugging, poor time managing, inability to judge priorities, and ""um""-ing, charming approach to life from beginning to end. A flat character is...well...soulless.Sachs is the devil. What she wears is Prada, sure. But more than that, nada. Ephemeral. True devil form.I was disappointed with the novel, and I am not sure yet what this entry has to add to my investigation of gender-shifting in devil literature. Maybe nothing. Maybe I will come back to it in time, once the disappointment dissipates and I am able to think a bit more critically. ",4,-0.9989,0.189,0.718,0.093,0.5295357686453573,NEGATIVE,0.9981

Andrea is not terribly likeable as a protagonist, with basically zero points to her credit other than that she is constantly tortured by Miranda, a person so transparently horrible that you have to feel bad for anyone in contact with her. Pretty much everyone here sucks except for Andrea's boyfriend, who's almost too perfect with his just-out-of-college job teaching at the kind of inner city school where a six year old brought a knife to school.No one is interesting. No one is allowed to be interesting in the gravity of Miranda, a demanding narcissist. A typical Miranda demand goes like this: ""Find me the Asian fusion restaurant review that I read in the paper.""Andrea asks what paper, or what restaurant, and is brushed off, so she calls every single paper in New York and tries to see if they know what Miranda is talking about. Failing, the next day, Andrea asks Miranda again which paper. Miranda says, ""I told you it was in the Post."" (She did not tell Andrea this.) Andrea tries the New York Post again, specifically, but there is nothing; she is berated later for having failed to find the review only to be told Miranda meant The Washington Post, which she insists she said even though she did not. Senility does not seem to be an excuse since Miranda is only old enough to have daughters who are about ten years old.I could not help but think of Crazy Rich Asians as I read this, which certainly must have been inspired by Prada here, with the horrible boss being replaced by the horrible future in-laws. The book was more successful (and that movie, more successful still) in mining a lot of comic relief about the weird habits of the ultra-rich. It does not take itself terribly seriously. Prada does. I think it actually believes Andrea is some kind of likeable every-woman. She isn't! She has an emergency credit card from her parents. Get out of here.Along with needing comic relief it's really screaming for variety of any kind. Things lurch from unconnected Miranda-induced ragers to brief interludes in Andrea's personal life. There is no growth (view spoiler)[until the very end when she finally tells Miranda to go fuck herself, obviously (hide spoiler)]. The only really interesting character is the recurring third-tier guy at the front desk who gets Andrea to do a little karaoke routine every morning on the way into the office.I don't know if this was more the book or my perception of time, but it feels very, very late-90s in the way that the Internet is still more of a nascent thing and she does not already have a cell phone. There are, at least, references to the newspapers having websites and at some point something is listed on Craigslist. Maybe 2002 (the book came out in 2003) was just not as different from like, 1998 as it is in my head - to me these are two distinct periods because I was in high school for one and college for the other. Anyway, don't read this.",4,0.3314,0.094,0.818,0.088,0.5140549277562264,NEGATIVE,1.0

A personal assistance for Miranda Priestly, head of Runway Fashion Magazine. She is told that if she keeps the job for a year she will be able to jump years worth of entry level/minion work in the publishing industry. The book then follows her as she tries to learn about fashion and how to meet all of Miranda's demands for the next year. We see Andy trying to balance her personal life and work, we her learning about Fashion and ultimately having to make a decisions on what  is important to her and what she really wants. Personally, I think that I did enjoy the book more than the movie. The book really concentrated on Andrea, aka Andy, and her journey. There was more details in the book of things that she had to go through and struggle with. The balance between her personal and professional life felt more delicate and important in the book then in the movie. I really felt that I built a stronger connection to the character of Andy in the book then I did in the movie. But, also still at time in the book I just wanted to take Andy and shake her say, ""do you see what you are doing? stop it."" I really felt that more was on the line for her in the book than in the movie since it was more than just her boyfriend she was losing in her personal life. That being said about Andy I think the movie did a better job with most of the rest of the characters. The book has characters that come in are there for a scene, introduced to us and even given some background on them, then we never see them again. Those characters are cut down the movie and combined into a fewer number of characters, which then brings substance and depth to the characters. At some point in the movie you are a viewer are brought to feeling a little sorry for Miranda, this never happens in the book. In the book there is one point where Andy feels sorry for Miranda, specifically about how she has to be so fake at an event. But the way it is done Miranda still felt flat to me in the book and not someone I felt for at all. The only person I feel like we got much about was Andrea which was frustrating at times. One character that was in the book that I missed in the movie was the security guard at the Runway building. He is kind of a comic reliefs in the book. While, running around like crazy trying to get everything right and at the right time Andy doesn't seem to slow down. But when she has to go by the security area to get to the elevators he stops her and makes her sing part of a song as a reason to get through. Yes, it seems cruel, but the fact it catches her and makes her calm down makes it a great thing in the book. Overall, I would say they did a good job making the change from the book to the movie with the adjustments they made. The book is defiantly amusing and worth the read, just as the movie is worth seeing.",4,0.9541,0.069,0.832,0.099,0.5231978653530377,NEGATIVE,0.9905
116,225620616,10/20/2011,5.0,"Brooke Sweeney Book Review- The Devil Wears Prada	It’s a job a million girls would die for... or is it? The book The Devil Wears Prada, written by Lauren Weisberger, is a fiction book first published in 2003 by Broadway Books. This book is not part of a series although its popularity almost calls out for a sequel. The Devil Wears Prada is a young adult book perfect for high school girls. This well-written and carefully detailed work of art was a New York Times bestseller the minute it hit the bookshelves.	Andrea Sachs is a young, typical, fresh out of college girl who dreams of writing for The New Yorker magazine. She applies for and gets the job as the junior assistant for Miranda Priestly, the editor of Runway magazine who is known worldwide for her stunning sense of fashion. Andrea’s every day routine includes rude, disturbing, and nasty calls from Miranda every ten minutes demanding her to schedule parties at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, make reservations at the fanciest of hotels in Paris, and to get ahold of and fly the not yet in store Harry Potter to Miranda’s daughters in Paris by a private jet. On top of that, she is sent on absurd errands and assigned to do things that can only drive a person crazy. Yet the worst of all is facing her boss every day at Runway magazine’s office located in the Elias-Clark building in New York City and getting grunts, disturbed looks, and no respect from Miranda. Nonetheless, Andrea is keeping her eye on the ultimate prize: a recommendation from Miranda to work at magazine of her choice. Andrea anticipates that her dream of working at The New Yorker could finally true, until she realizes how out of hand and ridiculous her current job really is. This frenzied and hysterical plot takes place in the center of Manhattan. As the year goes on, Andrea comes to question one thing: is this really worth it? And this thought leads Andrea to do the unthinkable but possibly what was best for her soul, her loved ones, and her future. 	The Devil Wears Prada is most definitely a must read book. The entire book offers a new perspective on life and provides the idea that no matter what power someone has in society, that does not mean they have the right to treat someone below them badly. Also, the reader sees how life is full of choices as Andrea loses her family, best friend, and boyfriend to her job working for Miranda and in the end must make a choice regarding how she wants to live her life. This brilliant, gossipy, and all together hectic novel keeps readers hanging on until the last page. ",4,0.9607,0.091,0.785,0.125,0.5599548721718534,POSITIVE,0.5119
117,1204277954,02/18/2015,1.0,"I really like this movie so I picked up the book at a thrift store for a few bucks.It's really disappointing. Yeah, in very broad strokes, both versions cover the plot but it's the difference in tone that really ruins it.What I like about the movie is how much my relationship with the characters change throughout:-I sympathize with Andy for getting this ridiculous job but we also agree with Nigel (Stanley Tucci) when he criticizes her for not putting her all into it.-I despise Miranda Priestly for how she treats her subordinates but by the end I see her humanity: how hard she works, how competitive the industry is. I stop seeing characters as black/white, good/bad and end on some version of grey. She's mostly just trying to do her job well and protect it. Wouldn't any of us do that same? Maybe if I had her job, I would be just like her? At least, I think about it.The book has none of this. Andy is a whiny asshole all the way through. She's a hypocritical baby. The only growing she does is that she comes to love all the free clothes but even still, she considers them a not-good-enough perk of her job. Do the job or don't! That's what Stanley Tucci said!The movie looked like a chick flick but was really well done and had a more universal message about success and what it takes. The book IS chicklit. By comparison, it spends WAY too much time describing people's outfits, especially for a character who, apparently, doesn't care about fashion at all. And I suppose that is the real issue, the one that the movie rectifies: Andy DOES like it, or she learns to like it. And that's a great choice because she becomes what she hates. Yeah, in the book, Andy gets close to this but she never stops complaining about her situation so when she gives it up, it doesn't seem like she's giving up all the much.",4,0.9916,0.083,0.725,0.192,0.4149166666666666,NEGATIVE,1.0
118,48815392,03/10/2009,3.0,"I enjoyed listening to the ABRIDGED audio of this book, but only because it was short and I had an evening of cooking to do after Noah went to bed. The profanity prevented me from listening to it with Noah (in the car), but wasn't frequent enough to make me turn it off. My primary interest sprang from the fact that I loved the movie...so perhaps it will come as no surprise that I liked the movie much better than the book. Here's why:1. Visual - I'm not fashion savvy enough to understand all the book's verbal descriptions of the wardrobe, but I loved the color and style paraded throughout the movie.2. Nuance - Usually books master nuance while movies flatten characters. In this case, I felt the reverse - particularly with Miranda and Alex. 3. Miranda - In the book, Miranda lies, changes her mind a lot, and doesn't reveal much talent, making it hard to understand why she is where she is. In the movie, Miranda sets very high expectations, but she doesn't seem to make many mistakes, and she shows some of her talent. It feels believable that someone at the top of a multibillion-dollar industry would expect to have assistants that are best-of-the-best. Which means the movie made her more admirable (in a ruthless, cold-hearted way) and less sleezy villaness. Some of this was the writing - some was the awesome performance by Meryl Streep. 4. Finally, I preferred the corporate maneuverings of the movie to personal friendship issues in the book - probably because they revealed more about the characters I found interesting.All in all, probably worth 5 hours of multitasking, but no more.

119,700406644,08/21/2013,2.0,"I have a confession to make. I watched the movie before I read the book. Usually I would be certain this would cloud my ability to write an unbiased review of the novel, however in this case I do not think it matters, for the sole reason that, on thorough reflection, I think the movie surpasses the written word (a statement I never thought I'd say here!) The writing is by no means awful, and the author displays an obvious potential throughout. The problem I found was that the main character, our heroine, comes across as shallow, predictable and actually, not at all likeable. This is a tough pill to swallow, as our instinct is to feel empathy for the main woman. As much as I tried, I could not like Andi in the story, for her repetitive musings about the world of fashion and how she transformed from awkwardly shy girl next door, to a ""clacker"" overnight.Perhaps the most enthralling character is big bad boss Miranda, a woman undoubtably inspired by the hideous real life editor of the biggest fashion magazine in the world. The authors blatant attempts to capture the persona of a real woman into a fictional character is amateur at best, and frustratingly bad at its worst. Unfortunately the writer comes off as the bad guy here; the reader can almost feel the resentment through the pages.Worth a read if you have the gusto to tolerate the repetitiveness, or have not yet seen the Hollywood adaption, therefore knowing nothing else but this.I would not be tempted to read anything else by this writer.

145,1050530450,09/09/2014,2.0,"*One and a half stars*Long story short; this was absolutely appalling.Laura Weisberger writes Anna Wintour into a scene and some dialogue towards the end, as if featuring her directly would disguise the blatant fact that more or less everything about Miranda Priestly is based directly on her stint as Wintour's assistant. It doesn't work, and actually makes me more suspicious of her motives when even the famously difficult editor in chief of Vogue is anti-Miranda, though of course never openly or publicly. In real life, Wintour does rather dislike Priestly, and Weisberger, for obvious reasons. However, I've read that she said the film (and Meryl Streep in particular) was very enjoyable!I'll start by mentioning that the prose varies from terrible to withstand-able. The dialogue is just as clunky and awkward as everything around it, and there were at least two conversations that may as well have been copied and pasted a few days later. I'm fairly sure Andy also comes to some conclusions more than once as well, but always in a very final, ""This is brand new information,"" way.Liberal use of the word ""anorexic"" to mean ""really thin"" was annoying, because it painted Andy as judgmental rather than better or less dangerously unhealthy. Oh no, people who are into clothes made for skinny people are on strict diets to make them fit. Oh no, a woman is tall AND thin, mustn't have that! Women must be either dumpy or poorly dressed to be taken seriously, and the occasional bout of glasses-wearing couldn't hurt. It's forever implied by other people that Andy's fat, but she walks around thinking that people look as if they're suffering with an eating disorder, and always with a note of disdain, so maybe she should jump off of her (constantly-ridden) high horse.On top of that, there's so many adjectives. Nothing is just a thing, and we obviously care about what word Weisberger thought best described an object that, if it's so damn important, should be able to state that importance through its role in the story. If things were actually interesting, maybe she wouldn't have to try so hard to make them so.On to the wasted, underdeveloped characters:Andrea Sachs is among the least likable protagonists I've ever had the displeasure of reading about. Your main character doesn't need to be like-able, just a good character. I dislike Katniss Everdeen as a person, but understand her actions and motives. Hell, ignoring the protagonist point for a second, I hate Delores Umbridge, but at least I get the feeling that she's a person, with genuine thoughts and feelings.Andy is sarcastic and snotty, often openly and knowingly, towards people who don't warrant it. Her fourteen hour workdays would be awful by default, especially in the heels she has to wear, but other than that we mostly see her doing office work that I didn't understand the issue with. Miranda's ""The Devil,"" but I struggled at points to see why a rich, entitled woman acting like a rich, entitled woman made her Satan incarnate.The supporting characters are fumbled together from various archetypes, as if Weisberger actually made up a list of cliched character traits and thought that it was clever and original to just lump a few of them together. Lilly is the alcoholic of the bunch, and the girl with loose morals regarding sex, and to top it off she's the best friend the lead inadvertently abandons until *SPOILER* crisis pulls them back together.Alex is literally the goody-two-shoes boyfriend who the main character risks outgrowing, but then of course finds her was back to later on. At least, I think that happens, because *SPOILER* we don't get to find out what happens there.Christian is the sexy new man in her life, who may just seduce her away from her three-year relationship, but *SPOILER* he too vanishes in the final chapter so we never see how that one pans out either.*SPOILER* A really big problem in the story itself is that characters just vanish when they've served their purpose. Nigel (a snarky, sweet and slightly underused Stanley Tucci in the film) is a raving queen here, perpetrating as many stereotypes as possible in two brief appearances. Every moment of reading about him was hilarious and frustrating in equal measure, but I still would have liked his existence to actually impact someone. He swans in, tells her he could do her up, doesn't, and then appears for something to do with dressing Miranda or something 100 or so pages later, and then is never heard from again. Were Miranda as understatedly cruel as her film counterpart, I'd assume he gave her bad fashion advice and was promptly murdered by some hired help.On that note: Emily and Miranda, played so well by Emily Blunt and Meryl Streep in the much better, surprisingly enjoyable film adaptation, fall so flat here. Emily has the occasional moment of what seems to be character development, only to embody the panic Andy mentions several times. In a moment of revelation that maybe, just maybe, she too is only putting up with Miranda to forge a career, she snaps back into a loyal drone, and I was sad to find that *SPOILER* the scene in which she and Andy say goodbye on a lighter, friendlier note with the giving of clothes and mock seriousness from Emily's side was an invention of screewriters rather than author. Here there's a scene in the same vein, but it's just not as satisfying.Miranda was fantastic in the film, Meryl Streep managed to embody the pure-bitch personality that Weisberger tries (and frequently fails) to convey, even when the demands wouldn't seem all that bad without her delivery. Here, however, Miranda fails to be the force of entertainment, amusement and frustration that she clearly could have been, because she fell into the hands of an author who just isn't good enough.*SPOILER*In the film, we see her humanized and we're even given, along with Andy, a chance to feel compassion and even sympathy towards her. None of that was from the book, which was a massive disappointment for me.I'm glad that I'd seen the film (repeatedly) before reading the book, because I wouldn't have watched it had things been the other way around. Say what you want about the film, but even if I hadn't enjoyed it, Meryl bringing to life a character so multifaceted but so skilled at hiding that very fact would have made the two hours worth it.This, this is just several hours of my life that I'll never get back. Laura Weisberger is not a gifted writer, she failed to convey all manner of emotions, and most of all failed to create the humorous novel that this set up could have given us.It's a thinly veiled jab at a woman who people allow to be difficult because (anyone who denies it would be a fool) she's brilliant at what she does, and she took a soon-to-be-dead publication back to the top, and has kept it there for over thirty years.The result: Weisberger sold the film rights, the Miranda Priestly character was fleshed out and made briefly sympathetic, and a documentary a few years later finalised the public humanization of Anna Wintour.I'm getting more personal than I should here, but I just felt it needed to be addressed that her critiquing a difficult boss through her writing did nothing more than draw said boss further (if that was possible?) into the public eye, and pull her into a more positive light than she'd been seen in for years.I've rambled on for far too long, so I'll use that to just straight into a short, final point.- You know that a book was bad, when the story behind it and the results of its existence are substantially more entertaining than anything it its (almost four-hundred; twice as many as the story needs!) pages.",3,0.9351,0.119,0.75,0.131,0.5065305808818467,NEGATIVE,1.0
146,1913196280,02/25/2017,1.0,"This is one of those books where i can say that the movie was (gasp!) better than the book.Prepare for a spoiler-riddled rant.Right off the bat the main character Andrea Sachs comes off as childish and as the book progresses, it gets harder and harder to like her or even agree with her.She has backpacked across Europe and India for a year after college andstill lacks the maturity expected from any 18 year old (she is 23). She turns into a whiny teenager any time she visits her boyfriend or goes home to her parents.She is seemingly rude to EVERYONE who is nice to her:1. She gets into a hissyfit and bites off her boyfriend Andy's head every time he points out genuine mistakes of hers.2. About her brother in law she thinks - 'I wanted to stick a tennis ball in his mouth to keep him from talking anymore'-  and this is AFTER he says 'You're looking more beautiful every time i see you'. She also mocks his accent like a 9 year old. And all this just because he is from a not-so-sophisticated part of America, like her family.3. Boss's husband: The only Runway related person who is nice to her and talks to her like family is 'too weird' and she wonders 'if he had a chemical imbalance, perhaps hypomania'She is probably the most selfish character in the book. At least Miranda is not afraid of owning up to her selfish ways.The author desperately tries to keep her grounded:She is always nice to the 1. Office security: dancing to his tunes - LITERALLY, 2. lecherous doorman of her apartment3. homeless people of NYC ( who get STARBUCKS everyday, paid for by Elias-Clark, the company she works for and hates)The friendship between Andy and Lily:The movie thankfully dropped Lily's character.It seemed like the author tried to cram 2 best-friend-personas into one.Lily is both the orphaned, broke, literary genius, pursuing a PhD in Russian literature and also the carefree, party animal picking up random guys at bars and stripping in street corners.For 2 People who claim to be BFFs since the 7th grade, Lily and Andrea couldn't be more checked out of each other's life throughout the book.They even live together at some point and Andy has no idea about the guys she is bringing home or that she is failing in her classes.Lily has no idea the kind of hell Andy's job is, and it is often Alex who fills these gaps for the girls - and gets no thanks from either of them.He even had to bring to Andy's attention that Lily is an alcoholic in denial.Andy is so self absorbed - she would rather shrug off Lily's behaviour with explanations like 'student-life' and 'stress-busting' rather than acknowledge the problem, probably because she would then have to deal with it.The friendship between Andy and Christian: Andy feels Alex is not understanding of her situation and wants him to be ever supportive, all the while she is gallivanting with hot author and boy genius Christian Collinsworth and sees no harm in 'sexy-and-fun' phone conversations, hanging out in bars or generally fallingfor all his charm and wit. Lily even eggs her on and tells Andy that it's okay to not always be monogamous at 23 and especially with Alex who, although has been a loyal friend/boyfriend for 3 years, is not as glamorous as Christian whom she met 15 seconds ago ; and Andy rationalizes that Alex MIGHT have also had similar feelings for a possible young, female inner-city-teacher, so she cannot be blamed for giving in to temptation. It is truly sad when Lily is in a coma after a few months, and it is not any of her boyfriends, or even Andy, but Alex alone who is by her hospital bedside 24/7.The book is largely based on the author's life and she seems to grab every opportunity to point out that she did in fact travel to exotic places after college and this somehow gives her free reign to reimpose every stereotype about them.India is brought up , and is portrayed negatively EVERYWHERE:1. ""I lasted a week in a filthy Indian hostel, begging alex not to leave me for dead in that hellish place"" - This is about India's capital2. Her roommates in NYC Shanti and Kendra are two Indian-origin hardworking girls more overworked and making more than her, but when they have to talk to Andrea , they can only manage 'bare whispers'3. She admits when moving out ""we hadn't had a conversation of longer than 30 seconds, ... i didn't know .. if they had any friends besides each other. I was glad too be leaving""- blaming them for the lack of communication. She also gives them no notice of her moving out and leaves a paltry note using scrabble tiles. She is just that flaky.4. ""I loved Indian food, but i did not love how the curry smell had seeped into everything i owned."" (As an Indian i can vouch that Indian curry, and Indian curry alone, has this magic odour with the unique property, that other food smells can only dream of , where it combines with all things fabric to create a super element that can permanently embed into said fabric threads).5. Her ethnic cabbie plays music which sounded like someone shrieking to her. 6. ""Perhaps i'd contracted a rare form of late-developing dengue fever? malaria? possibly even Ebola?"" - She blacked out and is hungover after a night of binge-drinking and attributes the symptoms to parasites she had picked up on a trip to India 4 weeks earlier.7. ""I quickly scrawled an illegible signature, whether it was mine or Miranda's or Emily's or Mahatma Gandhi's..."" - Why... just why drag the Father of our nation into this?8. ""shoving enough food down my throat between the hours of 2 and 6 am... it's like fucking Ramadan here"" - I can only shake my Head at this point9. The guy selling cigarettes and newspapers is, surprise surpise, a Muslim immigrant (Ahmed).10. The security guard is (shocker) a Mexican (Eduardo), who is casual buddies with Pedro, the fast-food delivery boy - because all Mexicans in NYC are friends by default?If only the stereotyping ended there!The gay men working at Runway are by the book divas- complete with gym bods and tight/ripped clothing, loud trash talking and girl gab about last nights club pick-ups,. One even addresses her 'BABY GIRL, HONEY, SWEETIE' all in the same paragraph. A feather boa was the only missing part. The 2 gay friends she has (James and Nigel) are even flirting openly at one point. Because 2 gay people in the same office MUST want to hump each other at some point right?Glad they chopped lots of parts from the book for the movie. Most were unbelievable characters and downright cringe worthy.Anne Hathaway's character in the movie - is lovable and innocent and a true fashiondisaster. She wants to write about real issues and quits the second she realizes she has become someone who could hurt people close to her and not think twice about it.Book Andy is however quite fashion intelligent. At 5.10 and 115 pounds coupled with great hair, she almost seems a good fit right from the get go. She is ready to work for Miranda even when her best friend and roommate is struggling with life and death, and only quits because she cannot take on any more of Miranda's impossible tasks. Movie Nigel is a quiet, dignified and a supportive friend and not the Nigel from the book - the OVERTLY LOUD MAN-CHILD WHO COULD NOT BE MORE GAY (ALL CAPS because that is how EVERY SINGLE line uttered by this character is written in the book)  In conclusion the characters are unrelatable, the plot is non-existent, the dialogue is offensive and everyone who was responsible for making the book into the amazing movie that it is, deserves an Oscar for their ingenuity.",3,0.9982,0.064,0.809,0.127,0.5644857804232803,NEGATIVE,1.0

151,771106900,11/22/2013,1.0,"I have to start this review by stating that I enjoyed the movie and thought it was a piece of light, fluffy fun--perfect for those of us who love fashion, but also love poking fun at it. The world of Runway was a hoot to enter and I enjoyed cheering for the haplessly unfashionable Andy as she made her way through the upper echelon of the fashion-obsessed magazine world and emerged on the other side, perhaps a little more stylish, but essentially unchanged in the face of label snobbery.The book, though...I honestly though that it would be better than the movie. Aren't books usually much better than the screenplays they inspire? Yet I found myself a quarter of the way through and DNFing in disgust. I have to say that while this book wasn't for me, other people might like it, and you're totally free to disagree with me. If you liked it, great! But I'm feeling irritable right now, so this review will contain the full brunt of my wrath toward Andy and toward Lauren Weisberger.Andy is a bitch. I know, I know, we're supposed to cheer for her as she tries to survive in New York City and fulfill her dream of becoming a writer, but you know what? I wanted her to be run over by a cab. For starters, she's a spoiled brat--her parents have paid for her college, she all but asks her mother to rent and furnish an apartment for her, and she uses her ""emergency credit card"" (again, financed by her parents) to pay for takeout food. Um, okay, clearly she comes from a different financial world than the one I occupy...but that's not where my irritation ends.Andy is clueless about life as an adult in the real world. I'm sorry, but even at twenty-three, I knew how to dress for a job interview and how to navigate city streets. (Hasn't she ever head of mapping out a route if she doesn't know where she's going?) It's hard for me to cheer for a character who doesn't even seem to be trying to help herself.But that's not even the worst of it. Oh no! Andy is condescending to almost everyone around her and spends the majority of the time whining about her awful, awful job and her awful, awful life. Let's recap: she's not working at Runway because she has bills to pay and it was the only job available to her at the time. She isn't even working there because it's the only avenue to the magazine job she dreams of. No, she's taken this job because it's a shortcut and because taking it will enable her to rocket to the top in one year instead of five.Let that sink in for a moment.You know what? I get that desire to be a published writer and see your byline in print. I understand chasing your dream and being willing to put up with all kinds of shit to achieve it. But Andy seems to have no clue, not to mention no gratitude for, the immense opportunity that has fallen in her lap. She complains constantly about her job and all the ways in which it makes her life miserable, but it's hard to ever feel any real sympathy for her because guess what? You could find another job at any time, darling. Harsh, yes, and I know I should be more sympathetic to some of the shenanigans she puts up with, but I'm not. Because you know what else?Not everyone wants to be a writer at a literary magazine. Suck in a big gasp of disbelief, Andy, but it's true, and do you know what else? This doesn't make other people less important or amazing than you! (GASP!) Hey, I love writing! I'd like to make a living at it some day! But that doesn't mean I think I'm better/smarter/more driven than the person who lives for fashion or wants to produce a reality TV show or (insert ""fluffy"" goal here). It just means we have different aspirations. Andy seems to think that her literary leanings make her automatically better than everyone around her and as such her constant snarky commentary starts to feel bitter and bitchy, not witty.I could go on, but you get the picture. Andy is mean, whiny and stuck-up. It's hard to cheer for her and hard to care about where she ends up. We're supposed to like her and hate the Ice Queen head of Runway, Miranda Priestly, and yet the latter is a self-made woman (according to Andy's impromptu bio of her), which makes me feel like she has the right to be a little snobby at times. It seems like Andy is snobby simply because that's who she is as a person.I don't know, maybe I'm reading far too much into it, but I genuinely did not enjoy this book and was so relieved to move on to other titles.

153,1049486211,09/08/2014,2.0,"There are very few films that I would attest to being better than their literary predecessors, but without a shadow of a doubt, 'The Devil Wears Prada' was one. I had high hopes for the book in light of my love for the film, but unfortunately for me, Lauren Weisberger's writing turned what could have been a great feminist coming-of-age story into something flat and unappealing.Now, I'm granting Weisberger a little credit for the fact that 'The Devil Wears Prada' is not only her debut novel, but was also published when the author was the tender age of twenty-three - a feat that I couldn't accomplish now, let alone back then - but every inch of her immaturity is visible in her writing style and characterisation.Andrea had the potential to be a good 'everyman' character; I was a fresh-faced graduate once, and I had the same idealistic nature as andy, so she could have been relateable, but she rapidly showed her true colours when she revealed herself to be self-important, highly-strung and whiny through the first-person narrative of the novel. Trust me, I get it; she's young and ambitious, and in a stroke of realism she doesn't know what she wants or how to get it, but Andrea's character is so snobbish and short-sighted that you can understand why Miranda views a little of herself in our protagonist. Arguably, that's the most interesting part of the story; it's just a shame we had to get through goodness-knows-how-many pages to reach that point.In my experience, first-person narrative is always risky because it's subjective; your character doesn't see, hear or know everything, so the characters around them become lifeless outside of their (often flat) dialogue with the main character, and in 'The Devil Wears Prada', none of the other characters really have any more depth than Andrea, except perhaps Miranda, and that rather goes against Weisberger's attempts at demonising her, because she's the one we know enough about to formulate a coherent opinion of.Emily has faint moments of promise, but her own ambition and paranoia means she yo-yos between having a mind of her own and being devoted to Miranda's service (which quickly becomes irritating, because we know the reality is that there will be no change), while Lily's journey is seriously under-represented due to the fact that Andrea isn't there for any of it. Alex, the devoted boyfriend, seems distant from the off, and while Christian could have injected some drama, excitement and glamour into a repetitive, empty novel, his use is lost to the endless conscience-wrestling that, I've learned in both 'The Devil Wears Prada' and its sequel, is idiosyncratic of Andrea.The thing is, Andrea never learns from her mistakes, and she retains this immature, superior, selfish attitude throughout the entire novel. It's frustrating as a reader, and would be frustrating as a friend or employer, so when everyone else's life seems to go on without her, I really can't sympathise. I deeply wanted her to realise that she was becoming the very thing she scorned all the way along, because at least that would be some sort of conflict, a climax, but there was nothing; no moral, no lesson, no inspiring message for us to take forward.And when your reader can empathise more with the antagonist than your narrator, you know you've probably gone wrong somewhere along the line.",3,-0.8126,0.152,0.709,0.139,0.53875,NEGATIVE,1.0

It's fun, and I love the acting.The book was okay. I read it. My biggest problem was that the main character is a whiny b.. with a too dependent boyfriend and a stupid flatmate. If I work hard and all my bf can do is nag me about not seeing me enough, I'd tell him to go somewhere... Oh wait, I have done that. If my friend becomes an alcoholic, she can drown in it. How is that my fault? I can't stand not self-efficient people.The main character is Andrea Sachs. She had been travelling around Asia for about a year, and when she gets back, she tries to get a job in the publishing industry. Now this wasn't written recently, but we all know that newspapers are dying. So when she actually gets a job in a women's magazine that is able to hire her, we all know that she should be happy. However, since it's not some high-brow paper, she's biased from the beginning. However, the problem doesn't just seem to be that Runway is a fashion magazine. It is actually Andrea's work ethic, which is annoying.What Andrea could not get is that when you are at the bottom of the barrel, you work your ... off. Who hasn't worked 'til 10pm? And poor her, she had to wear fashionable clothes, because looking good is so awful. Granted, her pay may not have been as much as she worked, but starter pay is usually not a lot.Miranda Priestly is ""The Boss from Hell"", supposedly. She does seem to ask more from her assistant than would be normal, but with a bit of creativity, Andrea could have made her own job a lot easier. There are a lot of demanding jobs out there, and a lot of bosses ask for a lot. For the most part, I felt that Andrea's problem with Miranda was that she had a lot more money.In the movie, Andrea becomes successful in her job. She actually learns a lot, and manages to acquire a sense of style. In the book, she doesn't develop at all. When she goes to Paris, they have to draw up charts for her as to what she should wear to what occasion and how to do her make-up. When she leaves, it's not because she realises that it's a world where friendships don't matter and at the end of the day it's about saving your own neck. She leaves because her drunkard friend got into an accident and she has to sit beside her bed. Then when she wants to suddenly leave her boss without help on the most important week of the year, she gets mad at her boss. No boss would have let her go. I just wanted to slap Andrea and give her a reality check, then take her job and be better at it.The whole book just felt like a whine-fest.I have also reviewed the second book, though that was a lot worse, and I couldn't manage to get very far with it.Cross-posted at Unapologetic Reviews, and the books-only version is on Booklikes too.",3,0.5543,0.093,0.816,0.091,0.5208333333333333,NEGATIVE,0.9975

I'm not usually one for chick lit or rom coms or chick flicks, but I did actually enjoy the film and this book. The two are different in subplots and so on, but the basics are all there. And although this is fiction, it does feel as though its like therapy for someone - perhaps even demonising an old boss to be worse than they actually were. And did I not read somewhere that this book was banned from the offices of some big fashion magazine in America? Anyway....It's about Andy/Andrea - apparently all Brits pronouce it Ahn-dre-ah; a young woman just out of college - uni - who wants to get into the world of magazine publishing. And she accepts a job as a PA to Miranda Priestly, the editor of Runway magazine who is a nightmare to work with. Because a year working there opens doors. Considering she didn't really have any work experience before this, it's kind of impressive that she even got this job. Although there is an attitude of I have a degree therefore the world owes me a living and I should be doing things that make the most of my brain. In an ideal world maybe, yes... heck. I suppose we've all been guilty of that one time or another, but most of us get real quick.Miranda is ridiculous, a nightmare, overbearing, rude and deliberately nasty. You can't help but think this woman has serious mental problems. She may be a good editor, but she is completely incompetant at people managing, and incredibly insecure (constantly on the phone) and incapable of arranging or dealing with any situation on her own. She's like a spoilt, screaming bratt that no one dares say no to. And it's awful the way people fawn over her, just bolstering this self-image.Andrea works there for almost a year, has a lot of stressful experiences, looses touch with her family, friends and boyfriend - basically looses her life. In a way this was a kind of stressful book to read, getting sucked into her lifestyle and I just wanted it finished, so I've done that in twenty-four hours! She ends up going to Paris with Miranda, and finally looses it and tells her where to go. And in Hollywood style, everything works out in the end, other people hire her and she gets to be a writer, la la la, because that is real life.I recently read a memoir by Anthony Bourdain, a New York chef. That sounded like hard work. Really dedicated. Sure, it's something he loved doing. I suppose in this case the problem is the ridiculous woman making unreasonable demands constantly. People like that just shouldn't be tolerated.Anyway, it's back to work for me tomorrow! ",3,-0.9804,0.149,0.758,0.093,0.5655449847310312,NEGATIVE,0.9994

Andy is the main character in this novel. She is a girl from the country side to the New York City. She really wants to work in a news paper office at that time. Therefore, she makes a decision to apply the news paper office. Unfortunately, she didn’t admit to there. That is why Andy works into the “Run Way” fashion magazine office. Even thought she doesn’t like this job, but this is a popular job for the entire girl who interesting in fashion. They all want to learn how to become a fashion person with Mirada. Even though Mirada is a devil boss for them, but they will not give up any chance to work with her. Thus, when Andy argues of her job, lots of people feel very angry to her. Because they hope to work with her for long time ago. However, Andy has to face all of difficult in her office. Whether she can handle it, she will be successful in the future. “Run Way” is an access board for her. Her plain is using Run Way’s experience to apply the New York magazine in the future. However, Run Way makes her change a lot. Because of her change made her boyfriend left her. She only knows how to serve to her boss, but always ignore her boyfriend’s feeling. For example: She plain to celebrate of her boyfriend’s birthday, but when she get Miranda’s call, she left her boyfriend stay at home by himself. Even thought she always ignores his feeling, but him still willing to waiting for her. But when a person always does the same thing, I don’t think your friends or family will agree that. Therefore Andy’s friends step by step to leave her at that time. Maybe Andy become a successful woman now, but her aftermath is losing her lover and friends. When she discovered that, she tried her best to retrieve her friends and boyfriend, but nobody want to care her. Therefore, she tries to give up her luxury life and wealth. Finally, she finds herself back. Even though she doesn’t have luxury clothes and life anymore, but she feels very enjoy in her life now.Personally I think, Andy’s situation is the best example for us. When you want to follow the luxury’s life or fashion, try to ask yourself will you happy to do that. Don’t feel regret after you do everything. Even thought you meet a devil boss or teacher, you have to find out a best way to face to them. ",3,0.9963,0.081,0.725,0.194,0.5142721861471863,NEGATIVE,0.5022

The movie on the other hand, I'd give it a ten on ten cuz I just loved it, especially Emily Blunt. I have quite a lot to say about the book actually and honestly I don't know where to begin. The narrative which should have been good considering the comedic timing which was on point, was just average because it got way too repetitive and really whiney. Andy the main character wasn't lovable from the beginning to the end and just keeps complaining about literally everything. Unlike the Andy in the movie who toughens up and gives the fashion life a chance, book Andy however doesn't even try. I didn't really have a problem with her neglecting her relationship with Alex and not having time for her family because I do understand that with a pretty demanding job, you tend to neglect things it's human nature. I didn't like the ending, Andy losing her cool in front of a crowd because Miranda made another one of her insane demands wasn't the way I would have wanted her to quit her job. It really just showed how immature she was. The movie ending was way better with Andy actually giving the whole thing a chance, respecting the fashion industry and even having sympathy for Miranda and finally realising that that wasn't the life she wanted. I wished the book gave us a little bit more to explain why Miranda was Miranda Priestly the dragon lady. Her struggles are mentioned in passing, but other than that nothing else about her is mentioned other than the fact that she's the devil incarnate in Prada. I felt the book tried a little too hard to make me hate her which failed miserably. There are many faults with the book but I will give credit where it is due. I was pleased with the fact that I got a little peep into what goes on in the fashion industry. As I have zero knowledge in all things fashion, I was rather fascinated and I think Weisberg did a pretty good job in giving us a glimpse of what really goes on. And it is a rather entertaining book and by that I mean, at least it doesn't bore the reader to death. Truthfully speaking if I hadn't seen the movie, I would've loved the book better.

It was a different field and he wasn't totally like this, but would have these things where he must have thought I could read his mind. Sometimes it was crazy-making. So I found it funny when Miranda made demands that were outrageous, or claimed she had given information that she hadn't. Also identified with people telling you things about how to handle these people - as with Miranda it was better to try and fail than to just ask her for enough information to get the task done quickly. It wasn't clear whether Miranda was the owner of the magazine. If she had a boss, they really let her use the company to do her personal stuff. It seemed so much money flowed in, that the company didn't make any effort to control expensing by employees. And her assistant's salaries must not have been much, as the way she used their time was very inefficient. Most companies would end up doing something about that. She could have done with only one assistant had she simply given clear instructions. It was like she was playing a game because she could. I thought both love interests were terrible. The Christian guy was overly aggressive. To the point of sexual harassment. And Alex was passive aggressive to an annoying point, so i'm glad she didn't end up with him in the end. Work is work and you have to do what you have to do sometimes. Andrea didn't even intend to stay more than a year. Some jobs are all consuming. He could at least have demanded she quit or he'd break up with her, but he just kept talking. Lily's problems were her own fault. She expects her friend to leave work when she can't. That's dumb. Even the family was a bit much. If your sister lives in Texas, you aren't going to see her children every day. Or you'd have to work out when you could get together.

If for no other reason than the three given below:1. Nigel in the film is an amalgamation of 2 or 3characters in the book - none of whom really have much page time. This means that there is no natural sympathiser for Andy to turn to in the office.2. Andrea herself is actually pretty much unlikeable in the book,she has none of the charisma of her screen counter part. This was my biggest issue with the book to be honest - the main character is just so self-absorbed and just lives to have her own pity party, it drove me batty3. In the film we do see a touch of humanity to Ms Priestly - well, towards the end we do. In the novel this is completely missing and she is painted as completely vindictive and self-centred with no redeeming qualities whatsoever.The plot is ore or less the same as that in the film so you do know what is going to happen overall. There are some significant tweaks though, particularly with Andy's living arrangements and relationships. Unusually the screenwriter has taken a rather unprepossessing novel with a great idea and turned it into broadcast gold.I found the writing to be rather stilted and there was an awful lot of covering old ground; there are only so many ways you can describe going for coffee or answering the phone. It does feel like a one-idea book and that nothing that is put on the page should deviate from that so it does become, actually, quite boring in several places. There are some good moments but these come early on when Andy is fully subsumed by Runway magazine and still has at least half a brain and a sense of basic human dignity.Basically if you haven't seen the film you will probably enjoy this book a lot more. If you have then probably best to steer clear as it will disappoint.",3,0.9602,0.042,0.861,0.097,0.4349593495934959,NEGATIVE,1.0

She ends up interviewing for an editor's assistant position in Manhattan... but in a FASHION magazine. Andy HATES fashion and deems it completely beneath her and her brain. We watch her go from a mousy, scruffy, completely unfashionable girl to a sultry, high priced, and over extended assistant. She only has to stay with the job for ONE YEAR, then Miranda (her boss) will write a letter of recommendation to ANY MAGAZINE Andy wishes to work for. It is widely known, thoughout the publishing world, that Miranda is the most high powered, demanding boss in the entire world. (some nights she even calls Andy out of her slumber at 2:30am to schedule an earlier flight - by 15 minutes!- because she can't STAND to wait a moment more) Andy is wearing the trends and doing the ""high fashion"" thing of planning and attending national events and whatnot- just to pass the time and earn her marks of Miranda's approval. She's trying to keep her brain in tact, but finds that she kind of... dare I say... LIKES the fashion industry. Andy is trying not to shed her smart skin in exchange for the submissively enhanced skin that the assistants at the magazine wear. She's trying to keep her composure while being stepped on countless times by the woman who holds Andy's future in the palm of her hand. One wrong move, and Miranda can stop all of her journalistic future in one snap of her tiny, manicured hand. This book is perfection!

I know that book-lovers hate it when their favorite book gets a make-over when turned to film, but my experience was backwards. Reading a book after watching a faithful movie representation bothers me a little. I feel like it's a waste of time, because I already know the characters and what happens. In this novel, the premise and most of the plot are the same, but the characters are distinctly different. The story isn't as light-hearted as the movie, which I found to be the most striking difference. Miranda isn't humanized at all, Emily is less mean (and therefore less funny), but she's definitely a more interesting, complex character than what the movie shows, and there's a lot more going on with Andrea's friends and family in the novel.Obviously, there are events the movie cut out due to time constraint and flow. These were fun to hear about and gave a much clearer picture on what Andrea was dealing with not only in regards to her job, but with her family and friends as well.I'm really glad I listened to this on audiobook. The narrator, Bernadette Dunne, makes the characters come alive. I got a good feel for their personalities and I could picture them a lot better than I would have been able to if I had just simply read this novel.Overall, The Devil Wears Prada is entertaining and funny.

Soon she is drowning in work as a personal assistant for a big time fashion magazine editor, Miranda Priestly. From buying lunch to getting her hands on two copies of the new Harry Potter book-before copies are available to the public, Andrea has seen it all. Having Miranda Priestly as a boss is a huge commitment. Andrea had to deal with cruel treatment, hard assignments, and being expected to know everything that Miranda wants.Fresh out of college, Andrea doesn’t exactly know how to get her life on the fast track to the New Yorker; her dream job as a journalist. She starts by interviewing for a job at Runway, a high fashion magazine. She ends up as the personal assistant for Miranda Priestly, “a job a million girls would die for” (p. 16). Her fashion style is extremely low and out of date, and she soon finds herself caring about fashion, her weight, and her job much more than she used to. As she struggles to fit in and keep her job, Andrea gets wrapped up in work. Her best friend Lily and boyfriend Alex start to feel like they can’t depend on her. Andrea knows that Miranda can help her get to the New Yorker, so she keeps trying to impress her and obey her orders, but when a something happens to Lily, which will she choose? Her career, or her best friend? I would recommend this book to any mature girl looking for an entertaining read. This book made me laugh out loud as I was reading the ridiculous things that Andrea was forced to do, and Andrea’s attitude. Lauren Weisberger creates a funny story that does teach a lesson in the end.

Little did I know that I was investing in the worst 360 pages I've ever read.

I can certainly be sympathetic in a situation like this, but not if it happens as frequently as Weisberger's god-awful catch phrase ""a million girls would kill for that job."" I saw that phrase so many times that I wanted to scream. Jesus, why did I keep reading?The part about this book that I found most infuriating was that our heroine Andrea was, simply put, mean. She decried everything from Fashion Designers to Harry Potter, and gave people fake smiles that said ""just die!"" Weisberger then tries to justify Andrea's meanness by having her do very small acts of kindness, but giving a homeless person free Starbucks doesn't negate the horrors of Andrea's self-centered, holier-than-thou interior monologues.

No, it's never going to win any literary awards and is probably going to be Lauren Weisberger's only bestseller, if the story is true that it's based on her own experience. I did attempt to read the follow up to this book - something with Harry Winston in the title, but just couldn't even finish the first chapter - I think Lauren used all her talent in TDWP.What's so interesting to me here is the underlying psychological processes at work. I've worked to many high level executives with way too many similarities to Miranda Priestly. And, as Andi touches on in a couple places in the book, it's hard to describe the intensity and overall-atmosphere in a high pressure job. It's not until you actually try to verbalize (or in Lauren's case, write) that you, yourself, realize how ridiculous most of it is. I love Andi's overall tone - most times I really felt like I was sitting in my living room sharing a glass of wine with her while she was telling me her story.If you look, underneath all the fluff and humor is a great psychological study that all assistants everywhere can identify with.Generally, I almost always prefer the books to them movie, and this is no exception.

You know when you compare a book and its adaptation, and the characters in both have very little in common? This is the case here. It turns out Miranda Priestley is only likeable in the film because she is played by the amazing Meryl Streep, the film Emily is much more interesting than her book incarnation, and the film incarnation of Andrea much more annoying. Hollywood maladaptation aside, this is an excellent read.The book succeeds in creating an entire world when she writes 'The Devil Wears Prada'. Not only does she encapsulate the madness of city life, but she also creates a world within a world and depicts it as both stunning, and baffling, and immersive - the fashion world. Weisberger is successful in writing Andrea as a character that is believable and likeable - she is interesting, accomplished, unpretentious, flawed but you feel for her all the same. She works hard and she fights. She is a character that every striver can get behind and one that readers will instinctively relate to - someone who just somehow cannot get it right.As Weisberger puts you in Andy's shoes, you see Elias Clark through her eyes. The absurdity, the dark side, the despair and the ambition all reflected in a world where everyone is trying to get ahead. Most of all, the excellence is how she manages to portray coming-of-age in this context - the struggle with the college sweetheart, that best friend who changes beyond recognition and realising that you are no longer sure whether you changed or everyone else did.

I understand that film's cannot portray as much as the written word ofcourse but the book was brilliant!I would definately call this book chick-lit and reccomend it to YA's, teenagers and women in general who have a love on fashion, glamourous literary worlds and your average boy-meets-girl romancesa.I have read so many reviews criticisising Lauren Weisbergers book which I can't relate too but everyone has a different opinion which they are freely entitled too.Personally I loved loved loved it!!!Regards,Emmax",3,0.9956,0.0,0.783,0.217,0.5088477366255145,POSITIVE,0.9992
172,636291565,06/08/2013,5.0,"I can see why there’s been rave reviews about The Devil Wears Prada; this is undoubtedly one of the best books I have read in months. An excellently written semi-autobiographical novel about the author’s time working as an assistant at Vogue, Lauren Weisberger taps into the rarely seen, less glamorous side of working for a magazine: the tirelessly long hours, minimal credit and inability to sign off after a day’s work. And that’s even before she’d made it on the editorial rota. The narrator, Andrea, is an aspiring writer looking to one day work for the New York Times. In her conquest for success, she finds herself hired as the assistant to Miranda Priestley, the editor-in-chief of Runway magazine. At 23 years old, she is constantly reminded that her job is one that most girls would dream of having. However, as the novel follows her over the course of her year working for Priestley, she starts to realise that it’s not all it’s cracked up to be.Weisberger paints a captivating narrator in the character of Andrea, and the characters she is surrounded by: the alcoholic best friend Lily, bitchy senior assistant Emily and of course the intimidating boss Miranda, to name a few, are all depicted brilliantly. This is a must for anybody who’s ever worked in editorial, or indeed, had a monster of a boss. The Devil Wears Prada is an excellent, gripping, and at times, incredibly humorous, read.

There are times that I felt for Andy and wanted her to stand up to ""the devil"", but she also had ways about her to be disliked too.

I would like to think that I would quit before compromising my ethics. I did laugh at the thought that she took out her aggression by refusing to wash the plate she served Miranda's food. Just a wipe down and it was ready for the next day. That is a warning for people to be nice to the people that could touch your food. Overall I enjoyed the story.

I know quite a lot of posh people, and they don't talk like that either. Even if Miranda does, did we really need to have her dialect sounded out for us every time? It's irritating.

Initially, Andrea is weary and averse to the fashion world and the people in it; however, as the novel advances, Andrea finds herself falling into said world and becoming the type of superficial person she used to dislike. As someone who loves fashion, it was highly amusing to hear all of the brand names and styles that were specifically mentioned in the book because that specificity provided such vivid imagery that I could see each chapter playing out in my head — it made the story that much more realistic.

Andrea comes in to the job with hopes of being a journalist and one year working for Miranda will give her all the connections she wants. Soon this job takes over her life and she becomes one of those anorexic fashion girls she once hated. Soon she realizes what she has become and is fired and ready to pursue what she had wanted in the first place.All in all this novel wasn’t quite up to par of what I had wanted.

It was stated that Andrea's apartment lacked a kitchen. Literally a few paragraphs later a character went into the kitchen.

And why did it take her almost a whole year to tell her to fuck off?  And while I sympathized with Andrea the whole book there are only so many times I can read about how she is doing something crazy for Miranda. This is also set in America, that place they like to sue everyone. So why didn't she just take Miranda to court?

It gets old very fast. Also, why is the word ""dynamite"" used like an adjective signifying ""cool""?

Another interesting aspect is the author’s use of periphrasis. For example, Miranda Priestly, the boss, is referred to as “Her”(p2), girls in stilettos are dubbed, “clackers”(p13), one of Andrea’s beautiful co-workers is referred to as, “knock-out girl” (19), and some preppy college classmates are known as the, “Jappy girls”(35).

239,1362319115,08/12/2015,3.0,"Though I originally rated this book 5 stars, I feel as though I have to go back and change it to 2.5. The big difference? Re-reading five years later, after having seen the film, I think I can give a much wider perspective.I originally read this book back in 2015, and decently enjoyed it. That was the first year I did a GR challenge, and I hit (a not unimpressive!) 177 books, which is great. I was a pretty busy teenager. This was about halfway through the year, in August, before I proved my own illiteracy by reading the sort of fanfiction I did about the seventh Star Wars film. I've read a lot more since, and in reading some amazing books and especially learning about writing, my standards have changed. I used to be able to look past a lot of things I can't now. If you're someone who doesn't worry that much about Plot Quality and is here to read a drama-filled fun romp, you very well may enjoy this! I'm not surprised I liked it the first time.The book itself is a thinly veiled vent about Weisberger's real-life experience working for Anna Wintour (a fact that has certainly affected my current reading). I'll always believe that you need to write because you have a STORY in you, not because you want to vent or convince people of something, and this is evidence of that.Every story needs balance. A protag can't be all good, and an antag can't be all bad. This is why the film is actually stronger than the book in this case-- Miranda is much more sympathetic, and much less balls-to-the-wall evil, there. She's not forgetful, for example, the way she is in the book-- she's actually more reasonable with her demands, and also more generally competent; suddenly it is realistic that she's the top editor in New York.Because the author is Andy, no effort is made to show that she is the Best Ever Protag the author wants her to be, and so she really does come off as whiny and annoying-- a task immensely difficult to pull off when you're writing about a woman so hardworking she doesn't sleep a full five hours a night! It's this lack of balance that Weisberger suffers from, where we don't get to see Andy's strengths or an example of her not complaining. If all your MC does is complain, complain, complain, we're just not going to like her, even if she is suffering from the worst job of all time. Sure, she's happy about the designer clothes she gets on the job, but we never see her take an ounce of pride in her work-- another problem solved by the film, in which Andrea actually decides to give it her all and greatly benefits from it. This marks another major issue in the plot: it's pantsed, and you can tell. The author seems to operate by asking herself ""what can I have happen next?"" and then dropping some flaccid exposition into our laps. For example, Andrea decides in the film to begin wearing designer clothes because a friend points out to her that she hasn't been trying at her job, and she has been unfairly unsympathetic to people who like fashion (something never addressed in the book! Andy is allowed her unnuanced hatred and stereotyping of the world of fashion!). In the book, Weisberger merely starts a chapter by announcing that, after three months, Andy decides to switch up her wardrobe. Of course, she continues by revealing that people have been hinting to Andy that she ought to do it for months, and she gets weird looks every time she walks into the office, and so on and so forth... but why weren't we shown that?The answer is that someone slacked on the edits. I honestly feel bad bringing this up, because I think the most likely conclusion is that the editor themself slacked because the film rights were scooped while the novel was only 100 pages of manuscript, an outline, and a proposal. It seems like the publisher just wanted this thing out so the film could be put out as well. And, hey, people liked this book! ...and unfortunately, it's possible that some of the attitude towards its publishing was simply ""women are dumb and will like the drama, so who cares if the finished product has any literary merit whatsoever."" So we get this two-page spread where Andy arrives at work having given us nothing of interest in the chapter yet, only to exposit (we're over 100 pages in!) about how the Elias-Clarke building houses not only various papers but also a bank, and sometimes bankers flirt with the Runway girls, and here's a banker now, and he's........ (GASP) Lily's ex-boyfriend who cheated on her?? Let's talk about THAT for two paragraphs. None of this is relevant until the end of the book, where (view spoiler)[Lily (Andy's friend) getting back with this ex is seen as proof of her general downward decline (hide spoiler)]. Of course, that's after Lily openly encourages Andy to cheat on her boyfriend with some hot guy in publishing, which is the kind of inconsistency that could have been solved with editing!To explain what I mean, taking this example, imagine if we'd learned that Elias-Clarke housed bankers in a throwaway line when Andy interviewed. Then halfway through, we could have Andy in the middle of a Miranda run when she's held up by this idiot banker ex-boyfriend, and then we bring it all together in the third act. Why does this need to be two pages of seemingly useless information? Why does Lily have to be written so inconsistently? Why wasn't anyone willing to edit this book?And I have to give a shout-out to the nonstop bigotry. All the girls in fashion are anorexic, all the guys are gay, every person of color is essentially only their race-- anyone else catch when Andy moved out from her place with two Indian roommates she never bothered to tell apart and said she was tired of having everything in her apartment smell like CURRY POWDER? hello??-- and you can already guess it but the film did this better, too. It's partially in the correction of Andy's ""fashion is boring and useless"" viewpoint (repeated ad nauseum in the book, in part because of the lack of editing), but also in the fact that Miranda's right hand man in the film is Nigel, a gay man, who is an actual human being. His counterpart in the book speaks only in capital letters and oh my God I just remembered there was an AIDS ""joke"" made about the other main gay man at Runway. Andy is constantly talking about how she's clearly not fat, no, ew, that WOULD be a horrible thing to be, but the main issue is that the girls at Runway think her size six ass is fat, and it's not, because if she WERE fat then their fatphobia would be justified I guess? There is just a lot of unquestioned bigotry here, not even appropriate for the early 2000s, and I can't imagine it's wholly separate from the mean-spirited nature of the entire book.Even the one big thing I miss from this book when watching the film-- (view spoiler)[Andy getting to say ""fuck you, Miranda"" (hide spoiler)]-- is not that powerful here because we don't see a genuine lead-up to it. Some attempts are made to follow a plot structure, but with all that ""throw the kitchen sink at it and see if it helps"" pantsing nonsense, it just doesn't build enough to give that moment power. I'm about to betray all the lesbians out there, but this book doesn't even give me the homoerotic tension that the film does. I understand that neither piece of media is trying to, but in making such flat and stale characters, Weisberger inherently erases all potential interest in their relationship, whereas the film's well-rounded antagonist and protagonist make us care about how they feel for one another. To put it another way, this book can't even write female characters compelling enough for us to care about them, and that is a serious problem to me.So, in summary, I find the book pretty rough to read. I will freely admit I skimmed all that repetition and expositing past page 100 this time, because I just knew I didn't need it and I was having a bad time. That's the main reason we're at 2.5 and not 3 stars-- 3 stars I reserve for a book I can get through despite my complaining; this one I had to put down repeatedly and skim to survive. Oh, well. If you can look past the mean-spiritedness and enjoy the pure catty nature of the book, it's really not bad! (That would have merited 1 or 2 stars.) Recommend to diehard DWP film fans (prepare for disappointment), completionists (really don't think you should bother, Max), and people who are fine with books that aren't 'well-written', which I can 100% respect.EDIT: I realize I made this sound like there's no reason to like this book and if you do then you're just some pleb but THAT IS NOT TRUE!! It's honestly a really fun read when it's not exposition-y and I only hold animosity about the bigotry. Nonsense drama should be accessible to everyone.",2,-0.9344,0.099,0.809,0.093,0.5457793496186357,NEGATIVE,0.998
240,4038860717,06/03/2021,1.0,"I had low expectations of this book, yet I emerged disappointed nonetheless.""The Devil Wears Prada"" was supposed to be about a relatable small-town girl who gets herself mixed up in the high fashion industry in New York. However, Andrea was such an unlikeable character that I failed to sympathize with. The author intended to garner pity for our poor protagonist who has a meanie boss and is surrounded by models in a fashion magazine while she's... a size 6! Instead, she comes off as obnoxious, ungrateful, and generally unpleasant.At the start, Andrea is basically handed this job because of her ""not like other girls"" attitude (this theme is repeated A LOT). For the interview, she doesn't prepare, dresses sloppily, has little to no knowledge about the company she applied for, and doesn't even know the most famous and successful author of the Runway magazine. If anything, this was probably one of the most unrealistic aspects of the novel. Despite this, Andrea still gets the job and everything works out for her. Along the way, Andrea gets wrapped up in an irrelevant and dumb love triangle with a *gasp* rich and famous writer who's inexplicably attracted to her because of her ""wit"" and ""sarcasm"" unlike the other stuck up models, amiright. Ughhhhhh! While she's not cheating on her actual boyfriend, Alex, Andrea is toiling away at her job as Miranda Priestly's assistant. Every single time she does something for Miranda, Andrea ALWAYS complains about every little thing. Miranda is so rude, she didn't say thank you! Miranda never talks to me! Miranda makes impossible demands! Miranda wants me to get her coffee AND breakfast! Like, I get it. Miranda is a demanding boss who's not there to be her friend. But that's literally your job!!! To be her assistant!!! After a while, Andrea's complaints came off as overused and annoying, as it never amounted to anything more than, ""Miranda is evil!!"".Another one of the issues I had with the book was Miranda's character. So we know that Andrea obviously dislikes her, however, one quote of Andrea's thoughts stuck out to me:""How many girls had no idea that the object of their worship was a lonely, deeply unhappy, and oftentimes cruel woman who didn't deserve the briefest moment of their innocent affection and attention?""What? Nowhere in the book is Miranda ever described to be ""lonely"" or ""deeply unhappy"". She has a husband and two children who she makes sure to spend time with, and never in the book do they ever say anything about THAT negative about her. In fact, throughout the story, Miranda is shown to try to make time to see and be around her girls. Who said she's lonely? I feel like the author was trying to flesh out some other side of Miranda but failed to provide any sustenance for it.Finally, the author also sends troublingly warped messages about sexual assault and victim-blaming. When Andrea's friend, Lily, drunkenly brings a guy back to their apartment, Andrea says these words to her:""Lily, just imagine how drunk you had to be to agree to not only have sex with someone who looks like that...""""Lil, sweetie, I don't think the problem is the guy. I think it's the drinking that's causing it.""NO!!! Lily did NOT give consent to him! You cannot give consent when under the influence of alcohol like how Lily was. Lily was sexually assaulted, and Andrea blames her friend because she was drinking rather than the man who took advantage of her. This part of the book (around 80% through) left me with an even worse impression of it, but I kept going out of pure spite.I won't go into every annoying aspect of the book, but to summarize, I personally did not enjoy it. ""The Devil Wears Prada"" had somewhat of an interesting (albeit cheesy) idea: a look into the fashion industry through a normal girl's perspective. Instead, we got a woman in her early twenties constantly complaining about her job and being inconsiderate to the people around her. Right. Thanks.

I just really don’t like what it’s trying to be either.To be invested in the story you have to buy that Andrea needs to do this job for a year and then she’ll somehow get a job at the New Yorker. Through the majority of the book I didn’t understand why or how that would happen, so I didn’t understand her determination to work at this horrible job for a year. It made it very difficult to care.I was also confused by Miranda as “the devil.” It took a good while for her to feel like *crazy* levels of horrible. I didn’t see her fire or threaten to fire a single person until the very end. I felt like it took too long to really feel her awfulness.Other things I didn’t like:1) Lots of casual racism, especially at the beginning 2) Boring details, including the multiple (Kindle) page snippet from the Bulletin and a description of the floor plan of the office3) Repetitive crises and conflicts - oh she tried to make another plan with Alex? I wonder what will happen…4) I kept expecting her to have to have a reason to write for Runway - got my hopes up when the travel writer called, only to have nothing come of it. Got my hopes up again when she had to write a speech. Nope. It would have been an interesting turn of events if she’d had an opportunity to write and have something come of it, but that was never something the story explored. I never even understood exactly *what* she wanted to write. Writing “for the New Yorker” could be a lot of things. In the end she writes a short story, which is not something you’d write as an employee of the New Yorker… you’d think if she wants to write so badly I’d have a better idea of what she wants to write!!Things I wanted to like but failed me because this isn’t trying to be literary fiction:1) The discussion around beauty standards and eating disorders. I wanted more, it would have been a perfect thing to address. When Anita writes to Miranda and Andrea is like, this lady creates problems for girls like Anita - let’s get into that!! No? Ok..2) The discussion around Lily’s alcohol abuse and other self medication strategies. Let’s get into that! Oh she’s just a device to give Andrea a crisis… ok.3) The discussion around awful “idea” people, powerful people, whose bad behavior is tolerated because they are “geniuses.” I loved when Andrea is talking to Emily and trying to get Emily to see that Miranda’s genius does not excuse treating Emily and others like trash.

250,867731854,02/28/2014,4.0,"I think this is one of the rare cases where I liked the movie better. The book was good, but I feel like the movie did a better job capturing what the author was going for. In the movie, I got the impression that Andrea was desperate for a job, any job, that would help her career path. In the book, she could have stayed with her parents longer, but didn't want to. Could have moved in with her boyfriend, but didn't want to. Could have stayed on her friend's couch, but didn't want to. Applied to the magazine in a random daze while sick (i.e did not seek out amazing opportunity, was not even aware this *was* an amazing opportunity), got the interview, and meh, why not, decided to work there.In the movie, her boss was the devil from the get go. In the book she had a month of boss free time where she sat around wrapping Christmas presents and learned the ropes. Honestly, her boss didn't even seem that bad. Her requests were demanding, but Andrea seemed more irate at having to send out her dry cleaning than track down the Harry Potter book before publication. Maybe this is a problem with the book being a bit dated, but nowadays that position might not even pay. It's not exactly unusual to graduate college, work in a competitive internship for pennies or college credit, get stressed beyond belief, have a boss from hell, and hate your life, but suck it up because that's the job market. Andrea had this golden opportunity handed to her (she didn't even seem to actively seek it out, which is irritating) with tons of perks and spent so much time whining about stuff that shouldn't have bugged her, that the stuff that should have didn't pack a punch. Plus she did SO much stuff she should have been fired for (buying four cups of coffee every day for the local homeless people on the magazine's dime as one example), that the constant ""threat"" of her getting fired never felt real.The moral of the story felt heavy handed. Sorry, it's actually not Andrea's responsibility to crash her career for the sake of her alcoholic friend. And anyone who has ever had any experience with real alcoholics knows it's not about their friends or their support net, it's about the alcoholic. No friend, no matter how great can help an alcoholic that doesn't want to help themselves. Had Andrea actually been available all year, she wouldn't have stopped her friends descent into darkness or whatever. She most likely would have just enabled her. But I would have had much more respect for Andy had she actually asked to rush home and been coldly shut down then quit in a fit of rage instead of the sequence of events that occurred. I would have more respect for her if she had asked. Period. However, in the real world, where crashing with your parents for the next couple months after losing your job *isn't* an option, she'd have to suck it up and stay in Paris for a couple days, distracted and worried, but responsible. And boyfriend guy, why schedule a trip and book a hotel room and all that stuff three weeks before the end of her internship? And by the way, I remember my first year student teaching (which as a teach for America candidate was his experience only 1,000 more hectic), an absentee significant other isn't even on your radar. Parents, why get so upset she hasn't seen her nephew three weeks before the end of her internship (okay, that one's pretty bad, but why even bring it up right then?) Andrea, why assume you can take a vacation while your boss is out of town when throughout the entire book everyone has been telling you how much work it is when she *isn't* there and you experienced that twice? Even if she hadn't gone to Paris, how many times did she call Emily while she was there? The conflict would have happened no matter what. I just couldn't figure whether or not her job was really that bad, or if Andrea was just so spoiled she didn't know how to handle having a job. The truth was probably somewhere in the middle, but that didn't seem to be what the story kept trying to tell me. The show and the tell sent massively different messages. Her boss sounded like a jerk, but what actually happened when Andrea couldn't deliver her impossible demands (which occurred several times in the book)? Nothing. No consequences beyond a bit of verbal assault, which, again, wasn't actually that bad. I've heard a lot worse. I've heard a lot of really good people who have actually had to fight tooth and nail for their job and to whom keeping said job was the difference between feeding their families or not, duck their head and put up with much worse. Fun read, and despite my gripes about the character it actually was fun to read and well written. I enjoyed the dialogue and the descriptions. It's a good book. I just couldn't buy into the premise.

255,3546242613,09/27/2020,1.0,"If it wasn't for my wife, I never would have watched the film. And if I hadn't enjoyed the film as much as I did, I never would have picked up the book for us to read together when I found it at Vinnies or wherever it was. The film is surprisingly very enjoyable, wonderfully acted by all involved - even Anne Hathaway who I usually don't like. After reading this absolute travesty of a novel though, I think the woman who adapted it into a screenplay, Aline Brish McKenna, is the unrecognised genius who pulled a good story out. I suppose you might say the book contains the bare bones of the movie's plot, but this is one of those rare - but not entirely unknown about - instances when the book should be steered well clear of. The film does everything so, so much better. The book lacks the complexity and the moral dilemmas and even the general likability of the film. As I said to my wife, as essay could be written about why this novel does not work. But the book does not warrant that amount of time spent on it. Clocking in a just under 400 pages, it has already taken too much of that from me. Andrea is one of the worst protagonists I have been confronted with in a while. She's extremely annoying, spends almost all the book whining - and not just about her boss, but her friends, her family, her general position in life as well. She's dumb and always says stupid shit. She throws her friends under the bus - like in the movie - only there is little denial about the fact, making it all the more unforgivable. Plus, she does not earn her redemption like Hathaway's film-version does. Miranda is a terrible villain, not in the love-to-hate way that Meryl Steep's version is. She's just annoying and stupid and, unbelievably, she doesn't even feature nearly as much in the book. Unlike the film, most of the book spends an ungodly amount of time obsessing over fashion items (even though the protagonist, the focal point through which the author writes, proclaims to have no interest in fashion). Otherwise she's running around doing menial tasks. There is none of the manipulative relationship the film showcases between Andrea and Mirander. Basically they just openly hate each other the whole time, then towards the end Miranda incomprehensibly changes but then changes again, so that Andrea can have her big ""fuck you, and fuck fashion"" moment which I guess was supposed to be triumphant and satisfying to the reader. Only at this point, anyone with common sense ought to feel like she is really the story's villain - not Mirander, whose behaviour and expectations were known about and communicated to Andrea before she even took the job.Christian, as the romantic interest that threatens to steal Andrea away from her boyfriend, is the laziest handling of such a situation I have come across. He just pops in and out of the story with little follow-up in between. Emily is inconsistent - she randomly turns nice to Andrea once in a while, but it never makes sense. In the end, the much cooler relationship the two girls share in the film ends up being much more emotionally satisfying. Nigel, played by the excellent Stanley Tucci in the film, is replaced by James, an early-2000's stereotypical gay guy, shouting campy innuendoes in capital letters. And, though I hate to sound like an SJW here, there's this strangely racist attitude underlying the whole worldview Andrea holds. This book completely lacks charm, is impossible to like, is way too long and just comes off as overly judgemental. Stick with the film.",2,-0.9925,0.159,0.736,0.105,0.6079943502824857,NEGATIVE,1.0
256,428861620,10/06/2012,4.0,"The Devil Wears Prada is a fun, light read. By now many readers will have either seen or heard of the movie, and I had too. I tend to create mental pictures of fictional characters, sometimes using actors, and other times inserting the faces of people I have known in real life. In this case, I could not imagine anyone other than Meryl Streep as Miranda Priestly, the boss from hell. Andrea Sachs has finished college and yearns to write for a big-name magazine, preferably The New Yorker. She stumbles across the opportunity to break into the publishing world as Priestly’s assistant. This is a job with a high rate of turnover, and one can see why from the moment the position commences. There is no such thing as off-the-clock time. Sachs is on call 24-7, often for such trifling things as a gift for Priestly’s snarky twin daughters, or the ubiquitous dry cleaning. If it rains, Sachs is blamed. If a flight is late, Priestly wonders why Sachs couldn’t anticipate this problem and deal with it. Sachs is constantly demeaned and belittled, and she puts up with it because of the immense amount of power Priestly represents in her chosen field. Sachs watches her relationships flounder as she is constantly required to break personal engagements in order to leap whenever her phone buzzes. She keeps at it knowing that at the end of a year with Priestly, her career in print journalism will either be made or broken by her boss.The book spins an over-the-top villain at the perfect place in time. The book was published in 2007, and this was a time when the First World had just begun to realize the downside that is inherent in the brave new world of satellite-based communications. People that used to enjoy going on vacation and walking away from their telephone now take it with them, and this is often either a plainly stated part of their job, or a better-safe-than-sorry aspect of damage control. I didn’t have to do this during my twenty years as a public school teacher; so far, teachers really can carve out a part of their time away from the classroom purely for personal privacy and enjoyment. However, my husband is in the tech field, and though work didn’t phone him while he was away, he constantly checked into his work e-mail via laptop computer, insisting that it was better to know if a crisis was unfolding so he could be prepared to meet it upon his return rather than being blindsided and unprepared. The movie version of the story develops Priestly a bit more and keeps her character from being a cardboard cutout. Unfortunately, the book doesn’t do that. But then, this is not serious literature; this is a romp.Though many modern professionals are married to their phones and other devices all the time, Weisberger has spun a tale that will make just about anyone gratefully reflect that their own job is better than that. So like horror stories, part of the joy in reading this fluffy beach read is in comparing one’s own life favorably to that of the protagonist.If you have a generous book-buying budget and want a fun read to pack for your beach trip or an escapist weekend at home, this one is a great choice. If your budget is tighter, try your public library; that’s where I found my copy. Unless you have a schedule like Sachs’s, you likely won’t have difficulty finishing this one by its due date.Great beach read; fluffy escapist novel.",2,0.9403,0.071,0.828,0.101,0.4997954333248451,NEGATIVE,0.9299
257,404739412,08/31/2012,4.0,"Though I've never seen the much raved over movie, I can honestly say that this has been one of the funniest novels of any genres that I've ever read. Andrea Sachs, fresh out of college, finds herself moving into New York City and landing a job at the Runway , one of the top fashion magazines in the world as a (shudder shudder) fashion assistant. She is employed by Miranda Priestly, who has made a name for herself in both the publishing world and being a terrible, terrible boss. There were so many times where I reread a section over and over again in disbelief-- there are no other words to describe Miranda (she hates being called Ma'am and Ms. Priestly) than as an ill-tempered, spontaneous, and harsh banshee. And as her junior assistant (she needs two assistants to do her chores for her because she's such an important woman), Andrea experiences the full force of her wrath. For example, Andrea (or Ahn-dre-ah, if you're the head editor of a famous fashion magazine with a British accent) does menial tasks like buying Miranda breakfast and hunting down a review for obscure asian fusion restaurants. I recall thinking before starting the book that Miranda couldn't possibly be that bad: honestly, it's not like she'll chain her employees to the office wall and make them work thirteen hour shifts. Thankfully, the former did not occur, yet the latter was achieved by a greatly sleep-deprived Andy. Needless to say, the main character does not find joy in her job.Sadly, I am not sadistic enough to enjoy the book purely because of the aforementioned tortures; it is more of the way Andrea reacts internally to Miranda's outrageous commands. One may ask why Andrea endures a job she loathes with her mind, body, and soul. Actually, she could've quit her one-year contract the day she started if she'd like. But apparently a letter of recommendation from Miranda-- Andrea's ultimate prize -- is equivalent to five years of being a regular assistant at another publishing office. Thus, Andy sells her soul to the devil who wears Prada suits.One of the other things that delighted me was how much Andrea (and her wardrobe) changed during the course of her career. She mentions herself how starting her job felt like such a long time ago, and how people who've never met Miranda are incredibly lucky. It was scary how much I agreed with her by the end of the book, too.This novel is definitely not written for male readers (it is probably classified under chick-lit), and I wholeheartedly agree with this. Not to sound prejudiced, but I don't think any guys will enjoy reading about a list of gifts that Miranda receives from various fashion designers, and reading brand names so many times that you can literally name most of them off the top of your head. But if you don't mind that, then go ahead...dig in!(if you're like me, you'll probably finish it within seven hours of nonstop reading)",2,0.9409,0.048,0.862,0.09,0.4938159063159064,NEGATIVE,0.6652

Andrea Sachs, fresh out of college with an English major has dreamed of being a reporter since she was a little girl. Her goal is to work for The New Yorker but knows she has to pay her dues first by getting experience in an entry-level job in the industry.

It's finally when Miranda acknowledges, ""You remind me of yourself when I was your age"" that Andrea realises she has lost sense of the person she used to be. Even if you haven't watched the movie, you can probably predict what happens. This is ""chick lit"" written with humour and humanity.

Working for Miranda Priestly, the highly editor of ""Runway"" Magazine, Andrea was her assistant, which was a job that almost any women would take in a heartbeat. The high fashion, high life, and constant attention that would be seen at every corner of the office at ""Runway"" is a life that seems great from a bystanders view, however after just a couple of hours, Andrea realizes her job may be more than she intended. Miranda, in fact, turned out to be a so called boss from hell with everything she put Andrea through. Everything from taking notes to running across town to do a small favor. Andrea had to spend less time at home, and slowly started to question whether or not the job was worth her sanity. Having a boss from hell is something that everyone fears, however my uncle was unlucky enough to actually get one. After he was done talking to my father about it, my dad started laughing because it reminded him of the movie ""The Devil Wears Prada"", and after that I took some interest and decided to read the book. Many aspects of the book made it very enjoyable, and fun to read. Andrea, the assistant, was the narrator of the book, so it was great to see everything through her eyes, along with everything she thought as well. I believed that was a great perspective to tell the story through because the gossip behind the boss' back was caught as well. Perfect book to read when you are bored and need something that will keep your attention. Personally, I feel that the book could have been much better if it wasn't so repetitive with what Andrea was required to do. It got very tiring when I had to read the same thing over and over again. I understand that it could show how awful the job was, however it also made some parts of the book pretty awful. All in all however, ""The Devil Wears Prada"" is a book that I would recommend to anyone looking for a quick read that shows the classic ""boss from hell"" story.

Perfectly shows that if you want to achieve something, there is nothing that can stop you (even your monster boss...). I loved this book so much that I can surely give it 5 stars. When I started reading, the first thing that I liked was the language. In this book it is very clear, without any weird slangs or difficult terms, often also very funny. It really helped me get through that quite long book. Also, every character is different here and this difference is shown very well. Andrea, Alex, Lily, Emily, Miranda - they are all described diversely, with various personality traits. Due to that it was easy to remember each of them and the book wasn't boring. But my favourite character, who is also a magnificent narrator, is definitely Andrea. I love her nature. She is determined and has charisma. She wants to write for well-known magazines, instead of that she ends up being younger 'assistant' of an well-known magazine editor - Miranda. She knows that being an assistant (which actually means 'serving someone') has nothing in common with writing. She hates her job and her boss, but she doesn't give up. She works hard, leaving her family, best friend and boyfriend behind, because she has a goal that she wants to reach. Every next page of this book I was more and more amazed how she kept sacrificing her life for her job. I highly recommend this book for everyone. Despite the number of pages, you read it quickly because there is always something going on and the action never slows down.Also, it tells a brilliant story. A story of an ordinary girl, who teaches us that, of course, your goals are very important, but there is nothing that can replace your family or friends. You should try very hard to reach these goals, but you shouldn't forget that sometimes doing something on a push can hurt more than just letting go.And (since I love happy endings) I'm so glad that Andrea finally got her dream job.

262,400663894,08/26/2012,5.0,"Funnily enough, although this was Lauren Weisberger's debut novel, it is the las by her that I read. I've now completed her entire line of novels and I'd started with her most recent (at the time). The last time I reviewed a novel by Weisberger, I'd complained it was too much like another I'd read, so I was a little reluctant to read The Devil Wears Prada. I was, however, pleasantly surprised by TDWP and have the movie all set On Demand to start as soon as I finish this review. Andrea (Andy) Sachs is a bright-eyed recent college-grad looking to get a job in the magazine industry. Her dream is to work for The New Yorker, but she wanders into a job at Runway, the most ""it"" fashion magazine around. She ends up as the junior assistant to the editor, an insanely demanding woman named Miranda Priestly. The novel reads like a memoir with little flashbacks and changes in time, but mostly follows along chronologically. Andy has a best friend, Lily, who has a drinking problem, a do-gooder boyfriend, and, of course, an extremely challenging boss and a life-consuming job. The story is told with wit and humor, and I was always eager to find out what was going to happen next. I wanted to see how long Andy would be able to ut up with Miranda, whether she would eventually come around to the fashion world insanity, or if Miranda would ever soften. The progression was satisfying and not as predictable (although not unbelievable at all) as I would have expected. I truly enjoyed reading this book and, as I've literally JUST finished the book, I'm a little sad that it's over.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone at any time. It isn't pigeon-holed into summer beach read or anything, and I think it would appeal to many ages.

Also, if one is not familiar with some fashion terms, there may be some difficulty in understanding what the author is talking about.Also, despite the fact that there are similarities between that and the movie version, there are a lot more differences than there are similarities.

As her time under the thumb of this self-possessed, uber-demanding witch continues, Andrea finds all the things she used to cherish - her family, boyfriend, and best friend - slipping away from her. It definitely had its funny moments, but all in all I wasn't too impressed with Andrea. She was snobbish and I was simply not convinced that she or anyone else believed her constant torment as Junior Assistant was really worth a vague possibility that Miranda could get her any job she wished at the end of it (her dream is to work at The New Yorker). I found myself repeatedly wondering why she didn't just quit already. Still, it was a decently light and fun way to pass an otherwise intolerably long commute.

Lily gets in a car accident and is in a coma and Andrea wants to stay in Paris! She doesn't want to come home to see her best friend when she needs her??? She even tells Miranda this and Miranda complements her on how dedicated she is. What?? Then Miranda asks Andrea to get her children new passports by the end the night and that makes Andrea quit?? That just didn't make any sense to me. It should have been that Andrea demanded to go home to be at Lily's bedside and Miranda saying no, then that making Andrea quit.

Miranda because she is such a horrible bitch who needs to be taken down a peg or 500. And Andrea because all she had to do to make it all go away was quit.
