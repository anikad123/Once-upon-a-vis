1,503731092,01/11/2013,4.0,"Angela's Ashes: a memoir of a childhood (Frank McCourt #1), Frank McCourtAngela's Ashes: A Memoir is a 1996 memoir by the Irish-American author Frank McCourt, with various anecdotes and stories of his childhood. The narrative is told from the point of view of Frankie as a child. Born in Brooklyn, New York, on 19 August 1930, Frank (Francis) McCourt is the oldest son of Malachy McCourt and Angela Sheehan McCourt. Both of his parents emigrated from Ireland and married in a shotgun wedding over Angela's pregnancy with Frankie. Angela is from Limerick, Ireland, and is fond of music, singing, and dancing. Malachy, from Northern Ireland, is an alcoholic known for his ""odd manner"" and for telling the stories about Irish heroes. Frankie is said to resemble his father, having a hang-dog face and the same ""odd manner.""In Brooklyn, the McCourts live in modern tenement housing next to a park and share a floor, and an indoor lavatory, with other immigrant families. Frankie has four younger siblings in Brooklyn: Malachy, born in 1931; twins Oliver and Eugene, born in 1932; and an infant sister, Margaret, in 1935.The family struggles with poverty because Malachy Sr.'s efforts to find work are complicated by his alcoholism. The family's prospects, and Angela's spirits, lift whenever he finds a new job and brings home his wages, but soon he finds himself spending all of his pay in bars, despite Angela's schemes to prevent him from doing so. He loses each job after a few weeks. ...عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «خاکسترهای آنجلا»؛ «خاکستر آنجلا»؛ «اجاق سرد آنجلا»؛ «اشک آنجلا»؛ نویسنده: فرانک مک کورت؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز هجدهم ماه سپتامبر سال 2001میلادیعنوان: خاکسترهای آنجلا؛ نویسنده: فرانک مک کورت؛ مترجم: پریسا محمدی نژنده؛ تهران، درفام، 1377؛ موضوع: سرگذشتنامه امریکاییهای ایرلندی تبار - آداب و رسوم مردمان ایرلند - سده 20معنوان: اجاق سرد آنجلا؛ نویسنده: فرانک مک کورت؛ مترجم: گلی امامی؛ تهران، فرزان روز، 1379؛ در 600ص؛ شابک 9643210529؛ چاپ سوم 1385؛ شابک 9789643210526؛ چاپ پنجم 13933؛ عنوان: اشک آنجلا؛ نویسنده: فرانک مک کورت؛ مترجم: زهرا تابشیان؛ تهران، نشر دشتستان، 1378؛ در 518ص؛ شابک 9649174877؛ عنوان: خاکستر آنجلا؛ نویسنده: فرانک مک کورت؛ مترجم: نینا پزشکیان؛ تهران، بدرقه جاویدان، 1380؛ در 618ص؛ شابک 9649345469؛ عنوان: خاکسترهای آنجلا؛ نویسنده: فرانک مک کورت؛ مترجم: منیژه شیخ جوادی (بهزاد)؛ تهران، پیکان، 1384؛ در 470 ص؛خود نگاشت زندگینامه ای اثر «فرانک مک کورت» است؛ «خاکسترهای آنجلا»، یا «اجاق سرد آنجلا»، اتوبیوگرافی نویسنده ی ایرلندی تبار آمریکایی، که در سال 1996میلادی برای نخستین بار منتشر شده‌ است؛ رمان زندگی «فرانک مک‌ کورت» در «کودکی»، و «نوجوانی»؛ در «بروکلین نیویورک»، و «لیمریک (شهری در ایرلند)» است؛ داستان، شرح زندگی فقیرانه ی «فرانک»، پدر دائم‌ الخمرش «مالکی»، که پولی برای خانواده باقی نمی‌گذاشته، و نیز بازگویی تلاش‌های مادرش «آنجلا»، برای نجات خانواده است؛ خاکسترهای «آنجلا»، برنده ی جایزه ی «پولیتزر»، در رشته ی زندگی‌نامه در سال 1997میلادی شده؛ «فرانک مک‌کورت»، کتابک «تیز» را در سال 1999میلادی، و «آقا معلم» را در سال 2005میلادی، به عنوان دنباله ی «خاکسترهای آنجلا» به چاپ رسانده اند؛تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 11/07/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 09/06/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی",224,-0.5744,0.025,0.958,0.017,0.3034759358288769,POSITIVE,0.6693
2,1557259027,02/22/2016,5.0,"I think I read Angela’s Ashes by Frank McCourt initially when the book was first published. In high school at the time, my mother and I shared books. I was introduced to all of her favorite authors that way and most of these authors I still read now. One author who was new to both of us at the time was New York school teacher Frank McCourt who published a memoir of his life growing up in Brooklyn and Limerick, Ireland. As with most books from that era, I had vague recollections because I spent the next twenty years finishing high school and college and raising a family. Books I read in high school were not at the forefront of my mind. Since my youngest daughter transitioned to a full school day three years ago, I have gone back and read all of those forgotten to me books from high school through adult eyes. The experience has been for the most part positive with only a few books that stand out as disliking. With my ongoing lifetime Pulitzer challenge focusing on nonfiction winners this year, I decided to finally turn my attention back to Angela’s Ashes and found it a worthy book indeed. Angela Sheehan immigrated to America from Limerick, Ireland at the onset of the Depression. Life in the slums of Limerick was unbearable even for a champion ballroom dancer like Angela. Immediately after stepping off the boat, Angela meets Malachy McCourt and becomes pregnant by him. Being good Catholics, the couple gets married. Five months later, Frank is born, followed in close succession by Malachy, twins Oliver and Eugène, and Margaret. Malachy (the father) is a chronic drunk and spends all of his wages on drinks in local pubs. The children have no food, Margaret dies from SIDS, the twins wear rags for diapers, and Angela is inconsolable. At the urging of cousins, the family emigrates back to Limerick because as destitute as life is there, the McCourts will be among family who can support them in their desperate hour. Ireland and its green land of the River Shannon and Cuchulain the hero who died for the country do not solve Malachy’s drinking problem. He can barely hold a job and Angela and the children still have barely any food to eat. The children still wear rags for diapers and the family shares two beds in flea and lice infested apartments where an entire building shares one bathroom. The twins succumb to illness and all is too much for Angela to handle. Her mother and sister have no sympathy for her situation and the family is relegated to going on the dole and asking for handouts at St Vincent of the Destitute. The McCourts eventually move to a home at the top of Roden Lane. It is as decrepit as their other homes but at least no one died there despite having one lavatory for the entire street that is right outside of their home. Although a chronic drunk, Malachy makes the best of the situation naming the downstairs portion of their home Ireland and the upstairs Italy. The children rarely have food but at least they have each other and stories told of old Ireland by the fireplace each morning. Frank and Malachy and eventually surviving brothers Michael and Alphonsus attend the Leamy National School for the poor. Run by priests, it is a quality education despite the fact that most of the boys rarely eat, wear dilapidated shoes, and have parents who survive on the dole or handouts. The River Shannon and its environs sickens the air and Frank can name many friends and acquaintances who have died over the years of consumption. Yet, despite the horrendous upbringing that Frank McCourt knew, Angela’s Ashes had me laughing over the course of the book as he used humor to get through the darkest of situations of his life. His uncle Pa Keating was quite the character and interactions with him had me in stitches. Frank’s fear of confession to the priests and then his time in confession was also laced with comedy, as were most every other episode in the memoir, including dance lessons and mooching off school to run in an apple orchard with friends. If the situation was not so dire, perhaps comedy would not have been needed, yet Frank McCourt had a gift with words even as a kid. It was this gift that had his mother and other relatives telling him that he would go far in life in spite of the environs of Limerick during the darkest days of both the Depression and World War II. With a drunk father and destitute mother, Frank desired to go to America as soon as he had the means to do so. By age nineteen, he sailed on a reverse trip back to New York and Frank was in America to stay. Eventually Malachy would follow and they would develop a comedic act for two about growing up poor in Ireland. Angela’s Ashes, despite the impoverished environment that it describes, is one of the most inspiring books I have read. How could anyone have an attitude other than positive and expect to rise from the slums of Limerick and make something of one’s life. Frank McCourt could find humor in any situation, even one that saw his parents bury three children and live for nearly twenty years on public assistance. Angela’s Ashes brings to light this horrendous situation and has me realize that even though the United States was also hit by depression, it is still the land of opportunity for people around the globe, the McCourts included. Thankfully, Frank McCourt reached New York and eventually told his story to the world, offering a beacon of light in even the darkest of times. 5 stars",160,0.9287,0.086,0.809,0.105,0.4701381013352844,POSITIVE,0.5682

Spiritual fulfilment in the split-level comfort of a Long Island ranch home?

It’s difficult to imagine anything worse than a childhood crushed under the oppressive conditions of abject poverty, relentless filth and unmitigated suffering. The childhood described in this book is the worst I’ve ever encountered. The “lucky” children suffer injuries or illnesses that (due to poverty) go untreated and result in death. The rest suffer miserable existences. Actually, “suffer” and “miserable” are not adequate to describe the experience. The children in “Angela’s Ashes” would have traded their lives for a life of merely suffering a miserable childhood in a heartbeat.And yet, somehow, Frank McCourt achieves a brilliant feat in this book. He tells a horrific story that caused me to cringe, grind my teeth, cry and loose sleep worrying. This book affected me physically. It was beyond upsetting.

And speaking of atmosphere, McCourt writes so descriptively and which such skill that you can really picture everything he's talking about. It's incredibly well written, with a Joycean stream of consciousness that again contributes to the immersive quality of the story.

Quite a few unleashed verbal vitriol at McCourt's memoir, claiming that it is not entirely accurate and that it is too mawkish/maudlin/bathetic. Others claim that the author romanticizes the penury and destitution of the lives in his lane. First, no memoir can ever be 100% truthful; our memories are incomplete and sporadic (at best). In fact, as I read I liked that there were NO quotation marks used to indicate speech. I actually thought that was a subtle way to indicate the author wholeheartedly admitting that it is impossible to accurately recall conversations from one's childhood. The book does not have to represent a meticulously accurate picture of what Limerick was like at the time; all it has to do, and all any memoir purports to do, is reveal what life in a particular place was like AS EXPERIENCED BY THE AUTHOR. Plus, who cares about inaccuracies--a good story is a good story.To say it is maudlin is extreme. There are many unfortunate events that take place; however, not once did I get the sense that McCourt was trying to manipulate his readers' sympathies. Events were described as a child would experience them...kind of like a Scout Finch as narrator. It is this fact that led some reviewers to claim that McCourt romanticized the rampant squalor and death. That would be like saying To Kill a Mockingbird romanticizes racial prejudice.Anyway, it was an absorbing read filled with personal tragedies and laced with humor.

I laughed, I cried, I felt dearly for the disadvantaged McCourt family that struggled against all odds.The memoir borrows heavily from the art of realism -- as tales of impoverished childhoods usually are. McCourt was born in depression era Brooklyn to an alcoholic father who spent all his wages at the bar, and a mother disgraced and desperate to feed her starving children. Here, we have a glimpse at the life of an Irish family living in a ratty (but ethnically diverse) tenement building. The children were often left their own devices, while the adults struggled with adult problems -- keeping a home, putting food on the table, etc. Loss is a prevalent and recurring theme in the book. Frankie's siblings, as young as several months, were victims of death many times.Things don't improve when they move back to Ireland to start over. Their North-Irish and alcoholic of a father couldn't find work, drank all the charity money they managed to get, and eventually abandoned his family for good. Meanwhile, the rest of the family must overcompensate by stealing, begging, and applying for public assistance -- the shame of which deeply affect each member of the family. Additionally, Frankie, a devout Catholic, must reconcile his church values and practices with stealing to feed his family, his sexual awakening, and the continuing deaths of his family and acquaintances. All in all, fantastic depression-era slice-of-life of a poor Irish family. McCourt is soulful and has a way with weaving tales and building characters.

Then in another chapter, I'm crying with grief over the loss of his siblings and the humiliations of his mother. But as awful as his childhood was, he tells it in such a way - GOD, it's funny.

24,2194952233,01/16/2020,4.0,"Non-fiction memoir about Frank McCourt’s family from his birth in 1930 to 1949. After being born in Brooklyn in 1930, Frank’s father, Malachy, has troubles with alcohol and with finding work, and, during the Great Depression, decides to return to Ireland. The alcohol and work issues continue in Ireland, and the growing family lives in poverty.The titular Angela is Frank’s long-suffering mother. She endures a seemingly never-ending series of hardships, including her husband’s alcoholism, abandonment, and the deaths of multiple children. McCourt gives us an idea of her character: “You never know when you might come home and find Mam sitting by the fire chatting with a woman and a child, strangers. Always a woman and child. Mam finds them wandering the streets and if they ask, Could you spare a few pennies, miss? her heart breaks. She never has money so she invites them home for tea and a bit of fried bread and if it’s a bad night she’ll let them sleep by the fire on a pile of rags in the corner. The bread she gives them always means less for us and if we complain she says there are always people worse off and we can surely spare a little from what we have.”While the misery is vividly portrayed, McCourt offsets it with subtle humor. For example, his father would drunkenly awaken his children during the night, singing patriotic songs and making them pledge to die for Ireland, leading Frank to observe: “The master says it’s a glorious thing to die for the Faith and Dad says it’s a glorious thing to die for Ireland and I wonder if there’s anyone in the world who would like us to live.” At one point, his mother wants him to learn to dance, leading to: how I can die for Ireland if I have to sing and dance for Ireland, too. I wonder why they never say, You can eat sweets and stay home from school and go swimming for Ireland.”It is written from a child’s perspective in present tense. Much of the narrative is extremely detailed, and it may be too much description of misery for some people. I found it poignant, filled with both tragedy and humor. I particularly enjoyed all references to books and storytelling McCourt encountered in his youth, as it would be very easy for people living under dire conditions to never be exposed to literature.",37,-0.9705,0.13,0.786,0.084,0.4669191919191919,POSITIVE,0.9992
25,986049209,07/04/2014,5.0,"What makes this book special and makes it evocative of the era, is not just the painful details of a poverty-stricken Irish Catholic childhood lived during World War II, but the beautiful voice of the young Frank McCourt. The man, the writer of this book, the adult Frank McCourt, brings his youthful self alive in a way that brings the reader into direct contact with the author as a child. The details of McCourt’s life and the things that young Frank notices evoke a certain era, and certain struggles that have been well documented both in fiction and non-fiction. But no one produced a young Frank McCourt. This character, real and reanimated, leaps from the pages to join the reader’s household. Like few other books I’ve read, Angela’s Ashes is a cure for loneliness. When you read this prize-winning memoir, you’re not alone, but instead have young and humorous Frank standing over your shoulder telling you what mam says and what da says. In this classically dysfunctional Irish Catholic family the parents advice rarely agrees leaving little Frankie to figure life out for himself—another archetypal element from the Irish Catholic childhoods of a few generations ago.This book transcends the genre, making it fully deserving of the attention and prizes lauded to it and its author.",38,0.9741,0.058,0.782,0.16,0.3958994708994708,POSITIVE,0.9998

It begins with his life until he is four in New York during the Great Depression, and then the family's return to the greater depression of their homeland, Ireland, where they live on a tiny government dole, and the charity of begrudging relatives.what makes this memoir so compelling is how the author juggles the different emotions, always with a ready wit, which makes this book a classic, and yet always at the same time displaying to pathos and misery of the Ireland of this era.McCourt describes the loss of his baby sisters with heart wrenching realism. He has three more brothers, the more charming and easy going Malachy, the king hearted Michael who brings home beggars and stray dogs to the family's humble abode, and the youngest Alphie.Always pervasive is the grinding poverty, the oppressive and guilt-inducing all pervading presence of the Catholic church and education system ,and the fierce patriotism and resentment at Realm of the time of the 800 years of English domination and cruelty.But what always shines through is the refusal to forget the humour and hope, the appreciation of small things and nature, through such crushing circumstances, and always the hope. The memoir closes with the realization of Frank's dream and goal to emigrate back to the America of his birth. Ultimately it is a book of the life of life, and refusal to ever be sunk by circumstances-what makes it more inspiring is a true life story of the authors' childhood.",35,0.2459,0.119,0.767,0.115,0.4735814022578729,POSITIVE,0.9999

31,11848672,01/06/2008,1.0,"Overpraised and insubstantive, the first installment in Frank McCourt's memoir cycle, Angela's Ashes, is mostly based around such an obvious cycle that its mind-numbing: ""Times were tough and we were on the dole. Me father drank and came home late at night waking us up and making us swear we'd die for Ireland. Me mother and me father fought and he shaped up. Got a job, but nobody liked him because he was from the dirty north. So he drank his first Friday's paycheck, was late to work on Saturday, and the boss fired him. So we was back on the dole. Times were tough."" Seriously, 300-odd pages of this, on loop. The more gripping sequences are in the beginning, when the McCourts first arrive in Ireland and are so sickly that it seems like at least two children die per chapter. You almost had to wonder why they don't, I dunno, just STOP REPRODUCING, but I guess I'm not that Catholic and thus can't understand. Anyways, it's harrowing and heavy, and most important, hasn't become a pattern yet. I was able to hang with this part. But once the last child dies, about 70 pages in, and the story shifts moods from ultra-depressing to whimsical for a while (""me neighbor wanted me to dance for a few pence, but I was so poor I only had one shoe, so I could not dance properly. Och, it was a jolly spectacle!""), and it's just the above sequence on repeat, I simply had a struggle understanding why the bloody hell this book won a Pulitzer. I suppose it presents a brutal picture of poverty in Ireland in the early 20th century, the prejudices and sufferings that result from it. And it subtly comments on the senseless bitterness of the IRE / UK divide. But, really, I've read Frank McCourt derivatives (Damian McNichol, for example) who are more poignant and less didactic than this novel. Worst was the conclusion; young adult Frank arrives back in the U.S., and sleeps with the neglected wife of a WWII vet on his first night in the country.

There are two instances where this statement is extremely true: show business, and memoir writing. Angela's Ashes (which is apparently the first in a series?) chronicles the childhood and adolescence of Frank McCourt, born into a poor Irish family with no money but a surplus of babies. His mother, Angela, does the best she can to prevent her children from starving to death on a daily basis; meanwhile the patriarch of the family is a man who, as Jack Donaghy might say, ""belongs in the Smiling Irish Bastard hall of fame."" Things aren't good, is what I'm saying. The kids dress in filthy rags, they have to collect coal on the side of the road to heat their depressing shack of a house, the majority of the kids die of some horrible disease, the father insists on drinking every goddamn penny he earns, and Frank just wants to drop out of school so he can get a job and maybe afford a meal every few weeks. Bleak does not begin to cover it.(giant sidebar: did anyone else watch Enlisted? Of course no one did, that's why it got cancelled after one season even thought it was fantastic. Anyway, there's a bit where one of the characters is super depressed so he decides to read Angela's Ashes, to further wallow in misery, and he tells another character, ""I'm at the part where he gives a raisin to the boy with no shoes."" I watched that part and thought, well obviously the writers made that up, that's just a spot-on parody of the stuff that goes on in miserable memoirs like that. But then I read the book a few weeks later and guys, that scene totally happens. That's the level Frank McCourt is operating at.)Look, I'm not saying Frank McCourt had to put a happy face on his horrible, horrible childhood just to make me less uncomfortable. His memoir is searing and honest, but it is also unrelenting in its bleakness. There are small flashes of happiness here and there, but the book was so overwhelming sad that every time something good happened to the family in this story, my first thought was, ""Well, this can't last."" Which, actually, is a very Irish-Catholic reaction to have, so congratulations to me for making my ancestors proud. The writing is very good, at least, so all the misery is very well-described and the characters are subtle and well-drawn. The book certainly deserved the Pulitzer it won, although if we're being really honest with ourselves the prize was probably awarded not for the great writing or characters but because the people at the Pulitzer awards get giant literary boners for misery porn like this. Realistically, I should give this four stars, because I liked the book, but I'm docking a point because of the ending. Without giving anything away, it's just too abrupt. Nothing gets resolved, there's no sense of a conclusion, it's just like McCourt got tired of the book and said, ""Well, let's just stop here"" and then it ends. It was not satisfying, and not worth all the misery I went through to get to the end. ",29,-0.9897,0.186,0.685,0.129,0.576845238095238,NEGATIVE,0.999

So the decision was made to move back to Limerick where Frank's maternal grandmother lived. But Limerick was not much better than New York, and in some ways worse, especially for Frank's father who was from the North.His father, Malachy, rarely has a job and when he does he drinks his wages. The family lives in conditions of extreme poverty.

42,145877725,02/04/2011,2.0,"Angela's Ashes was really not the sort of book I would enjoy. In fact, I found that the further it progressed, the less enthusiastic I became. McCourt uses the modern technique of describing the protagonist's struggles and life day by day. The intention is to make his own unique experiences feel universal because people look past each individual day and look at it as a whole, and see the supposedly universal themes.However, I am not a believer or practitioner of this contemporary writing style. Excruciating detail of daily life is not a brilliant writing style; in my opinion, it is exactly what it is: excruciating. Sure, the stories and people were interesting/tragic/funny at first, but when the same mundane themes keep repeating themselves, it grows dull very fast.I understand the tragedy, humor, beauty McCourt wants us to see in his childhood, I just wish he wasn't so repetitive about it, because as I said, the tactic of excessive day-by-day writing gets old quite fast, making this book a less than enjoyable read.And for the love of God, PLEASE introduce Mr.McCourt to quotation marks. Not a single one used in the entirety of the memoir. I'm not interested in how fanciful or unique that writing style is. It's damn annoying.In conclusion, Frank McCourt is a skilled writer, with very deep themes, and good stories to write about. However, his style of writing makes for a less-than-enjoyable experience that leaves the reader overwhelmed and frustrated.

There are terrible tragedies and the family is constantly fighting to survive.Kids and parents alike are nearly starved, most of the time. They are constantly cold and damp because of their lack of clothes and disgusting living conditions. This, in turn, causes disease and death. The Catholic church doesn't come out of the book well. Priests and nuns view the poor as little more than vermin. The Church is only concerned with ensuring total obedience to canon law and to terrorizing the poor with threats of eternal damnation.Having said all that, there is plenty of humour throughout. When the rent man comes to call, the family have ripped down a wooden partition wall to use as firewood. He looks round and asks, Where's my other room? I rented ye two rooms, what have ye's done with the other one?I didn't include quotation marks because neither does the author. I don't know why they are missing but the book is easy to read, nonetheless.I have heard some debate that the author has taken liberties with the truth of the story, but so what.Millions of people lived and died in horrendous conditions and everything that happened in the book must have happened to someone. In the same way that ""Roots"" lives on as a document charting a period of history - again with the author being accused of tampering with history - ""Angela's Ashes is a wonderful social document in the Dickensian tradition.

46,2424144477,06/14/2018,3.0,"McCourt’s classic puts the misery of the Irish squarely on the table. No bones about it, 800 years of colonization, along with an uncompromising religion, produced a terrible legacy of poverty, hunger and guilt relieved only by humour and alcohol.This book covers Frank’s life journey out of America, where he was born and raised until age four, back to Ireland, and until he returns to the Land of the Free at the age of eighteen. The eldest in a family where younger siblings are destined to die unless they have strong survival instincts, Frank grows up early in the presence of an alcoholic and irresponsible father, Malachy, who could never hold down a job and who drank away his earnings. Changing his younger siblings diapers and looking after them when he was not quite out of diapers himself, Frank learns self-reliance and survival on the mean and cold streets of Dublin where consumption is the biggest killer. Everyone is eternally hungry, everyone is unwashed and dirty, everyone is yoked to a life of unending misery. That is my one criticism of this book—there is too much misery! The only escape is join the war effort; then one is able to send home money from the front, making proper meals possible again for the family. The war creates a two-tier society back home: those who receive telegrams with money and those who don’t. The other escape is America, the beacon that Frank yearns for, for after all, he is an American living in this shithole of his ancestors.Frank’s Ireland also envelops its inhabitants with guilt. Frank’s guilt is legion:a) Sleeping with the older and consumptive Theresab) Wanking in the field while the cows and sheep look on. I saw shades of Joyce here— someone always wanks in the open in a good Irish book.c) Slapping his mother in anger over her sleeping with the landlord.d) Smoking with his friends.e) Drinking at age sixteen and heading down that giant path to perfidy carved out by his father.When Malachy vanishes to England to work and send money home (he never does) the family gets evicted and is forced to live with a crippled man who lives in an attic. The new landlord offers them board in exchange for favours from Frank’s still-young mother, Angela, by night; and he expects Frank to empty his chamber pot by day. Frank detests his mother’s forced “duty.” He quits school and works at the post office delivering telegrams, and becomes a letter writer to a debt collector, counting his pennies for when he could escape this sorry place. Finally, he has to top up his savings to make his passage fare across, and he does that by robbing his employer. In this environment, I think the robbery is justified.The strong feature in this book is not the hard luck story of a dirt-poor Irish family. There are many of those. What sticks in the mind is the way in which it is narrated: with quote-free dialogue, in the quirky vernacular of the Irish, and peppered with a myriad of humorous and tragic situations that Frank and his family find themselves in. Imagine toddlers woken up in the middle of the night by a drunken father to sing old battle songs of Ireland, or a little boy climbing on a table to reach the attic and bring down a fully loaded chamber pot smelling to the high heavens of excrement and urine, or the “excitement” that a pubescent and naked Frank experiences when he is out in the fields trying to dry his clothes. Imagine traditions where a father takes his son out to the pub for his first pint on his 16th birthday, or a rite of passage where you can’t take a girl out if you don’t smoke? Although supposed to be a memoir, this book certainly is Dickensian in its treatment.When Frank finally arrives in America, his first night in his new home is enough to wipe out all the guilt, pain and sadness of Ireland. Instead of adding a spoiler and telling you what happens to Frank on that night of mind-bending pleasure, I will end with the last line of the book, “My God, that was a lovely night, Frank. Isn’t this a great country altogether?” And in answer, we are pointed to the one-word final chapter that follows: ’Tis. Which is ironically the title of the second book in this memoir trilogy. Frank may have learned survival in Ireland, but he certainly learned his marketing in America.",15,-0.9342,0.074,0.873,0.053,0.4732997179588087,NEGATIVE,0.9287

I always say that the memoir genre is a challenge and can be difficult to review. And unfortunately, the memoirs I've read have often fallen short for me. But not this classic. Anyone who has read this will know what I mean when I say that McCourt may be the master of the memoir, and in Ashes has pulled off a feat that few have been able to do. That is - tell a deeply depressing and downright sad life story with such sharp wit and clever prose that rather than walk away in a despondent stupor, the reader is left with hope and dare I say, a SMILE on their face?

To say this book is depressing is one of the grossest understatements I've made in the past year. The book is narrated by the very young Frank McCourt and follows a child's stream of consciousness to describe the things he sees but doesn't always understand. As he gets older, the narration implies less and becomes more stark as Frankie develops the ability to see and understand what is happening in his family.There is no punctuation used to annotate spoken words from written prose and it took awhile for me to accustom myself to the format. But I found that over time, it became easier to follow and the writing became quite lyrical. I can't help but think this would make a fantastic audiobook if read in an Irish accent.I have the sequel to this book on my shelf but I can't say as I'm looking forward to rushing out and reading it. The alcoholic father and the dying babies and the dirty, starving children and the helpless mother were all a bit much for me to stomach in one go. I need a long break, so perhaps someday.

50,2154788890,02/22/2019,3.0,"I will confess here and now that all along my reading of Frank McCourt’s book, Angela’s Ashes I was trying to catch the hidden meaning of the title, only to find out (long live Wikipedia ) that the author simply inverted the titles of his two memoirs, since this one finishes with the word “’Tis” and the other, which is called ‘Tis, with the scattering of Angela McCourt’s ashes on the shores of Ireland. Now I don’t know whether Frank McCourt was joking or not when he provided his readers with this blasphemous (for his fans, at least) piece of information, but one cannot deny it is as good an explanation as any, more profound, other 😊. I am joking too, of course, but I challenge you nonetheless to discover which are Angela’s ashes – her children, the days of her life (to inappropriately quote a soap opera), the Hansel and Gretel-like crumbs she left for her son to guide him through his memoir, and so on, and so on.It seems that with this book Frank McCourt (this I didn’t know) invented a new genre, called a little derisorily even though appropriately “mis-lit” – the misery memoir, that is, which had such a tremendous success that many have followed (I myself read and wrote about one of them, Jannette Walls’ The Glass Castle). It was inevitably that, as it happens with any memoir, its truth be challenged by its own characters so to say, in this case many of them, including his mother Angela, denying some events and accusing him of greatly exaggerating others (more details in Zoe Brennan’s article A Miserable Liar? published in Daily Mail, an / or in Bernard Adams’s one, Frank McCourt: Late-flowering writer whose book 'Angela's Ashes' set in train the genre of 'misery memoirs' published in The Independent). At the end of the day, this is nothing but the eternal dispute issued from the ambiguous place diaries and memoirs are born – with one foot in fiction and with the other in the real world. For my part, given that the I am more interested in the fiction part than in the accuracy of the events, I simply savoured the story, which goes well and smoothly. The narrative voice reminded me a little of Momo’s, the little boy in Roman Gary’s Life before Us, having almost the same candor, the same capacity to enjoy even the tiniest sparkle of life, the same generosity which makes him love and forgive his father no matter what: I think my father is like the Holy Trinity with three people in him, the one in the morning with the paper, the one at night with the stories and the prayers, and then the one who does the bad thing and comes home with the smell of whiskey and wants us to die for Ireland.Michiko Kakutani, in his review, Generous Memories of a Poor, Painful Childhood published by New York Times in 1996 goes further than I, putting the author’s Limerick on the same level with James Joyce’s Dublin (in a comparison as risqué as mine to Roman Gary’s hero I dare say), and there are indeed some vivid, crude and at the same time humorous depictions of people – be them family or strangers, and of places –the town, the street, the hospital, the pub and of course the mighty school: They hit you if you can’t say your name in Irish, if you can’t say the Hail Mary in Irish, if you can’t ask for the lavatory pass in Irish. It helps to listen to the big boys ahead of you. They can tell you about the master you have now, what he likes and what he hates. One master will hit you if you don’t know that Eamon De Valera is the greatest man that ever lived. Another master will hit you if you don’t know that Michael Collins was the greatest man that ever lived. Mr. Benson hates America and you have to remember to hate America or he’ll hit you. Mr. O’Dea hates England and you have to remember to hate England or he’ll hit you. If you ever say anything good about Oliver Cromwell they’ll all hit you.Overall, a well-written book you will certainly enjoy.",13,0.9261,0.097,0.785,0.117,0.5048125261834939,NEGATIVE,0.99
51,2557554503,10/10/2018,4.0,"This is the second time reading this book. The first time I read this book I was a university student. It was probably summer and I was probably breezing through a large reading list of my own creation. I remember liking the book...but I also remember it killed a little bit of the joy of my summer. A book about poverty and hunger has a way of doing that. Now, having read the book a second time as a slightly grayer adult, I can say that I like the book, but don't love it. Like other books of hardscrabble living -- think Faulkner or Steinbeck -- this book gives you an appreciation for just how good things are when you have a full belly and aren't constantly on the move looking for work. The book reminds you that there are people in the world that are constantly on the move and whose greatest concern is where they will get their next meal. A book that brings out the humanity of this situation is a gift. No one was better at this than Steinbeck in my opinion. McCourt's memoir is heartbreaking at times, but there is also a sense of detachment in the memoir. A sense that the author himself had become a bit numb to the poverty and hunger he witnessed. To be sure, this is better than the sin of melodrama -- where things are overdramatized with overly elaborate prose. But still, I think there is a balance to be had between sparsity and the poetry of prose. If you're a fan of sparse prose, something like this might strike you as especially poetic. ""Frost is already whitening the fresh earth on the grave and I think of Theresa cold in the coffin, the red hair, the green eyes. I can't understand the feeling going through me but I know that with all the people who died in my family and all the people who died in the lanes around me and all the people who left I never had a pain like this in my heart and I hope I never will again.""For me, though, I want to feel something more for Theresa, and I think there is more in Frankie McCourt's heart than an inability to understand and feel. Something like this: ""In the frost whitened ground there is a girl I only barely knew and the things I will never know about her and all the other people who sit hungry in the lanes waiting to die, wasting away in piles of rags, their own filth, and the death of the river Shannon. The enormity of death, poverty, filth, and senselessness fills me with something...something hard, mean, and bitter. I want to lash out at some villain in the shadows, a movie villain twirling his mustache...but then I think of Theresa in the cold ground and all the things I'll never know about her and my knees buckle. I fall...and people in the lane are still hungry...and tomorrow someone else will die. The frost will fall. The ground will whiten. And there will be nothing I can do.""I don't know why I wanted to re-write that part. Perhaps it is just my way of getting to know Frank McCourt better...I want to understand...and to feel...There are also moments of great levity where you see the innocence of youth. Again, though, there seems to be a kind of journalist's detachment of sparsity to the writing. I wouldn't be surprised if the author was a fan of Hemingway. I was a big fan too, once.

54,43133917,01/15/2009,5.0,"	Angela’s Ashes is the first of three memoirs written by Irish author Frank McCourt. Angela’s Ashes was published in 1996, and won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography. The story was made into a film directed by Alan Parker in 1999.  Frank McCourt begins his story with the tale of how his parents meet in Brooklyn, New York. When Malachy gets his mother Angela pregnant with Frank, she marries him and the two start their life together in a small apartment in Brooklyn. Angela gives birth to three more sons while in Brooklyn; the second son is Malachy, followed by twins Oliver and Eugene. Malachy Sr., Frank’s father, proves to be a hopeless alcoholic who cannot hold onto a job for more than a few weeks at a time. Some motivation to improve his behavior comes with the birth of a daughter, Margaret. When Margaret passes away in their Brooklyn apartment, only a few weeks old, the McCourt family moves back to Ireland, where twins Oliver and Eugene both die within a year. Two more sons Michael and Alphie are born in Limerick, into a gritty world of discomfort and suffering.	Frank McCourt’s story is an absolutely miserable one. He opens the novel explaining the extent of the misery that was his childhood. “When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I survived at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood.” The McCourt family eventually settles into a less-than-comfortable house on a sorrowful lane in Limerick. The lane shares just one lavatory among all the houses, which happens to be located in the McCourt’s backyard. In addition to the cold and the rain, the McCourt family has to endure the stench of their neighbors dumping their sewage on windy days. Angela McCourt is left with no other option than to beg for the dole and handouts from the St. Vincent de Paul Society. Malachy manages to drink away all of his wages in the pubs, and still cannot hold onto a steady job. During World War II, Malachy travels to England to work at a defense plant, yet he still manages to waste all of his money, and only sends wages home once. The McCourt children have one set of clothes and a pair of patched shoes each, struggling to live off of very little in their damp, cold climate. 	Although Frank’s story is desperate and sometimes unbelievable, it is full of good humor and adventure. The reader is certain to find themselves laughing out loud many times throughout the course of the book, and there are countless quotable passages between the covers. As a memoir, this book is particularly interesting because it is McCourt’s real account and interpretation of his childhood. He paints a beautiful picture with his words, telling what was going through his mind as he grew up in brutal conditions in New York and Limerick. McCourt recounts the days when having an entire egg to himself for breakfast was an exciting and noteworthy luxury, and his clothes were held together by his mother’s obvious stitch work, while some children in his class had no shoes at all. McCourt’s voice and rhythm are very distinctive, and I would definitely rank him among my favorite storytellers. Angela’s Ashes is a powerful masterpiece which tells a true story about pain, hunger, desperation, love, heartbreak, and, above all, strength. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read which is full of humor, but also very meaningful.",11,0.2748,0.083,0.825,0.091,0.5426341335432244,NEGATIVE,0.967

The drunkard father who could never find a job or hold it, who runs to the taverns to squander the salary. He doesn't deserve to be a father if compared with uncle pa keating.

62,416612318,09/17/2012,5.0,"Frank McCourt does some interesting things with the creative nonfiction technique here. If you want to read about how poverty, starvation, malnutrition, and disease affects a child, read this book. What makes the book unique is how it encapsulated melancholy, but also leaves you entertained-- brilliant word-smithing. As a child, McCourt experiences so much death (including the death of his siblings) and abandonment, including that of his own father who is an alcoholic, yet still he manages to view a dimly lighted future afar. He is born in America but his family returns to Ireland, where he grows up in a poverty-stricken area where starvation becomes the norm. In the end, it is books, of course, that saves him mentally, giving him the option to return to America and start anew.There is a way that McCourt has with style, something you don't see often in memoirs (no wonder this is a Pulitzer-winning-one), where he not only seemingly and nonchalantly gets the reader to inhale portions of extreme poverty in passages like this one, but he also makes the reader aware of the dire situation in the world around him:I take the greasy newspaper from the floor. I lick the front page, which is all advertisements for films and dances in the city. I lick the headlines. I lick the great attacks of Patton and Montgomery in France and Germany. I lick the war in the Pacific. I lick the obituaries and the sad memorial poems, the sports pages, the market prices of eggs, butter and bacon. I suck the paper till there isn't a smidgen of grease.If you don't like reading dialect in literature, you may not follow this well. Also, there is a lot about Catholicism (which I suppose McCourt had to do in order to show how it affected his life and environment, after all he was named after St. Francis of Assisi), so if that kind of thing turns you off, you could have difficulty reading. No, said grandma. You're not making no collection till you've had a proper First Communion breakfast at my house...I ate the egg, I ate the sausage, but when I reached for more sugar for my tea she slapped my hand away.Go aisy with that sugar. It is a millionaire you think I am? An American? Is it bedecked in glitterin' jewelry you think I am? Smothered in fancy furs?The food churned in my stomach. I gagged. I ran to her backyard and threw it all up. Out she came.Look at what he did. Thrun up his First Communion breakfast. Thrun up the body and blood of Jesus. I have God in me backyard...She pushed me into the confession box. Now grandma says she has God in her backyard and what should she do...The priest is like the First Confession priest. Ah...ah...tell your grandmother to wash God away with a little water and for your penance say one Hail Mary and one Our Father."" This dialogue continues, because once he returns, grandma wants to know: ""holy water or ordinary water?""Humor also helps the pacing and shades of barrenness in this memoir. And, of course, characterization, for there are characters like Quasimodo, who, ""before he leaves his house he always sticks his head out the door and tells the lane, 'here's me head, me arse is coming."" This is not the easiest to understand at first, especially the beginning, but after reading it for the second and technically third time, it still reminds me that only a few memoirs manage to embody such novelty.

63,1916871171,06/24/2017,4.0,"""Och."" -every character in this bookThis was both an enjoyable and valuable reading experience. ""Angela's Ashes"" was written with deliberate simplicity but still conveys some heady themes about religion, poverty, gender, disease, death, and most importantly, coming of age. The author and main character Frank McCourt deftly combines an onslaught of depressing, dreary darkness with unexpected humor and wit.Throughout the story you see people stuck in bad situations, choosing to be at their best in the face of them or at their worst. Frank is in the middle of it all struggling with the very same decisions. Poverty forces difficult choices on people, and it is through these choices that we see what they are really made of.I feel like I have to talk about Frank’s deadbeat alcoholic dad. You think you know deadbeat alcoholic dads? See how you feel after you experience Malachy Sr. find a respectable job, pull his family out of abject poverty, get their hopes up that life will get better soon… Then take his week’s wages straight to the pub, drink it all away, and then come home yelling patriotic gibberish at his starving children. Then watch him do this 10 more times before the book even reaches its halfway point. His one redeeming quality is that he’s a natural storyteller, a talent that he passes on to Frank. Listening to his father tell stories is perhaps Frank’s only positive memory of him.On the other hand, Frank’s mother Angela and the namesake of the book is always trying to make ends meet. Considering the near constant desperation and humiliation she endures from her husband’s antics throughout the book, she is an extraordinary testimony to the strength of women during that time. I think one of the overarching themes of this book is just how horrendous it was to be a woman, especially a poor woman, in Ireland in the 1930s and 1940s. They were completely dependent on their husbands, and powerless to improve their station in life. Angela tries her best to provide for her family and maintain some dignity, but the struggle is real...(view spoiler)[At many points throughout the story, characters with nasty diseases and ailments are described in grisly detail; you feel as though you are actually looking at the man whose legs are slowly rotting off, or seeing Frank’s eyes ooze yellow pus. Many of these characters also suddenly die. Frank’s first girlfriend dies, three of his siblings end up dying before their 5th birthdays, friends and family die… And perhaps the most disturbing thing about it is how casual everyone’s reactions are to it. You realize that, living in such poverty, death becomes exactly that; casual. (hide spoiler)]If I had to come up with a gripe about the story, I'd say that there was a point around the halfway mark where the story started to feel a little repetitive. It broke out of that funk quickly though, thanks to some unexpected story beats.I highly recommend Angela's Ashes. 8.5/10",9,-0.9851,0.172,0.694,0.134,0.5494897084048026,POSITIVE,0.8199

73,434911048,10/15/2012,2.0,"I wanted to love this book--so many whose opinions I respect adored it beyond words. I actually saw the film and remember liking it a lot. At first I thought I would love it. The book is McCourt's memoir of his miserable childhood in Ireland. With an emphasis on misery. The first pages really pulled me in. It had the kind of prose that makes you think, ""this is a great book."" It reads likes a novel, is crafted like a novel. But the book has lots of modernist touches such as long passages reporting the speech of people--without quotation marks and sometimes without even paragraphing--minimalist punctuation, use of the present tense, parts that could be called stream of consciousness... I admit this is a style I find off-putting, in spite of it being rather appropriate for a book set in the land of James Joyce. But I think it was the sheer numbing misery, combined with the creative non-fiction embellishments that eventually really got to me. McCourt began by writing, “When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I managed to survive at all.” Given what he related, I did too. And it's not very credible as non-fiction given McCourt purported to remember in detail events in his early childhood fifty years later--which along with the consciously literary style undercut for me a lot of his credibility, making me wonder how much of the account was exaggerated. (Those who knew the McCourts in Limerick also 
fiercly dispute
 a lot of his stories.)I know for a lot of people it was precisely the style they loved. I know for a lot of people, despite the dire poverty related, they found this book uplifting rather than depressing. They found lots of humor in it rather than finding it relentlessly grim with people (characters?) impossible to like. I detested Frank's father--and his mother wasn't a prize either. And I found Frank more bitter and whiny than charming. I've long given up trying to give objective ratings. Maybe the book deserves its acclaim, but if anything, my rating is generous.

At face value, it may seem like an unemotional account of getting out of Ireland and leaving behind a sad childhood and memories. Upon further thought, I realized how Catholicism, guilt, and poverty were a central theme and inextricably related. With TB claiming the lives of countless people, including several of McCourt's siblings, an alcoholic father, and cruelty from neighbors and relatives, it's a wonder that McCourt could still make me laugh aloud with his cynical eye for detail. I was touched by his mother's heroic attempts to provide for her family. She did what she could, which is something to be said for a woman in 1930's Ireland.

That does not typically mean I rush off to read it, but in this case recommendations from those whose sentiments I value, were so consistently laudatory that we read it for our reading group. What an extraordinary book!McCourt recently retired from teaching writing in a New York City high school. I have heard him read from his work, and judging from his way of reading and responding to his audience I suspect he was a wildly popular and effective teacher. This book represents the story of growing up in Limerick just before and during World War Two.He was born in New York City, but his father was an unrepentant alcoholic who managed to lose every job he got by drinking up his wages on payday. The children grew up in extraordinary poverty. Angela, his mother, lost several children to disease inflicted by the squalor she was forced to inhabit. Her mother sent them fares to return to Ireland -- it's a wonder that wasn't imbibed also -- but refused to put up the McCourts claiming to have no room. They managed to find lodging in the Limerick slums. Downstairs was referred to as Ireland and it regularly flooded during the rainy season; upstairs was Italy. It was so cold and they had not money so they were forced to dismantle the wooden walls to burn in order to heat the water for the imperative tea. Frank's father finally sought work in the booming English industry which had geared up to produce war materiel. He didn't help; he remained shiftless and reduced his substantial earnings to liquid form.What's extraordinary is the level of superstition that existed in Ireland -- at least what we see of it -- as late as the 1940's. When Frank is extremely ill and leaking blood from virtually every orifice, his grandmother insists it's just part of growing up and recommends all sorts of bizarre home remedies. His hospitalization lasts for several months to cure the consumption. Frank was to have numerous health problems -- no wonder given the living conditions, rats, lice, and fleas were common -- and he almost lost his sight to conjunctivitis. In order to bring in a couple of shillings for his mother he helped a friend, whose legs were giving out after years of labor, deliver huge sacks of coal. This left him covered with coal dust that filled his eyes making them even worse.The memoirs have hundreds of poignant episodes. Throughout everything one sense that Frank never lost his sense of humor and many of the stories bring a quick chuckle even while experiencing an unremitting sense of horror at the extreme poverty.I think my favorite anecdote involved the library. When Frank was about thirteen, they were evicted from their hovel for nonpayment of rent. They move in with a distant relative, a slothy, alcoholic, ex-Royal Navy officer, who lies around and reads all the time. He sends Frank to get books for him, and one rainy day the librarian suggests he stay and read in the library rather than walk back (some two miles) in the rain and risk ruining the books. She gives him Butler's Lives of the Saints to read assuming it cannot help but edify. Frank is soon hooked and wishing it would never cease raining. These saint stories are different from the ones he hears about in church or from Uncle Pa Keating. ""There are stories about virgins, martyrs, virgin martyrs and they're worse than any horror film at the Lyric Cinema. I have to look in the dictionary to find out what a virgin is. I know the Mother of God is the Virgin Mary and they call her that because she didn't have a proper husband, only poor old St. Joseph. In the Lives of the Saints the virgins are always getting into trouble and I don't know why. The dictionary says, Virgin, woman (usually a young woman) who is and remains in a state of inviolate chastity. Now I have to look up inviolate and chastity and all I can find here is that inviolate means not violated and chastity means chaste and that means pure from unlawful sexual intercourse. Now I have to look up intercourse and that leads to intromission, which leads to intromittent, the copulatory organ of any male animal. Copulatory leads to copulation, the union of the sexes in the art of generation and I don't know what that means and I'm too weary going from one word to another in this heavy dictionary which leads me on a wild goose chase from this word to that word and all because the people who wrote the dictionary don't want the likes of me to know anything. All I want to know is where I came from but if you ask anyone they tell you to ask someone else or send you from word to word.""After a while it eventually stops raining and our lovely librarian is so impressed by Frank's attentiveness to the Lives of the Saints that she sends a note home to his mother suggesting that she may have a future priest on her hands he was so intent in the saints' lives. Little does she know.The book has sometimes been billed as the quintessential immigrant story. Mythologically perhaps it is, but as with about 60% of other immigrants, the McCourt family returned to Ireland when America turned out to be a little less paradisaical than expected.This book is a gem.5/8/09 When I was revising this I attempted to fact-check the 60% number that I had heard somewhere. I'm not sure this is quite correct although I did validate that a majority of foreign born students return to their native country.

It's a national trait, and McCourt shows it perfectly - no need for a laughter-track here.There's poverty - terrible, cold, starving, killing poverty. There's piety - righteous, sanctimonious, judgmental piety. There's cruelty and brutality. There's children dying. There's alcoholism. Is all this romanticised because there's also humour and hope? I don't think so. Narrated from the perspective of a child, told in the present tense, of course it doesn't angst about whether the rent will be paid or what the neighbours will think of the children having no shoes - a child's view of the world is so different to that of an adult. The author's ability to put himself back into his childhood thoughts, with all the innocence and simplicity that implies, without commenting or moralising, is unusual - and perfect for this story.Did I enjoy it? Sort of. It's long and it's hard and the drama is based on the dreadful living circumstances of this family at this time. It is, however, cleverly devised, well-written and exceptionally executed.(Also, I'm astonished at the reviews from those who are outraged at the mention of masturbation and erections. Have they never been or known a teenage boy? Are they buying into the religious bullshit that sexual desire/behaviour is wrong and perverted and those who engage in it for anything other than procreation are to be damned?

Even the times he chats with his mates you get the whole conversation, (a conversation that quit often leads nowhere and doesn't add to the flow of the book), surely that can't all be recalled?

96,30917875,08/22/2008,4.0,"I love this book like I love ice cream. The taste is sweet, almost sad, it always takes me back to childhood, and I feel extremely depressed after I'm done with it. McCourt's memoir is unbelievable in almost every sense of the word. It's inconceivably well-written, beyond beautiful. It's also too sad to be a true story. And yet it is.The action recounts McCourt's impoverished childhood in Ireland from the age of four to about nineteen, when he finally steals and saves enough to escape his hellish life and sail to America. It's a painful read, I must say. Beautifully painful. Little Frankie struggles with an alcoholic father who squanders his own children's welfare money to get drunk in pubs, a lunatic of a mother whose grief and shame make Macbeth's life look like reruns of the Rin and Stimpy show, an endless stream of dying siblings, schoolmasters who insult or beat him, a terrorizing faith that puts him in unceasing fear of burning in hell eternally, the responsibility (at only 4 years old!) of changing his little brothers' diapers and stealing food for them to eat, and the constant pains of illness and starvation. That being said, McCourt's retelling is surprisingly humorous. Last night I was reading the book in a room with my husband, then I suddenly laughed out loud hysterically without even realizing it. He asked me what I was reading and I said, ""Angela's Ashes, the saddest book I've ever read..."" with tears in my eyes. He looked at me like I was a lunatic. And I kind of was. A story like this will do that to ya.DISCLAIMER: rated R, not for you young readers...Thanks for the recommend, Larry. You're the man.FAVORITE QUOTES:The master says it's a glorious thing to die for the Faith and Dad says it's a glorious thing to die for Ireland and I wonder if there's anyone in the world who would like us to live.You feel very rich when you can go up and down the stairs all day as much as you please.I know that big people don't like questions from children. They can ask all the questions they like, How's school? Are you a good boy? Did you say your prayers? but if you ask them did they say their prayers you might be hit on the head.It's lovely to know the world can't interfere with the inside of your head... You might be poor, your shoes might be broken, but your mind is a palace.If I were in America I could say, I love you, Dad, the way they do in the films, but you can't say that in Limerick for fear you might be laughed at. You're allowed to say you love God and babies and horses that win but anything else is a softness in the head.Under the picture of the man with the burning heart there is a shelf with a red glass holding a flickering candle and next to it a small statue. Mam tells us, That's the Baby Jesus, the Infant of Prague, and if ye ever need anything pray to Him. Malachy says, Mam, could I tell Him I'm hungry, and Mam puts her finger to her lips.FUNNY STORIES:...Mama calls from the bottom of the stairs, Frank, come down and have lemonade and a bun....I don't want it.

Come down here at once....Her voice is sharp and rue sounds dangerous. I'll go down.----...I have to look in the dictionary to find out what a virgin is... Virgin, woman (usually a young woman) who is and remains in a state of inviolate chastity. Now I have to look up inviolate and chastity and all I can find here is taht inviolate means not violated and chastity means chaste and that means pure from unlawful sexual intercourse. Now I have to look up intercourse and that leads to intromission, which leads to intromittent, the copulatory organ of any male animal. Copulatory leads to copulation, the union of the sexes in the art of generation and I don't know what that means and I'm too weary going from one word to another in this heavy dictionary which leads me on a wild goose chase from this word to that word and all because the people who wrote the dictionary don't want the likes of me to know anything.----...He says, Ah, boys, boys, You can make up your own minds but first stock them. Are you listening to me? Stock your minds and you can move through the world resplendent. Clarke, define resplendent....I think it's shining, sir....Pithy, Clarke, but adequate.

98,80895600,12/13/2009,4.0,"This book tells the story of author Frank McCourt's difficult childhood. Either he has an amazing memory or, more likely, he's embellished a bit of this to fill in the gaps to make it a readable memoir. I can't remember what I ate for breakfast, never mind what I ate or longed to eat for breakfast when I was wee child. The book reads like a novel and I quickly forgot it was a first hand account of growing up in a slum with absolutely nothing but an exhausted mum, a lush of a dad who can't keep a job and a slew of younger siblings who seem to die off as soon as the next one is born. Frank grows up quickly because mom is tired, dad is lazy and he and his younger brother must take of the younger kids, scour the lane for bits of coal to keep his family warm, steal bits of food to survive and then face cruelty at school. The book is pretty grim so far as I've read but compelling enough that I want to continue reading to see how Frank makes it out alive. I've seen criticism that this book is a one-sided view of Ireland during the depression and from what I read it looks like that is true. Many times in the book the author points out that other boys had shoes and weren't eating a pig head for Christmas dinner but the author gets away with it because he is writing from his experience and not of the experience of the boy with the full belly and hard-working father. This was a thoroughly compelling, wryly funny, and often tragic read. It's much longer than most of the books I read but when the end came it was too soon.",5,-0.8883,0.124,0.759,0.117,0.5799479166666667,POSITIVE,0.9961

112,593253097,02/08/2017,2.0,"Angela and Malachy fell for each other under similar circumstances but for varying reasons. Angela saw a sad soul that she could nurture and make whole, Malachy saw a sustenance for his sexual appetite after spending a few months in jail. Before meeting Malachy, Angela was a dancer and singer with tremendous promise who performed at Wembley Hall before going to America with Malachy who was doing some singing and dancing of his own to escape some sort of retribution. Angela wanted to live a little before getting married, but she fell for a drinker, got pregnant and took up cigarettes instead, which would prove oddly wise as they would become the only pleasure she would have in life. Her family warned her that Malachy had an insatiable craving for the drink; a curse that afflicted most of the Irish. Moreover, if you were dropped on your head as a child, the problem was made even worse, with Malachy's penchant for histrionics, it was more probable than not, that he'd been dropped a time or two, or twelve.
"" I think my father is like the Holy Trinity with three people in him, the one in the morning with the paper, the one at night with the stories and the prayers, and then the one who does the bad thing and comes home with the smell of whiskey and wants us to die for Ireland. ""
Angela's Ashes begins with Frank reflecting on the past and suggesting to the reader, as transparent as an introduction can be, that the recently immigrated McCourt family should have never left depression era Brooklyn, New York. Something horrible must have transpired for him to feel that strongly, and it would prove to be unquestionably tragic. Parents Angela and Malachy Sr. with their children Francis, Malachy Jr. and twins Oliver and Eugene were going back home to Limerick; the holiest city in Ireland, and ironically enough a city where your religion could make your life more deplorable at the hands of the arrogance of other fellow believers, or feel like less of a person because you were born a Yankee and reside in the North as a Protestant. The welcome home doormat must have been left under a layer of dirt because there was certainly no one organizing a parade. There was a great culture shock that goes unnoticed of going from living in the city to the country and sharing one bed with six people. However during times like these; at a moments notice six can become four, this was the way of the world when consumption and typhoid were killing children one-by-one; Angela knew that feeling all too well. Again, welcome home, where the happiness and light that only a child can bring can also be snatched from you in the blink of an eye or the duration of a nighttime.
""It's a good thing Jesus decided to be born Jewish in that warm place because if he was born in Limerick he'd catch the consumption and be dead in a month and there wouldn't be any Catholic Church and there wouldn't be any Communion or Confirmation and we wouldn't have to learn the catechism and write compositions about Him. The End.""
Haunted by the ghosts of her fallen children and disturbed by the endless family infighting, Angela has become depressed and can no longer live in the family's farmhouse. With little money they had few options and ended up living in the lanes of Limerick with the likes of rats, fleas, and lice while sleeping next to a communal bathroom for fifty residents with bad plumbing, raw sewage, and at any moment having it seep through the walls leaving the family bound to the top floor. The living conditions were so bad that the children preferred hospital stays and even had thoughts of death rather than living at their lane in Limerick. Nothing positive seems to come the family's way and if it does it disappears quickly, that is the world as they know it and must learn to accept for the time being.I didn't find this book all that humorous, and became less amused by the embarrassing father after each raucous rendition of Kevin Berry and Roddy McCorvey's sacred songs about dying for Ireland which started by Chapter Two, his ranting and raving about the politicalization of the news media was tiresome, and I was satisfied when he became less of a distraction later in the story. When he was around he provided very little, and when he left it was nothing but high and dry for months at a time. With Malachy gone things didn't improve much per se, but the household gained a rhythm and consistency that helped tremendously. Malachy rarely worked, not even bothering to look, and when he fell into work he would drink the wages at the local pub and lose the job within weeks, relegating his wife Angela to get assistance from a labour program that provided very little for a family of six. I won't even mention what he would do with the money provided specifically for newborns, but if my words mean anything then I am sure you can guess.
""We don't laugh long, there is no more bread and we're hungry, the four of us. We can get no more credit at O'Connell's shop. We can't go near Grandma, either. She yells at us all the time because Dad is from the North and he never sends money home from England where he is working in a munitions factory. Grandma says we could starve to death for all he cares. That would teach Mam a lesson for marrying a man from the North with sallow skin, an odd manner and a look of the Presbyterian about him. Still, I'll have to try Kathleen O'Connell once more. I'll tell her my mother is sick above in the bed, my brothers are starving and we'll all be dead for the want of bread. ""
Malachy redeemed himself in some ways through storytelling and inciting a working imagination in his children while living in a cold world, but each time he came home bleary-eyed, broke, and stinking drunk, waking his children up, shouting his love of Ireland from the rooftops and upset for being under English rule for eight hundred years, I had had enough with him. One could say he was a man that maintained dignity and instilled it in his children, I believed Malachy had too much ego and was pig headed to truly take the responsibilities that were asked of being a father; there was enough pig's head to go around at the holiday season the family didn't need another one. Anything positive he had to offer meant little to me, he may have had his children's ear, but after ten years of the same crap, someone was about to come around and see the truth for what it was.
“The master says it’s a glorious thing to die for the Faith and Dad says it’s a glorious thing to die for Ireland and I wonder if there’s anyone in the world who would like us to live. My brothers are dead and my sister is dead and I wonder if they died for Ireland or the Faith. Dad says they were too young to die for anything. Mam says it was disease and starvation and him never having a job. Dad says, Och, Angela, puts on his cap and goes for a long walk.” 
Angela's Ashes was brutally honest, deeply depressing, and incessantly whiny. I have read books in the past that both made me mad at the state of the world or at past history and also tugged at my heart strings with signs of hope and aspiration in an unrelenting environment. In this book there is no hope and little aspiration, it is a daily goal to survive, the thought is made more profound knowing children at a young age further complicate the point. What made it more somber and sobering was that the story revolves around young children and their silence when faced with not having enough coal to heat the living space, cook food, or even boil water; not to mention sickness, severe hunger, abuse, humiliation, inhumane circumstances and enduring tragedy after tragedy. These children must follow their own religious beliefs, the discipline issued by their family, their thirst for knowledge, and the political influence in Ireland as they try their best to survive. Optimistically speaking, although it times they waver, the family as a whole never fully lose their pride, their aspirations, and their faith; something we should all appreciate. The book ends at a period when most children grow into the people they were set out to be and encounter trouble that manifests everywhere, leaving the reader hoping things turn out well, but if the past proves anything it's that nothing good lasts forever, and a week begins to be too much to ask.
""He says, you have to study and learn so that you can make up your own mind about history and everything else but you can’t make up an empty mind. Stock your mind, stock your mind. It is your house of treasure and no one in the world can interfere with it. If you won the Irish Sweepstakes and bought a house that needed furniture would you fill it with bits and pieces of rubbish? Your mind is your house and if you fill it with rubbish from the cinemas it will rot in your head. You might be poor, your shoes might be broken, but your mind is a palace.”

A couple of decades later and I've finally gotten around to hearing the story first hand told by McCourt himself and I was not disappointed. The struggles, the loss and the hardship experienced by Frank and his family is something I could not even imagine based on the way I was brought up. However, the author tells the story in quite a comical fashion that ensures that laughter often prevails over the horror that was their life. McCourt also writes in a way that is simple to understand, almost as though the story itself is being told by a child or adolescent. I find this helps to really put yourself in the shoes of a young Frank McCourt and understand what his perspective on things was at that time. He has a terrific memory when recounting all of his encounters, conversations & stories. Everything everyone says is so detailed I find myself impressed at how he was able to recall so much from events that happened so long ago. Maybe it's just the fact that his life was so traumatic that everything really became engraved in his mind.

The babies die, one after another Father drinks constantly, kids without food, he doesn't care, though he swears he loves his kids. Back to Ireland, Belfast, father's family, don't seem to want them around. On to Dublin, then to Limerick. When in Brooklyn, some neighbors were good to them, gave them food, the Italian grocer gave them fresh fruit, another lady made soup, hot food. Her boy was friends with Frank's little brother.Back to Ireland, to Limerick where his mother is from. There is some humor, laugh out loud parts in the book. Laugh to keep from crying. Malachy McCourt was a sorry excuse for a man. I had to laugh, but get mad at how the man spent the dole money on alcohol. There were so many others in the same condition. Dirt poor, run down neighborhoods, houses falling apart. ragged clothes, too, too much poverty. Malachy McCourt bragged, talked about how much he did for Ireland, loved his country, would die for it, loved his kids.When in Limerick, two more boys were born into poverty. Malachy went to England, the war was on, jobs to be had. He sent money back once or twice, drank away the rest.The neighbors, the boys Frank went to school with, relatives, his grandmother, Uncle Pat, who was dropped on his head as a baby so wasn't right. Aunt Aggie and her husband Uncle Pa Keating, no kids but loved children and who was more of a father than their own father, a loud, bragging, singing man who couldn't stop drinking.Frank, when very young, was a sweet boy with too many responsibilities. Take care of little brothers, keep them outside playing. When the family moved back to Ireland, one of the twins died. the second missed his twin and was soon gone. Malachy McCourt would not carry anything for his wife, it was beneath his dignity. He would not pick up coal from the ground. It was undignified. The boys could do this. The family got by on poor schools, poor food, ragged clothes. But they were together, Frank wrote.As he grew up, he took jobs wherever he could, whatever he could find. His mother went begging to the St Vincent de Paul Society. Papa had his pride. At one time, Frank slaps his mother during an argument. The family was thrown out of their apartment. Angela moved the family to a man, Laman Griffith's place, a run down, rat infected place like all the rest. She has an affair for them to be able to stay there. Frank wants to return to America. The book is about him wanking much. Tiresome.The people from Limerick didn't care for those of Northern Ireland, Presbyterians, Galway or anywhere else than other than Limerick. Laughable, yet not.The book is painful. Food from hand to mouth, and too many times, not getting to the mouth. Flooding downstairs, living upstairs, calling it Italy. Finally, Frank has his dream, getting back to America. He had saved, so when he was nineteen, he bought a ticket and sailed to America.Malachy McCourt died in Belfast when he was 85. He lived a long life despite his bad lifestyle. The three other McCourt boys came to the United States and had long lives despite their hard childhood. Malachy McCourt Jr. is the last living, he is 85.  ",4,-0.9487,0.125,0.765,0.11,0.4552719421101774,NEGATIVE,1.0
117,81533005,12/19/2009,5.0,"<< Life-Through a New, Refreshing Lens (Review of Angela's Ashes)  A family, deeply weakened by death, alcohol, and poverty. If you feel like your life has gotten into an uncomfortable groove, you must read this, for this book will add some spice to your life for sure; “Angela’s Ashes”, a truly stunning and heart-wrenching memoir about the author, Frank McCourt’s childhood in the poverty-stricken city of Limerick in Ireland, will hit you like a tidal wave. Optimistic and hopeful, McCourt uses graphic realistic details, characterization, and the enchanting theme of childhood to craft this wonderful story about poverty, perseverance, and just being a kid, gracefully.  It think it is very easy to say that watching a movie is considerably less difficult than reading a book. All you do is watch images and hear sounds. Passionate and heart filled, the way Frank McCourt writes this book, with awing and lifelike details makes the words pop out into a movie. You can envision the drunken dad coming home every day without money and singing his usual songs. You can envision impoverished people begging outside the local church. You can hear the babies wailing in the streets, the mothers crying over deceased loved ones. Frank McCourt writes with telling details put insane, high-definition, 50-inch flat-screen TVs in the reader’s head. Readers that have never been to Ireland will surely know what it looks like after reading Angela’s Ashes!   Distinct and diverse, the people surrounding Frank McCourt’s life are all unique in their own way. The extremely alcoholic father who would rather buy a beer than pay for his little baby’s funeral and casket, the weeping mom, the spirited little brother, the extremely inquisitive classmate...and the list of characters simply just goes on. All the characters have an affect on Frank McCourt, and soon enough they start to affect your life, and the way you think.   We all remember our childhood days. Ahhhh, those days of freedom and innocence! Well, Frank McCourt writes as if he is a child, and throughout the entire book you visit the mind of a very curious and innocent child. Quiet and observant, he writes of things like seeing his mother beg for food, and his father waste away from alcohol, very innocently. And as the book goes on, and more and more tragic and mind awakening experiences happen, you may observe that he slowly starts to lose that innocence. You see him age not only physically, but mentally. This reoccurring theme of childhood pops out at you throughout whole story. There is something that people of all ages can relate to and enjoy about the mind of a child.   It’s amazing how something as small as a book can change a person’s life, and turn it in a whole new direction of thinking. The many components and themes of Angela’s Ashes will click on a luminescent light bulb in your head, and soon you will view everything in a different light. It will be like seeing life through a whole new lens – a refreshing feeling nobody minds. ",4,0.9823,0.05,0.836,0.114,0.6139611633577149,POSITIVE,0.9999
118,86033940,01/21/2010,5.0,"Stunning. Absolutely stunning. What an amazing way of telling your life's story. Or at least the story of your first nineteen years on this earth. This didn't read like a memoir, full of funny stories and important, yet fleeting figures, that all combine in the end to give a moral or a lesson. Rather this is just a raw and honest look at a hard life.When I talk to people about Angela's Ashes most have the reaction of, ""Oh my gosh it's such a sad book."" Or ""I loved that book."" Or variations on the two. The former reaction seemed to come from people without strong Irish heritage. The latter- Irish. There's a bitter humor that runs throughout the book. A very, what I've come to realize is an Irish humor.If asked- I'm American. Really, most of my family has been in this country since it was first founded. But when tracing family lineage I'm a strong 25% German, and the rest of me is Irish. Maybe just a dash of French, Scottish and English thrown in there- but mostly Irish. I found myself laughing at so many things, that other people, without that bitter, biting, Irish sense of humor would find unsettling. There is an Irish personality I've noticed, especially after reading this book and thinking about my family. We laugh at hardships, they (or at least Frank) laughed at hardships.Yes, Frank McCourt had an extremely hard life. Yes, there were dispicable things happening, disturbing and sad. But he writes it all with such an innocent and storylike quality to it, you feel that he's kindly putting up a window so you're not right in it, and you can watch in comfort.His style of writing is so unique as well. It's story-telling done so well you have trouble remembering this all really happened. There are depressing moments, there are touching moments, and like I keep saying there are many funny moments.Angela's Ashes is a perfect book to help you really remember that life is what you make it. Shit is going to be thrown at you, but you can't let it weigh you down. You can change your circumstances. Yes, it's hard work, but with determination and the ability not to take it all so seriously, you can turn things around your way. And really, things aren't so bad.Oh- I guess there was a moral here. Well done, McCourt. Well done.",4,0.9866,0.093,0.743,0.164,0.4805560251714097,POSITIVE,0.9999

Angela's ashes is a memoir - I'm still not sure why such a title coz Angela isn't becoming ashes here. It is a memoir by Frank McCourt of his Irish childhood that had a dad who whiled away on drinks and a mom who could never meet ends with 7 kids eventually losing 3 to sickness. Through the words of a child we get to know of the Irish generation which was stuck between the wrath towards the English who ripped them for 800 yrs and the dependency on the very same English for any sort of work/money. I was amused to note that an Irish kid from 1930 had these ideas about India - ""there were dark skinned ladies with red dot on their forehead whom they can marry""; Calcutta was disease infested and Mumbai was a slum; Kashmir is more beautiful than Killarney; Bangalore had dogs - :). It was heartbreaking to read of the kids who didn't have a slice of bread for a meal and how they had to steal and beg sometimes even coal to survive, it gave a smile to read of the nine year old who saw his parents marriage certificate and calculated that if he was born before 9 months after that date, he might be a miracle baby!; it was inspiring to read the journey of a man who roamed around in one shirt day and night, often didn't have a slice of bread and survived on tea leaves and boiling water, and dreamt of the big American Dream and who indeed made it with the 'Pulitzer Prize'!

Here is why: in the book, horrible and terrible and awful tragic things are happening to the author in his youth. It's awful. However, you are inside of the boy's head and hear his thoughts. He is hilarious! He misinterprets things and has a totally child like way of seeing everything.I remember when he takes his first communion, he gets sick and throws up afterwards. His Grandma freaks out and scoops up the vomit, because in her belief, the wafer he had just thrown up was literally the body of Christ, and she couldn't leave it on the floor like that. The priest finally convinced her it was okay to throw it out, and that no one would have to eat it again. (Which brings me to the question I have always wanted to ask a Catholic friend: If the Sacramental food that you eat is literally the body and blood of Christ, then what about when you poop it out and flush it down the toilet? Seriously. I have always been concerned about this.)So anyways, the movie based on this book shows all the terrible things happening to him, sans the hilarious thoughts he is having about them in his head. So instead of being a super funny awesome story, it's a super sad and dark unhappy dumb movie. Skip the movie. Read the book twice instead.",4,-0.4625,0.141,0.729,0.13,0.7399764844209288,NEGATIVE,1.0

As a child he grew up having to accept handouts because his father was a drunk and would drink away whatever little work money he was able to get. Due to the family's malnourishment and lack of proper housing; Frank lost three young siblings to illness, and spent his entire childhood hungry and in and out of hospitals. Despite all that he was able to look towards the future and worked hard to save money to go to America.

I don't care if it is an exageration because what it does is show how a child sees the world. It shows how a child can still love his alcoholic father and co-dependant mother despite all the pain they made him suffer. And it shows that someone can rise above his situation. It shows that the church is really not that helpful if you don't have money but there are still people in the church who can be kind and good. It shows that there are people who are not religious who can be kind and good as well. It shows that religion does not go hand in hand with goodness. It shows that whether you are good or bad does not so much depend on your religion or your station in life but on what you do with what you have.I can see how someone who is extremely religious might be offended by this book and I would not recommend it in that case.I laughed much more than I cried.

Because of McCourt's style, childish judgements, orality of the narrative, and Irish slang, the graveness of the McCourts' story is very much sweetened. But if you take out all the amusement, Angela's Ashes is a very very sad and heartbreaking story. Of course it's also inspiring given what Frank McCourt succeeded in his life, but this cannot be said about his mother, a woman who suffered from poverty and the loss of her children, for a big part of her life. Three of her children died and that's inconceivable to me as a mother.Contrary to my expectations, Angela doesn't die at the end of this book (and that made me happy), but I had a theory which was confirmed when reading other opinions online: to me, the ashes in the title is the nothingness that became her life, after moving to Ireland and loosing her children, her husband, and her decency.

It's also cool that Frank McCourt was a high school teacher before publishing his first book at the age of 66, which won a Pulitzer and established him as a minor literary celebrity. I watched an interview with Frank McCourt where he was asked whether the success of Angela's Ashes took him by surprise. He said yes, the most he'd realistically hoped for the book was a small blurb in the New York Times. A blurb which would probably describe the book as ""lyrical and charming,"" because every book by an Irish writer was described by the New York Times as ""lyrical and charming.""Angela's Ashes is lyrical and charming.

I came to be entertained, and I was.In spite of his grammar abuse, McCourt writes well. I don't know what he has against quotation marks, for there was nary a one to be found in the entire book, but I eventually got used to their absence. He also seemed to disapprove of indentations, but that was selective. Some paragraphs had them, others didn't, and I couldn't find a pattern though I confess I didn't look that hard. After a few pages I stopped noticing. I guess these are artsy-fartsy things the modern literary elite like to ""ooh"" and ""aah"" over, but I'm not sure. This book makes it very clear that McCourt was quite poor, so maybe he couldn't afford the quotation marks and was able to get only half a book of indentations and decided to spread them out evenly.I was entertained, like I said, but I wouldn't call this fantastic. For the life of me I can't figure out why it won a Pulitzer prize. I guess the competition wasn't very stiff on the 1997 autobiography slate. Apparently this ushered in a new genre for memoirs, that of misery literature, and the race was on to see who could write the most traumatic story of his life. I guess we can thank/curse Mr. McCourt for that depending on your fancy.If you're invested in the story, I'm sure you'd find it quite depressing. It's very bleak, but it was overkill for me. It's like Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ: That ordeal was rather harrowing, but in the end it's just two hours of beating a man, and it gets boring. This ongoing tale of woe was interspersed with amusing anecdotes, and Frank's witty style with his childlike observations helped to keep me going without forcing myself to it, but I did get tired of reading the same thing over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. We're poor, father drank all the money we got from (insert various jobs/charities/etc. here), mother got pregnant, the baby died, the school masters hit me because (insert silly reason to hit a child here), grandma and auntie hit us because (insert even sillier reason to hit a child here), I sinned, I went to confession, I sinned again, we ate bread when we had it, if we came into money I'd get an egg, I'd get work doing (insert trivial job here) but lost it because (insert debilitating illness here), on and on and on ad nauseum.A lot of Frank's sins involve jacking off, but I think God will be merciful. There really wasn't anything else to do in Limerick, and going from being abused to self-abuse sounds like a step up to me. He did do it at the top of a hill a few times for all the world to see (not that anyone was watching), but who hasn't?Since Frank is Irish, these masturbation parts always reminded me of a verse from an old dirty song that used to tickle me. It's done to the tune of ""She'll Be Coming Round the Mountain."" I'll start with the chorus, and I expect y'all to take care of the echo part.Ahem, mi mi mi mi miiiiiiii, everyone on key? Splendid.

It blew my mind knowing this was all true. A very depressing and dark time with a deplorable and alcoholic father who didn’t care about anyone but himself. His poor mother and the way she had to live; with her own mother who didn’t care to help much at all. I just can’t even imagine a life like that.

143,3979743383,05/02/2021,5.0,"He wrote ""Angela's Ashes"" in ' 69. This is not a work of art. Biography, or rather, autobiography. Frank McCourt was not a politician or a celebrity, a retired teacher. The book took a Pulitzer; translated into seventeen languages; a film was made based on it: based on the script of McCourt, the Broadway musical "" The Irish. And how they got there"", which has survived five productions in two decades to rave reviews from the audience. The book outraged many Irish people who lived in Limerick at the time described, who found its troubles and sorrows greatly exaggerated, and the author's mother, Angela McCourt, at the premiere of a film based on her son's book, shouted: ""This is all a lie!"" Прах к прахуПреподаватель говорит, что умереть за веру – великая честь, папа говорит, что умереть за Ирландию – великая честь, и я думаю, а надо ли хоть кому-нибудь, чтобы мы жили? Мои братья умерли, и сестра умерла, и мне хотелось бы знать, за что они умерли - за Ирландию или за веру. Мне хотелось бы узнать, почему на свете столько взрослых, которые ни за Ирландию, ни за веру не умерли.Он написал ""Прах Энджелы"" в 69. Это не художественное произведение. Биография, точнее - автобиография. Фрэнк Маккорт не был политиком или знаменитостью, учитель на пенсии. Книга взяла Пулитцера; переведена на семнадцать языков; по ней снят фильм: на основе сценария Маккорта поставлен бродвейский мюзикл ""Ирландцы. И как они туда попали"", который пережил пять постановок за два десятка лет под восторженные отзывы зрителей. Книга возмутила многих ирландцев, живших в описанное время в Лимерике, которые нашли ее беды и горести сильно преувеличенными, а мать автора, Энджела Маккорт на премьере фильма, поставленного по книге ее сына, выкрикивала: ""Вранье все это!""Что до ирландцев, тут ведь, понимаете, всякий своей жизнью жил и если кому повезло расти в полной семье с работящими, умеренно пьющими родителями - это одно. А кому, как Фрэнки - это даже совсем другое. и потом, были ведь ""Поющие Лазаря или Очень бедные люди"" Флэнна о`Брайена, где совершенно то же написано, может только взгляд с чуть иной точки. Я вам больше скажу, господа, изумрудный остров и сегодня не самое уютное для жизни ребенка места, хоть ""Голос монстра"" Патрика Несса возьмите, хоть ""Быстрый чистый крик"" Шиван Доуд. А что до матушкиного возмущения. Ну, ее можно понять: выросший и успевший сам стать дедом сын, рассказывает всему миру о том, как в его детстве мать низвела себя до роли самки, бесконечно рожающей от алкоголика-отца; дети которой умирали в чудовищных условиях, а она только стонала да жаловалась.Тут еще, понимаете, взрослый, какой бы тяжелой ни была жизнь. которую ему приходится вести, видит мир сверху. Грязь и мерзость удалены от его глаз сантиметров на сорок, в сравнении с детским взглядом. И у взрослого, имеющего детей, какое бы ничтожное место в социальной иерархии он не занимал, есть подчиненные. И подружка в том же нищем квартале, муж которой так же пьет, да еще и поколачивает ее с детьми - тебе лучше, твой на тебя руки не поднимает (пьет и не работает, это да, но чтоб бить?). Подружка, с которой можно высмолить полпачки сигарет за разговорами о том, какие козлы эти мужики, да сколько хлопот с детьми. И когда ты взрослая женщина, ты можешь иногда, в особо тяжелых ситуациях, как смерть семинедельной дочери, впасть в депрессию, лечь в постель и лежать, уставившись в стенку, пока отец пропивает деньги, полученные от продажи тела малышки в анатомичку. А как там оставшиеся четверо мальчишек, от двух до пяти - авось как-нибудь.Если из того, что я успела написать, вы сделали вывод - чернуха. то вы сделали неверный вывод. Эта книга не из тех, которые принято называть ""добрыми"". Она жестокая, порой невыносимая обыденностью ужаса, но при этом вся пронизана парадоксальным юмором, который не веселье, не ирония, не сарказм, но понемногу от всего этого. Наивность простака который глядит во все глаза на абсурдный, накренившийся мир, не зная, что где-то может быть иначе и пытается приспособиться к имеющемуся. Исполненная горькой нежности история о том, как один мальчик выжил, хотя по всему не должен был. Прожил достойную жизнь. Стал богатым и знаменитым, хотя бы даже в последнее десятилетие своей жизни. И развеял по ветру прах той Энджелы, которая убила его детство (потому что каким будет детство, целиком зависит от родителей). А та женщина под сотню, что кричала на премьере: ""Враки"", была другая Энджела.

147,288675512,03/04/2012,4.0,"So I remember when this engrossing memoir was all the rage back in the late 90's, around the time Ireland was experiencing an economic resurgence and trends like Riverdance and pubs were becoming popular in America. All I heard about this book was that it was ""sad"".So imagine my surprise when I didn't find the novel to be merely ""sad"". Although the author tells the story of a childhood riddled with poverty, loneliness, and saddest of all (in my eyes), little kindness, encouragement or affection; in spite of all this, he tells his story with humor of all things! It reminds me of a wise woman who said that life will either make you laugh or cry, and why not laugh because crying gives you a headache.The book makes you feel as if you're living with the McCourt household in 1930's New York and later Ireland as they beg a pig's head for Christmas dinner, nail tires to their shoes when they start to wear out, experience typhoid fever, consumption and tuberculosis, and watch their father drink away his wages again, and again, and again. It sounds pretty dark on paper, but somehow McCourt made me chuckle and smile at every turn.If you have experienced the nature of addiction (and remember that the author's alcoholic father can't exactly join AA back in those days, and don't forget the worshiped role of booze in Irish culture), it isn't surprising but no less astonishing that a person can be so supremely selfish. Indeed, McCourt brings out one of the tragic truths of humanity - that you can love someone for the good that's in them, despite the fact that they are incapable of loving you back. (LOVE, of course, is an action, not just a feeling).I don't feel that I necessarily admire the author, despite his ultimate victory over poverty, but neither do I begrudge him his financial success through his writing. People have criticized him for making money off of his misfortunes, of falsifying events and so on. Since MccCourt wrote his memoir while in his 60's, I take it for granted that unless he has a photographic memory, the novel reflects his feelings and impressions of his upbringing, uses liberal creative license, and is not a verbatim report of past events. But I think he is honest to the spirit of things. He makes no qualms about admitting that he was many times dishonest and shady in order to reach his goals, whether it was finding bread to eat or scraping up the fare to immigrate back to America, the land of his birth. The author himself recognizes that he is an unscrupulous opportunist; are we really surprised that this disadvantaged boy would grow up to make a fortune off of the misery of his past life? I'm happy for the guy and hope he's finally at peace now, having passed away in 2009.",3,0.9925,0.099,0.719,0.182,0.5335961657390228,POSITIVE,0.969

Frank McCourt, the author and main character engaged me by the first 2 sentences of the book. I enjoyed his style of writing and the way he displayed conversations. I truly felt like I was there with him listening to his story.After reading this book, you can't help but look at life and all that is around you and know that it is true, we do live a life of ""excess"". America is about big houses, big cars (thank you GM Hummer), big meals (thank you Claim Jumper and AG Spurs) Hollywood Glamour, money...and it is true; Americans are ""whiners"".

149,1510258103,01/15/2016,4.0,"This book is so very sad: extreme poverty, starvation, diseases, neglect, and so many dead children. The most terrible thing in my opinion in these situations is the parents' neglect of their children, and their blindness about it, their ignorance about it. Neglect that leads to many of the terrible things that happen to kids in poverty. And that leads very young children to prematurely behave and become adults, as Frank was already at the age of 5 or even earlier. So sad, so painful.The book is bleak, but what can you expect when the kids are dirty, dressed in filthy rags, starving, barely have a shack for a house, a father that drinks his weekly salary (when he has a job!), and diseases that are overlooked by neglecting parents and get sever sometimes to the death of infants.Also, how can you grow up and aspire to become someone or value education when everybody around you is pretty much like this?. That is a real problem, not only in depression times, not only in Catholic Ireland, but in a poor neighborhood also in your country, today, wherever you are. There is also some black humor in this book, and it is funny although depressing. For everyone that asks how does one remembers early childhood so vividly? Or how can there be almost no happiness in a kid's life? I am very happy for you that you can't answer these question. But this is reality of children, who suffer, that later become adults, and they keep their scars forever.Back to the literary aspect, the writing is pretty good, although a bit repetitive. But what bothered me was the abrupt ending, I think McCourt could omit the last story that was not really related to the book, instead of fully opening a new chapter that does not get enough attention or closure.

There's a lot of misery in this book what with the church, the rain, the consumption, the pint, the starvation, the children dying left and right but it is balanced with an appreciation for things we take for granted like just being able to get up in the morning and have a boiled egg.But it also frustrates me because of the church and how it encouraged people to have numerous babies they could barely feed and then it offered little help. Folks smack children over the slightest thing too. This book would go well with Black Boy by Richard Wright in the sense that both had a difficult childhood full of starvation, beatings and disappointing dads. They both faced their own share of prejudice, those McCourt's was mostly class based, where Wright dealt with class AND race. Both men are surrounded by cruel religious types. Glass Castle would go well too because you have the alcoholic dreamer dad that the child loves because he's their dad, because as much as the reader ends up hating him, the father is, in some ways a good person. (In some ways)But the alcohol fries their brain and their sense of right and wrong.

151,49432434,03/16/2009,5.0,"The author remains for me, ""Mr. McCourt,"" because he was my English teacher in High School. Sometimes he brought in drafts of sections from this book (and, I believe, the next one as well) and read them aloud in class. This might not be seen as a particularly useful pedagogical exercise, if observed by a school administrator or board member, but in fact it served a higher purpose - that of inspiring us as students to strive to use the English language in the most perfect way possible in order to express and explore our thoughts.This book is also an inspiration. In spite of its many descriptions of grinding poverty, childhood illnesses, and constant hunger, it consistently demonstrates a human spirit that transcends its circumstances and recreates itself through perseverance, luck, and wit. Frank McCourt learns in spite of teachers who who promote stupidity, hopes in spite of a world that says he can never accomplish anything, loves in spite of dullness and hatred. I once heard a self-proclaimed ""intellectual"" on PBS describe this book as a depressing example ""Irish rage,"" shortly before he admitted that he hadn't read the book. In fact, it is as close to an opposite of that as one could achieve. Far from depressing, it is uplifting, because the choices young Frank makes allow him to escape circumstances that would destroy other individuals. Far from being specific to the Irish experience, it is universal in its application, because each person faces the same possibility of limitation due to social surroundings, and the same struggle to overcome them. Far from noisy rage, it seems to me a symphony of humanity that demonstrates the harmony possible in this world.",3,-0.9906,0.209,0.681,0.11,0.4232857142857143,POSITIVE,0.9998

It's a detailed account of his Irish Catholic childhood in Limerick (Ireland), his struggle through the degrading and depressing life in squalor and the worst of conditions, which he has artistically sprinkled with irreverant dark humor. It's a life of such great deprivation, that all his childhood is snatched away. BUT...This seems to be predominantly the book of old Frank, and not the little Frank, which I think is unavoidable when recounting one's childhood, but in the act of doing so he may have become dishonest. I have no qualms if the author adds a bit here or there to enhance the readability of the book, yet it's not seldom when the question pops in my mind - ""Is McCourt reliable at all?""McCourt's side:McCourt thinks his critics are missing the point. ‘Angela’s Ashes and ’Tis are not autobiographies, they are memoirs – and they are not the same things. An autobiography is an attempt to bring up all the facts, and to stick to them, faithfully and chronologically. But a memoir is an impression of your life, and that gives you a certain amount of leeway. If an autobiography is like a photograph, then a memoir is more like a painting. So I’ve always said to my critics, This is my impression of my life, so what are you gonna do about it?’Okay! We got it.

I really did feel a lot for him and his family and I am glad that he came out of the poor situation and made a good life for himself.The memoir continues in the second book 'Tis A Memoir.

He has a gift for storytelling, and finding light in dark moments. He can also bring tears to your eyes in the next paragraph. I do have one criticism, and it's just a personal preference - I could have done with a lot less wank-talk as he went through puberty. I know it's part of growing up for a young man but I was put off by the repeated mentions of it and the details he went into. I found the day-to-day details of their survival amazing and riveting. The thing I found most powerful was the way he described the crushing Irish Catholic guilt he felt. That resonated with me.

185,2511386051,08/28/2018,5.0," Angela’s Ashes by Frank Mc Court as reviewed by Gail M.Murray Frank Mc Court’s memoir covers his life from age 4 to 19 in Limerick, Ireland during the 1930’s and 1940’s. It is a sad Irish Catholic childhood with an alcoholic father, pompous priests, bullying schoolmasters, illness, and death of 3 of his siblings yet his humor, pathos and perseverance shine through. It is an emotional and compelling read.  Mc Court published Angela’s Ashes in 1996, won a Pulitzer in 1997 and the movie was released in 1999 starring Robert Carlyle and Emily Watson. The story of his childhood was always there in his mind when he attended English courses at New York University and wrote a piece about waking up with fleas in the mattress, when he and brother Malachy improvised then performed their memories and brought the house down. He taught creative writing at Peter Stuyvestant High School in prestigious Manhattan and wrote to encourage his students. Yet is was in his sixties and encouraged by his third wife Ellen that he wrote it all down. The editor barely changed anything; the story was deep in his marrow. Sometimes she would find him in turmoil and tears. He had to forgive before he could write. Though his father’s alcoholism left them starving and desperate, he never condemned him. My favourite passage in the book is the way he describes his father: “I think my father is like the Holy Trinity with three people in him, the one in the morning who makes us tea and reads the paper, the one at night with the stories and prayers and then the one who does the bad thing and comes home with the smell of whiskey and wants us to die for Ireland.”(p210).  Frank almost does die from the squalid living conditions, ending up in the hospital with typhoid, taking two and a half months to recover. It is the first time he sleeps in a bed with clean white sheets and gets regular nutritious meals. How anyone can survive on tea and fried bread is a wonder.  Although his mother did her best to scrape through without help from her cruel family, it bothered me that she always had money for cigarettes – her one indulgence. At that time, women could not collect the dole, jobs were few and there was no child care. As a Catholic she was obliged to service her husband. Birth control was illegal in Ireland until 1980. Angela bore seven children and lost three of them as babies to pneumonia. Her only daughter Margaret died at seven weeks of age. His memoir deals with major themes: poverty, religion (the church is pervasive in their everyday lives), classes, misplaced pride, coming of age. The tone is conversational, colloquial and engaging. We see through the child’s perspective, an observant child with an ironic sense of humor. Frank was the eldest and grew up fast stealing bread, milk and apples to feed his brothers as their father drank their money away. At 13 he was working full time as a telegram delivery boy. Throughout the book, he is serious, clever and street smart – a survivor- and we cheer him on! Mc Court wrote two other memoirs: ‘Tis about his early adult years as an immigrant in New York City and Teacher Man which elaborates his teaching career.  When interviewed he said: “Doggedness is not as glamorous as ambition, talent, intellect or charm but still the one thing that got me through the days and nights.”",2,-0.645,0.076,0.856,0.069,0.4451889903026265,POSITIVE,0.9812
186,2153582679,04/12/2021,4.0,"Synopsis: Angela’s Ashes is the Pulitzer Prize winning memoir of Frank McCourt. The book begins in New York, where Frank’s parents met and started the family. We see the McCourts struggling with the harsh realities of poverty caused by dad’s alcoholism and inability to find work. Frank is only four years old and is already sharing the responsibilities of raising his younger siblings, while experiencing hunger, squalor, and sickness. The family moves back to Ireland during the Great Depression and their situation takes a turn for the worse. There is very little support available from their extended family and the McCourts plunge deeper into poverty and a life of misery.*** Review ***While many readers may find the book to be a very depressing read, I do not share this view. First, McCourt is a great narrator who is able to show us the crude depictions of poverty and its dramatic effects, yet does so with humor and compassion. Secondly, in spite of a bleak picture of extreme and inescapable poverty, we see Frank McCourt growing up into a young man who is responsible, hard working, and who is able to ultimately reap the benefits of his education. With every bit on money saved, Frank gets one step closer to salvation from the claws of poverty.One particular aspect that I loved about this book is McCourt’s relation with his alcoholic father, Malachy. While it was Malachy’s alcoholism that was the root of all misfortunes of the family, McCourt depicts his father with much compassion, in a way that makes it almost impossible for the readers to hate him. We frequently see glimpses of a father who deeply loves his children, who told them stories and loved teaching them about Irish history, a father who suffered immensely when three of his small children passed away, but ultimately a father with a debilitating addiction to alcohol.While this may not be a book that fits everyone’s tastes (well, what book really does?), I found this auto-biography absolutely fascinating. This is particularly because it does not simply reflect the a dramatic story of one single family. The McCourt story is intertwined with the history of the time and the typical challenges experienced by the Irish society: famine, unemployment, extreme poverty, and the strong grip of the Catholic church.Read more of my book reviews:Instagram: www.instagram.com/abookwormstravels/Facebook: https://facebook.com/abookwormstravelsTwitter: https://twitter.com/BookwormsTravelBlog: https://abookwormstravelsblog.wordpre...",2,0.4547,0.099,0.797,0.104,0.5644418081918082,POSITIVE,0.9979
187,3666151819,12/19/2020,3.0,"Angela’s Ashes is well written and even funny at times despite being a story of poverty, abuse, neglect, abandonment, and religious oppression. Early on, the story is very engaging but over halfway through it starts to feel repetitive. Frank McCourt has been accused of exaggerating and fabricating many elements of what is supposed to be an autobiographical work. To some extent, this is the nature of memoirs. They aren’t accurate retellings of events. They are an individual’s memories or interpretations of events. Memories aren’t snapshots of points in time. They change and become altered over the years. Two people can remember the same event very differently. Still, people who knew Frank McCourt said his family wasn’t as poor as he claimed they were. In Angela’s Ashes, McCourt says, “When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I survived at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood.” Did McCourt invent some aspects of his childhood story, sprinkling in fabrications among actual events, because he thought his real childhood wasn’t worth a reader’s while? And if many events are indeed fabricated, is it worth the reader’s while? As an example, McCourt claims the day before his confirmation a boy offered to let him spy on his naked sisters. They got caught and got into trouble. McCourt later admitted that this particular boy didn’t have any sisters. McCourt defended the book by saying it’s ""a memoir, not an exact history."" How much of the book is inexact? Which parts? Some things in the book ring true, like the treatment of pupils by the masters in schools and the oppressiveness of the Catholic Church in Ireland at that time. But it’s hard to know what’s real and what was added to make the book “worth your while.”Angela’s Ashes is marketed as a memoir/autobiography but semi-autobiographical seems like a much more accurate description of what readers should expect. I think if it had been properly marketed, I would have liked it more.

188,1977309205,08/22/2017,4.0,"Frank McCourt grew up in extreme poverty on the streets of Limerick, Ireland. His father was an alcoholic who could never keep a job and spent every bit of money on whiskey or a pint. This memoir was filled with gloomy, sorrowful pages of a desperately hungry family struggling to survive. But what I have witnessed time and time again is the kindness of the poor towards people who are even less fortunate than them. While wealthy people and people of the church slammed doors in young Frankie's face and shamed his family for needing assistance, his mother and brother were welcoming the homeless into their house for a (somewhat) dry place to spend the night. I have seen this play out so many times - why is it that the poor are more charitable than the wealthy? I googled it and there are actually studies done that confirm this. An NPR article says, ""Across these experiments, the main variable that we find that consistently explains this differential pattern of giving and helping and generosity among the upper and lower class is feelings of sensitivity and care for the welfare of other people and, essentially, the emotion that we call compassion.""Frankie's school experience had its ups and downs. Some of his teachers had zero patience, were quick to reprimand, and very actively discouraged questions. Another teacher gave this advice: You have to study and learn so that you can make up your own mind. Stock your mind, stock your mind. It is your house of treasure and no one in the world can interfere with it. If you won the Irish Sweepstakes and bought a house that needed furniture would you fill it with bits and pieces of rubbish?

Frankie's boyhood voice comes through strong as cigarette smoke in this ""misery memoir"" and lingers just as long; this writing is bold, funny, cinematic. One feels set down in the streets of Limerick to fend for oneself, just as the McCourts do day in and day out. There is a cyclic quality to this story: Schoolmasters question their pupils using the same conversational format no matter what the subject is. Frank's father sings nationalistic songs and exaggerates his patriotism every night he comes home from the pub. Our young hero tries to prevent his siblings from telling stories about  his  hero, the legendary figure Cuchulain. Angela is mocked and teased by the owners of the charities she begs for help. And always, always, there is hunger.This book is terribly sad; babies die, fathers drink, mothers trade sex for shelter. But it never goes beyond the pale in terms of gore or sexual content; as the narrative voice is so beautifully childlike, the worst events are revealed through euphemistic language. People are here one day and ""gone"" the other; babies are delivered by the Angel on the Seventh Step.

My favorite aspect of this book is how the author's voice changes over the course of the book - the voice starts very childlike and innocent, and as the years pass and the author grows up, the voice matures as well. It makes it feel like the story is really being told to the reader, as opposed to being kept at arm's length. The voice also helped mitigate some of the terrible events of the author's childhood - we, the reader, can read between the lines and understand how miserable things must have been, but a young person's matter-of-fact narration keeps it from bogging down.

The book took a Pulitzer; translated into seventeen languages; a film was made based on it: based on the script of McCourt, the Broadway musical "" The Irish. And how they got there"", which has survived five productions in two decades to rave reviews from the audience.

Биография, точнее - автобиография. Фрэнк Маккорт не был политиком или знаменитостью, учитель на пенсии. Книга взяла Пулитцера; переведена на семнадцать языков; по ней снят фильм: на основе сценария Маккорта поставлен бродвейский мюзикл ""Ирландцы. И как они туда попали"", который пережил пять постановок за два десятка лет под восторженные отзывы зрителей. Книга возмутила многих ирландцев, живших в описанное время в Лимерике, которые нашли ее беды и горести сильно преувеличенными, а мать автора, Энджела Маккорт на премьере фильма, поставленного по книге ее сына, выкрикивала: ""Вранье все это!""Что до ирландцев, тут ведь, понимаете, всякий своей жизнью жил и если кому повезло расти в полной семье с работящими, умеренно пьющими родителями - это одно. А кому, как Фрэнки - это даже совсем другое. и потом, были ведь ""Поющие Лазаря или Очень бедные люди"" Флэнна о`Брайена, где совершенно то же написано, может только взгляд с чуть иной точки. Я вам больше скажу, господа, изумрудный остров и сегодня не самое уютное для жизни ребенка места, хоть ""Голос монстра"" Патрика Несса возьмите, хоть ""Быстрый чистый крик"" Шиван Доуд. А что до матушкиного возмущения. Ну, ее можно понять: выросший и успевший сам стать дедом сын, рассказывает всему миру о том, как в его детстве мать низвела себя до роли самки, бесконечно рожающей от алкоголика-отца; дети которой умирали в чудовищных условиях, а она только стонала да жаловалась.Тут еще, понимаете, взрослый, какой бы тяжелой ни была жизнь. которую ему приходится вести, видит мир сверху. Грязь и мерзость удалены от его глаз сантиметров на сорок, в сравнении с детским взглядом. И у взрослого, имеющего детей, какое бы ничтожное место в социальной иерархии он не занимал, есть подчиненные. И подружка в том же нищем квартале, муж которой так же пьет, да еще и поколачивает ее с детьми - тебе лучше, твой на тебя руки не поднимает (пьет и не работает, это да, но чтоб бить?). Подружка, с которой можно высмолить полпачки сигарет за разговорами о том, какие козлы эти мужики, да сколько хлопот с детьми. И когда ты взрослая женщина, ты можешь иногда, в особо тяжелых ситуациях, как смерть семинедельной дочери, впасть в депрессию, лечь в постель и лежать, уставившись в стенку, пока отец пропивает деньги, полученные от продажи тела малышки в анатомичку. А как там оставшиеся четверо мальчишек, от двух до пяти - авось как-нибудь.Если из того, что я успела написать, вы сделали вывод - чернуха. то вы сделали неверный вывод. Эта книга не из тех, которые принято называть ""добрыми"". Она жестокая, порой невыносимая обыденностью ужаса, но при этом вся пронизана парадоксальным юмором, который не веселье, не ирония, не сарказм, но понемногу от всего этого. Наивность простака который глядит во все глаза на абсурдный, накренившийся мир, не зная, что где-то может быть иначе и пытается приспособиться к имеющемуся. Исполненная горькой нежности история о том, как один мальчик выжил, хотя по всему не должен был. Прожил достойную жизнь. Стал богатым и знаменитым, хотя бы даже в последнее десятилетие своей жизни.

Born in America to Irish parents, he lived the first few years of his life in poverty in New York City before his parents decided to move back to Ireland - where they proceeded to live there in abject poverty. McCourt begins the book by saying that was a mistake, and he proceeds to lay out in humorous yet sometimes gut-wrenching detail why that was. He focuses on his boyhood, especially up to age twelve or so. From there he somewhat quickens the tempo up to the end of the book, when he is nineteen. McCourt, his mother, and his siblings are really handicapped by McCourt's lazy, alcoholic father. The man is a deadbeat, going for long stretches without a job, sitting at home literally doing nothing except collecting ""the dole"", and then immediately spending all of that in one night at various taverns. If he does get a job, he loses it by the third week due to drunkenness. To even call his attempts at trying to get employment ""halfhearted"" would be charitable. The man was just lazy. Since McCourt's mother, Angela, is always seemingly pregnant, she does not get a job either. She tries to take care of the children as best she can in whatever awful apartment or relative's home they are staying at, but with a no-good husband, she is forced to go plead for donations from charities, and then finally beg for food. Not until very late in the book, after Frank is already no longer living with her, does she get a job caring for an old man. Unfortunately, Frank's extended family is almost no better. The only one who shows him any kindness is an uncle on his mother's side, Pa Keating. Everyone else is mean, even downright cruel, to Frank and his siblings. Frank seems to bear the brunt of it since he is the oldest one, and unfortunately for him, physically resembles his father. His grandma is a mean old witch who does not miss any chance to demean him, nor does his Aunt Aggie. A cousin, Laman Griffin, is no better. But not just his family is cruel. Frank paints a portrait of a dysfunctional society where many of the men are drunks, the women pious, and almost everyone looking down on them. The children starve, get diseases (three of his siblings die), do not get adequate medical care or nourishment, and not even much schooling. Only at the very end, after a few years of hard work (and a bit of thievery), would Frank no longer be considered destitute. And perhaps that is the biggest reason that this book is so good: Frank never gives up, never stops trying to be better, does not allow himself to stay wallowed in self-pity, keeps working hard to reach his goal of returning to the United States and starting a new life. This is not an easy read. Some of the things and situations that Frank describes are horrible, especially considering that this is what the children were enduring everyday. There are many example, but one should suffice to explain what type of existence he had to endure. On page 296, he is writing of when he moved in with his mentally handicapped uncle, Pat: ""He says there's no food in the house, not a scrap of bread, and when he falls asleep I take the greasy newspaper from the floor. I lick the front page, which is all advertisements for films and dances in the city. I lick the headlines. I lick the great attacks of Patton and Montgomery in France and Germany. I lick the war in the Pacific. I lick the obituaries and the sad memorial poems, the sports pages, the market prices of eggs butter and bacon. I suck the paper till there isn't a smidgen of grease. I wonder what I'll do tomorrow."" It's a miracle that he made it out of Limerick City, Ireland alive. ",2,-0.977,0.122,0.796,0.082,0.5281901605339104,NEGATIVE,0.9997

His life is the definition of perseverance and determination in spite of great tribulation. I seem unable to remove from my mind clichés when trying to tell you my impression of this novel and this boy whose story it is.His story is sincerely the perfect example of rags to riches as through harsh poverty young Frank, unaware of his worth pushes through hunger, cold and disappointment. He endures,he fights back with a sometimes wavering strength not understanding that he was truly a diamond in the rough.  If you're wanting to read a light, happy, hopeful tale that will boost your assurance that life isn't filled with depressing news this is the wrong book for that. This book broke my heart often and McCourt's humor helped me just enough to keep reading. This family suffered sorrow and hardship and some members survived ,while others, perhaps mercifully did not thanks mainly to the father who just didn't have enough strength in him as his young sons did.However, reading about Frank McCourt in this volume and also read an article about what he goes on and accomplishes beyond the book I cannot help but feel inspired.

The lack of quotation marks on the conversations was easy for me to get used to, but I admit I struggled with reading the words written with an Irish accent. Though very sad, it had moments of happiness that made me laugh out loud.The story is close to my heart. Even if we didn't experience poverty like the McCourts, I did experience deprivation in many aspects, making the story relatable and I, too, looked back in my own childhood and smile at the memories. I see my own dad in Frank's story, for my late father also experienced poverty - having to sell ice drop while he was young and having to work as a janitor at the same university where he studied college. I love stories like this, for it is indeed an inspiration. Now, I think I will buy the next book - 'Tis - because I want to know how he rose from the ashes. *SPOILERS AHEAD*Giving my five - point reaction to this book:1) The heaviest part was at the first few chapters, but even if it was too much to handle and I was on the verge of giving up, it didn't make me cry. The book made me cry, yes, but it was towards the later part of the book - especially that part where the father cut the hard boiled egg to share to his children.2) Their father wasn't a desirable man, but there were some things in him I admired. One, for marrying Angela and staying with her despite the many problems... two, for his faith in the Catholic church. Such a shame that there was no word about him after he went back to England, I wanna know if he came back to Angela and her two remaining children.3) I loved how it was written - with child's voice and lingo at first, gradually changing as Frank aged. It was nice to see an improvement in POV and writing alongside with Frank's life changing for the better.4) I seriously don't want to experience extreme poverty like theirs, but I greatly admire Angela for her strength. She made bad choices after they got evicted, but she sure is a great mother. 5) In one of the interviews of Frank McCourt on YouTube, there was a comment about this story being a lie - that the McCourts weren't that poor. I don't know if it's true or not - what a shame if it is - but I gotta say, real or not, it was a well crafted book, something to draw inspiration from. RIP, Francis McCourt.

I’m glad that I finally got a chance to read it.Frank McCourt was born in depression-era New York, but poverty and his father’s drinking drove his immigrant family back to Ireland. Life in Ireland isn’t any easier for Frank. He grows up in extreme poverty and faces disease and starvation. His only goal is to become a man so that he can get a job and support his family.This memoir is pretty bleak. Frank did not have an easy childhood. His hunger, poverty, and unsanitary living conditions led to serious diseases that altered his life and killed a few of his siblings. Even though this book is difficult to read, it’s not completely depressing. There are moments of startling humor and beauty. The writing is very good. It’s blunt and occasionally vulgar. It’s honest without being melodramatic. I could really feel Frank’s desperation to make a better life for himself and his family, and I couldn’t imagine growing up like he did. This book shows humanity at its best and its worst. Frank's story has a lot of causal violence, but it also proves how kind people can be. One of my favorite scenes is when Frank steals a bag of oranges from a store. The store owner know that Frank and his siblings are starving, so instead of calling the police, the store owner gives the kids a second bag of fruit.I don’t know very much about depression/WWII era Ireland, so the political and cultural aspects of this memoir are interesting to me. The book is a firsthand account of the conflicts between the Protestants and the Catholics and the English and Irish. Being an Irish Catholic is a huge part of Frank’s identity. I liked reading about someone whose life, experiences, and beliefs are so different from mine. I enjoyed this book overall, but I have to admit that I was bored for a lot of it. I think the plot is slow, flat, and repetitive. Every time Frank starts to get ahead in life, something tragic happens that knocks him back down. This does help the reader feel Frank’s frustration, but the cycle becomes boring and predictable after a few hundred pages.If you can get past the repetition, I highly recommend this book. It provides an in-depth look at extreme poverty and makes you grateful for everything you have.

I pass by this book exchange at least 2-3 times a week in the hope that I’ll spot a gem I haven’t already read. I recognized both the title and the author’s name immediately—and grabbed it. “Fortunately,” however, is entirely accurate. Why? Because I can say with confidence that 
Angela’s Ashes

Angela’s Ashes
 is the book for you! The prose in this book moves fast. Very fast. But I suspect that almost involuntary speed-of-read has more to do with the writer’s talent than with the brogue. It takes talent to make a reader’s eye move quickly across the page, and Frank McCourt has that talent. In spades.But he also has something else, which I’ll call a perfect pitch and feel for tragicomedy. There are passages in this book — great mountains of them — that are painful to read. There are also passages — most of them dialogue — that will make you laugh like Satan. None of them, mind you, of the knee-slapping variety, but rather of the frenzied-at-midnight, demonically celebratory variety. I dunno. Perhaps it’s just the brogue. Or Ireland. Or the Irish — surely God’s chosen wretches if there ever were such a “Chosen People.”If I have any criticism of 
Angela’s Ashes

It made it very difficult to read knowing that five different people could speak in one paragraph and you had to somehow guess who was saying what. But the punctuation (bad as it was) was not the downfall of the book, the content proved to be that. I kept reading hoping for something redeeming about the story. That hope proved fruitless.The first indication I would hate the book was when the author describes, in detail, the sexual position his parents were using when he was conceived. By the way, that position is standing against a wall in a bar because the moment could not be delayed for a better time and place. The book had some deeper moments, but the way those moments were presented made it hard to have the right emotions. For instance, at times the book was quite a page turner, and sadly, for all the wrong reasons. I found myself reading on to see which of the author's siblings would die next. What a horrible place to take your mind – thinking about real children that really lived and wondering when one will get it over with and die to make the book more interesting. The book's ending is what really upset me. I was looking for something to make everything else make sense. I was looking for the boy that had lived the previous 350 pages to come out a man that would learn from those mistakes of others. A man who knew where he came from and would rise above it.

Angela's Ashes was an incredibly bleak memoir of the author growing up in NYC and Ireland during the Great Depression. He lived in horrific poverty alongside an alcoholic father who constantly squandered the family's wages on booze. I watched some of the film but they make the dad seem more sympathetic than the way he's described in the book. He's played by Robert Carlyle but I will eternally see him as Rumple from OUAT.

Angela's ashes can represent a number of things, but I think it’s possible that they represent, above all, poverty; that as long as Frank stayed in Limerick as a messenger boy, he would become more and more closely tied to the ashes himself until he, too, would spend his adulthood by the fire, reminiscing about his wasted potential and dreaming of a better future that never materializes. As much as this is Frank’s story, it’s also his mother’s – she helped him survive, she supported him, she watched over him, wanted the best for him, and had a past of her own that was subtly entwined with his. Her ashes are the same ones that could have haunted Frank, had he followed the same course as his mother or father.Take a look at this stellar advice from the author:Everybody says, ""Follow your dream."" Or Joseph Campbell would say, ""Follow your bliss."" You have to. If it’s deep enough and authentic and profound and genuine, that’s where you have to go. If you want to put on the collar of a clergyman, go and put it on. If you want to be a barefooted monk in the Himalayas, that’s what you have to do. If you want to be a housewife, that’s what you have to do, because nature — I know. I found out eventually why I was put on this earth. I was put on this earth to write.

It tells the story of one of the most impoverished and deprived childhoods I have ever read about, and I have read a lot of depression era books. The poor in Ireland suffered greatly during the depression years, and also in times prior, and the author's family suffered more than most due to his father's alcoholism. Many people have found this story very depressing, and I recall an acquaintance asking ""Why would you want to read about that?"", but I really didn't find it that way. The author writes about his childhood and his family's suffering with humor, although it is often a dry and subtle humor that I think many misinterpret. I am impressed by his ability to see the positive in people who could easily be depicted in a very negative light. We see the many good times he had with his father, who really did love his children, but who suffered from alcoholism and frequently drank all his wages or social assistance money and left his family with no food or heat. Having said that, I frequently found myself wanting to leap through the pages and knock some sense into his father, and also into his mother, who I feel could have done a lot more to ease her family's suffering. This book gives us a fascinating glimpse into Irish culture, especially the long held grudges against the English, and Northern Ireland, and the strong hold of the Catholic church over the people, which only adds to the poverty and oppression.

McCourt tells us at the beginning of the book, ""Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood"".The story starts in New York, where Frank was born, along with a sister and three brothers. His father is an alcoholic, which means that he drinks what little money the family does have. It's also the middle of the depression and Frank's mother Angela struggles just to find enough food for the kids to eat. They decide that there might be more work in Ireland, so the whole family moves back to Limerick, where the rest of the story takes place. Their luck doesn't change by going to Ireland. In fact, it gets much worse. Throughout the book, just when you think that nothing else can go wrong for Frank and his brothers, something else terrible seems to happen to them.What makes the book especially poignant is that it's told entirely through the eyes of the child that McCourt was. So what you get is a description of extreme poverty and oppression, as explained to you by a child who lived through it. Frank never stops to wonder why those around him suffer; he's too busy living the life that he describes.

Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood.""The whole book is written from the perspective of a child--a mode of storytelling McCourt stumbled upon (or that stumbled upon him) when he heard his four-year-old granddaughter speaking in the simple, present tense. As a result, moments that could be brutal are often tender, and there are enough laugh-out-loud scenes--especially related to priests, the Church, drinking, and sex--to make the book read quickly. There are so many themes in here because it is the portrait of a complex upbringing rendered simply and honestly. For me, one of the major themes was innocence and the loss of innocence, and how, as children, we inevitably come upon moments when all the adults in our lives disappoint us. This memoir's reputation is richly deserved. It is a masterpiece of both craft and storytelling, with an Irish flair.

So I had the music of his voice with me as I read. But the music is also in the writing.I've often seen literary agents write that to be published, a memoir has to have a strong voice and a really unique story. McCourt wins on both accounts. Reading this book is exactly like having someone sitting opposite you, telling his story; the writing rambles on, without punctuated dialogue, and yet it's as clear as a bell.And what a story. Brutal, poignant, touching and funny. There are two points in the story which always, on audio or on the page, reduce me to tears, and both involve a priest. The memoir is steeped in Irish Catholic faith and superstition, seen from the distance of years with fond, mocking eyes.

It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood.”So begins the luminous memoir of Frank McCourt, born in Depression-era Brooklyn to recent Irish immigrants and raised in the slums of Limerick, Ireland. Frank’s mother, Angela, has no money to feed the children since Frank’s father, Malachy, rarely works, and when he does he drinks his wages. Yet Malachy — exasperating, irresponsible, and beguiling — does nurture in Frank an appetite for the one thing he can provide: a story. Frank lives for his father’s tales of Cuchulain, who saved Ireland, and of the Angel on the Seventh Step, who brings his mother babies.Perhaps it is story that accounts for Frank’s survival. Wearing rags for diapers, begging a pig’s head for Christmas dinner and gathering coal from the roadside to light a fire, Frank endures poverty, near-starvation and the casual cruelty of relatives and neighbors—yet lives to tell his tale with eloquence, exuberance, and remarkable forgiveness.""

Angela Ashes is usually shelved under Memoir, and it could be right approach too as this based upon the life of Author.

Poverty of this boy's life take him through numerous phases of his life's where he saw his brother and sister dying in front of his eyes, where he saw his father in drunken state while they were starving to death, where he lives at worst uninhabitable houses, and where he saw her to wandering door to door for feeding her small children. During the last pages of this book , this boy beat all odds of his life and made it to America which was he was dreaming throughout his life.The existence of lots of such memoir can't be ruled out as that decade [1925 -1935]was tough period for most the countries as they all were suffering from invasion of Germans and most of population were under miserable states.",2,-0.9764,0.161,0.786,0.053,0.5661654135338346,NEGATIVE,0.9819

The beginning of the book is painful due to Franks early life (3-10 yrs old) but you get to experience the good times amongst the bad and that's what I enjoyed while reading the book. Franks father had me wanting to jump through the pages as some of his behavior really got under my skin but at the same time glimpses of his more intelligent side resonate at awkward times.
