0,5262878,08/28/2007,4.0,"That I can remember, I've never before disliked the start of a book so thoroughly, and by the end, gone on to think so much of it as a complete work.The last 2/3 of this novel are as good as contemporary fiction gets. The first 1/3 is like reading a Jane Austen plot trapped in amber.As the title indicates Atonement is about a future artist's massive effort to redeem herself for ruining the character of a young man when she is a younger girl. There are parts of this novel that are disjointed - or if they aren't they appear so because the opening act moves so slowly that one is barely conscious and later unable to recall that anything much happened at all.Halfway through this novel, when its greatness starts to happen, a reader almost laments his earlier opinions of it. But whose fault is that? The beginning is such an act of endurance that the later parts make a reader wish that McEwan had moved things more quickly in the beginning - and used those words for more character development in the middle - so the reader could declare this novel, unequivocally, one of the five best novels he's ever read.McEwan is at the top of the art form throughout, though, whatever a reader opines of the product. He knows what he's doing every step of the way, right down to an allusion to the disjointed narrative methods employed by Virginia Woolf.The ending is brilliant, unexpected and harsh. But unlike the case of the returning Baxter character in the third act of Saturday, this ending is consistent and at once surprising and inevitable.After a person has read a few hundred novels, he grasps the art form well enough to know when an author is writing - usually it's when the author's employing some top-heavy descriptive technique that makes the water droplets gathered on a rose petal somehow more important than the protagonist's motives for anything she's done to that point - and it fairly well cries out, ""Look at me, my creator is a writer!""Knowing when an author is writing means knowing that if there's a surprise coming, it's either going to be predicted about 50 pages out or done in such fantastically poor form that its inconsistency mars the rest of the work.McEwan is fine enough at his craft that the ending is both unanticipated and perfectly consistent.

3,461664145,11/22/2012,4.0,"Atonement, Ian McEwanAtonement is a 2001 British metafiction novel written by Ian McEwan concerning the understanding of and responding to the need for personal atonement. Set in three time periods, 1935 England, Second World War England and France, and present-day England, it covers an upper-class girl's half-innocent mistake that ruins lives, her adulthood in the shadow of that mistake, and a reflection on the nature of writing.Abstract: On a summer day in 1935, thirteen-year-old Briony Tallis witnesses a moment's flirtation between her older sister, Cecilia, and Robbie Turner, the son of a servant. But Briony's incomplete grasp of adult motives and her precocious imagination bring about a crime that will change all their lives, a crime whose repercussions ""Atonement"" follows through the chaos and carnage of World War II and into the close of the twentieth century.Characters: Briony Tallis, Emily Tallis, Cecilia Tallis, Leon Tallis, Lola Quincy, Jackson Quincy, Perriot Quincy, Paul Marshall, Robbie Turner.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز سی و یکم ماه مارس سال 2012میلادیعنوان: «تاوان»؛ اثر: ایان مک اوان؛ مترجم: م‍ص‍طف‍ی‌ م‍ف‍ی‍دی‌؛ نشر تهران، گام نو‫، 1389، در 480ص؛ شابک 9789646917446؛ ‏چاپ دیگر: تهران، نیلوفر؛ 1390، در 437ص؛ شابک 9789644485213؛ موضوع: داستان‌های نویسندگان بریتانیا - سده 20مرویدادهای «تاوان»، در سال‌های پس از جنگ جهانی دوم سپری، و در این میان به یادمانهای سال‌های جنگ نیز می‌پردازد؛ فيلمنامه «تاوان» را «کریستوفر همپتون»، از همین رمان به قلم «ايان مک اوان»، اقتباس کرده، رمانی که در سال 2001میلادی منتشر شد، و پس از قرار گرفتن در لیست پرفروشترینهای آن روز، به منزلت «مک اوان» افزود، و وی را در کنار «مارتین امیس» و «جولین بارنز»، به عنوان یکی از سه رمان نویس برتر، و زنده ی اهل «بریتانیا»، به خوانشگران شناساندداستان دارای سه بخش است؛ بخش نخست بلندترین بخش داستان است، این بخش خانواده ی اشرافی «تالیس» را، در سال 1935میلادی نشانه رفته؛ توسط «براینی»، دختر سیزده ساله ی خانواده، که عاشق نویسندگی است، بازگویی میشود؛ این خانواده در انتظار رسیدن پسر خانواده یعنی «لئون»، و دوست او «مارشال» هستند؛ «براینی» برای پیشواز از برادرش، میخواهد نمایشنامه ای که خود آن را نگاشته، به همراه پسرعموها و دخترعموها اجرا کنند؛ او برای علاقه به داستان همگی رویدادهای پیرامون خود را با توجه به خیال خویش بازگو میکندبخش دوم، در سال 1940میلادی، «رابی» با شهادت «براینی»، پس از سه سال، از زندان به شرط شرکت در جنگ، آزاد شده است؛ «سیسیلیا» دوره ی پرستاری را بگذرانده، و با خانواده خود رابطه ی خود را بریده است، این دو از راه نامه با یکدیگر در تماس هستند و «سیسیلیا» به «رابی» قول داده، در انتظار او بماند؛ در یایان این بخش «رابی» به همراه ارتش در «دانکرک» گرفتار شده، و دلمشغول عقب نشینی هستندبخش سوم داستان، «براینی» در حال گذراندن دوره پرستاری، در بیمارستانی در «لندن» است؛ او حالا دریافته که «رابی» به دخترعمویش تجاوز کرده، و برای شهادت اشتباه خود، دچار عذاب وجدان شده است؛ از این روی تحصیل در دانشگاه را رها، و به تاوان اشتباهش پرستار شده؛ او در انتهای این بخش «رابی» و «سیسیلیا» را میبیند، که کنار یکدیگر زندگی میکنند، و به آنها قول میدهد که به جبران اشتباهی که مرتکب شده، به نزد خانواده برود، و شهادت خود را پس بگیرد؛ اما در پایان، داستان به گونه دیگری پیش میرود، و خوانشگر را شگفت زده میکندتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 15/07/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 04/06/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی",227,-0.969,0.049,0.942,0.009,0.1888888888888888,POSITIVE,0.9979
4,911157616,04/15/2014,5.0,"The subject matter of Atonement is literature itself, but it is much more. First, the writer is one of its characters; second, because Ian McEwan’s novel creates a world where subjectivity and objectivity interfere mutually. The characters are full of life and the language, even if elaborate and subtle, does not go around or makes inroads into itself.The narrator and protagonist, Briony Tallis, emerges in the beginner as a pre-adolescent that dreams to arrange the world in her texts, as in the play she is writing. Her love for order, for the careful design according to her spoiled desires, is translated into an impulse to write that hardly depend on the theme. 

“There did not have to be a moral. She need only show separate minds, as alive as her own, struggling with the idea that other minds were equally alive. It wasn't only wickedness and scheming that made people unhappy, it was confusion and misunderstanding, above all, it was the failure to grasp the simple truth that other people are as real as you. And only in a story could you enter these different minds and show how they had an equal value. That was the only moral a story need have.”

Her cousins, Lola, and the twins will be the actors, with which she plans to awe the assembled family, that include her parents, her older sister Cecily and the son of the housekeeper, Robbie. On that day of 1935, Briony sees Cecily and Robbie in a game that culminates in a fateful scene. Briony believes she sees something that profoundly perturbs her. The development of the story doesn’t let the reader stop. When, later, Lola is raped by a man that was not seen, Briony, without any grounds, makes a ‘deduction’ of who committed the crime.Here we are, therefore, in the territory of Jane Austen, cited in the epigraph, or Henry James, George Eliot, and many other English authors: social tension versus sexual stress, pride and prejudice conflicts, mere misunderstandings that adopt dramatic dimensions. McEwan considers the simple distortions that physical acts, such as vision, can suffer when clouded by moral bias. Briony is attracted to Robbie and envies in Cecily her independence and, and in her anxiety to wipe out her shortcomings recreates the world in her own way, succumbing to prejudice and threatening her already reduced capacity to accept reality.But, more than that, what McEwan shows is how a writer can worsen weaknesses such as vanity, cowardice and credulity, sentiments that derive from the solitary and fallible condition that is above all human. Briony, with an absent father, a sick mother, a distant brother and an adult sister, fills her solitude with words that want to arrange everything, as she organizes her room. 

“But hidden drawers, lockable diaries and cryptographic systems could not conceal from Briony the simple truth: she had no secrets. Her wish for a harmonious, organised world denied her the reckless possibilities of wrongdoing. Mayhem and destruction were too chaotic for her tastes, and she did not have it in her to be cruel. Her effective status as an only child, as well as the relative isolation of the Tallis house, kept her, at least during the long summer holidays, from girlish intrigues with friends. Nothing in her life was sufficiently interesting or shameful to merit hiding; no one knew about the squirrel's skull beneath her bed, but no one wanted to know.”

She is emotionally deprived as all of us, but a few degrees above the Richer scale: her need to be praised, her inability to deal with her environment, her surrendering to a fantasy of perfection – it is as if she were an immature child, seeking protection from life itself. However, the novel goes beyond an intimate recounting. In the second half, McEwan throws the reader into the Second World War, with memorable descriptions of the United Kingdom’s empire ultimate whisper at the battle of Dunkirk. McEwan uses this as background to show us Robbie’s feelings. Among dead and wounded, he drifts with his head down and wrapped in his own sentiments to protect himself and to dream he will be exonerated for having survived in a battle where so many had died.

 “Now he reduced his progress to the rhythm of his boots -- he walked across the land until he came to the sea. Everything that impeded him had to be outweighed, even if only by a fraction, by all that drove him on. ...He knew by heart certain passages from her letters, he had revisited their tussle with the vase by the fountain, he remembered the warmth from her arm at the dinner when the twins went missing. These memories sustained him, but not so easily.”

 But what rots and sustains him is his hate for Briony:

“In that shrinking moment he discovered that he had never hated anyone until now. It was a feeling as pure as love, but dispassionate and icily rational.”

Above everything:

“Let his name be cleared and everyone else adjust their thinking. He had put in time, now they must do the work. His business was simple. Find Cecilia and love her, marry her and live without shame.”

The ability of McEwan is very well known, but in Atonement he arrived were he had not reached before and where few living authors – maybe Coetzee, Philip Roth and a few others – were able to arrive. The force of his narrative comes from its plot and its magnitude as well as from its richness and structure. The story is strong, but who narrates is not subservient to its hierarchy and its rhythm: it’s a subject that lets it flow and, at the same time, chooses the moments and the way to reveal its parts. McEwan does not need to resort to fragmentation and mysticism to deal with the battle between affection and speech, tolerance and freedom, a clash so in evidence nowadays.____",163,0.926,0.135,0.715,0.15,0.4785543608124254,POSITIVE,0.8777

The cost of oblivious daydreaming was always this moment of return, the realignment with what had been before and now seemed a little worse.
In the heat of a 1930s Summer, a family reunites at their country home for what may be the last time. Cousins have come to stay, a sister has returned from University and a brother is returning from America with a new friend in tow. Briony, the only child left at home, is furiously writing a play to be performed, but what she witnesses-and is exposed to-will force her to make a decision that she will regret for the rest of her life.This book reminded me strongly of Evelyn Waugh, though I think that's purely based on the surroundings and era (and mostly the house). Whilst Evelyn had a whimsical style to his writing, Ian McEwan is positively overflowing with flowery prose that leads nowhere and brings up memories of terrible books they made me read for college.Atonement is a relatively easy read, if you can take so much description and little plot. None of the characters are anything except a piece of personality and don't go beyond their one trait and I felt nothing for all of them. They all had their one job and, whilst they did this one job well, that was that and there seemed nothing beyond their doing their one job.We begin in a wonderful countryside house, which is described to death and the plot simmers along nicely. There's a play being written, and the cousins coming down from the North are being forced to act it out. There is youthful petulance, coming-of-age rebellion and adults avoiding responsibility and, in truth, the scene is set nicely in the first few pages. But then this setting of the scene continues for around half the rest of the book and it soon becomes clear that the plot is far away and we're not entirely sure if it'll be seen at all.Setting the book during the war seemed like a pointless endeavour, if only to include some kind of treacherous battle scenes to add to the overall lack of drama up to this point. I suppose the book needed to be set somewhere and some time, but the overall affect was unimpressive. I found the whole thing lacking, in truth. The book, whilst it shifted to another city and even country, was just too small. Everything was cloying and felt like it was happening in one tiny bubble. I prefer big worlds and big plots, not just a single thread moving through a mire.The main thing that irritated me about this book, is that it was full of needless cliffhangers that were seemingly pointless to anything except to expunge the pathetic attempt at a plot beyond the story arc. Nearly every chapter ended with something along the lines of ""and oh my if this character hadn't done what he's about to do in the next chapter then his life would not have turned out the way it did"", as if McEwan is unsure of his plot and needs to plead with us to keep reading. ""What, what Ian, what's going to happen? I must must must read on if you say something interesting is coming along, because so far we haven't had much, have we, Sir?""I am grateful, however, at the vague pleasure I got from the book as I read it that kindled within me a notion of the kinds of books I do and do not like. I feel, having read this book, that I could spot a book I dislike from the first few pages now, whereas before I'd probably have to get through it all just to know. So, of course, I will now not be wasting more hours on books that seemingly go nowhere, even after the first half, than I need to.",160,0.8827,0.085,0.814,0.101,0.4800999412110523,NEGATIVE,0.9976
6,1582508101,03/17/2016,4.0,"A lesson to us all: never put anything in print that one day might come back to bite you in the ass.Having already seen the movie, I didn't particularly want to read the book (I've never read Mario Puzo's The Godfather, now have I?), but seeing as this book is a modern great, I felt it my duty to drag it from my book cave.Pleasingly, McEwan writes with aplomb about the human psyche: of lust, loathing, immaturity and guilt; his prose is word perfect.That said, the novel suffers from its own identity crisis, a mezze of Jane Austen, followed by a main course of Sebastian Faulks.The author's genius, though, is in causing us to forget that his book was actually written in the modern day. Very clever!One of our protagonists, Robbie, puts his lustful thoughts to paper in a way that would merely seem vulgarly juvenile in a modern-day text message: Been dreamin' bout kissing your c**t, yeah?But when inscribed in ink, onto 1930s vellum stationery, the ""C"" word is both shocking and ruinous.

7,11721739,01/05/2008,2.0,"I feel that perhaps I have sabotaged this book somewhat as I read it directly after finishing Love In the Time of Cholera, and perhaps in retrospect should have read a poetry book or some non-fiction in between. Clearly anything I would have read after finishing a Masterpiece would pale in comparison but I decided that the critical raves this book had received and high praise from people around me should be enough to encourage me to see it through to the end.Here is why I found this book lacking without giving too much actual plot away to those who would want to read it themselves.I found all of the characters completely devoid of any true personality or any reason I should care or feel connected to them. The details described in the book do a lot for physical surroundings but we know nothing of Cecila except she went to college and chain smokes, so I don't particularly care about anything that happens to her, besides the fact that much of her life is lived outside what information the book provides. Briony is a terrible child, a narcissistic teenager, and and at last a harmless grandmother who I don't especially care about at any of these three points in her life. The only character with the least bit of humanity seems to be Robbie who is still somewhat confined to his role as the ""victim"". All the lovely descriptions of ponds and hospital wards and French war-torn villages could not make up for the fact that none of these characters were the slightest bit interesting to me or seemed to connect to anything. They simply floated through long locational descriptions being powerless to the world around them and unfortunately for me I didn't need 350 pages to get that point. It could have easily been accomplished as a short story or novella. I just kept feeling that the book had all this great detail but didn't focus it on anything that it shoud have. I know this may sound exceedingly harsh and once again I do chalk some of this up to reading Atonement directly after a much better novel it had no hope in eclipsing or even paralleling in its structure but I also know how quickly and easily I fall in love with characters. How quickly I can get pulled into a good story and I sincerely feel that although I wouldn't call this book a complete waste, that my time would have been much better spent elsewhere.",115,0.9968,0.057,0.75,0.193,0.4760000000000001,NEGATIVE,1.0
8,11335656,12/31/2007,3.0,"This is where a 2.5 star rating would be ideal. I am extremely ambivalent about this novel--first the pluses: the writing is gorgeous; McEwan has some of the best prose out there. Every line has meat to it, nothing is throwaway, and every visual is so vivid that the reader is transported to a specific time and place. Secondly, (what everyone praises the novel for), the commentary McEwan is making about the novel itself--the fact that it is written, that characters and plots are manipulated by the author, and how a real character emerges (eventually) while at the same a written story exists too. This is very difficult to write about without revealing anything about the plot, but as one reads the novel, it becomes clear what McEwan is trying to do. Finally, the references to other literature (including some of the best novels--Clarissa, Lolita--and novelists--Elizabeth Bowen is directly mentioned, Henry Green and Virginia Woolf are obvious influences) is fluid, never forced, and is done to showcase a love of literature. At the same time, there are downsides to McEwan's endeavor--how to write a novel that is commenting on its obvious falsity (its construction as fiction), while at the same time trying to convey reality. This is perhaps an impossible task, and I'm left with the nagging feeling that the novel wants to have its cake and eat it too. The characters and situations are so obviously phony that it becomes distracting in the first part of the story. I was drawn in by the fantastic writing, but then found myself wanting to hurl the novel across the room at some of the ridiculous choices by both the characters and the novelist. Namely: 1) The main plot twist makes little realistic sense. Absolutely zero would fly in a mystery novel let alone real life; 2) The characters in the first part are boring aristocrats who we don't care about (check out a Henry Green novel; except in his novels, the reader continues to laugh at them, there is no attempt at emotional attachment); 3) The 'mystery's' solution is obvious to the reader before the crime even happens; 4) Briony (part 1) is an insufferable narrator (as kid narrators, To Kill a Mockingbird excluded, so often are); 5) The novelist's choice to name a sexually, precocious teenager 'Lola' (too obvious a reference). But these choices are meant to be ridiculous--reality is only supposed to set in in the epilogue. At the same time, I marveled at how real parts 2 (Robbie at war) and 3 (Briony as a nurse--some of the hospital scenes are the best I've ever read) seemed to be. Then the question became for me--if they seemed real because of the way the scenes were written (the gore again in the hospital), but could not have been real because the characters and overall plot of the Tallis family are so fake, isn't that cheating? I haven't reached a conclusion yet, but something is still bugging me about the conception of it. Ultimately I prefer novels that go the opposite route--Paul Auster's Oracle Night for example--that start out real and quickly become fake, or throw out the idea of a realistic, consistent plot entirely (only in the conclusion does David Mitchell's Cloud Atlas come together), rather than the never-ending 'is it real? is it fake?' push-and-pull of Atonement.

10,3738646981,01/03/2021,5.0,"Wow! I will embarrassedly share a personal secret. Actually it’s not personal! It’s about the actress and the bloody intense movie adaptation of this book. I am a big fan of charming Scottish Mr. McAvoy (In my opinion not Idi Amin but he’s the real king of Scotland!) so after watching so young but intimidating Saoirse Ronan as thirteen years old Briony Tallis and witnessed how she ruined her own sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley ) and Robbie ( played by magnificent McAvoy) the son of the servant, I started detesting the guts of that actress with every bone in my body! After years I kept booing her at the theaters as soon as her frozen blue eyes appeared on the screen and I got kicked out from theaters! ( being thrown away like a garbage didn’t hurt my feelings but not watching the entire Lady Bird and Little Women adaptation of Greta Gerwig truly ached my heart! ) Good things about this predicament: Even she was 13, Saoirse freaking Ronan was brilliant actress and the story of the book is heart wrenching, extra powerful and remarkable! It definitely broke my heart into tiny little pieces.  I skipped to read it for years because I knew deep in my heart the story would hurt me more when I got aged and just a little turned into a wiser woman. But here I am, pulling out the band-aid! I got truly lost my mind in this remarkable journey which sets in three different time periods: 1935 England , during the time of Second World War between England and France and present England!  We’re introduced to thirteen year old Briony who witnesses her sister Cecilia and servant’s boy Robin’s flirtation which make her intrigued and jealous as well. Her reading wrongly of the actions and her misjudgment bring out a crime and ruins people’s lives! I know she was just a young, naive, innocent girl but she paid throughout her life because one mistake she’s made! That was the worst punishment to keep thinking about everything you’ve made differently through your entire life and putting this burden to young kid’s shoulder was a little cruel choice but that’s what makes the reading journey more angsty, emotional and effective!  I’m so happy to read the book and I’m so happy to make peace with Briony’s character as well! And I’m so relieved that I’m not gonna need to curse Saoirse Ronan when I see her face at the big screen!

11,15552796,02/16/2008,5.0,"Having recently seen and loved the magnificent film adaptation, I decided to reread Atonement, which quite impressed me when it was first published. And guess what? It was an even more rewarding experience the second time around. Knowing what was coming -- knowing the plot twist at the end -- helped me focus on the quality of the writing rather than on the development of the story, and as always, McEwan's prose completely sucked me in. He is, quite simply, one of the most talented authors alive, and he uses his gift to great effect here.I'm not really going to go into the plot here, because the less the first-time reader knows about the book, the better. Suffice it to say that it is about an imaginative thirteen-year-old who witnesses a few things she doesn't understand, draws the wrong conclusions and ends up ruining the lives of two people near and dear to her. The first half of the book deals with the event itself and the hours leading up to it; the second half deals with her attempts to, well, deal with it -- atone for it, so to speak. As always, McEwan excels at setting the scene. His description of a hot summer afternoon in a 1935 English country house is lush and sumptuous, his evocation of a young soldier's struggle to reach home after the disastrous 1940 battle of Dunkirk is haunting, and his look into the horrors of a war-time London hospital is gruesome in all its detail. Amazingly, McEwan manages to find beauty even in the most horrific scenes, which is one of the things which set him apart as a writer. As usual, though, it's the psychological stuff that is really outstanding. McEwan has a knack for taking his readers deep into his characters' minds, letting them share their most intimate, most uncomfortable thoughts and feelings. Sometimes these thoughts are a little disturbing (those of you who have read his earlier works will know what I mean), but usually they have the effect of completely drawing the reader into the story. The latter is definitely the case in Atonement. By presenting the story from different perspectives and vantage points, McEwan provides the reader with a complete and engrossing view of a life-changing event and its aftermath. All the different perspectives ring true, and together they tell a marvellous tale of perception, loyalty, anger, secrets, lost love, shame, guilt, obsession with the past and -- yes -- atonement. And about writing, for more than anything else, Atonement is about the difference between fiction and reality, the power of the imagination and the human urge to write and rewrite history -- to write destiny and play God.I've heard quite a few people say that they found the first half of the novel too slow and ponderous, wondering why McEwan felt the need to devote nearly two hundred pages to the events of a single day. Personally, I found that part of the book to be utterly brilliant in its rich, Woolf-like glory. As far as I'm concerned, the atmosphere of the first half is superbly drawn, with each character down to the most minor one being well realised and the tensions and suspense at work almost being made tangible. For me, it is the second half of the book which has problems (albeit minor ones), in that I found the jumps in time and perspective jarring and the (otherwise fascinating) chapter about Robbie's adventures in France somewhat unreal. Of course, there are good reasons for the slightly unreal quality of the Dunkirk chapter (which the film captured just brilliantly), but still, it didn't quite work for me; it felt a bit out of place. Thankfully, though, the rest of the book worked just wonderfully for me. Like other McEwan books, it left me with a haunting question -- 'What if...?'As for McEwan's impressive insight into the mind of a thirteen-year-old girl, which other reviewers have called scary, I think that has everything to do with Briony's being a writer. She is hardly your average thirteen-year-old (I think even McEwan would have a hard time coming up with one of those!); rather she is a writer (a good one), and that, of course, is something McEwan knows all about. As a fellow writer, I greatly enjoyed seeing the world through Briony's eyes, and hope her author will live to her old age and write as many good books as he has her doing.",95,0.9968,0.067,0.789,0.145,0.4939403142209265,POSITIVE,1.0

One hot summer afternoon, when cousins and a friend of her older brother Leon's are visiting, a strange series of events will change Briony's life. She will witness a mysterious scene between her older sister Cecilia and their housekeeper's son, Robbie; her thirteen years old eyes will interpret their interaction and the following events very differently from what actually happened and by the end of that day, nothing will ever be the same… From there on, we follow Robbie and Cecilia's story, as they deal with the consequences of Briony's not-so-innocent mistake, and with the young girl's long and excruciating journey for forgiveness.I am late on the band-wagon, as usual, and this is my first McEwan novel. And now I am kicking myself for not having checked this book out sooner. His prose is lush with gorgeous images and sensations - I found myself reading slower than usual to make the pleasure last a little bit longer. The characterization is amazing, as we get under every character's skin, explore their thoughts, what haunts and motivates them - and it is captivating! McEwan's mastery of language blew me away, as did his use of symbolism and clever narrative structure. A story about a mistake in judgement could never be told from a single point of view, it has to be explored from many angles, and he handled that with incredible skill.What Briony does is a thoughtless act motivated by a whirlwind of immature feelings: jealousy, a need for attention, wanting to be taken seriously and feel ""worldly"", the budding fascination (and paradoxical repulsion) with sexuality that every young girl experiences... I've read many reviews that mention how much they hated her and how petty and selfish she was; have these readers ever met thirteen year old girls?! They are generally insufferable precisely because they are at that horribly awkward stage of growing up. Being a little girl doesn't work anymore, but no one treats them like adults either, so they are unpredictable and they act out. I am by no means excusing Briony's spiteful reaction; as the title of the book implies, she will spend the rest of her life paying for her mistake it in guilt and regret. What I am saying is how realistic I think she is; I didn't like her one bit, but I believed in her completely.I am not a big love story fan, because I think most people can't write them up in any kind of honest and realistic way. Most people write about love-at-first sight or obsessive lust and neither of these things are love the way real people experience it, so I avoid books labeled as romances like the plague. I can count on the fingers of one hand the love stories I actually felt invested in, and Robbie and Cecilia's story is one of them. This is impressive given the fact that they are each other's first and only love, something I am usually very skeptical of. I was very moved by their devotion and how they give each other a reason to carry on in some of history's darkest days. I read the second half of this book with a lump in my throat, wondering what was wrong with me. In the end, I realized that nothing is wrong with me: McEwan is just fucking brilliant.Cecilia is spoiled, but she turns out to have more character and inner strength than the rest of her family put together. Her faith in Robbie and her unwavering loyalty to him made her one of the greatest romantic heroines I've encountered in literature. As for Robbie, I couldn't help but admire his pride, his resilience and his fair-mindedness. For someone with such a bright and promising future to be disgraced and ruined the way he is would be tragic in and of itself, but the dignity with which he keeps moving and never gives up on his ultimate goal (to ""live without shame"": what a line!) made me root for him with my whole heart.The ending made a lot of people angry, apparently, but I loved it. It made the heartbreaking parts of the story even more crushing and while we see that Briony can never really make peace with herself, she gave peace back to those she hurt the only way she could figure out how. I found that incredibly moving. Writing is a form of therapy to many writers: it's a way to talk about the things that linger on your mind without really talking about them exorcise demons, right wrongs and create a better world. This novel made me want to start writing again.This was a wonderful and rewarding read, a rich mix of Austen, Forster, Waugh and Woolf, and I loved every word of it so much more than I could have anticipated. I saw the movie, and while I often can't stand the sight of Keira Knightley, I do think that she was a perfect Cecilia, and that the movie was a flawless adaptation that perfectly captured the tone of McEwan's writing. 5 very bright stars and a spot of my ""favorites"" shelf.",81,0.9767,0.12,0.741,0.139,0.5595240137221268,POSITIVE,0.9995

17,858318341,02/18/2014,4.0,"Atonement is a post-modernist interpretation of historical fiction. How historical fiction is a kind of double fiction, a fiction within a fiction. Not that McEwan’s intellectual mischief detracts from his gift for storytelling. For this is a compelling and moving story and it’s not until the end that we are called upon to question the roots of storytelling. How all the stories we tell require a measure of illusion to sustain them. And how narrative itself is a selective process – brilliantly exposed here when Robbie sends the wrong letter to Cecelia.  The atmospheric ideal drift of life on a country estate replete with overly familial class divisions quotes early/middle 20th century historical fiction themes with a slightly troubling fidelity to clichéd tropes. For a while it’s almost as if McEwan has gone soft in his old age. But it’s as if he is working his way through 20th century British literature in this novel whose subject, beneath the ostensible one of guilt and atonement, is essentially narrative itself. To the clichéd backdrop of the country estate he brings in Virginia Woolf’s floating impressionistic technique of creating biography, Lawrence’s use of the repressed sex instinct as plot crucible and catalyst and Forster’s showdown moment in the Maribor cave when deep seated submerged prejudice and crowd contagion convince everyone of guilt. It’s almost as if McEwan is playfully writing himself into British literary history. The second part is all gritty realism – a high definition account of the brutalities of war. One effect of war is to scramble formerly sustaining narratives. This is what happens to both Robbie and Briony. His experience of blame and hers of guilt change. War provides Briony with the possibility of atonement in the form of self-sacrifice and bullies Robbie into understanding that holding one individual to account for his wretched fate is absurd. Both begin to construct a new narrative, no more true perhaps than the former. Because this is a novel about the enormous power but, at bottom, creative inauthenticity of narrative. We believe in what it is necessary for us to believe. ",66,-0.6166,0.089,0.844,0.067,0.3955584415584416,POSITIVE,0.9935

“The anticipation and dread he felt at seeing her was also a kind of sensual pleasure, and surrounding it, like an embrace, was a general elation--it might hurt, it was horribly inconvenient, no good might come of it, but he had found out for himself what it was to be in love, and it thrilled him.”
It has been a rather turmoiled couple of weeks, and of all reasons other than the second wave of covid, because of this novel. I again took a day off just to recover from the numbness, though every time I glance at the book, which incidentally is right on my lap as I write, I am unsure whether I really overcame it. Where to begin? I think it will be safe to say this is one of the best written novels that I’ve read, which’s written in this century. And the characters…damn. Though it is looked upon by most as of romance-war genre, (or at least Google says so) I think it’s basically a very microscopic study of the inner turmoil of a precocious pseudo-intellectual and rather stupid adolescent. Well, Briony won’t be called precocious in this century, but suffice it to say it’s quite flabbergasting how much her thinking process is developed at a mere thirteen, though we could’ve done with a similarly well-developed conscience, at times she did seem like a smaller yet masculine version of Ronald Weasley, in the ways she showed off her protectiveness for her elder sister. The prime focus is on the storytelling, obviously. Just like the numerous references to the classicists, all the words are like a brilliant fusion of the typical styles of Austen in her sarcastic undertone, Virginia Woolf in her stream of consciousness, Conrad in the delineations of the horrors of the battle-field and hospital beds, whereas the atmospheric built-up is certainly a homage to Thomas Mann (I got confirmed by McEwan’s influences’ list). And quite expectedly, there’s multiple shifts in tonality, though it gets significant in the transition from one Part to another. And herein lies the only flaw of the novel: it’s too flawless for its own good, kind of reminds me how Hemingway told after finishing his The Old Man and the Sea that there ain’t a wasted word. Well, I could’ve done with a couple of wasted words in a novel of this size. Anyway…The interior monologues is another standing point for the novel. However, given that an entire section was devoted to the almost Kafkaesque devastations in Dunkirk and the blood and guts and excrement in the hospital, which is rather splatterpunk too, I feel Cecilia’s character deserved a bit more room, though that thought won’t cross anyone’s mind twice. The coincidences Robbie shared with his Freudian psychology, more than once, are similarly astounding.
A bit from my experience
:(Skip if you feel like it) Just like I had done with Virginia Woolf’s or rather any other novel that’s just as brilliantly written, after reading just a page or two and already been dumbfounded by the fabulous storytelling, I decided that I will read only a bit a day so as to savor the brilliance. That does work most of the times, but after a point, I just gave up and read the remaining 250+ pages within two days. However, a part of me still wishes that I haven’t read the last three pages. Just because… you know. There’s a sort of feeling, like from the very start of a novel you start to apprehend that the blow is about to come. Then you wait for it for ages, all prepared, and it never comes in a hard-hitting way, so you give a big sigh of relief for a not-so-happy-but-not-too-devastating-either-ending to come, but when it comes, you want to just chuck the book away as far as you can. That almost happened with me, I got numb. I couldn’t fully understand what just happened, and when I did…I wish I had the spoilers; you know. I was recommended the movie almost since it ever came out, and I hadn’t watched it, or read anything about, well anything at all, so that I have the exact experience of those who read it when it came out at first (the year I was born, more precisely😊). And I had it. But I actually don’t know if I had wanted it to happen. It’s a genius, no doubt. But these types of books can be better relished if not taken personally.And about the movie-well. I’m glad the green dress stayed. And it’s the only one point where the novel scores less than the movie, despite the performances.

20,58221419,06/02/2009,2.0,"Sometimes when I write these reviews, especially when they're of novels with widespread popularity and critical acclaim, I start to feel like a real curmudgeon. Is there anything really wrong with Ian McEwan's “Atonement?” Is it not a compelling story well told? Is the writing not clear, succinct, and free of pretentiousness? Does McEwan not draw the reader into a well-imagined world and hold him there until the last page? The answer to all these questions is yes. Yet still, yet still...Maybe it's all the acclaim that “Atonement” received when first published and the literary prizes it either won or was shortlisted for, or maybe it's the comparison I'm drawing – unfairly, to be sure – with some of the classic novels I've been reading lately, but I just don't see why McEwan's book has been held up as one of the great works of literary fiction of recent years. (Or maybe everything else from the last several years is that much worse?) My chief problem with “Atonement” is it just never feels fully real, like great novels do. I could never picture Briony, Cecilia, Robbie and the book's other characters existing beyond their words and actions on the page. They never become something more than characters in a novel – never become real living, breathing people, as is the case with truly great works of literature. The whole book just feels far too mannered, too neatly composed, too written.Spoilers to follow here, so skip the next paragraph if you haven't yet read “Atonement” and plan to.Does this maybe speak, though, to McEwan's genius? After all, in his nod to the art of metafiction, McEwan makes the novel not really his novel at all, but rather one written by his character Briony Tallis, so that all but the last section of the book, which is told first-person by Briony, becomes a novel within the novel. A defender of the book who accepts everything I've said up until this point might rightfully argue that the novel-within-the-novel's weaknesses speak to the who the character of Briony actually is, and to her shortcomings as a novelist. If that were McEwan's intention, it's kind of a brilliant move: a good novelist purposely writing in an average way because the character actually telling the story is herself an average novelist. OK, but even if I accept this argument – and even though I made the argument myself, I'm not sure it holds water – I still don't want to read an entire novel that's simply average, even if it's intended to be.Spoilers over.Getting back to my original point, though, why do I feel the urge to demand that every piece of literature – even one well-loved, and with critical regard – need be as brilliant as one by, say, Nabokov? (Though, to be fair, McEwan is asking for this comparison, as Nabokov mastered the metafiction toyed with in “Atonement” back when McEwan was just a wee lad.) Can't some literary novels just be an enjoyable read without achieving a place in the pantheon of great literature? Isn't there, alongside Nabokov and Bellow, a place for writers such as John Irving and Ian McEwan? (And is that too insulting to McEwan? Too flattering to Irving?) And, finally, have I become, as a reader, too much a curmudgeon?",61,0.9972,0.058,0.77,0.172,0.4974279835390946,NEGATIVE,0.9977

She's such an idiot with all her aesthetic way of thinking. Even in her mature age she still is one. For one, she believes that her writing is some sort of atonement. As if anyone would care about her graphomany. As if her magical thinking would have any other effect other than make her believe that she got her atonement by doing something that she believes useful. Good for her. Under all her everything she's still that brat who believes that the world's biggest problem is her play / her atonement / her fantasies / her and not the people whose lives she blew up. And everyone around her is not much brighter. Her so-called precociousness is basically too much free time on her hands. Maybe she should've been, I dunno, studying Math or Chinese to set off some of that fantasy keeping her up doing harm? Or washing dishes? Or helping whoever was cleaning their house? Betty? Or learning domestic economy or whatever it was that women were supposed to learn at that period? I'm totally sure that had her idle time been shortened by at least 50%, there wouldn't have been any grounds for the debacle. She would've been taught to distinguish between fantasy and actual stuff (don't tell me she was too young for it, kids as young as 3-4 can do that perfectly fine!) and that would've at least given her a chance to distinguish between her maniac perceptions and what she actually saw. As it was, she was half-mad with her fantastic thinking and was very far removed from real life. So, considering that I believe that the whole premise is ludicrous and the bunch of these MCs need a shrink and some sensible activities to do, I'm looking at the plot and thinking it's dreadful. I definitely dislike all the other reviewers' arguments about how she was a kid and didn't know what she was doing. Since, what does that really mean? What, every kid now has a free pass to go and destroy some lives? That's why kids don't vote, because they might not know what they are doing. And that's why they need upbringing and education and medical help (incl. psychiatric, if needed). The sex-rape-id-thing. What the hell was everyone thinking? A not-very-stable not-so-little girl accuses a boy of a rape and they just lap it up! How could she have seen his face in the dark?And what was her fragging deal? She was quite old to bother people into playing out her horrible plays? Isn't she then old enough to maybe think a bit in a straight way?! I think Robbie's just not very well-written. It's just as if the author wanted him to be a shade of some general partially randomized boy. You know, to give the general idea of all the wrongfully-accused young men who, well, got into mess not of their own making?Or is that the author just showing us that large chunks of the story are just Briony making all this stuff up as some sort of self-therapy? If so, how very nice for her. Basically, the only really fleshed out character is Briony. The rest read like ghosts: moth-like, we've got names, we've got them doing things but they are transparent. Likely that's the author letting us feel that we are seeing things second-hand with Briony's eyes.The atonement: None for anyone. We don't enter the same river twice: we may only dream about it.One can be sad with Briony not getting her chances but damn, the 1st part was such a stupid plot twist. On the chances:- she didn't get her memo for not making stuff up and subsequently, no chance for actual atonement for her / by her.

Briony felt the disadvantage of being two years younger than the other girl, of having a full two years’ refinement weigh against her, and now her play seemed a miserable, embarrassing thing. …she proceeded to outline the plot, even as its stupidity began to overwhelm her. (c) Well, it was a miserable thing. Who are we kidding? Briony's very egoistic from the start and she seems to be very much in love with her older brother. What's it with McEwan and incest themes? Well, at least this time around the incest is more of a subconscious longing than action plan.Q:She was not playing Arabella because she wrote the play, she was taking the part because no other possibility had crossed her mind, because that was how Leon was to see her, because she was Arabella.

22,467358000,06/15/2021,4.0,"A stunning,  lyrical saga about love, war, guilt, forgiveness, and of course, the uncertainty inherent in our vantage points and hence our perceptions. Briony, a fanciful thirteen-year-old is so consumed with her version of the narrative that she cannot grasp the lasting damage it would cause and the lives it would destroy. A crime is committed by her in the haze of adolescent immaturity, which proves fateful for those who unwittingly get dragged into it. Is redemption possible for this unlikely perpetrator? And what about the adults who unthinkingly condone her actions? Do they have a share in the guilt like they have a share in the deed? And can making amends later – after maturity prods one to examine past decisions – change anything, apart from quelling the unrelenting pangs of remorse? Can one stitch back the broken shell that a person becomes?A person is, among all else, a material thing, easily torn and not easily mended.The first part of the novel traces that ill-fated day in 1935 when Briony's confusion between fantasy and reality changes everything. The tone of the narrative modifies according to the shifts in the points of view – an indulgent, gently humorous flavour for the young, much-loved child Briony which subsequently transforms to bewilderment and self-consoling as her story takes an ominous turn; a dazed, wistful mood for the lovers and finally solemnity and reflection for the events that follow in the second and third parts. Oh, I revelled in the glorious writing and the polished prose which laid bare the inner worlds of the characters. Each sentence is beautifully crafted, almost too perfect, and portrays, in the author's words, ""the crystalline present moment through the onward roll of the conscious mind"". There are trivial drawbacks to this focus on capturing the present, on reproducing all that one thinks, feels, and sees – sometimes descriptions of moss, algae, and migraines usurp the attention reserved for finer emotions but I'm not complaining. I'm in awe of the strikingly beautiful compositions of McEwan and some of the other contemporary English writers that I've had a chance to read: The Line of Beauty by Allan Hollinghurst, On Beauty by Zadie Smith, and The Sense of an Ending by Julian Barnes. My heart is bursting with things to say about this book of rare, timeless beauty but however desperately I try to convey them, I fall short of words. As a feeble excuse for my ineptitude, I wanted to drench your screen with lovely phrases from this very quotable masterpiece but you must have already come across them. I wanted to tell you about the hopelessness of war and even the perspective it bestows on us, of making all concerns seem tiny and forgettable, of reminding us of the importance of love. Instead, I will tell you that a nurse who was tending to the injured in the Second World War described the highs of her work as  ""moments of impersonal tenderness and elated, generalised love"".. Isn't that something to remember? And on a lighter note, an astute observation by the author might make you smile ""Communal singalongs had a faintly coercive quality"". Lastly, in one hell of a twisted Epilogue, McEwan suggests that as a writer, it is essential to impart hope. What good would more bleakness do? There's enough of it around us. I agree.",56,0.991,0.101,0.739,0.16,0.4674528301886793,POSITIVE,0.9999
23,305423837,04/02/2012,4.0,"This was the favourite novel of a friend of mine who died suddenly a few years ago. She loved it so much that she refused to see the film adaptation because, she said, it couldn't possibly be as good as the novel. I, on the other hand, saw the film without having read the book because when the film was released I was still in the won't-read-McEwan stage of my life that lasted from 1988 or 1989 until two or three years ago. Anyway, I quite liked the film, or at least it made an impression on me at the time. Although I've only seen it once, I can still see images: Cecilia's green dress and the beach at Dunkirk particularly come to mind. I also remembered the plot, and therefore its twist. So when I read the novel, there were no suprises. Knowing what was going to happen, I paid attention to see if I could pick up the clues and yes, they were there in the text. Not that I think a reader who didn't know the plot could work it all out just on the basis of the clues, but at least McEwan wasn't cheating. Anyway, while I don't think McEwan is ever going to be my favourite novelist. There's a brittleness to him (or something, I'm not quite sure what it is) that I find unappealing. However, in this novel he poses important questions about love, guilt, redemption, truth and the nature and purpose of fiction. McEwan writes excellent prose and he does the meta-fiction thing extremely well. I doubt I'll be reading this again, but I'm glad that I've read it once.

It does not matter whether it is true or false: in fact, true or false has no say in it, because for each one of us it is entirely subjective. And when the person in question is a writer, sometimes the narrative proves too powerful for herself to control.This is what happens to Briony Tallis.

But I literally just finished the book and I'm so much in awe of it I just can't. It's perfect. It's perfect in every image and line and mirror and echo. Ian McEwan is such a master of language and storycraft.I devoured this book in a day. Less than a day. Ignoring all other work to do so. And it was TOTALLY worth it. I can't think of what to praise first this point, so I'm going to go in random order. I'll start with the language. It's enthralling. It's that that draws you into the story. The story moves rather slowly, really. Half of the book takes place on a single day. But it is the language that makes you not care. The wordchoice is enchanting, just so. Gorgeous imagery interposed with just the right touch of magic to keep it beautifully fresh. He weaves his images throughout the text, having them pop up again and again, subtly. For instance, a pair of boy's pajamas becomes a symbol of war and horror as well as innocence ruined and then vague oppression and doubt renewed throughout the novel. A finger becomes a sense of self and changed identity at various points. It's just gorgeously done.The storycraft is so perfect too. I love how he chooses to do it, switching from perspective to perspective, but always with the center on this delusional little girl, and the echoes of her own storymaking. It is story that screws over them all in the end. But it is story that resurrects them too. I loved his inward musings on writing, and his critique of his own writing within the text. It's a bit of a breaking of the fourth wall that's done with a rather sad irony, but it still brought a smile to my face.I really enjoyed the themes that he explored too. Eventually I'll post some of my favorite quotes to give an idea of the beauty of the language and ideas that he explores as well, but in general... I think my favorite idea that he dealt with was the idea of order as a kind of childishness. As a kind of little, small denial of the world. The entire book shows the folly of order and what it does to our souls and minds. (quotes to come on this). I also loved his treatment of the all consuming nature of guilt. Atonement. Atonement indeed.Amazing. I cannot recommend this enough. ",55,0.9838,0.07,0.805,0.125,0.6004065040650407,POSITIVE,0.9999
26,15268691,02/12/2008,5.0,"There are so many angles and perceptions to consider in this book. Sometimes the end can make a book and that is certainly the case here where the story is left open for interpretation. This is a book that leaves you thinking and considering, making up your own conclusions--and strong enough characters to make you want to.The first few chapters I did find my mind wandering through lengthy descriptions (I'll call it beautiful, poetic scenery), and yet that scenery set a lackadaisical feel vital to the innocence and peace of that opening day. It's not just the easy-going feel of pre-war life McEwan was portraying. On a second read, I find a strain, a desire to understand every motive and action. And in those details I find sadness that life never moved on. It was played over and over again trying to find meaning and purpose to each detail. The slowness is painstaking analysis. There is a reason for the meticulous care with which each detail is described and the read well worth the persistence to the end.Even from the beginning I was intrigued with the story and found the characters compelling. I just loved Briony's capricious character, her innocent yet eloquently advanced mind. I could despise the nosy little sister and sympathize with the fearful inactive girl all in one breath. I could hate Paul's conceit and Lola's pleas for attention and understand the muteness all the same. But mostly I could sympathize and relate to Robbie and Cecilia as likable characters, wanting to add more time to their brief, interrupted interactions. I found myself ever-fearful for the end and therefore could not put the book down.Spoilers in my analysis to death.Despite Briony's foreshadowing (saying she would rewrite the fountain scene from all perspectives), I did not suspect the end. I expected the separation but not the invention of this whole story. Because of the story in a story format, you can interpret the few authentic scenes anyway you like and not take her word for any of it. That is what I love about the story, particularly on a second read, that I can question motives assigned to characters instead of take it for face value. At one point reading Robbie's thoughts I considered the layers: Ewan writing Briony writing Robbie and paused in awe at McEwan's talent. Because of the layers, McEwan has the unique opportunity to add insight and symbolism, even study questions as commentary. Take Briony's comment when relieved to see Robbie at Cecilia's that Robbie's death would have been ""outlandish, against all odds"" and would have made no sense. Or the letter from the editor telling her the story was incomplete: ""how might [her misunderstanding:] affect the lives of the two adults?"" And while vivid her descriptions of light and shade she should create ""light and shade within the narrative itself."" To which you can't help but wonder about light and shade in the story and characters. In what other novel can the author analyze his own work and insert his own cues for study?I was confused at the drastic abbreviation of Robbie's war tour--though I enjoyed considering the shrapnel as a physical expression of his hidden wound. It was so obvious why the section quit there, but I couldn't believe it ended there; I had to hold out hope however thin the thread. I thought Briony's atonement would come as a nurse on duty, and I held my breath waiting for the improbable meeting. Her interaction with the dying French boy showed how much she wanted that redemption from Robbie by consoling and listening to what cannot be fixed. How she longed for closure with him. I doubt Robbie hated Briony. In her self-deprecation her interpretation is harsh. I think exasperation at a nosy child whom you adore but all of a sudden can't approach because her vivid imagination has turned to fear is sufficient emotion. I liked Robbie enough to think he could have forgiven her. If anything he was the one who was understanding and forgiving while Cecilia was ready to throw out her family to show her commitment to Robbie. I think Cecilia and Robbie were on the verge of forgiving Briony, but Briony could not allow herself to believe so without diminishing her guilt. She states ""neither Briony nor the war had destroyed"" their love. Even though she says so about her made-up gift of an ending, can't she see some redemptive power for herself, even in the ""bleakest realism""? I was so confused at the unexpected way the reunion scene between Robbie and Celia. It was so implausible and awkward and I wondered how the story had gotten off course and how Robbie had gotten there from France. His reaction was not anything like I expected, that after everything he had been through, he could still hold that much hate for Briony. And yet that was its intention. On a second read, it's one of my favorite parts as she gives us a glimpse of the verbal rebut she so longed for and some of the best layered meanings. I love how her novel sprouted from a desire to amend, but offered as a response to Robbie's invented request: ""She knew what was required of her...a new draft, an atonement."" While Briony should take culprit for the loss of several years, she can't for their entire lives, for the years fate and the war stole away. And she can't even take full credit for those years. It was not her ""crime"" but her interpretation of one that fueled the problem. She spent her life in remorse, letting her decision shape her life and self worth. I think she more than paid her debt for what was a misunderstanding, a mistake, not cruel revenge. She got caught up in her perception and forced facts to fit her assumptions--ones she full-heartedly believed. It is Lola unwilling to admit her part in the sexual encounter that should be atoning. Paul with his unrepentant spirit that should atone for another man paying for his crime. And even her mother making the improbable leap from inappropriate love letter to assault to break a servant's son connection with her daughter. Surely, she is just as guilty but seems unwillingly to accept her part in losing relationships with both her daughters. Briony is the only one in this story willing to atone for the tragedy. I didn't find her silence at the wedding cowardice: what good would it have served to ruin yet another couple's happiness? Her appearance was sufficient.I wish Cecilia were more vocal the night they waited for his return. Sure the social class and unacceptable library behavior restrained her, but I wanted passion as proof of her love. Her silence annoyed and confused me as much as Briony's self-righteous witness angered me. But despite her hesitation that night, considering Cecilia's drastic reaction to her family, I want to believe the relationship must have been long-term, more serious. I'd like to think as her atonement Briony was as hard on herself as possible. I want to think that instead of unrequited love there was secret love undiscovered away from home but unable to pass inquisitive eyes. It doesn't atone, but it makes it less severe. Briony's initial reaction to the fountain scene was that Robbie was proposing marriage. It could be accurate that Briony happened upon a lover's quarrel: Cecilia wanted to keep the relationship hushed from her parents and when Robbie was too personal in broad daylight she snapped. The letter could have been a joke from a guy asking for a moment alone with his girlfriend and in it his hesitance to jump from playful to committed. The story invented, while the most probable, was the most severe option she could conjure up and not the one I wanted to believe. I know I'm grasping at straws, but I want to believe Briony was wrong. The beauty of the story is I can.The fact that I cared enough about the characters to want that for them, to simmer over it after I closed the book, reluctant to have it end, testifies to the power of the story. Despite my longing, I wouldn't necessarily consider the story of Robbie and Cecilia a complete tragedy. If one had survived to grieve and hate then yes, but to have such intense love (to have ""a reason for life"" as Cecilia put it) and be reunited after a short time gives their lives meaning and purpose and only makes it tragic for Briony left to regret the consequences of her rash judgment without ever hope of reconciliation. There in lies the tragedy: in a girl's life altered, not in the love story.Some of my favorite quotes:It wasn't only wickedness and scheming that made people unhappy, it was confusion and misunderstanding; above all, it was the failure to grasp the simple truth that other people are as real as you. And only in a story could you enter there different minds and show how they had a equal value. That was the only moral a story need have.The cost of oblivious daydreaming was always this moment of return, the realignment with what had been before and now seemed a little worse.(Robbie of meeting Cecilia) It would be worse, but he still wanted it. he had to have it. He wanted it to be worse. Every now and then quite unintentionally someone taught you something about yourself.(Robbie & Cecilia uttering each other's names) It sounded like a new word--the syllables remained the same, the meaning was different.(Briony on guilt) How quite refined the methods of self-torture, invading the beads of detail into an eternal loop, a rosary to be fingered for a lifetime.Memories--bleached colorless through overuse.With the clarity of passionA person is, among all else, a material thing, easily torn and not easily mended.She was the sort of girl who lived in her thoughts.It was common enough to see so much death and want a child, common therefore human, and he wanted it all the more. When the wounded were screaming, you dreamed of sharing a little house somewhere, of an ordinary life, a family line, connection.Now was her chance to proclaim in public all the private anguish and purge herself of all that she had done wrong. Before the altar of this most rational of churches.To Briony it appeared her life was gong to be lived in one room without a door.What she felt was more like homesickness though there was no source for it, no home.

The story starts moving only when about 100 pages into the book.When I completed the first 3 parts, I was kind of disappointed with this book and thought I will give 3 stars and was wondering what all the hype was about! That was until I read the last section. It was heartbreaking. Those few pages made me re-think about the 3 stars. They compelled me to reward this novel with 4 stars. It deserved it.All Briony Tallis wanted was for her elder brother Leon to enjoy the play she had written and was planning to enact it with her cousins, when he returned home after college. All her plans were ruined by her rude cousins who fought with her. Sad, she begins to wander around her house, with her thoughts. She spots her elder sister Cecilia and their cleaning lady's son Robbie in a situation she cant comprehend. Her vivid, wild imagination prompts her to immediately write a story. She thinks that Robbie has set his mind to do something evil and she needs to protect her sister.When a family tragedy occurs, Briony decides to take charge and accuse Robbie of a crime he has not committed. This turns the life of a lot of people upside down. As Briony grows up, she realises that she has made a mistake. The rest of the novel is about how she tries to atone her mistake and whether she succeeds or not.What I loved about this book:Character development: Even though the initial chapters were boring, McEwan has done a great job in writing the thoughts and perspectives of each character. The thoughts of Briony who wants to be a writer, the anguish of an ill mother when she thinks about her daughters, the thoughts and actions of Robbie and Cecilia.. All these were written with perfection.Conclusion: As heartbreaking as it was, this is the point in which the novel turned from an average book to a spectacular one.Originality of Plot: The story idea was original and realistic.Things that disappointed me:Beginning: It was dragging. I guess it needs editing. Those initial chapters were required to build the story, but they needn't be so lengthy.Part 2: After the story started moving, the book was really interesting. But when I reached part 2, I just didnt understand why it needed to be so long and it felt so disconnected from part 1.Portrayal of Briony: I believe that Briony was almost innocent, considering her age and what she witnessed. But all through the book, I felt McEwan was trying to portray her as someone evil and mischievous. The young villain of the story. But her motives were honest and just. I dont know why the police and investigators didnt do a good job. They could have asked where each of the characters where during the search. *Spoiler Alert*( An afterthought on this point. Maybe Briony was portrayed as a lying, unreliable witness and a cruel girl by the author because she is the writer of the story and it's all that she can do under the given circumstances: make herself look like the bad guy, as a small penance for ruining the lives of her sister and Robbie.)Missing pieces: I wish McEwan had written a bit more about the interrogation and what was going through the minds of each of the family members after the ""tragedy"". Also how Cecilia acted after the arrest of Robbie. That's all I can think about now! I'm eager to hear the thoughts and opinions of other readers about this book😊!!Watched the movie and loved it.

33,143906868,01/26/2011,5.0,"Atonement is a magnificent masterpiece that showcases Ian McEwan’s ability to tell a shattering and sublime story. I re-read this novel when I was casting about for a literary work to satisfying my longing for impeccable prose and a strong storyline. I was amazed at how fresh this story read after a lapse of almost a decade and its ability to hold my interest even though I already knew the story. What is perhaps more gratifying is picking up nuances I had missed in my previous reading. One of the salient discoveries is the potential of the written word or stories for great evil.Sadly, Atonement is a devastating story about a wrongdoing for which there is no atonement. It is shattering and horrifying because the crime is committed by a 13-year-old girl who is barely out of childhood and ignorant of adult rites and conventions of behavior. She spends an entire lifetime doing penance, seeking forgiveness and trying to atone for her misdeeds.Briony Tallis, the young protagonist, keeps her drawers neat and locks her diaries; she is a champion of an orderly world, ‘one of those children possessed by a desire to have the world just so.’ What works ironically to Briony’s detriment is her precocious writing talent that is matched only by her fertile imagination. On a hot summer’s day, Briony observes from a distance a flirtatious interaction between Cecilia, her 23-year-old sister, and her Cambridge schoolmate Robbie Turner, their close family friend and son of their charlady. Robbie appears to have put her sister in a compromising position, an observation that upsets Briony’s sense of an orderly world and certainly her expectations of her sister. Two other events, including Robbie’s crude but unintended note to Cecilia that Briony makes it her business to read, are similarly misconstrued. Worse yet, they become material for a new story she is composing in her mind. That summer marks a watershed for Briony who sees herself as stepping away from the world of princesses and castles and being initiated into the strange world of adults, which calls for a new narrative. Subsequently, Briony’s innocent but wrongful appraisal of a social situation leads to a guileless and promising young man being imprisoned for a crime he did not commit. The false charges also cause a prolonged estrangement within the prominent Tallis family. Briony struggles with the certainty of her incriminating testimony, but her youth and urgency to grow up compel her to stick to her version of the truth: ‘It was her own discovery. It was her story, the one that was writing itself around her.’And ‘As far as she was concerned, everything fitted; the terrible present fulfilled the recent past.’ Briony has been unable to distinguish real life from the stories she is writing in her head. The damage, however, is irreparable. Beyond a personal tragedy, Atonement captures the hypocrisy of life among the upper classes of British society in the 1930s. It also recounts with searing force the carnage of the years leading to World War II. Parts Two and Three which centered on the life of worn out soldiers trudging through the depleted countryside mortally in need of water and food, and of nurses working round the clock to provide care for the wounded are excruciatingly painful to read. McEwan highlights how in such dire circumstances where life seems untenable, humans make resolutions to live differently, aspire to find comfort in the simple and ordinary, and cling onto every shred of hope that provides a reason to live.As I expected, McEwan provided a reading experience that is totally engrossing and luxurious. His incisive prose lays bare the subtle undercurrents of emotions that are guarded secrets of the characters’ interior life. There are also pages and pages of precise prose that capture a sense of place and time whether it be the gorgeous precincts of the Tallis home in the country, the hostility of beleaguered towns ravaged by war, or a cringe-worthy hospital scene where a blood-soaked bandage is being unraveled. Indisputably, it is writing at its finest. Thank you, Mr. McEwan.",49,-0.9573,0.115,0.779,0.107,0.5440401552470518,POSITIVE,0.9986
34,1399829970,09/24/2015,4.0,"""Atonement"" focuses on tragic events surrounding the Tallis family during the years prior to, during and after the Second World War. Briony Tallis, a thirteen-year-old girl who has a dream of becoming a famous author, witnesses and misunderstands the sexual tension between her older sister Cecilia and the gardener Robbie Turner, with her mistake leading to years of remorse, hate, solitude – and atonement. One might think this is a concept too unpromising for a full-length story, lacking any further potential for an interesting reading experience which will stick in one’s memory. But whoever may bear such thoughts: the novel is even more than that. Don’t expect a hopeful, romantic or even funny story when entering the world Ian McEwan has built in his masterpiece. It is tragic, heart-breaking and full of dark moments. There is not too much hope in this story. „Atonement“ depicts what might very well have been reality. McEwan deals with flawed characters. Neither of them are perfect, all of them commit mistakes with grave consequences. Most of them are not even likeable. But you can’t say any person included in McEwans large cast of characters is depicted in an unrealistic way, and in my opinion, that’s what makes „Atonement“ a true masterpiece.Two years ago, I had to read „The Innocent“, one of McEwan’s less-known novels, for school. It was not particularly well-written, felt really weird to me and a lot of others, did not deal subtly with its messages, and was generally no novel to be commemorated as a great work. I am still angry with my English teacher for introducing me to McEwan with such a book, considering his writing talents shine so much more through the narrative of „Atonement“. Say what you want about the plot or the character development, but the prose is beautiful. The book has been published only fourteen years ago, but it is one of those novels which will probably be considered to be true classics in fifty or one hundred years. „Atonement“ is divided into three different sections. The first one deals with a hot afternoon in the summer of 1935 and the aftermath of a fatal entanglement, introducing the main characters, a stunning atmosphere and allowing the reader to become familiar with McEwan’s writing style. It was a little bit difficult to get into the story due to its slow beginning and the lengthy introduction, which is the main reason for why I deducted one half-star from my rating and finally rounded it down to 4 stars. But as soon as the first plot twist appeared, the story’s pace gathered speed, making up for a great conclusion to the first part. The second section then introduced us to a soldier’s experience during the Second World War, and while interesting and very well-written, this section – once again – may be considered to be a little long-winded. (I think those 100 pages might easily have been reduced to 60 or 70.) And then McEwan returned to his main protagonist during the course of the last section, narrating a tale about a nurse’s difficult life during War, and had he not already captured me with his prose, he would certainly have succeeded to do so with this final part. The epilogue was one of the best conclusions to a story I’ve ever read, staying true to the plot and the characters and completing the story in a way which is very close to being perfect.If you enjoy reading novels with magnificent writing, profound plot elements which remain true to the characters, and perfect character development, then this is the book you should check out next.",49,0.9918,0.073,0.795,0.132,0.5798340548340548,NEGATIVE,0.7638

36,1732652629,08/19/2016,4.0,"What a remarkable reading experience! Initially you find your self in a duplicate of Jane Austen's Mansfield Park, then the general atmosphere reflects that of the Brontë's (especially Jane Eyre) and the writing style that of Virginia Woolf (with the continuous registration of impressions), ... perhaps not coincidentally all British, female authors. The story is situated in the middle of the 1930s, in an environment of wealthy British bourgeoisie. The pace is slow, and there is a heavy emphasis on the different perceptions of the protagonists, and that also is not a coincidence. Then a dramatic development follows, described from different perspectives.""End of story"", you think, but nothing is less true. We jump to May 1940 and are served a rather hallucinatory episode of the Second World War: the chaotic withdrawal of British troops at Dunkirk, through the eyes of one of the protagonists of the first part; for me this is one of the most poignant descriptions of the horrors of war I have ever read. Then, the focus moves forwards to London in July 1940 (just before the Blitzkrieg) and the storylines from the previous parts come together in an ultimate final. Here, McEwan gives us proof of his lucid psychological discernment, with some very intense, beautifully composed scenes that will linger along in my memory for a very long time. Only the epilogue, more than 50 years later, seemed superfluous; in this section McEwan - in the best postmodern tradition - deepens the meta-narrative of his novel about the process of writing and the extraordinary power of the writer; interesting stuff, but I wasn't thrilled.In my view this book shows McEwan at the height of his creative power, and he approaches the maximum a writer of prose can reach in literary expression. Weighty words, I know, but there is a downside to this: this novel is so polished that I finally had a bit of difficulty to really connect with the characters and the story. Originally I gave this a rating of 3 stars, but I've upgraded it to 4, detracting a half one (what a troublesome thing this rating system is!).

The story of deception, perspective, imagination, delusion and responsability is one of the best written by McEwan.It tells the story of a particular day that changes the characters' lives forever. Briony is a twelve-year-old girl whose imagination drives her to create explanations for the things that she doesn't know about or understand. When she sees, through the window, the scene between her eighteen-year-old sister Cecilia and the maid's young son Robbie, you realise how Briony unconsciously sees the tension between them as something dangerous, a puzzle she must solve.In times of the beginning of the war, in the house there are other visitors: Briony's cousins, the twin boys and their teenaged sister Lola, and a friend of the family, the chocolate manufacturer Paul Marshall. During the night, the boys run away as they fight with their sister and everybody seeks them through the darkness of the garden.A terrible thing happens, being Briony the only witness. This event changes the flow of the plot completely, moving through time as it portrays an older Briony, now a nurse in the army, trying to atone for the mistake she made that night years ago.What is to say about Mc Ewan's well-crafted writing, the quick-pace of the plot only slows to give us a glimpse of the characters' complexity, the reasons behind their actions, the decisions they make as History leads their days into chaos.A surprise is waiting for you if you think you know where the story is going.

The incident in question is a sexual assault. The victim has already been described as a drama queen who loves nothing better than to be the centre of attention. There's then nothing in the text to suggest she has undergone anything as serious as rape. Initially, I assumed it was a bit of hanky panky because she wasn't depicted as being overly traumatised. It was a shock to later hear she had been raped. Then she protects the rapist by agreeing to accuse someone completely innocent of the assault. McEwan conveniently skips the trial when the wrong man is convicted of the crime. This belittling of rape becomes more uncomfortable later when we discover the victim marries her rapist. So, there's some clumsy plotting and some highly dodgy sexual politics (McEwan perhaps showing his age) but I'm going to judge the book on its literary qualities, not its sexual politics, and for that reason definitely a five star read. I especially enjoyed the descriptive writing of the retreat of Robbie as part of the British expeditionary forces to Dunkirk. ",43,-0.8739,0.168,0.73,0.102,0.5009420289855073,POSITIVE,0.9992
40,635192782,06/07/2013,5.0,"A scintillating piece of the purest gemstone, a diamond, was tracing around the forceps of a persona, the face of a mountain. The sky was a jet-black expanse devoid of sunlight and every color that pleases the eyes. There were small bursts of constant explosions inside that cavernous cave of red. A ripping sensation engulfed the whole scenery, like a piece of meat being torn by a pack of savage dogs. Emptiness. Then, a small stream of gold flowed from the heavens. Color was restored in the most simple of hues. The raging river was calmed and tamed. There was absolute stillness in the valley. A small crack, a curve, appeared on the face of the mountain. A smile. Then, I closed that little book called ""Atonement"".Ian McEwan's masterpiece left me a man defined by his emotions. It was a breath-taking view I glimpsed but I fell into a pit of the darkest kind. I was a happy yet an unhappy man. The logical part of me was so astounded and amazed by that single confession, that act of self-abdication. The logical man was very impressed by that post-modernist ending. Yet, that man of feeling was abhorred and devastated. He was deftly crushed. I did not know what to say. Of course, in times like these, feeling is preemptive of thinking. One feels before one thinks. When the dust settled, all I felt was anger, then I saw the light. This is sort of reminiscent to Lolita. Where Nabokov uses literary artistry to, in a way, ask for consideration on Humbert's part. To mask the monster underneath a facade of beauty. McEwan adapts this concept in a different way. Instead of aesthetic artistry, though it is still present, the manipulation of fates and events become the central point of his undertaking. They both acknowledge the healing powers of the written word. Before the book even started, the reader is already given a Romantic novel quote--something out of Jane Austen's ""Northanger Abbey."" This sets the tone for a book that will be packed with literary allegory. Even the form of the book walks the reader through some of English lit's historical periods: Part One--Austen'esque Romanticism; Part Two--Historical Fiction War Story; Part Three--Victorian or Modern Memoir; and Part Four--Post Modern speculation and theory. You see, McEwan's Briony cleverly concocted a covering of gold to a broken statue of clay.“How can a novelist achieve atonement when, with her absolute power of deciding outcomes, she is also God? There is no one, no entity or higher form that she can appeal to, or be reconciled with, or that can forgive her. There is nothing outside her. In her imagination she has set the limits and the terms. No atonement for God, or novelists, even if they are atheists. It was always an impossible task, and that was precisely the point. The attempt was all.”Briony will never receive Atonement. But, I do believe that she has achieved At-One-Ment with herself if not with her readers, for she has done everything in her power to make up for her crime. “A person is, among all else, a material thing, easily torn and not easily mended.” If you consider the gravity of Briony's crime, the effect, the outcome, even when you put her innocence in consideration, one can't help but feel hatred for her. I admit, I did. But in time, the fact that it was the effect of a wildly imaginative ardor will soften the blow. Surely, atonement isn't for her, but sympathy is what she deserves and it's what she refuses to get. Some might consider her act of altering the story a Pontius Pilate act. But I admire her for it. She shuns sympathy even when she greatly needs it because she knows she doesn't deserve it. And though she might not be able to mend the flesh, she was able to conjure their spirit of love. Robbie and Cecilia might be gone, but their love lives in the memories of people who read their story. Much like Briony has etched herself in mine. I know what she looks like. I watched her grow up. I was there every step of the way, and I will keep a part of her alive in me until the day I take my last breath. But even then, that wouldn't be the end. Others will take her up in their memories and keep her alive. Sure, she might not be the same as when I envisioned her. But she'll live far longer than I. So the same will go for the lovers. Therefore I wholeheartedly agree with the excerpt below. “But what really happened? The answer is simple: the lovers survive and flourish.”Literature immortalized their love, and that's all that matters. Not her Atonement, but their Love.",40,0.9976,0.081,0.751,0.169,0.4555679563492063,POSITIVE,0.9327

42,227366915,10/25/2011,1.0,"I hated this book, and after putting it down, I gained a decided aversion to all things Ian McEwan. First of all, the writing. Yes, it's beautiful and such. But it's LONG. And BORING. Robbie spends an entire chapter in the bathtub. And nothing happens. And then--aha! Things start to get rolling. Cecelia and Robbie disappear into the library, Briony walks in on them, Lola gets raped, Briony comes to the wrong conclusion because of her pre-existing fears of Robbie. And away goes Robbie, and the story begins. My second issue with the story are the characters. Briony is cast as the villain. But shouldn't a twelve-year-old be legitimately creeped out by what Briony learns in the first part of the story? Aren't her suspicions (though not her conclusion) legitimate? I had a hard time feeling sorry for Cee and Robbie because I couldn't see them as victims, but as selfish idiots. And horny ones at that. And my third, and greatest problem: What happened to Lola. Probably the main reason I had trouble feeling sorry for any of the main characters was because I was stuck on the rape of a young girl. How can I feel agony at Briony's predicament? She sees Lola raped and then spends the rest of her life trying to atone for Cee and Robbie's separation--without ever going back to set things right with her cousin, or to see that Marshall got what he deserved. Cee and Robbie don't seem to care either; they're too fixed on their own broken hearts. Lola gets raped and marries her attacker without knowing it, and the only thing the three main characters care about is that Cee and Robbie didn't finish their shag. Really?It isn't just the shallowness of the characters that leaves a bad taste in my mouth; it's the fact that McEwan presents that as okay. He doesn't care either. Maybe I could have stomached Atonement if that part of the plot had been different. As it was, Lola and Marshall affected me more than anyone else in the story, and I was never able to get over their subplot, or even bring myself to tolerate the rest of the characters.

43,17602452,03/12/2008,2.0,"**NOTE: Spoilers included: I like the experience of reading a book and then seeing the movie, which is why I read this book. Both the book and the movie are highly acclaimed, so what could be a better choice? I haven’t yet seen the movie since I just finished the book today, but perhaps I should have read ""No Country For Old Men"" instead. 100 pages into this book, I wanted to just give up. It felt like something that would have been forced on me by high school English teachers, with all the descriptive, flowery language about British aristocratic characters, scenery, and architecture in 1935 that I just couldn’t bring myself to care about. Were it not for the knowledge that Briony was going to commit a crime (based on the back of the book), I would have definitely put it down. Even so, I thought the crime would have been something worse than perjury – taking approximately 170+ pages to build up to the crime better damn well be murder! (joking) – but nonetheless, her crime tore her family apart, which was bad. But still, taking up 170+ pages to describe one afternoon (as many people on this site have noted) was unnecessary. And even though the writing style was beautiful, elegant, etc., it seemed like nothing really *happened;* it was mostly thoughts, memories, and physical descriptions, much of which were irrelevant to the actual plot. Maybe that’s just my preference for reading books in which the characters actually DO something and TALK to each other. I mean, don’t get me wrong, a little description is ok and necessary, but this just took it to the extreme. I know McEwan was just trying to show the depth of the characters at play, thus getting the reader to care more about them and make the impact of what was about to happen more forceful, but he overdid it to the point of making me not care at all. I didn’t think the plot of this book really needed such in-depth description.However, Parts 2 & 3 changed gears and definitely picked up; it was like reading a completely different book! I enjoyed reading about Robbie’s traumatic escape from France during the Battle of Dunkirk, and Briony’s experience as a nurse tending to the wounded/dead of World War II. Both sections were a refreshing contrast to the superficial, snobbish feel of the first section of the book (not that war is refreshing). One thing I thought the book was missing and should have elaborated on more rather than the tedious Part 1 was the immediate aftermath of Briony’s crime. After the crime occurs, the plot immediately jumps to Robbie in France during the war, and we are told very little of what happened in the 3 year period of time between the crime itself, Robbie’s prison sentence, and his eventual deployment. We know that Robbie had aspired to go to medical school, but was the outcome of the novel a result of Briony’s crime or World War II? Even if Briony committed no crime, wasn’t Robbie’s being drafted to the war and eventual separation from Cecilia inevitable?Despite being unsure if the novel’s outcome was the result of war or a childhood crime, unlike what some posters on this site have written, I actually liked the ending. I liked the revelation that the story was a novel within a novel, and an attempt at atonement that never happens in (Briony’s fictional) reality. If Briony had went on to talk to her family, lawyers, and legally retracted her false statement, and then Cecilia and Robbie lived happily ever after and forgave Briony, the novel would have been merely a glorified version of Briony’s juvenile The Trials of Arabella. Maybe it’s just me, but happy, neat endings in movies, books, etc. sometimes just get old. Life is just not that perfect, and the fact is, seemingly innocuous actions in the present may lead to consequences that can never be redeemed.Overall, the length and weightiness of the first part of the book is why I only gave it 2 stars, but if that section had been condensed into, say, 50 pages or less, I would have given it 5 stars.

I was annoyed by - the behavior of the upper-crust British family about which the story revolves.- the absence of details concerning the trial.- the excruciating description of body injuries in the war scenes.- the melodrama of Briony's (view spoiler)[impending death (hide spoiler)].- the ending which diverts into a discussion of how the novel should conclude.- the posh, wordy writing style.- the fact that Briony thought she could attain (view spoiler)[atonement through a novel (hide spoiler)].It is very hard to discuss the above points without revealing the events of the story. Underlying my dislike of the book is the absurdity of the notion that the words of a thirteen-year-old child are taken as proof for a verdict. Children make errors. They cannot and should not be expected to fully understand the adult world around them. Much more attention should have been focused on others' guilt. This is a love story, a war story, a book about what can be achieved through a novel, and of course about how to make amends. Can one atone for one's mistakes? Of course one cannot always do that! Life is like that. I do think the author accurately depicts the upper-crust British lifestyle between the wars and the horrid reality of war. Yet for me the writing was too melodramatic and too florid. I dislike haughty wording. I prefer a more simple style. This is a matter of taste, but I believe if the wording annoys you every step of the way you will have difficulty enjoying the novel. I did smile sometimes at the imagination, passion and precocity of the young Briony. One word about the audiobook narration by Carol Boyd.

51,319186351,04/26/2012,5.0,"'I had written him a letter which I had, for want of betterKnowledge, sent to where I met him down the Lachlan, years ago,He was shearing when I knew him, so I sent the letter to him,Just ""on spec"", addressed as follows: ""Clancy, of The Overflow""'To borrow the opening verse of a famous Australian poem by Banjo Patterson, this is precisely what parts of Atonement feel like. A letter, written and directed to relatives wrongly accused in the hope of seeking forgiveness or at the least: atonement. Atonement is one of the finest modern literary novels I have read, lyrical and hauntingly moving, while captivating the reader with an interesting story. As for the ideas behind this novel, they are profound. I believe this book alone is one which should class McEwan as a writer deserving of acclaim.I noted in the previous McEwan novel I read how McEwan had written in the first person present tense. In Atonement his writing is still a beautiful, if not more beautiful, but set in the third-person. And personally this works better in describing the events of the story. By the end of the novel the narrative does drift into first person, but only as necessary for the story's completion. For by the end of the novel the reader will see that this book is 'not written' by McEwan but rather by Briony Tallis herself as her testimony of a wrong once done. I thought this method of having Atonement be something of a book within a book was a brilliant meta-linguistic technique. Of course I did not recognise this until the end of the novel, which is when McEwan wanted his readers to see this fact.The novel focuses on Briony Tallis, a thirteen year old in 1934, who could perhaps be described as capricious and wilful. She wants the world to run according to her designs (as any thirteen year old does) and is a budding author, having been in the process of writing a play. This introduction to Briony perfectly places her into the narrative as a naive dreamer, a girl who sees black and white and then argues what she sees.At the story's opening Briony Tallis spies her sister Cecilia strip down to her underwear in front of one particular boy, Robbie Turner and so begins a dreadful misinterpretation, particularly when she reads a smutty letter from Robbie to Cecilia, as Briony suspects Robbie of committing wrong against her sister. (view spoiler)[This belief is confirmed to her when she finds Robbie and Cecilia in the library making love. (hide spoiler)] When Briony's cousin Lola is raped, she reports that it was Robbie who did the deed, though he claims innocence. And so Robbie, one a 'family friend' is separated from his lover and a once loving family because she believes so clearly that it was Robbie.The themes of this novel essentially resolve around the conflict created from Briony's mistake. The question is asked subtly by the novel: can anyone be forgiven or make up for a mistake made as a child? The question is not should they, for I think that most people would believe that yes, an individual should be forgiven if they are truly sorry for their mistake. But the question asked is 'can they be forgiven?'. Another aspect of McEwan's brilliant writing is that he does make complOvex and solid characters in this novel who respond not to fairytale logic but rather who respond as emotional individuals. And as emotionally driven humans there are some crimes and some wrongs that we never want to right or forgive. Personally this element touched me due to my beliefs in God and that we all need someone who can unconditionally forgive, because I do not think that we as people can forgive every detail of a crime done against us. Or we may pardon them but never forget their mistake. We will allow mistakes to colour our perception of individuals. And from this perspective this was a great book, along with the writing, the characters and the overall story.Overall a piece of literature that deserves to be read and has been read by many hundreds of thousands of people. It's a potential classic in the making and certainly has to be McEwan's best work in writing. I encourage anyone who is interested in stories about unfair accusations and forgiveness to give it a try if they have not.",31,0.9984,0.076,0.734,0.19,0.5591269841269839,POSITIVE,0.9975
52,1509855802,09/10/2017,4.0,"What Mr. McEwan gives us here is a story about love and war, yes, but much more than that it is a story about guilt, perception, and story-telling.I will say that I felt as if this novel had a felling of dooming, damning taint from start to finish. There is an ominous foreboding that hangs over the beautifully orchestrated language. I half-wish there could have been some points to lighten the story, some glimmers of natural joy that wasn't sprung from malice or discomfort, but I guess that's just not that kind of story - in fact I suppose the end of naive, free felicity is somewhat how this story begins. This is a story that stems from the mistakes(?) we can make by being blindly sure of the truth of our perspectives and how a lifetime of guilt and a struggle for penance can follow. It is not a light book, but it is realistic in as far as it explores it's topics. While the best of this book is built on internal struggles, I think there is also something of class, history, and the creative process that should be thought about. There is a layering of themes, feelings, thoughts, and yes, I am going to say it once more, perspectives, that is mesmerizing. It's a bitter, nuanced pill that as the reader you hate to swallow, but feel obligated to chew and digest all the same; and the aftertaste will linger long afterward.As for an ending that some question, perhaps even dislike, I think it kind - the best thing an author might be able to do for their 'characters', the one last attempt at some form of atonement.

Okay, you know how sometimes you're craving a certain kind of musical style, like sixties soul, say, or classic British punk, but you don't actually want to listen to old music, you want to listen to something that's, like, of the now? There're a few (okay, not many) bands out there that don't just do hollow retro imitations, but sort of take what they love from the classics, and somehow make that new and fresh and appropriate to our time. I'd say this book is like that: it's the perfect thing if you're after an exquisitely written modernist novel, only you don't actually want to get into the musty old canon, and would like something new. Honestly, I think this actually works better with fiction than with music.... In any case, this guy can sure put together a sentence, let me tell you! Beautiful, beautiful sentences. They made me a little ashamed of myself. Actually, they made me a lot ashamed, but I was enjoying it so much that I didn't feel bad.I'm a little hesitant about putting this in my book report, because I really do recommend this book and I'd like you to read it, but I have to say that I did find the last chapter hugely disappointing. It did have one instant where it went a ways toward redeeming itself at the end, but on the whole it was kind of like.... I don't know. It didn't ruin the book or anything, but it made me feel like Ian McEwan might be something slightly less than the incredible, sublime sentence-crafting god I'd been picturing him as. I mean, I guess he looks pretty ordinary on the back photo, which should have been a tip-off. Isn't there some culture's artistic tradition that's like that, where they purposely don't finish or add imperfections in their statues, to remind humanity that nothing we make can all that great? Well, the little coda at the end of _Atonement_ kind of hit me like that. To be sure, the author is extremely talented... but he is mortal, like the rest of us.Yeah, the ending is dumb alright.Worse than dumb, it's poorly executed. I understand why he felt he needed it, and the impulse was a good one. However, its function should have been accomplished with the grace and style all previous chapters had, and in my opinion it wasn't. It was just off, to me: like a great restaurant with mediocre desserts.Anyway, it was still a great book. I'm curious if other people agree with me about this, or if I just sound cranky.

55,1991763838,07/08/2019,5.0,"Atonement opens in 1935 at an English country estate, continues in rural France during the retreat to Dunkirk during WWII, and moves to a hospital in London in 1940. It mostly takes place during WWII, though it is not about the war itself. It is a story of the lives of Briony Tallis, her sister, Cecilia, and her sister’s beau, Robbie. Briony makes a terrible mistake that devastates the lives of these young people and their families. At the time of her error, Briony is thirteen years old. She is an aspiring writer with a vivid imagination, which is, in part, the cause of her misjudgment. Her mind is filled with the stories in her head, and her ambition to be a writer influences her judgment, so she “sees” events that coincide with what she believes to be true. This is the story of Briony’s atonement for her grievous error, trying to overcome almost unbearable remorse and guilt.It is a literary novel containing many levels of complexities, which the reader gradually discovers. Some of Briony’s lessons will be imparted to the reader through this multi-layered structure. It is difficult to describe this process without spoiling. The writing is elegant and insightful, containing beautiful descriptive passages as well as an in-depth portrayal of human nature while under duress. The final section contains an epilogue set in 1999, and as with many epilogues, it may have an adverse impact on the reader’s enjoyment. I felt the epilogue was critical to impart the full picture and reveal all the complexities referenced above. I found it exquisitely written and brilliantly crafted.

“Was everyone else really as alive as she was? … If the answer was yes, then the world, the social world, was unbearably complicated, with two billion voices, and everyone’s thoughts striving in equal importance and everyone’s claim on life as intense, and everyone thinking they were unique, when no one was. One could drown in irrelevance.”

This was a book I never thought I would ever pick up - or, at least not anytime soon. When I was younger, I watched the movie because a friend said it was her favorite movie (and also because I loved James McAvoy). I was too young to understand the beauty of the story - of all the things that made it real and raw and made parts of younger me shy away. I ended up really disliking the movie being a lover of … a different kind of ending. (I also distrusted and disliked Saoirse Ronan for years but that’s not important). I forgot about the movie and the book until years (we’re talking years) later, I ended up staying with that best friend for a few nights and she, once again, mentioned her love of not just the movie, but the book. She called it her favorite book. Naturally, I had to give it another try.I’m so glad I did. This book was slow and painful and frustrating and just so real in a way I haven’t experienced with a book in a very long time. I’ll admit (and this is important to note!) the book starts out incredibly slow. I mean painfully slow. I think the main reason this isn’t five stars (jury’s still out, I’m tempted to change my mind update: I did indeed change my mind) is because of how slow it was. Already colored by my childhood dislike of the movie, I nearly put the book down. But then I came onto Goodreads and saw so many people mention the same complaint and telling readers to push through. And here I am. There’s a reason the book starts off so slow (to the point where I was constantly putting it down. It was engaging but also not. It was confusing to feel all this but I wanted to keep going). When you finally understand why the book starts the way it does, it makes you appreciate it (and hurt a little … no, a lot). (view spoiler)[Briony is trying to remember everything, every single detail, to make up for the time she didn’t but also to prolong the time before it gets to her unspeakable deed. You feel the dread as the moment comes closer.“The interminable pages about light and stone and water, a narrative split between three different points of view, the hovering stillness of nothing much seeming to happen—none of this could conceal her cowardice. Did she really think she could hide behind some borrowed notions of modern writing, and drown her guilt in a stream—three streams!—of consciousness?” (hide spoiler)] Basically what I’m saying is, push through the first third, it gets better.I woke up super early this morning and found myself tempted to go back to sleep. Somehow I ended up picking up Atonement instead. I figured I’d read a few pages in bed and fall back asleep. It’s 2:37 pm and I’m writing this review shortly after finishing the book. Yeah. Somewhere during my reading, towards the end, it started to rain (it’s still raining as I type this). Somehow, this feels really fitting. I can’t tell you why or how, but the feeling that rain brings to the world is how I felt finishing this book. Atonement is artfully written in a way that I’ve never seen another book do. I never thought I could stop hating or forgive Briony after watching the movie so long ago. I don’t know if I forgive her, but I don’t hate her and, at the very least, I actually understand her. It is entirely different watching the movie vs. reading it happen and I started reading with my anger already in place. Every section and perspective was unique and painful and raw. I felt the emotions. I felt Briony’s self-righteousness, Robbie’s anguish and constant need to survive in order to get back to Cecelia, and I felt Cecelia’s love and anger and bitterness. I felt all of it and actually knew what happened before Briony tells us in the end. That was beautifully done. I remember finishing Robbie’s section, shutting the book, and pretending I was okay. I remember the anxiety and stress and terror and horror I felt when the soldiers were brought into the hospital Briony was at. I felt all of that. And more. Atonement also ends in a way I never thought I would like but was left pleasantly appreciative of (and by that I mean there are tears in my eyes). Atonement was real, even in the parts where it wasn’t. Especially then. You’ll understand what I mean when you read it. And the way it sort of came full circle had me in tears. The book left my heart aching but also hoping. It makes you really really think about life and the decisions one makes in it and how it all impacts everything.I’m so glad I decided to pick up this book.

The passage from Northanger Abbey that precedes it was promising; anything referencing Jane Austen should be worth reading. However, despite the fact that his style is interesting, that every sentence attempts to make an impact, I feel as if it is trying too hard. A comparison to Austen's writing style is ridiculous, because even though McEwen attempts the same focus on a brilliant turn of the phrase, his style in no way comes close to Austen's clarity. I also found the plot to be faulty. Yes, his detailed description of one afternoon if for the most part gripping, but what happens before and after is lacking. I want to believe that Cecilia and Robbie are in love, but there's not enough there to substantiate that. The description of their secretive letter-writing seems to serve as an indication of their close relationship, but I find it hard to believe that the almost racy yet purposeless Cecilia (as she is characterized in the first half), who was planning on staying at her parents' home all summer because she didn't know what else to do, now has purpose, drive, and patience to wait for Robbie like a good housewife. I can't reconcile her earlier flightiness with her later responsibility. Another issue is the novel's lack of focus. Is the point the consequences of a child's mistake? Or is the point the unfortunate results of fate and war?Overall, there are too many issues that are unresolved or lacking development (i.e. Cecilia's personality, Robbie's turmoil with class, Leon in general) to make me like this novel. Even the observations on writing that make up so much of the introduction do not carry through the rest of the novel.

Nuts.Did I sabotage the book by opting to watch the movie first?Maybe.Or would it have turned out this way regardless?I'll never know.I like the idea of this book. Ian McEwan's definition of atonement is as dazzling as it is strange. I also love the prose. So rich and refined. For these reasons alone, I'm giving Atonement 3 stars.The rest of this review, I'm afraid, is a jumbled explanation for why this book made me so mad.I thought the purpose of this book was to tell a story. A story about how a misunderstanding borne out of innocence could tragically alter so many lives. But did it really do that?? It tried to, at least in the beginning. But even then, I did not for a minute believe that it was really happening, that all these people actually existed. It felt like the script of a play - everything was carefully rehearsed and choreographed. Every character from Briony to Cecelia, from Robbie to Leon, was like a caricature, like Arabella in The Trials of Arabella.Then somewhere past the halfway mark, the story just stopped and Atonement turned into a documentary on the horrors of WW2. Civilians were getting blown to bits, soldiers were being left to die, villages were turning to rubble... I'm not saying it was pointless but it was way overdone. If these characters felt vague before, they ceased to exist for me then - lost in the mess of war tales.So you see, very little actually happened in the course of 350 pages. So much of it was devoted to overtly descriptive passages that were, for lack of a better word, boring. And then there's the twist at the end, of course.(NOTE: Do not peek at the spoiler if you intend to read the book someday.)(view spoiler)[Since the entire novel is supposedly written by Briony and not McEwan, maybe the book was deliberately designed to reflect Briony's ineptitude??

60,1756814299,09/22/2016,5.0,"This was something else. The first question that can be raised is: whose story was it? We think it to be the story of Briony and Cecelia and Robbie, but turns out it is just Briony's story. And that's the point. When a writer writes a story, whose story is it? Of the people who inspired it, or of whom it is a true account of? Or is it just the author's story? What McEwan is trying to establish is that the author is the God. The author decides what will happen in the story. It doesn't matter what actually happened. And it may seem a little cruel of McEwan to suddenly shatter the perfect ending, but it's amazing how just the last few pages completely changed the novel such that that ending didn't matter anymore. What mattered was the process used to achieve it. So many people use writing as a way to reach a conclusion. To understand things better. To understand themselves better. When I write a poem, my aim is to identify my feelings, to understand them. It seems inevitable then that Briony, always a writer, turned her guilt into literature. The point that McEwan is trying to make, however, is that literature isn't necessarily true. There's too much power in the hands of the author. How can an author analyze his guilt when he's perfectly capable of changing everything about his story and believing in that version instead? The real atonement for an author would be to face his guilt on paper. But by doing that, by acknowledging the truth, wouldn't the author lose all his power and be overpowered by mere pages? It's too horrible a prospect.I was going to write about the predicament of Briony's fault, on the one hand, being unforgivable, and on the other, being merely a product of psychological immaturity. But does any of that matter? That's just a part of the book inside the book. And it's a tricky thing that McEwan pulled off so brilliantly. The worth of literature lies in its ability to convey deeper meaning and relevance, which in turn depends on it permitting its readers to discover a universal truth. McEwan, however, manipulates the reader’s perception of truth, and amazingly, by manipulating the truth is how he lets his readers discover a universal truth. To conclude, I absolutely loved this book. It is going into my pile of favourites. ",27,0.996,0.071,0.744,0.185,0.4959677419354839,NEGATIVE,0.9993

Confused, I tell you!Men are forever praising women for apparently possessing a magical power called ""female intuition"", but it seems this magical power always gets it wrong when it comes to sex. Funny, that.Atonement is about a little girl who gets it wrong, and consequentially Ruins Lives. And if Ian McEwan wants to tell this particular story, why shouldn't he? Because isn't it true that nothing is off limits in literature? Oh, yes. But it is equally true that no literature can be divorced from its social context either. The context we're working with here is one where we can ask any social services worker, and they will tell us that one of the biggest problems in cases of child sexual abuse is that other adults frequently didn't believe the child. The context is one where every day the real, flesh-and-blood lives of women, children and occasionally men are ruined by the doubt and dismissal of their claims.Given this context, if you want to tell a story about a girl who misinterprets adult male sexuality and ruins a poor chap's life, you'd better have an excellent reason for doing so (and you'd better proceed with care too). McEwan has no reason beyond a thinly veiled defensiveness that permeates the book, and from that, I can only surmise that he is an intellectually dishonest creep.This book is just more of the same insidious cultural propaganda that, when someone says Rape, encourages us to reply: Nuh uh. Misinterpretation or lie. Propaganda is always unforgivable. I wouldn't go so far as to say that authors have a social responsibility, but when authors are self-servingly irresponsible, I will give them no quarter.The prose and pacing in Atonement is fairly good. In terms of craft, this book deserves more stars, but I won't be handing them out. McEwan doesn't play fair, so I won't either. I'm keeping my copy of this for the zombie apocalypse, when kindling will no doubt be in short supply.To summarise, this is a terrible, terrible book. (Yes, two terribles. Thank you, Skyler White).

64,2211872962,12/12/2017,5.0,"I loved everything about this novel—the storytelling, the inner dialogue which rang so true, and the structure of telling a story in a kind of wave form: the plot moved forward like the tide hitting the beach, then was drawn out in an undertow, going back in time, then flowing in again as another point of view of the same time, and thus it keeps progressing and surprising. What tension, what detail, what a wonderful portrait of a child writer awash in the drama of her fantastic certainty and imagination. I wager anybody who writes will remember themselves through the character of young Briony, whose self-aggrandizing fantasies and need to be the hero of her own drama lead to tragedy. She embodies a time of life that some of us grow out of and then hate ourselves for … until we mature enough to realize that everybody does this stuff and we forgive ourselves for being human. But in this astonishing masterpiece, McEwan, whom I would call a “writer’s writer” because of his ability to reveal that very private process that is usually unspoken, takes us well past that … to atonement.Usually I’m bored by a lot of inner dialogue. I’ve come to associate it with Women’s Fiction where mostly I find it to be overwriting. I had no problems with whole chapters of inner dialogue in this book—perhaps because so much of it was the kind of psychological searching for who and how we really are that I’ve always done.

Simply excellent.Many times, I hesitated picking up this book. The reason: I saw its movie adaptation a few years back and I knew the plot. However, one of my Goodreads friends was right: I still enjoyed the book primarily for the portions that I thought I did not see in the movie like that garden scene where 10-y/o Briony Tallis told their gardener young man, Robbie Turner that she loved him or the scene when nurse Briony loosened up the bandage on the dying soldier's head which was a mistake as she realized that part of the skull was missing as she could see the white bloody brain. I was also anticipating that the end would be different but it seemed that, in essence, it was the same: the old and gray Briony telling the reader (or the viewer) that the lovers, Robbie and Cecilia Tallis actually died separately during the war. So, the old Briony was writing her novel as an ""atonement"" for the mistake that she did when she was 13: telling the police that Robbie was the one who raped Lola, her cousin.Unlike some of my other friends, I did not find the storytelling boring. McEwan's prose is engrossing for its seriousness yet devoid of philosophical musings and insightful quotes. How can a boring writer think of this pivotal line in the story: ""In my dreams I kiss your cunt, your sweet we cunt. In my thoughts I make love to you all day long"". Pivotal because it was the note that Robbie sent by mistake to Cecilia that was read by Robbie's messanger, the 13-y/o, Briony. Imagine the confusion that that line could create in the imaginative mind of a no-longer-a-child-but-not-yet-an-woman Briony. Also, McEwan's vivid descriptions for his settings are remarkable. Reading the first part is like being there in the balcony of the big mansion watching Cecilia and Robbie in the fountain while hearing the voices of Lola, Jackson and Pierrot in the background. I also liked the way the structure of the book having a lengthy first part, a short second part and the dramatic closing in its third. Reminded me of Virginia Woolf's ""To The Lighthouse"" an equally excellent classic novel. The second part being the transition or bridge between the two parts.

70,2716706981,07/03/2020,4.0,"A great achievement! I discovered an excellent writer. I'm not particularly into war novels but the quality of the language really stands out. The novel is made up of disjointed and framed narratives in which we follow the trajectory of three different characters. I was less absorbed in the second part with its war scenes and frantic rhythm, save for that brief, lovely encounter with Luc, the French soldier from Millau. This is a really challenging book and one that triggers a lot of ""ifs"". Also, it tends to include so many details, thus sometimes thwarting my ability to stay immersed in the story. It is quite weird to have the writer elaborate on the weak points of his own novel, inside that same novel. I feel he wanted to create an overwhelming sense of loss brought upon by the war, and for that matter it did not fail to lose me at times.Briony is an exceptional character but one should never trust a child that reads too much Gothic fiction^^",25,0.9815,0.102,0.661,0.237,0.5765151515151515,POSITIVE,0.9997

72,451307417,11/08/2012,5.0,"I was pretty knocked out when I started to get a handle on what this book is. McEwan is attempting a difficult trick, and every sentence has to be just right for it to hang together. 13-year-old Briony has to walk a tightrope between horrible little punk and precocious budding writer: we need to identify with her without condoning what she does. And along the way McEwan throws in little squiggles - little bits where the coloring escapes the lines - that make you suspect that although it's written in the third person, you should bring the same skepticism to it that you bring to a first-person story. (view spoiler)[Because it's fairly clear early on that it's not McEwan writing it, but Briony herself. (hide spoiler)] It's a knockout performance: McEwan, whom I haven't read before, utterly nails it.I don't think he follows through fully on that threat/promise, though. When the actions shifted in the second half, by several years and many miles, I was thrown off and never completely recovered. I'm not sure what I wish he'd done instead. Maybe make the whole book like 500 pages longer? Because what he's about here is describing a life - three, in fact - lived in atonement for one sin, and I don't think he quite gets there.The hints of narrative instability don't come to anything, really. (view spoiler)[There's of course a big one at the end, but that all amounts to sortof a coda followed by an entirely different coda, and it barely affected me. What was more interesting to me was the rejection letter Briony received about her first draft of this book. The editors suggested plot elements - ""Maybe the girl could come between the couple!"" - that are in the story you just read, and this raises questions that are interesting to me: so, has the first half of the book been embellished? To what extent has she been writing fiction? But the answer ends up being no and none, I think: the editors' suggestions were more ironic than meta. And maybe this is just a case of my complaining because McEwan didn't write exactly the book I wanted this to be - a ridiculous sin that I'm often guilty of. I love unreliable narration; I want every book to lie to me. Now I'm whining about it. ""Not enough lying!"" But still: I felt like he was bringing up interesting threads and then dropping them.I get that since the theme of the book is atonement, that final twist - in which Cecilia and Robbie get their happy ending, and then they don't - has repercussions for the whole thing. If they live happily ever after, then they survived Briony's betrayal; if they died young, she's destroyed both of their lives. But that seems a little like confusing the process of atonement for its result. The process is the story, and it's the interesting part, and I think she wrote that part accurately. Also, btw, that final coda was saccharine. (hide spoiler)]I'm giving this five stars because seriously, man, McEwan can write like a motherfucker. I really enjoyed reading this: couldn't wait to pick it up, blasted through it in three days. But it's also true that I felt a little let down by the second half, so this was a tough rating for me. But I'd instantly and gleefully pick up another McEwan book any day, so I guess that's five stars for you.",23,-0.3579,0.116,0.777,0.107,0.5201439332795263,NEGATIVE,0.9998

A literary tour de force.This was my third reading of the novel, and it was as if it shed yet another layer, added new touches, a tell-tale sign of literary depth, which is one of the things I love about this novel. Another aspect I love about it is the ambience created in part 1 of the novel - the paradoxical juxtaposition of impending doom/smouldering menace and a hot, languid, pre-war, English summer's day where it's all drinks, cigarettes, cream coloured clothes and hopeful expectations, set in the grounds, drawing room, dining room (and library!) of a country house. It's decadent, stifling, alluring and ominous all at the same time. It is thus all the more surprising when we move to the second part. The first time I read it I was reminded of The House of the Spirits, which I read decades ago. There, too, the first part is set in a grand house, inhabited by a rather...interesting family. Pure magic. Then came the completely different second part: upheaval, social comments, war and its casualties. I will say little about part 3 except that it becomes clear that the author has taken us for a ride. Although the style of the novel is such that it could have been written at the time it takes place in the beginning (1935), the last part makes it clear that this is a post-modernist piece of writing.Finally, the third reason why I love this novel is the writing. Ian McEwan blends Virginia Woolf-like, modernist descriptions of impressions with post-modernist hints of plot twists and really just demonstrates how good writing skills have been honed to perfection. I cannot praise this novel enough and feel extremely reluctant at ever reading anything else by McEwan, suspecting that his other works cannot possibly live up to this (which I’m also led to believe by other reviews in here). But this is a five-star read if ever there was one. Third time round as well. Review from 2012:Rereading this novel for a book club, I'm struck again by how wonderfully written it is. Knowing what's going to happen makes it a different, but by no means lesser, reading experience. The sense of premonition and subtle atmosphere of impending doom remind me of A Passage to India, another masterpiece in English literature. Back to reading: I have less than four days to read more than 300 pages...And it was worth it. What a masterpiece. I love the writing style, the characterizations, the milieus depicted, and I rejoice and suffer along with the characters.

The details of a single day made me feel I was there. (My frustrations at the ending make it a grudging four stars.)I read Part 1 with suspense (even trepidation) at every turn, but it was fueled by information on the book's cover--telling me that Briony would accuse Robbie of a crime and it would change their lives forever. (I am not sure how I would have reacted to this section without that knowledge. This detracts from the book's inherent power, having to rely upon the cover copywriters.) The long descriptions of each moment, with its smells and light, prolonged this delicious agony. Parts 2 & 3 flew by in comparison, with the crime already committed and the days and years described succinctly.I am especially impressed with McEwan's understanding of how a 13-year-old girl, in her immature, orderly, and righteous ways, would feel revolted, defiled, and betrayed by the idea of blatant adult sexuality. I can believe she would respond as she does, and that she would be unable to distinguish between a maniac and a lover.Class is a major theme, and who can argue with the classism McEwan portrays? The evil rich prosper and the innocent poor are squashed underfoot. An interlocking theme is freedom--to choose a path and live your life. Of course, there is also loss of innocence (""she was still wearing the filthy white dress"").***SPOILERS BELOW!***I feel cheated by the revelation in the last pages, of fiction within fiction. If the whole book is Briony's version of the story, it should be first-person. Of course, this is the main theme of this novel--the creator of fiction wields considerable control over others, concealing or changing words at his/her own whim. So I think McEwan wants to piss us off to make his point. Why else ""deceive"" the reader, then ""un-deceive?"" He seems to say that readers want a ""happy ending,"" but I'd rather have a tragic one and know it than have ""happy"" one ripped away from me. Briony creates the false happy ending (the one she wishes had happened) for her own selfish reasons, and perhaps it helps her sleep at night.The book's title is never achieved for me: Briony cannot atone for her wrong. She wants her novel to be an atonement. She wants her service as a nurse to atone. But, for Robbie and Cecilia, the damage cannot be undone. Briony spends her life having to assuage her conscience through her writing. But she lives a long, prosperous/satisfyingly successful, comfortable life, so I feel her novel is too little, way too late.What about Briony's experience with the West Indian, lawyer cabbie? You can't tell who's educated nowadays, she says. That should have been true for Robbie in 1935 and she knows it.Where are the reliable, loyal men among the characters? Not Jack Tallis, absent father who can't even get home in an emergency. Not Leon, who is married four times and can't seem to commit to the profession he studied. Only Robbie is ""innocent"" (although the consensual fornication he commits with Cecilia in the library would have been a crime in 1935 though it is not to modern readers), and he is accused by the pillars of society. Perhaps the blue-collar men are reliable and loyal--the constable, the servants, the soldiers. They also have to jump when the rich say jump (make a roast on the hottest day of the year, die in the war, etc.).I'm also not convinced of some plot elements: Wouldn't Cecilia make some argument as to Robbie's innocence--wouldn't it be heard by someone--or is her testimony nullified by her indecent acts in the library, acts I'm not sure are fully revealed? Couldn't she appeal to the sister who wanted to protect her--do they never talk after that night? Would Lola marry Marshall (I can't give 20-year-old Lola the same inability to distinguish between maniac and lover that I can allow in 13-year-old Briony)? Would Marshall seek a legitimate relationship with Lola? How can the lifelong prosperity of the Marshalls, shown by Briony in the final section, have had its beginnings in the violent, hateful acts we witness in 1935 (rape is not an act of sex, it is an act of violence)? Would Jackson and Pierrot be close, life-long family members of Briony, while their sister Lola is estranged from Briony? I feel including Jackson and his descendants in the final birthday party for Briony is a convenient plot element, but not believable.",21,-0.9894,0.137,0.764,0.099,0.6509163059163059,POSITIVE,0.9935

""It was common enough, to see so much death and want a child.""

We each live in our own world - and worlds of children are so far simpler than those of grown-ups; the friction between these worlds allows chances for misunderstandings. McEwan, who seems to have a thing for misunderstandings, banks on them for the beautiful story.The number of coincidences in the first part could have looked objectionable in hands of some other author. Robbie suddenly finds his life thrown off the track and is made to bear punishment for a crime he never did - that must be how most of Europe have felt during second world war.A child's innocent mistake destroys future of a young man. But scratch the surface there - was she as innocent as she claimed? Or was there malice, at least at subconscious level? She repents as she realizes her mistake, but the wrong done can never be corrected fully. It is so far easier to wrong than to correct:

""A person is, among all else, a material thing, easily torn and not easily mended.""
The guilt will never die - it is always there eating into one's heart. She turns her whole life into an atonement - but even that is not enough. Her victims won't forgive her, and why should they? Her suffering doesn't redeem theirs. Whether or not it was an innocent mistake, whether or not she was a child, whether or not she repented - the forgiveness was ou of question.
""It was not reasonable or just to hate Briony, but it helped.""
And so, what else is one to do with guilt? Suffering souls yearn for expression - as if that is all it needs to cure its suffering. But even assuming that was true, confessing one's guilt is something too difficult - Even if we intend to be honest, all we seem to manage are a few honest lies. All art, arising out of guilt, must thus, by definition, suffer inadequacy:
""How can a novelist achieve atonement when, with her absolute power of deciding outcomes, she is also God? There is no one, no entity or higher form that she can appeal to, or be reconciled with, or that can forgive her. There is nothing outside her. In her imagination she has set the limits and the terms. No atonement for God, or novelists, even if they are atheists. It was always an impossible task, and that was precisely the point. The attempt was all.""
- That kind of sums up why 'The Sense of an Ending' might have appeared so incomplete (to me at least)..The prose is incredibly rich. There are very few writers who can build the psychology of characters so perfectly. McEwan didn't impress me with 'Amsterdam' - mostly because its story seemed too forced, its a good thing I didn't go along with my worse judgment.
""She turned her face into the pillow and let her tears drain into it, and felt that yet more was lost, when there was no witness to her sorrow.""

79,1306053431,06/12/2015,4.0,"Well, that was depressing. Is Ian McEwan the natural successor to  Thomas Hardy? I have to confess I knew nothing about Atonement except that the film adaptation came out a few years ago (if eight qualifies as a few). It did receive glowing reviews but did not pique my interest much, I filed it away in my head as “may be if it comes on telly”. However, I literally* stumbled on the audiobook on Youtube and decided to give it a listen (in numerous sessions as it is almost 6 hours long). The audiobook is beautifully narrated by Isla Blair but it almost ruined the original book due to lack of chapters and parts indications that you get in most audiobooks. What this means is that it is read in one massive narrative lump without any clear divisions to indicate changes of scene, time periods, or switches in narrative points of view. These things can be figured out but it makes for a messy narrative, I will have to buy the printed book for a reread later. (The print version is clearly organized into chapters and major parts. I checked).Any way, enough of the story filtered through to me to become intrigued. Here is a story about Briony, a thirteen year old girl who wrongly accused a man of raping her cousin, leading to his arrest and several years of imprisonment. As she grows into adulthood it begins to dawn on her that she may have been mistaken, by the age of eighteen she wants to actively set things right. Thanks to the confusing audiobook (dis)organization the story did not have much as an impact on me as it should have done. I was not able to empathize with the characters as I would need to do in order for the story to resonate. This is not Ian McEwan’s fault, the book is superbly written and the characters well drawn, it is more like a technical problem caused by the audiobook. Six hours seem like a long running time compared to movies but the book is 351 pages long and it would take me at least a week to read (allowing time for getting on with my life). Consequently I felt the book whizzed by me and I was just getting into end when it ends! Still, I did find the storyline to be intriguing and book emotionally charged, especially in a poignant confrontation scene between the adult Briony and the wrongfully imprisoned Robbie Turner. Though I do find it a bit odd that a thirteen year old girl’s accusation carries so much weight given that the evidence against the man seems to be very circumstantial. The epilogue is quite the twist, very well played by McEwan. Had me reeling a little bit. So a great story somewhat spoiled (for me) by the confusing audiobook structure (not Ms. Isla Blair’s fault I suspect). In all fairness I would rate it as follows:4 stars for the book (could be 5 after a proper reread).2 stars for the audiobook (they removed book's structure of chapters and parts).5 stars for Isla Blair’s reading._________________________________* I was seated at the time.",20,-0.5023,0.1,0.804,0.096,0.4229662698412698,NEGATIVE,1.0

That part, I loved. I wasn't as keen on the latter third or so of Part One (too much prolepsis is nobody's friend), and Part Two thus far is slow going--which is surprising, as it's the WWII part! But it's early yet.""Despite being a perfectly good portrayal of men at war and of a dramatic historical moment (the evacuation from Dunkirk) that's mostly overlooked by historical fiction, Part Two never did manage to impress me. Mostly, I think we weren't given enough emotional insight into Robbie in Part One, so being dropped into war-torn Europe with him in Part Two was no more than abstractly affecting. I also couldn't tell how much of the ""mystery"" from Part One was supposed to be telegraphed, but there were no surprises for me in the final revelations.That said, I loved the Tallis women, and was particularly impressed by McEwan's insights into what it means to be a woman; see Briony's wry observation in the closing section about the veteran colonel who resents the feminine presumption of writing about war. Overall, Part Three was by far the most compelling as a narrative, and after a lot of vacillating, I was finally sold on the book by the final section, where all its slightly precious metafictive devices were finally justified. For some reason, McEwan writing about Briony writing about Briony learning to write (i.e., her insight while watching the fountain scene) just felt self-indulgent. But when the last level settled into place--McEwan writing about Briony writing about Briony writing about Briony learning to write--I got interested in what he was saying. I don't know how that works.Moreover, what could have felt pat and cynical in that final section (the author's deceptions and conflations, the rewritten happy ending, the dreaded first-person flash-forward to The Present) was actually quite moving and smart.

“A person is, among all else, a material thing, easily torn and not easily mended.” 


This is a  pretty well-loved novel, funny story I was about to leave it when I first saw it in a thrift shop but the cover of that sad girl sitting on the stairs in black & white compelled me. When I looked up the reviews I found it was pretty popular & it also had a movie adaptation featuring Keira Knightley...

I decided to check it out and literally everyone in Goodreads told me it was fantastic but being a love story kind of put me off so I had lowered my expectations going in... I liked it for the most part but I found some problems along the way.


The story follows three characters, Briony (an 11-year-old with a wild expressive  imagination & a flare for drama which she channels through plays) Cecilia (Her Older sister who is basically bored with life and craves adventure) Robbie Turner ( A hard-working young lad who loves education and always improving himself by taking up new challenges). One Summer day, Briony sees something transpire between Cecilia & Robbie that changes her perspective and ruins literally everything, that is basically the backbone of the book :)





        “The cost of oblivious daydreaming was always this moment of return, the realignment with what had been before and now seemed a little worse. ”
      


Firstly Ian McEwan can write like no one I have ever encountered, his prose was elegant and his imagery was crisp :) I was surprised that this was published in the 2000s, it read like a regency era book, I had this feeling of sipping tea while flipping the pages in my classy suit...






“Wasn't writing a kind of soaring, an achievable form of flight, of fancy, of the imagination?”


He also managed to capture the 1930s era beautifully and I was engrossed in the atmosphere in the book as I followed the characters. The themes ushered in throughout the book were also well developed from showcasing the innocence & end of childhood, to the importance and side-effects of imagination, the effect of war, family dynamics, self-discovery, mental illness and so much more. He is really talented & I will definitely check out his other books but this one didn't really live up to my standards sadly





“It was not generally realized that what children mostly wanted was to be left alone.”


The problems started out at Part Two of the book, I found the change of scenery a bit lackluster.  I wanted more of Part One, the whole war scene was boring to me and it took me a long time to get over it because I needed answers and the answers were taking too long. I also found myself detached from the characters, the only character I relatively had strong feelings towards was Briony but the rest felt like cardboard cutouts. It funny though because the author gets the reader into their deepest thoughts but I still felt 'meh' towards them.

I was up & down with this one but honestly, I would recommend it for the writing style. Some people really adore this book and I can see why but for me it was pretty average.Thanks for Reading Guys :)link: MY BLOG

87,2746480123,06/06/2019,5.0,"There are fantastic stories and there are fantastic writers. I think not every book is made of either of these components. And presumably it doesn't need to, because some plots are so great that they speak for themselves. Again, other works shine with a precise and grandiose use of language, so the actual story doesn't have to be so extraordinary to sweep the reader along.For me, Ian McEwan's Atonement is one of the novels that can do both.I could write you down a brief summary here, tell you about the tragic love between Cecilia and Robbie, of Briony, whose young age and unbridled imagination affects the course of so many stories before and during World War II.But for me, Atonement is a novel that shows me the high quality and linguistic intricacies with which a novel can be written. Not for nothing was the novel described by the #TIME as a ""deep psychological masterpiece,"" because the images that ran through my head while reading, in black and white, befitting the grim current events, didn't make me let go of the book even once.The introspective approach of an emerging writer such as Briony made me fall in love with the process of becoming a writer. Questioning one's actions is one of the messages I took from this book. Just as the motivation and inspiration to continue to improve my own writing skills. I could never write at a McEwan level today, but who knows... maybe in some 40 years perhaps.",18,0.9139,0.031,0.876,0.093,0.5448222222222221,POSITIVE,0.9997

90,477121418,12/13/2012,5.0," “Find you, love you, marry you, and live without shame.”  McEwan is a genius. The writing is poetic and penetrating. He pays attention to the small details, but not in a tiresome way and he's obviously a master in describing his characters' personality, emotions and inner demons. This book is not for everyone and I understand why some won't like it. The twist at the end is painful, but if anyone starts reading a book with the name  Atonement  expecting some bubbly love story, then they should be more careful in choosing books. One more thing - it's not a story about Robbie and Cecilia, it's all about Briony. The book is divided into 4 parts. The first part tells us about the last summer in 1935 where Tallis family is still united and Robbie Turner is still a mentee of a head of the family. There is some chemistry between Robbie and Cecilia, observed under the watchful eye of Briony, Cecilia's younger sister. The family idyll is ruined when Briony makes a mistake in the assessment. Mistake, that she will regret her whole life. The second part lets us see World War II from Robbie's point of view. McEwan did his homework impressively. I'm not exaggerating when I say I really felt like I was  there  with him. Soldiers form fragile, but loyal friendships despite their ranks and conflicts. Sometimes, appalling changes in soldier's mind are so destructive that some of them don't come home because of a hand of their own ""brothers"". In the third part, we see that Briony is not the same person. She wants to be a nurse and she's really persistent. I think that life as a nurse in war is just as stressful as being a soldier in a war. You can die or be scarred for life either way. This part is definitely my favorite. I love the conflict of emotions Briony gives me and I love how she and other young girl were so brave in dealing with hurting soldiers. ""London 1999"" serves as an epilogue. This is where most people decide if they like the book or not. It's hard not to sympathize with Briony because she tried to earn her atonement the best way she could. It may not necessarily be the best way in general. But who knows what would be enough? She destroyed lives because she was an immature and self-obsessed little girl who paid for her mistakes her entire life. As I said before, Briony is our protagonist. She's vexatious, strenuous, tends to put her nose where it doesn't belong and thinks the sun revolves around her. She sees the world in black and white and thinks she can't be wrong. She's all about writing her plays and often mistakes people around her to be characters in her silly stories. She's flat and deserves some good bitch-slapping. But then Briony grows up. Guilt keeps eating her up. She still is self-centered, but now she's trying to direct her flaws into helping people and seeking atonement. She feels deeply now, she's durable, handy and actually sees that world as it is, not as she wants it to be. I don't think she chose to be a nurse in such hard times just to punish her self. Instead, I think it was her own way of breaking all attachments with the old life in which she wasn't the best person in the world. I don't know if I believe that people can truly change, but Briony gives me hope that it might be the case. Robbie was a kind, smart, charismatic and decent man with a bright future ahead of him. He was a bit pretentious, but he deserved to be. Everyone loved him and those who tried to provoke him never succeeded. He never let his temper get the best of him and he always found a way to defuse the tension. Maybe, that's why he was the easy target. Most of his good side hidden in war. I won't say lost because I like to believe his good nature was above everything. In war, he became easily annoyed and waiting for the right moment to release his aggressive side of a leash. Nevertheless, he was still a hero. No matter the state of a mind, he would always jump to save the innocents and his fellow soldiers. More than anything he wanted to come back to Cecilia, but first he had to finish his call of duty. I guess Cecilia was a role model for Briony, at least when she was all grown up. Cecilia craved for independence, change and to actually live instead of just surviving. She wanted to run away but she couldn't find the courage to leave her parents' home. The one thing that was keeping her there was Robbie. For a while, she couldn't comprehend who she wants to be, but in the end, he helped her find her identity. Cecilia was warm, resourceful, friendly and insecure - like when she changed her outfit a million times for one, not very elegant dinner. She was always seeking for her purpose in life. I hope she found at least part of it as a nurse. The only memorable and meaningful relationship is between Cecilia and Robbie. The circumstances weren't in their favor, but they never gave up. They loved each other completely. She gave him the strength to hold on while he did what he had to do and he gave her independence, identity, and self-confidence. I wouldn't really call their story tragic, because eventually, they found their way to each other, one way or another. They were each other's first love and last. It may sound cheesy or unrealistic, but the way the author presented them, I see nothing more than perfection in them. In a way, it is a book about a love story, but it's more how Robbie and Cecilia gave each other reason to stay alive in such dark times.  “It wasn't only wickedness and scheming that made people unhappy, it was confusion and misunderstanding; above all, it was the failure to grasp the simple truth that other people are as real as you.”  I guess this is one of the hardest lessons to learn while growing up. Because of this, Briony made one mistake that she could never be able to fix. I wonder how many times I've made the same mistake without even realizing it. Yes, Briony was a little girl, but her actions wrecked a family dynamic.   ""He knew these last lines by heart and mouthed them now in the darkness. My reason for life. Not living, but life. That was the touch. And she was his reason for life, and why he must survive.”  Don't even let me start on this one. If your heart doesn't break after this one, then you're cruel.  “Come back, come back to me.”  The most important line in the whole book. It holds so much symbolism of their relationship.  “One could drown in irrelevance.”  Part of me wishes Briony did drown in irrelevance and oblivion. But the other part of me knows it would be too harsh.  ""In Leon's account of his life, no-one was mean-spirited, no-one schemed or lied or betrayed; everyone was celebrated at least in some degree... Leon turned out to be a spineless, grinning idiot.""  I suppose Leon was the most important person in Cecilia's life and her rock. Probably that's why his betrayal hurt the most.  ""Finally he spoke the three simple words that no amount of bad art or bad faith can ever quite cheapen. She repeated them, with exactly the same emphasis on the second word, as if she had been the one to say them first. He had no religious belief, but it was impossible not to think of an invisible presence or witness in the room, and that these words spoken aloud were like signatures on an unseen contract.""  I'll just leave it here.  ""Nothing in her life was sufficiently interesting or shameful to merit hiding; no one knew about the squirrel's skull beneath her bed, but no one wanted to know.”  The reason why Briony was so narrow-minded was her mother holding her in golden cage and keeping her distance at the same time. Unlike Cecilia, Leon and Robbie, Briony didn't hang out a lot with her coevals.  ”And only in a story could you enter these different minds and show how you enter these different minds and show how they had an equal value. That was the only moral a story need have.”  Such beautiful line.  “Every now and then, quite unintentionally, someone taught you something about yourself.”  This is true. At least, I like to believe it's true about all my ruined friendships and relationships. (view spoiler)[ I still can't believe Lola married her rapist. No one will convince me she didn't know. Of course she knew it was Paul. I don't feel sorry for the girl at all. She was tricky, I find it hard to believe sge was forced into that marriage. Can we talk about the flashback with Briony and Robbie? It was so disturbing and adorable at the same time. She consciously put her life in his hands just so she could express her childish love for him. I don't know what happened to her in just three years. She was peculiar, but obviously a sweet kid. Despite the fact that Briony ""wrote"" all of this, I choose to believe that her presentation of Robbie and Cecilia is genuine, both their personalities and love for each other. And for Briony, I think the book is her one unique way of getting some redemption.  (hide spoiler)] Check out my blog! ",17,0.9341,0.138,0.717,0.146,0.5247870107420669,POSITIVE,0.999
91,1201783010,02/15/2015,5.0,"Rereading after about 13 years; yes it is as good as I remembered, though my memory turns out to be a mish-mash of scenes from the film and only half-remembered details - I had the same shiver seeing the sign-off “BT, 1999” at the end of the third part as I did the first time I read this.The first half of the book reveals McEwan’s uncanny ability to create tension from unexceptional surroundings, where the events of a single day are described in claustrophobic and oppressive detail. Briony Tallis, a 13-year-old who imagines herself entering adulthood, witnesses an incident between her older sister Cecilia and Robbie, who was raised with the family, that arouses her interest; she reads a letter that Robbie asks her to take to Cecilia and proceeds to misinterpret and misunderstand most of what she later sees. It also colours how she reacts to an incident that her cousin Lola relates to her, and when she tells Lola about what she’d seen they both agree that Robbie must be a “sexual monster.” Later that evening, when she encounters Lola after she’s been attacked, the day’s events leads her to her fateful accusation. The developing bond between Robbie and Cecilia is revealed through their own versions of the day; where Cecilia was also looking forward to a reunion with her brother Jack, who had brought along his rather creepy friend Paul, a man whom Cecilia“contemplated how deliciously self-destructive it would be, almost erotic, to be married to a man so nearly handsome, so hugely rich, so unfathomably stupid.”Briony’s mother Emily provides another commentary; she’s incapacitated by migraines, hears everything going on in the house but can only interpret the sounds according to what she’s familiar with. As in many of McEwan’s novels, there is a ghastly inevitability to each of the steps, ending with Briony watching, in the small hours of the next morning, as Robbie is driven away.That day is followed by two searing chapters set in WW2, about five years later. One is Robbie’s story, he is part of the British forces evacuated at Dunkirk and badly wounded – there is an implication that he barely made it back to England; the other is Briony’s experience as a probationary nurse. It ends with an explosive meeting between her, Cecilia and Robbie, where she attempts to atone for her accusation. Towards the end though there is the first hint (at least, the first I found) that the fabric of the story isn’t all that it seems: “Perhaps this was the first step in the undoing of [Briony’s] plans, but she was already walking back, retracing her steps.” But what sets Atonement apart is the final chapter, Briony’s first-person monologue on her 77th birthday in 1999, and the discovery that the book is the last of her many attempts to set down what “really” happened after her accusation. She admits that she was unable to write that Cecilia and Robbie had died during WW2 without managing to meet again. There is a nice symmetry here, where it ends as did the first day, at 5am the following morning, with the cryptic suggestion that there might be another version where Cecilia and Robbie were “still alive, still in love” at her birthday celebration. This is brilliant writing and I loved the ambiguity woven through these voices.",18,0.9462,0.041,0.889,0.069,0.4670557111733581,POSITIVE,0.787

In a confused state of mind, wavering between reality and imagination, she plays a dangerous game of malice under the guise of sisterly love committing a grave crime against an innocent man; and she lives her adult life trying to atone for her crime.It was an interesting story and the nagging question was why a story I loved to watch was utterly boring to read? Only towards the end of the book that I really understood what the cause was. It was McEwan's too much dwelling on the incidental matters rather than on the main story line. Too much space had been devoted to detailed description of the brutality of World War II and Briony's life as a trainee nurse during the war. These are relevant to the story of course, but the too detailed devotion to these incidental topics disturbed the flow of the main story.

Yeah, I felt that with  Atonement.Once upon a time, there lived a thirteen-year-old girl named Briony Tallis who wished to be a writer someday. While she is working on The Trial of Arabella, she is sent as a messenger to hand over a letter to her sister. On her way, she opens and reads the letter which changes her life forever. THE END.Oh, I forgot to mention that the book was written by  Ian McEwan. Need I say more? So, yes there is more to the story.  McEwan totally blew me with his splendid writing skills. My fondness for historical fiction is growing day by day. He did a commendable job in portraying how a thirteen-year-old girl's mind works. Briony is innocent. She thinks she knows the difference between right and wrong. As she grows up she slowly develops an understanding of her misinterpretations as a child. 
'The problem these fifty-nine years has been this: how can a novelist achieve atonement when, with her absolute power of deciding outcomes, she is also God? There is no one, no entity or higher form that she can appeal to, or be reconciled with, or that can forgive her. There is nothing outside her. In her imagination she has set the limits and terms. No atonement for God, or novelists, even if they are atheists. It was always an impossible task, and that was precisely the point. The attempt was all. '
Written from the third person's POV, there are three parts to the story. Part one dealt more with the detailed interior lives of the members of the family. Part two and three talked about the aftermath and involved more on the World War II side. I felt so emotionally connected to the MC. She is lamenting over her fault. It's so heartbreaking to see what guilt can do to a person.  McEwan gave an emotional experience of watching a character grow and develop. The writing was flawless. The only issue I could notice was that it moved really slow for the first part. But, I guess that build-up was needed for the richness in the latter half of the story. I immediately went and watched the movie adaptation of Atonement and I must say I liked it. This is my first book by  McEwan and I'm sure I'll seek out others by him.

Her hands hover over the keyboard, and she wills them to move, to begin typing out a review of Ian McEwan's novel Atonement, but they do not. She understands, of course, that willing her hands to move and making them move are two entirely different things, that in fact the thinking about the one is preventing her from accomplishing the other. And yet she doesn't quite know where to begin, what to say.How can she best express her profound admiration for McEwan's gift of more fully putting the reader into the minds of his characters than perhaps any other writer she has read? In fact, there were many times throughout her reading of the book where McEwan captured the inner workings of a character with such precision that Carolyn thought to herself, ""Why, yes, that's it exactly. That's exactly what would happen inside me if I were this character, in this situation, and yet never could I articulate it myself."" And what generosity of spirit McEwan demonstrates, that even the young person whose transgressions against the truth put the most crucial events of the story into motion and have such terrible consequences, is presented in such a way that, although we may despise what she does, we come to understand her so well. In truth, Carolyn, who was also given to trust in the conspiracies of her heart and her imagination as a child, saw some of herself in this character.And oh, the structure, with its powerful final pages, surprising us and making this story so much more than it was already. Carolyn longs to say more about these final pages, but she is reluctant to do so, for fear of spoiling the novel's impact for others. And yet, for all this, Carolyn cannot deny that there were sections in the book that did not fully captivate her. Surely such a revelation says more about her than about the book, for there is no denying that Atonement is a tremendous literary achievement. At times perhaps, to Carolyn, the narrator's description of the events and the internal lives of the characters was, perhaps, too precise, if such a thing can be possible...it felt a bit removed and clinical, coolly observing and reporting on the events from a safe remove.She sits there still, trying to best determine how to express all this. Simply clicking the mouse to assign the book four out of five stars is so inadequate as to be almost comical, when thinking of such a rich, complex and wonderful book as Atonement.

The book is split into 3 distinct parts with a final denouement at the end that ties them all together. The 1st part plays out on a country estate where Cecilia, the wealthy daughter of the estate owners, finds hersrlf attracted to Robbie, the son of their charwoman. However, her relationship with Robbie is misinterpreted by Cecilia's younger sister, Briony, which leads to tragedy. With the emphasis of class distinctions and upper class hypocrisy, this section is very reminiscent of Jane Austen and the book, in fact, opens with a quote from Jane Austen's Northanger Abbey. McEwan is an excellent writer and the scenes between the lovers are charged with eroticism and longing:“Now and then, an inch below the water's surface, the muscles of his stomach tightened involuntarily as he recalled another detail. A drop of water on her upper arm. Wet. An embroidered flower, a simple daisy, sewn between the cups of her bra. Her breasts wide apart and small. On her back, a mole half covered by a strap. When she climbed out of the pond a glimpse of the triangular darkness her knickers were supposed to conceal. Wet. He saw it, he made himself see it again. The way her pelvic bones stretched the material clear of the skin, the deep curve of her waist, her startling whiteness. When she reached for her skirt, a carelessly raised foot revealed a patch of soil on each pad of her sweetly diminished toes. Another mole the size of a farthing on her thigh and something purplish on her calf--a strawberry mark, a scar. Not blemishes. Adornments.”The 2nd part of the book is a war novel where Robbie finds himself in the middle of the British Army's rout in France and it's frantic withdrawl to Dunkirk at the start of WWII. The horrors of war are well described in this section and Robbie keeps going for one reason only: Cecilia's promise that she would wait for him:""I'll wait for you was elemental. It was the reason he had survived. It was the ordinary way of saying she would refuse all other men. Only you. Come back.""The final section is a coming of age story and deals with Briony's attempt to atone for her guilt by volunteering at a hospital. McEwan does a excellent job in this section of writing a historical novel about life in England at the start of the war. The fear of a German invasion is palpable and blackout curtains and bomb shelters become a way of life.McEwan takes his time setting up the plot and he carefully describes each of the main characters, especially Briony, at the start of the novel. You get a real feel for their personalities and desires and this helps give gravitas to the tragic events that play out. I did watch the movie version several years ago and, surprisingly, this didn't ruin the book for me. To some extent, it actually made the novel better since all the events had an undercurrent of sadness to them as I read. I'm a romantic and a sucker for well written love stories: ""Nothing as singular or as important had happened since the day of his birth. She returned his gaze, struck by the sense of her own transformation, and overwhelmed by the beauty in a face which a lifetime's habit had taught her to ignore. She whispered his name with the deliberation of a child trying out the distinct sounds. When he replied with her name, it sounded like a new word - the syllables remained the same, the meaning was different. Finally he spoke the three simple words that no amount of bad art or bad faith can ever quite cheapen. She repeated them, with exactly the same emphasis on the second word, as if she had been the one to say them first. He had no religious belief, but it was impossible not to think of an invisible presence or witness in the room, and that these words spoken aloud were like signatures on an unseen contract” ",14,0.8759,0.066,0.844,0.09,0.4730422562512115,POSITIVE,0.9997

So why not read the book? Naturally, I expected this would be a 5-star read for me as it ticked all the marks. Right? Wrong! The story itself is gripping and the characters are solid with unique characteristics but unfortunately, this did not work for me because of the writing style. For some reason, I couldn't connect with Ian McEwan's writing style. I really tried hard. No matter what I did there was always this big wall that prevented me from enjoying the book. I pushed myself hard to finish it. If it was not for the other books I was reading at the same time this would have thrown me in a reading slump. I went into it knowing the story and appreciating it, if this was not the case I might've DNFed it. This is a beloved book and many of my friends love it. There are things that I appreciate about this novel like the setting of the story, the three main characters (Especially Briony), and the overall concept but many times it felt just too slow and dragging. In simple words, boring!I think the twist in the end, is what provides a shock factor mainly to readers reading the book for the first time but once you watch the film that novelty is gone and all you will focus on is how the story is narrated and written. This is still a good book and if it didn't bore the hell out of you then I guess you might end up liking it. I wish the writing was a bit more focused and less pretentious. In my opinion, this is one of the rare cases where the movie adaptation is a lot better than the actual book.",17,0.9946,0.05,0.758,0.192,0.4876447876447877,NEGATIVE,1.0

It reminded me of my childhood, raised as a daughter of a hyperactive and workaholic journalist, the sound of typewriting machine was the sound that I was constantly surrounded with. Plus, I had something of Briony in my personality. Book wonder, and sneaking upon my older sister. So I saw the movie, and because I didn’t have any clue what to expect, I cried for the next few days. Atonement is the first book that made a huge impact in my twenties. I decided to read it because, I thought, no, honestly, if a movie is really that great, is it possible for a book to be even better? Correct. Most of the time during reading, I was utterly envious. I couldn’t believe that somebody – McEwan, actually had all those words in his vocabulary. He was talking about Briony and her aggressive attitude toward nettles for 20 pages – what a fantastic psychological mind game. And during those pages, I was biting my nails because my brain just couldn’t cope with his eloquence. His symbols, sexual connotations, guilt as a wild angry animal that will torment you till the end – everything about this book is connected with human psyche and rotation consequences. I know that Briony is just a kid, inspecting her childhood years on the edge crossing into adulthood, while dark and humming sounds of sexual deviations are coming to the surface during lazy summer nights, but at one point I just wanted to slap her. Mind your own business you spoiled and stupid child! But I understand her. Perspectives change as everybody in this book inevitably change.

The character development was lacking for me as I never really felt attached to any of the characters in any way.

3.5/5 Stars
This turned out to be a pretty solid read!So, this book and I have a complicated relationship. I almost DNF'd this book at the halfway point because it was so boring. But thank god I pushed through because the second half of this was amazing!This book is definitely not without its flaws. So I'll start out with what I didn't like about it. First and foremost, I think this book suffered from some pacing issues, especially in the first half. The first half of this book takes place in only one day. That's right, ONE day! I feel like McEwan could've easily taken out at least a good 50-75 pages of Part 1 and make it more interesting. Another big critique I have is that this book is incredibly narrative heavy. McEwan definitely loves his descriptions. For some reason, he didn't include a lot of the dialogue or conversations that were implied throughout the story. He just would say, ""And then they talked about this."" Which I guess can work in instances where the characters have already talked about a topic previously, but it seemed like it happened A LOT. There was just not enough dialogue!What I will say though is that McEwan does have beautiful prose. Like I said earlier, he loves his descriptions, very similar to Tolkien. And sometimes it worked exceptionally, like in Part 2 where he describes characters that are experiencing the horror of World War 2. Going off that point, I will also say that the main reason why I didn't DNF this book earlier is because McEwan painted such vivid characters that I would've felt guilty leaving them behind. Yes, the first half of this book did nothing for me, but the characters are what I loved to read about. And once you get to the end of the book, you'll then realize how impactful and alive they are. So, I'm rating this a 3.5 Stars mainly because I really did not like the first half, but then really enjoyed the last half (and loved the characters), so I'm putting my rating slightly above average.I'm going to quickly address some spoilers so I'm gunna section this part off. (view spoiler)[ Okay, so at the end of Part 1, Lola is sexually assaulted by a man, but it's not clear who. Briony, who sees the man run off, immediately says that it's Robbie because she thinks he's a maniac. Even though Briony is only 13 years old, this accusation just frustrated me! We all knew it was Paul Marshall who did it because he was being super creepy to Lola before. So it wasn't surprising when it was revealed that it was in fact Paul who did it. And then seeing them get married afterward just made me even more angry and I wanted to just punch Paul square in the face! Ughh, okay rant over (hide spoiler)].I feel like this book would be better upon second read, so I think I might hold onto it for the time being. Also, apologies for this kind ""rambley"" review. This book has just put me through it.I would still recommend this book to people who are still interested in it. It definitely is an experience. I'm not sure if I'm going to read McEwan's other novels or not. They're very popular and have won a lot of awards, but I'm still kind of skeptical about them. If anyone has read more McEwan, let me know if they're worth it!",14,0.987,0.105,0.743,0.152,0.5227058201058199,NEGATIVE,0.6238
114,1135873373,12/19/2014,5.0,"I am again reviewing a book that I wanted to give one star at completing the reading, but at second, third, and fourth think, not. (I desperately want a gif which blinks back and forth between one star and five stars.)Right at this minute I am feeling like Star War’s Darth Vadar - not, as I had hoped when I finished this book, after he became a redeemed ghost, forgiven by his noble son, his crimes against humanity, and others, about to be forgotten also because they had become null and void through Vadar’s embrace of love/family/democracy in a final atonement, as well as by being forgiven (although the unredeemed monster was predictably embraced by admiring boys all over the world, thrilled by the dark power of his destructive evil); but instead I feel like Vadar apparently did when the limbs of his body were burning away, with the understanding he had been betrayed by the universe and his own volatile emotions, lured willingly and completely into the dark side of ‘The Force’ by his need for revenge and overwhelmed by rage. ‘Atonement’ left me full of rage. I hate the author (fictional and real), I hate the ending chapter of 1999, and I hate both little Briony Tallis and rich Paul Marshall most of all.This popular book, and a subsequent movie, and at least 12,000 reviews written on GR alone, attest to its greatness as a literary ‘tour de force’, reaching into all sectors of culture. There have been multiple literary nominations and awards awarded. Love it or hate it, I guarantee the hundreds of little daily truths and big themes exposed by the characters will echo inside of every reader of the book, to return again and again into the mind as the story’s timeless themes reoccur in some shape, hopefully with far less import or destructiveness, in everyone’s real lives. The issues regarding jealousy, economic class, guilt, lies, injustice and forgiveness are powerfully investigated. If the common ills of human relationships don’t grab you, then perhaps the beautiful sentences and phrases will have you in ecstasy as you encounter them, chapter by chapter, paragraph by paragraph.The main body of the novel deserves every accolade, emotional tear or rave which most readers have bestowed on the book. If you, gentle reader, feel curious enough to pick up the book because of everything you have heard about it, I encourage you to do so. It is a possible classic, (view spoiler)[and extremely amazing in its exploration of the circumstances surrounding a malicious lie told by a young immature spoiled 13-year-old rich girl of 1935 England which destroys a young man, Robbie Turner, highly educated and showing great promise, but whose status as the son of a poor cook determines the outcome of his trial for rape. (hide spoiler)] and the novel is full of tone-perfect psychological insight and nuance. Every character breathes with life and realistic depth. The author allows his personas to go to their obvious fates according to where their education, prejudices, failings and choices take them. The Tallis family, Turner, Marshall and Lola are exactly as they should be.WWII interrupts every aspect of English society, along with directing the fate of some of the book’s characters, but unlike the usual tropes readers encounter in novels which explore the impact of war on the protagonists, I thought the author used the scenes of war to amplify the reader’s pain in an unsuspected literary manner. At least, it misled me! While the scenes of the Dunkirk ‘evacuation’ are dreadfully perfectly and realistically portrayed, by the end of the book I felt emotionally tricked, thus part of my rage. (view spoiler)[ Perhaps my understanding that the scenes of empty, ultimately meaningless, self-righteousness behind the supposed purposes of war suffering are actually revealed at the end to be nothing more than pack animal survival and territoriality, and perhaps to also win the power to reshape meanings through rewriting of historical facts and memory by the victors of war, is correct. I saw, I hope correctly, how the emotions of those who fought the war on the ground were meant to mirror the tragedy which ensnared Robbie as a betrayed victim of England’s ruling class structure. But I also found myself becoming more than a little fond of Robbie, to my grief. Alas! (hide spoiler)]While the book builds slowly from tragedy to tragedy, it never gave me any reason to feel that I would be disappointed in finishing the novel. Either there would be a romantic, or, given my naturally depressed gothic nature, a satisfying bleak finish or sacrifice of some kind. However, instead there was a huge detour by the author(s) (view spoiler)[(doesn’t matter which author, whether it is the fictional Briony or the real McEwan). I DID NOT LIKE THIS TRICK OF AN ENDING! Grrrrr. I realize the ending mirrored the tragedy of Turner’s conviction(s, both meanings of which the author managed to reference), and the tragedy of the soldiers’ convictions in fighting the ‘good’ war, both parties operating under what turns out to be horrifically false convictions, but, HONESTLY? McEwan/Briony had to mess with MY conviction in what the ending was/should be? OUTRAGE!!!!! I’m full of self-righteous motivation in feeling complete justified in giving this one star! REALLY! Really? S/He had to remind me there was a writer writing? That there was a writer inventing fictional fiction? When I was so involved I forgot it WAS fiction while I was reading it?Damn it.I HATE this book! Literary writers at the top of their game are SO despicable.  (hide spoiler)]If you feel maybe you should read this book, I would add to your self-imposed pressure to do so by reluctantly recommending it. Of course, I do NOT think it is a crowd pleaser, given that I put it down at the last page considerably disgruntled, with my fur fluffed in resentment. If you have already read this book, do you suspect McEwan slyly dissed his readers, as I do (but with love)?",13,-0.9977,0.198,0.652,0.15,0.5060410410410411,NEGATIVE,0.5361
115,2891502416,08/09/2019,3.0,"Of course there is always something spellbinding and touching in a love that’s faithful enough it crosses boundaries of distance and surmounts the passing time. A love that endures, as one might say, is both a blessing and a curse for it doesn’t deter from any kind of struggle, however the affliction, and reunites with a soulful fervour. But when it’s weathered by insufferable theatrics it becomes almost a borderline melodramatic excess. Such is Atonement. Told in paragraphs much too beautiful it can be emotionally dismantling, it successfully distracts from its subtle mediocrity. For one, Atonement is almost irredeemable with its usage of rape as a cheap, underwhelming plot device. As if it is not disturbing enough that the victim and perpetrator reach the most appalling of conclusions, the others are too caught up in their own confusing snobbishness, selfishness, and tiring anguish to prevent it at all. What’s more surprising here is my utter indifference to Briony Tallis which near the end turned to sympathy then pity of some sort. I don’t believe she is completely and solely culpable. A child exposed to some kind of trauma can’t be fully held accountable for acting out of fear. Some of the characters’ decisions are absurd (looking at you, Cecilia Tallis) too. And without any relevant interactions to invest much on, Cecilia and Robbie’s love story gets diluted into that one lustful library encounter. And perhaps if some form of explanation to Briony was provided after, it’d have been entirely different. Nonetheless, the chapters about the second world war are the strongest in the novel as they capture, also mirror, a life-altering catastrophe which victimises everyone. Nobody goes out unscathed. A theme present throughout the book. Amidst some flaws and predictability, McEwan’s prose kept me tangled (and fairly satisfied) in its depressing mess.“A person is, among all else, a material thing, easily torn and not easily mended.” If there’s anything of genuine value here, it’s how we tend to forget that words can be both sharp and dull: they can alter a moment, injure those closest to us, and they become smoke when they have burnt a cellophane of emotions. That and it’s surely romantic to be made love to against a row of bookshelves (but mind the cunt-calling please).",13,-0.4559,0.144,0.725,0.131,0.572037037037037,POSITIVE,0.5554

The fact that the most interesting character was the least explored, or that the most interesting section of the book felt like only an interim between returning to the purple, self-indulgent, self-fellating """"""writer talk"""""" that McEwan so desperately wanted to get across.Okay, I'm being too harsh, but in fact reading what he put forward through Briony actually explains a lot as to why i distaste him as a writer. He talks so much in this novel about capturing a singluar moment, which to his credit he does, but in doing so he forgets about every other aspect of what brings a novel to life. It's like he's baking a loaf of bread with dead yeast. All the steps are done correctly, but nothing grows, nothing is living inside the dough of the story. It's all method and chemical reaction, no life. That is save for one character, Cecilia. her. She was the only character i liked. And what happened with her that we got to see first hand? Nothing. She was there as someone that people had letters from, or had arguments with. The utter WASTE of a brilliant character. Now i will admit, McEwan's atmospheres and setting were very good, but they just couldn't cover for the passivity of Briony or Robbie. For two characters who were so diametrically opposed to one another, they reacted to things in the same way. That is to say, passively.Would I recommend this book? Eh, yeah probably.

Most of it bored me, and I found the writing style to be incredibly convoluted and dense. To make matters worse, large portions of this novel felt completely inconsequential to me. Part 2 could be summarized as ""Robbie goes to war. War is bad,"" and part 3 as ""Briony does her job."" Why we needed 100+ pages of agonizing descriptions for each section is beyond me. The only part I even remotely enjoyed was part 1, and that was only because THINGS HAPPENED, things that were of actual consequence to the plot. (But that's not really saying much because the inciting incident of this novel was so ridiculously stupid I couldn't fathom how the characters could screw up so colossally.) So, to recap: part 1=okay, part 2=BORING, part 3=Mostly BORING. And then we get to the concluding section titled ""London 1999"" -- and what a horribly infuriating section it was.  The cherry on top of the boring, meandering cake that was this book.  Was the ending of this book A) Cheap, B) Gimmicky, or C) Manipulative? If you answered all of the above then DING DING DING WE HAVE A WINNER! This is what not to do when you want to end a story. I did not endure 371 pages of a glacially slow story for it to end like that. It felt like a violation of the reader's trust, and I certainly did not appreciate being thrown in for a loop like that. Onto the problematic aspects of this book. (view spoiler)[ First of all, and this is something many reviewers have pointed out, the story largely ignores Lola's rape. Atonement's biggest problem is that it gets so caught up in the injustice that Robbie's faced with that it completely disregards the main injustice of this whole conflict: someone got raped.Some pertinent points:#1: Don't get me wrong, Briony infuriated the hell out of me when she was so adamant on laying the blame on Robbie, but I also think that what she did kind of made sense. She got that creepy note from Robbie (it really was FREAKING CREEPY-- why couldn't he just keep that tidbit to himself ugh), thought he was attacking her sister, and then concluded that he raped Lola. Her conclusions were certainly faulty, but given the circumstances (creepy obscene letter, assault, rape), I think she was justified in being so distressed. #2: Briony eventually realizes that she'd falsely accused Robbie, and Cecilia knows that Robbie isn't the one who raped Lola, and yet both of them sit on that information for YEARS without doing a single thing to help. Briony freaking knows it was Paul Marshall but she does jackshit about it, and then when she's told that Lola is about to get married to her rapist she's all like woops ma bad sucks for her I guess. #3: Yes it's awful that Robbie went to jail for something he didn't do, but ALSO A 15-YEAR-OLD GIRL GOT RAPED SHOULDN'T WE MAYBE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT???? OR AT LEAST THINK ABOUT IT AT ALL??? (hide spoiler)]And don't even get me started on how much I disliked Briony. So selfish. So entitled. Though I may make it seem as if I passionately LOATHED this book, I didn't. It was mostly just boring, and then once I thought about it some more, problematic. To say that I passionately hated this book would mean that it made me feel something, which it didn't.  Which is I guess the crux of the matter when it comes to Atonement: it didn't elicit anything in me, and so it wasn't particularly memorable.",12,-0.9986,0.21,0.716,0.074,0.6239186507936508,NEGATIVE,1.0

Oh the rich children simply must get their play in order before Daddy Bertram comes home! Shut up. auaughghghsghsghhI doubt I'll ever like Austen --- but, as I read McEwan's skillful prose and watched his characters come ambiguously out of the woodwork, that ""the rich kids must get their play in order!"" trope became a little less personally offensive.I liked Atonement quite a lot. The moral questions at the core of the novel were well-constructed and left artfully open-ended, with just enough information to start the discussion but not enough for it to conclusively end. With a nod to my mom (who loves questions and battles of morality in fiction), that wasn't where I most responded --- what hit home for me was, as it often is, the construct of narrative. We question whether we do right or wrong, but we also question what is construct and what is real, and whether our perceptions and perspectives define the terms. That's where McEwan excelled, here -- at least in my perspective.I was, however, coming from a trail of books all centered on wealthy aristocratic families, and it was the wroooong time to read this book. While I can give it 3.5 stars for objective quality, I got bored of the excessive description and skimmed a great deal of it, perhaps to my readerly detriment, but ennnnh. I think I got the picture.

127,1356408290,05/15/2020,3.0,"A note to you, dear reader: This is not a review as much as it is a rant of sorts, a tirade I need to get out for the internet to float away. I am right there, right at the brink of understanding it, of getting McEwan, but still too dumb to quite grasp it. I know I'll think about this book for a long time, whether I gave it the right amount of stars or not, knowing that in the end, whenever there is a book I am so much conflicted with, I must a. read it again when I'm wiser in years and most importantly b. give it 3 stars because any book that makes me wonder about it so much is deserving of as much.Part 1The writing is very good, excellent even, but if you're not ready for a very detailed description of a young girl being moody you won't care about the writing. The words ""too drawn out"" describe this book the best. I don't like endless pages of descriptions if it doesn't lead anywhere or if they don't in some way add to the story. I liked it in the beginning but I read it at a wrong time in my life, I'm too depressed myself right now to read about other people's problems. I listened to it in audiobook format and feel it was easier to get through that way not having to concentrate intently. I know if I'd read the physical book right now I wouldn't have been able to pick it up every day. Too heavy. I let some parts just fly by like nothing.And I felt it was okay with this story, because it's not so much about all the little details of what things were in someone's room or what they're gonna wear...not that...not that...not that... It was more about the bigger picture of how they were all connected. (And that's one of it's flaws since there are whole heaps of things in rooms and what people want to wear and you have to make up the connections yourself ie. you have to be interested.)And it's boooooring!Blah blah blah Briony thinks this Blach blach blach Briony thinks that Blargh blargh blargh Briony thinks a lot!""She was the sort of girl who lived in her thoughts""Everyone says Briony was their favourite character.Mine, definitely not.Noooo nooo noooNoNo.I liked ""the mother"" Emily, ""the sister and love interest"" Cecilia and ""the victim"" Lola somewhat.Only when I read on (And on and on because this boring book seems to jade on forever) I realised I hated Briony because I was her.I used to be the sad little girl in my own world ""writing"" stuff and being very emotional if someone even slightly criticised me. I took it all very personally.I'd spend hours and hours by myself. I was the girl when we were on a family vacation and got robbed in the middle of the night wanted to be so much part of the whole thing that I lied and said I'd seen the burglar.Yep, that's me folks! And I was maybe ten.I kept falling in love with guys, especially in my teenage years if my friends liked someone I had to like him more ie. fall in love with him.There's something about being left out that you go to these horrendous lengths just to be included. And my god how pathetic is that??In Part 2, in terms of a war setting and a male perspective, it is way too sentimental for my taste! I know the point is to emphasize how in love Robbie was with Cecilia, I get it, but it just...it's this continuous inner monologue about the specific few moments he had touched her.And then it turns out Briony was in love with Robbie which explains e-ve-ry-thing! but does not excuse it. This revelation I might have missed in Part 1 but when it became clear in Part 2 it ""should have"" been a catalyst for action and conclusions, for revenges and for ... something! Instead it was just a statement among others and if you didn't pay attention you missed it too and it really didn't amount to anything. Again.Many people have questioned why was the book set in war times. My guess would be because Robbie happened. Maybe McEwan wanted to show that he went to war anyway, regardless of what happened, and died. So either/or the outcome was highly likely to be the same.Dead.Part 3He references Virginia Woolf's The Waves, a book I've tried to start twice this year and just can't. At this point it's clear to me I've made a mistake with this book but am too far gone already to dnf.Now, reading Atonement, it just rings like The Waves. This endless struggle to get into or through something. It's really a metaphor for me at this point. There is something about books with a solemn air, a melancholy, a mood that hangs over the whole writing, that require a melancholy time in my life to get through without struggle. Right now, it just takes too much out of me.To me McEwan is a bore and if he's one of these learned scholars who can ""only be appreciated"" if x equals y when n is 7, I can only conclude he's not my author.People criticise the lack of character development or really, there being any 3D characters in this book or any clear and really good character descriptions (because mainly all of them are left very distant to the reader and too little is told about them - someone pointed out very well that Cecilia is written in Part 1 being this very rebellious girl chain smoking and at the same time being an idle teenager with no direction, oh hell, just stay at the parent's mansion for lack of anything better to do, and theeeen! suddenly she's waiting for this one man and her life has come to a halt and nothing else matters and no one else will do - what?). But if you don't skip over the specific part in Part 3, you'll hear ""Briony"" think to herself how ""characters aren't needed in novels these days"" and what other nonsense. Come on Ian, mate! That's not you saying that, is it?! Come on, mate, admit it!It's like he is writing, in his own novel, why his novel is good. ""Weeell, you just forget about how important characters are and concentrate all your efforts on singular moments and man, a great book you write!""Meanwhile forgetting that someone has to read your drivel!!!For some godforsaken reason, he made a decision to write the book this way, describing only the exteriors and having these inner dialogues go on forever. This is what I'll need to learn in the following years to fully appreciate The Atonement: why it's ""higher writing"" and why it should be ""appreciated"". I don't care about these stupid characters, the plot, which there is none, none of the scenery in France or bed pans in a hospital ward. Why'd you write it like that, Ian, why? PostscriptThe Briony of Orange Is the New Black, Piper, spoilered this for me with her comment ""Everybody dies"" on the show a few years ago. And I'm still so so so glad they died and Briony didn't get her redemption.",11,-0.968,0.128,0.763,0.108,0.5050795712224285,NEGATIVE,0.9999
128,1922821373,02/23/2017,5.0,"Revisited for the 2019 Mookse Madness tournament.(view spoiler)[In the first part of the book set on a Summer’s Day (the gathering heat working as a metaphor for the growing feeling of irrevocable destiny that seems to haunt everyone’s actions as well as the country in light of growing re-armament) in 1935. Briony Tallis a 13 year old would-be author and her family (including sister Cecilia) are visited by their cousins the 15-year old Lola and two younger twins (all fleeing an impending divorce), as well as her older brother back from university with his chocolate magnate friend Paul Marshall. Briony starts by trying to produce a play but is thwarted firstly by the ineptitude of her younger cousins but ultimately by her own growing consciousness of the limits of her literal writing compared to the unfolding complexities of the adult world, which is in turn triggered by a confrontation she witnesses between Cecilia and Robbie Turner (the son of their cleaner, who was supported by Briony’s father through Cambridge). What she thinks was actually an assault on Robbie was in fact an awkward encounter between the two, who were childhood friends, avoided each other at Cambridge, misinterpret each other’s subsequent behaviour but now are growing to realise that there is something between them an awareness bough to fruition (and to an impromptu sexual encounter) by an obscene version of an apology letter than Robbie accidentally sends. This letter is sent via Briony and this, plus her walking in on their sex convinces her that Robbie is a maniac assaulting her sister. The twins go missing and while they are being searched for Briony comes across Lola apparently being assaulted and convinces herself (with Lola’s implicit acquiescence) and the police (with the aid of the letter) that she saw Robbie fleeing the scene. The second part of the book is Robbie’s thoughts as he takes part in the evacuation to Dunkirk, having secured early release from prison in exchange for serving as a private. Cee has become estranged from her family and waited for him – only for an early call-up to prevent them getting together but does write to him saying that Briony has had a sudden change of heart – giving up university to nurse (as Cee does) and hinting at a recantation of evidence. In this part of the book Robbie dwell son Briony’s motivation (which over years he has traced to an incident when he laughed at a childhood declaration of love from her – an incident we later find that she forgot as soon as it happened) and on his hatred of the gardener’s son – the obvious actual culprit. This section features a detailed account of the horrors and ignominy of the retreat. The third part is Briony at hospital – clearly trying to work out atonement and finding some form of it in the horrors of nursing the sick and dying of the evacuation. She also during this time receives a refusal from a literary magazine of a story she wrote around the fountain incident (and is told the story needs embellishing with a back story and the motivation of the participants and watcher). It becomes clear that the real culprit was in fact Marshall when Briony goes as a silent watcher to his marriage to Lola. She then, in an unconvincing ending visits Cee (and to her surprise Robbie) to offer her apology and agree to help fight his case – receiving if not forgiveness then some form of atonement in the retraction they ask her to write. A fourth postscript is set much later – with Briony an elderly author going to a birthday party with her family where the children act out the aborted play from 1935. During this piece it is clear she has just finished writing this book itself but cannot publish for fear of libel until the Marshall’s death (which she realises will be after hers). There is a growing sense of foreboding (or something not quite right) in this section and in a final twist she says that the real story was that both Robbie and Cecilia died (in Dunkirk and a bomb raid) and that there was no happy ending or atonement. (hide spoiler)]Extremely well written and with some deep themes. The book is on the surface about atonement and when revealing her “trick”, the elderly Briony bemoans how it is possible to achieve atonement via a novel as the novelist has no higher authority from which to obtain forgiveness and no outside agencies to be reconciled with. But the book is really about the meaning of fiction – how do we know that the “real” ending is real, what does real actually mean in a work of fiction, what is the meaning of the literary review of a different account of the incident without back story? Further the earlier parts of the book is principally about characters completely misunderstanding each other’s actions and motivations – if it is impossible to know what someone else is thinking and meaning then the whole idea of narrated multi-character fiction is a fraud.",12,-0.9737,0.112,0.783,0.105,0.3877139136904762,POSITIVE,0.7536
129,4020606951,05/25/2021,5.0,"If I had known the sheer poetry and whirlpools of emotions this story would bring upon, I would have read the book first. But somehow, watching its film adaptation brought in life the beauty which romanticises throughout the story, and thankfully for this beautiful adaptation (which is such a rarity) my reading experience was not ruined, in fact it only amplified the emotions which knotted around as a gulp in my throat, accompanied by an urge to stop reading sometimes, but the magical articulation of words and the urge to feel the characters already so close to my heart was enough for me to continue.Atonement is one of those stories which shatter you completely. It is a tragedy but so well-crafted that even in sadness you cannot help but feel the warmth which fiction usually provides. It was this tragedy that prevented me from reading the book for years after I watched the movie. For I knew if the movie could connect with me on such a deep level, I could only imagine the anguish the book will cause and I was not wrong.It is extremely rare to chance upon a book with the perfect symphonies of words, adorning the text and deepening the feelings by conveying the story in such an artistically beautiful way, like a pearl necklace majestically disintegrating as the string holding it breaks, the beauty of the pearls falling apart though tragic but accompanied by a surreal aesthetic that calms you down even in its sadness, you might feel tears swelling up but even then the beauty never lets go of its hold on your heart.I won’t summarise the story or get into the various analytical examinations of its themes for I am not qualified for such a review. I believe when you read a book, you are able to connect with the author’s mind at such a level that is not humanly possible in any other way, and in this a resonance is produced which transforms you and helps you carry along at least some part of that book, which might remain unknown to you as well, and a book is successful if this is achieved. Atonement very well achieved that.The three main characters and their plight of reality against fiction is so exquisite that you want to be a part of that realm and shout and help these characters out of their so evident misery. Robbie and Cecelia remain one of the most beautiful literary couples of all times, in ranks with Jane Austen’s beautifully written heroes and heroines. You know these characters are more than just fictional fabrications when they make you happy in their happiness and make you cry in their sadness, for as the tears flow through their eyes you can’t help but feel the wetness appear in your own.The third main character, who is actually the central of it all, is one of the most fascinating characters I have ever read. Briony Tallis is a novelist and she showed signs of her fictional supremacy right from her childhood. She believes in fairy tales and she cannot help but feel an air of superiority that easily comes when you are a creator of your own stories. She loves this control over her characters, she loves to play God and find happiness in fabricating these lies as stories. But her imagination falters when she seems to have lost control over the real people in her life. She feels agitated when she thinks her hero is behaving in an atrocious villainy way and it is then when she takes the reins in her hands and dictates the lives of those who are not her fictional tales.I cannot help but relate with what goes on in her head for I too am someone who lives in these fictional realms. But yet the story makes me abhor her in ways I could never hate any fictional character. The story is about her atonement yet by the end of it all, she could not truly atone. And for me personally, I could never forgive her, and I don’t think anyone could, no matter how precious a way she finds to finally atone herself.The best and the worst part of the book, coincidentally, was its ending. It feels so beautiful as the tug of war between reality and fiction finally draws conclusion only to leave flabbergasted, making you throw away the book as hard as possible yet pick it up and embrace it as a token of the bittersweet story that teaches you about the rarity of true love, the misguidance of adolescence, the helplessness of war, the pang of isolation and absolution of sin.And most importantly it questions the naivety which comes along with fantasies and the need to realise the difference between reality and fiction, teaching this lesson, ironically, by means of fiction.Atonement, hence remains one of the most beautiful books I have ever read.",11,0.9948,0.121,0.708,0.171,0.6184877147205913,POSITIVE,0.9993
130,253216422,12/30/2011,4.0,"How can you atone for a mistake which so drastically alters someone’s life? 13-year-old Briony Tallis aspires to being a writer. She spends her days writing romances, adventures, and plays; her family encourages these efforts. On a summer day in 1935, at her family estate, she witnesses a part of scene between her older sister, Cecilia, and Robbie Turner, the son of a servant, and her imagination takes off. Additional happenings in the house that same day, including her own snooping, result in a leap of logic and she accuses Robbie of a terrible crime. Once the attentions of the adults and police are focused on her, she feels compelled to complete her story – she “knows” Robbie did it and so comes forth as an eye witness. Her “confident” testimony is what convicts him despite the absence of evidence. This is her crime, whose repercussions the book follows through World War II and beyond, and for which Briony will spend her life trying to atone. This is a complex novel that explores issues of class, guilt, love, war and forgiveness. The reader knows this is an injustice and can only hope for an eventual resolution. I was horrified that no one took a good look at the situation and saw the obvious flaws in this young girl’s testimony. But then, she was an upper class young lady of a fine family, and he was the strong laborer trying to “get above his station.” Cecilia, in my opinion, is equally to blame for locking herself in her room at the outset and not coming forward until it is too late to save Robbie. She also atones; she completely cuts herself off from her family and continuously works to try to reverse the damage. Robbie is left to try to piece together some semblance of a life; his service during WW 2 is in part an effort to expunge his record. Jill Tanner’s performance of this audio book is wonderful. She’s able to express the boredom and outrage of the young teen Briony, the passion and excitement of Cecilia, the anxiety and confusion of Pierrot and Jackson, the petulance and superiority of Lola, and the hope and determination of Robbie. (view spoiler)[The issue of class is further evident because while Cecilia firmly believes that Robbie had nothing to do with the attack on Lola, she automatically focuses her attentions on Danny Hardman, a lad from the village. She never suspects Paul Marshall … though it was HE who had scratches on his face from an earlier attempt on Lola. Even though Lola had to seek treatment for cuts and bruises earlier in the day (she blamed her younger twin brothers), no one seemed to put two and two together. Paul, after all, was the scion of a wealthy family, a college man, and a good friend of Leon Tallis. And later in life when Briony wants to tell the “real” story, she is advised against doing so because surely the Marshalls would sue her for libel. Yes, Lola marries her rapist and is now the wealthy wife who, along with her husband, supports many worthy charities. Their “class” insulates them from scrutiny.

They were all very flawed, as mortal mean are, but they didn't have enough redeeming qualities to even make me really like any of them. I also thought that the title was ill-fitting.

But her intentions were noble, weren't they? She didn't do anything out of malice, she was trying to do the right thing. But her words destroyed multiple people's lives.

137,762961171,11/12/2013,5.0,"Ian McEwan won the Booker Prize in 1998 for a deadly little masterpiece called ""Amsterdam."" What seemed like a triumph of literary acumen then was, in fact, just a prelude to a far broader, more ambitious novel that captures the brutality of love and war and guilt. The extraordinary range of ""Atonement"" suggests that there's nothing McEwan can't do.The story opens on a sweltering day at the ugly Gothic estate of Emily Tallis and her much-absent husband. McEwan rotates through the perspectives of several residents and guests during a ludicrous and ultimately disastrous weekend, turning subtly through a kind of mock tribute to Jane Austen, Henry James, and Virginia Woolf.Thirteen-year-old Briony has composed a romantic play, in verse, for her older brother ""to celebrate his return, provoke his admiration and guide him away from his careless succession of girlfriends, towards the right form of wife, the one who would persuade him to return to the countryside, the one who would sweetly request Briony's services as a bridesmaid."" That seems a rather tall order for any play - in verse or otherwise - but Briony ""was one of those children possessed by a desire to have the world just so.""Unfortunately, her three cousins, visiting while their scandalous mother has an affair in Paris, don't see the importance of helping Briony shape reality to her will. While pouting during a break from a particularly bad rehearsal, Briony watches her older sister and a young man in the yard arguing in front of the fountain.Cecilia and Robbie appear to be tussling over an old vase. When it drops into the water, her sister strips to her underwear, retrieves the pieces, and marches away. The scene makes no sense to Briony at first, but it quickly provides the material for a new melodrama starring her.Meanwhile, Robbie retreats to his room and realizes in frustration that he must no longer conceal his love for Cecilia, regardless of their recent argument by the fountain. After writing several drafts, including a rather crude sexual fantasy, he composes a confession of his love, rushes to the house, and asks Briony to deliver it to her sister.In her new role as Cecilia's defender, Briony immediately opens the letter and finds the obscene fantasy that Robbie has mistakenly mailed - oops! ""Something irreducibly human, or male, threatened the order of their household,"" McEwan writes, ""and Briony knew that unless she helped her sister, they would all suffer.""At the coming-home party for her brother that evening, she keeps a close eye on the ""sex maniac,"" but Robbie and Cecilia are too caught up in their new romance to notice or care. McEwan's knowledge of the inner workings of these characters is so piercing that you can't help feeling sorry for them; only God should have such intimate knowledge.The tragicomedy of Briony's crisis peaks when two children disrupt the party by running away from home. For the adults, the dark search is made anxious by their proximity to the lake; for Briony, who knows what sort of fiend is among them, the situation couldn't be more alarming. Gripped with terror but driven on by constant attention to the heroic story she's composing, she creeps out to the island temple - an artificial temple built on an artificial island - and there interrupts a rape in progress.She finds her 16-year-old cousin disheveled and distraught. The rapist, surely Robbie, has darted into the night. ""I saw him,"" she announces, creating in that moment a degree of certainty her story needs to reach its climax. And despite the darkness, despite her cousin's lack of confirmation, despite a sprinkling of contradictory details, her narrative calcifies into rock-hard certainty that smashes several lives.Three shorter, dead serious parts follow. The first is a terrifying short story about Robbie, now serving in the British Army, fleeing the German invasion of France. The second describes Briony's grisly experience at a London hospital as soldiers arrive for treatment. And the last part jumps ahead to 1999, for an epilogue that brilliantly complicates the events and the morality of what happened that night at the Tallis estate. These disparate parts, alike only in their stunning effectiveness, combine to produce a profound exploration of the nature of guilt and the difficulty of absolution. As she clears the fog of adolescence, Briony must confront the destructive power of her fiction, even while pursuing its redemptive possibilities.We're each of us, McEwan suggests, composing our lives. And in those stories we can illustrate ""the simple truth that other people are as real as us ... and have an equal value."" Or we can ignore that moral and pay the consequences. The role of author entices us with the chance for endless revision, but assuming that role precludes the possibility of atonement with an Author outside ourselves. Such is the harrowing paradox captured in this comic, moving, ultimately unsettling novel.http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0314/p1...",10,-0.9863,0.142,0.738,0.12,0.5439085402901193,NEGATIVE,0.8731
138,2552511667,10/05/2018,5.0,"Somewhat late to the party, or effigy burning, as it’s clear this book has polarised people. But first the initial impressions: loved it, wow, total knockout, holy shit, and other superlatives. This reaction is surprising, as  Solar (read a while ago) was in hindsight supremely forgettable: what even happened? Here with Atonement, maybe some professional reviews overdo themselves with their dramatics in ejaculations like, from my back blurb, “No one now writing fiction in the English language surpasses Ian McEwan,” or “McEwan could be the most psychologically astute writer working today[.]” These thunderous declarations too comfortably settle in on the too-presumptuous side for my liking. But it's hard denying that, from the writing to characterisation, structure to self-reflexivity, Atonement more than justifies itself as an impressive technical and narrative achievement, and a wholly entrancing character study besides. Sure, this study concerns a truly infuriating character in Briony (even the name, like Umbridge, sets some people’s blood to boiling). Yet it’s nonetheless damn interesting. Her practical and philosophical interest in storytelling, being a budding writer, results in expansive contemplation on the nature of language, texts, and fiction, which gives us long, flowing sentences like these: “The title lettering, the illustrated, the pages bound—in that word alone she felt the attraction of the neat, limited and controllable form she had left behind when she decided to write a play,” which “in the garden of the arts… was a weed and had to die.” On that word: she sees it as a “typographical demon,” yet evoking “[t]hree figures huddling at the foot of the cross.” On the future novel: “[i]t was thought, perception, sensations that interested her, the conscious mind as a river through time, and how to represent its onward roll,” etc. Atonement is largely (or even entirely) a fiction about fiction, but far from being superficial, artificial, or obnoxious (though Briony herself embodies the latter so well), it is at the same time incredibly human—in all its contradictions that so offend young Briony, who also embodies idealistic order against Robbie’s and Cecelia’s untidy chaos: “What fairy tale ever held so much by way of contradiction?” Where this book gets postmodern, apart from its self-consciousness about form, also puts us in spoiler territory, hence these tags. (view spoiler)[Part three ends with Briony’s signature, “BT,” that’s placed and dated to “London, 1999,” when all this time we’ve been situated in wartime London. This raises the possibility of everything previous being fabricated, though this possibility becomes outright confirmation in the final two pages of the epilogue as the elder Briony reveals both Robbie and Cecelia never had their happy ending after all, but had been dead all along since the war. It was all pretend, constructed! Naturally, some felt cheated, and questioned the whole point of it all. Enough of this postmodern trickery! What, ultimately, was the book worth? But this twist, more than being a cop-out, saves it from that “tide of forgetting, and then oblivion,” and honestly elevates it to being damn good literature. Plus, it certainly also fits with what we’ve learned about Briony with her novelistic mind, driven by a “controlling demon” that ultimately propels her self-image to divine heights: “how can a novelist achieve atonement when, with her absolute power of deciding outcomes, she is also God?” Atonement in its religious sense is the act of reparation for sin, yet she as God is beyond atonement because God is beyond sin. The irony of this book’s (i.e., Briony’s) self-proclaimed task of atonement is that no atonement actually takes place. It’s breathtakingly arrogant and tragic and just amazing. (hide spoiler)]Other criticism has been lobbed its way, and shields thrown up to deflect them. All make points varying from legitimate to, frankly, outright bonkers ones. I heard someone suggest today in class that the second part could be deleted, and the third aggressively trimmed, to little negative effect. What? Considering the book in light of the above spoiler, this would instead have the effect of what happens when you set fire to the drapes in the library. Atonement, from beginning to end, jumps from inner world to inner world, from Cecelia’s (with her exasperation), Robbie’s (ambition), Emily’s (”slow drift of association”), and most engagingly of all, Briony’s, which is a world of immature emotions, writerly concerns, and elaborate fancies, a perfect storm of chaos in a self-styled symbol of order. By itself, the book's postmodern aspect may just be cleverness, yet within the fuller context of the story (and Briony's character), not to be dismissed out of hand.",10,-0.9615,0.113,0.784,0.103,0.5031179138321994,POSITIVE,0.9815

David Mitchell's number 9 dream, Rachel Seiffert's The Dark Room, Ali Smith's Hotel World and Andrew Miller's Oxygen (the weakest of the lot, which is saying something) were all strong contenders for the prize, and three of them were even better than McEwan's story of war bound love and betrayal.The travesty is that Peter Carey beat McEwan with The True History of the Kelly Gang rather than Mitchell or Seiffert or Smith.Regardless, Atonement is a fine book.The multiple perspectives, the lies, the fancy, the truth, the life, the sensuality, the suffering, the echoes of Brideshead Revisted, the metafiction, they all combine to make an experience that won't let me go.It took three tries to get past Briony's production of her play, but once I made it past her spoiled petulance, I couldn't stop reading Atonement until I was through. And Briony's final, fading declaration of truth actually made me cry. What stands out for me about Atonement is that nothing really stands out. It was a novel of immersion, like Cecilia diving for the broken shard of vase, or Robbie cocooned by darkness, rotting internally from a gut shot, or Cecilia drowning in a bombed out subway station, or the French soldier buried in his impending death, mistaking Briony for his lover. It is all there. All at once. And nothing overpowers the others.

The kind of ugly cry that leaves me with a book hangover and smashing headache the next day.

Not even that least little bit...okay, there's a bit in the beginning, otherwise it wouldn't have crushed me so. McEwan shows us a glimpse of what could have been and then snatches it away brilliantly...I hate him minutely.Where this book excels is in it's visual exposition. The pages became so sensory. I loved all the details. While I can understand that other readers may find this level of detail boring, to me it felt like a steady heartbeat. The cadence of the words were perfect.Of course there are parts that I hated, that made me want to jump into the book and shake the precocious Briony, but that's the point. That utterly helpless feeling puts you so far into the characters of Robbie and Cecilia that it's practically hurts. And then we're left contemplating our own choices. Can one misunderstood moment change lives so drastically in our own reality? Can a lie, even to ourselves, bring devastation?Ultimately, this book made me feel. Just feel.

Her pretension and narcissism were annoying and aggravating. But then as the story started to unfold my anger found its correct target: Ian McEwan. Yes, Briony has her faults. She narcissistic, self-aggrandizing, and meddlesome. But she's a little girl! She exhibits the arrogance that all little kids have in thinking they are the center of the universe. She's a precocious, but McEwan makes her seem almost evil. To me the way McEwan talked about her spying, playing with her toys, and making up stories made Briony seem creepy and devious. And then the consequences of her arrogance and fancifulness are so horribly aggravatingly dire. Why tie the overarching tragedy of the story to a little girl's misunderstanding? Why vilify a little girl? Briony sees rape, forceful sex, hears crude words for the first time and yes, she completely misinterprets what she saw, but the tragedy of the book shouldn't boil down to a little girl's misunderstanding. I'm often too quick to jump to an aggravated feminist position on books and movies, but I do think there is something disconcerting about McEwan, a grown man, constructing an elaborate tragedy and then making a little girl the source and cause of that tragedy.",10,-0.998,0.313,0.66,0.026,0.5825231481481482,NEGATIVE,0.9999

165,3736056,07/29/2007,5.0,"Book Review: Ian McEwan, Atonement (Vintage, London, 2002)The cover of Atonement is plastered with reviewers claiming it to be a 'masterpiece', and McEwan's best novel to date. I'd previously read his novel Enduring Love, and whilst I appreciated its merits as a literary piece, I was never completely pulled in by the characters and plot. But, Atonement really is a masterpiece. Being the geek that I am, I was practically squeeing over the sheer skill of it all.The characters of the piece are each beautifully created creatures - the three protagonists especially. McEwan touches on characterisation a little when Briony muses that modern (mid twentieth century) novelists have no need for plot and characters - as she discovers, and as McEwan shows us, this is not the case. Along with Briony is Cecilia and Robbie. These three characters really come alive, both when the writing is from their prospective and when they are merely appearing in a scene. I found I could relate to each of them, finding shades of light and dark in them, liking them, but at the same time disliking them.The central 'crime' of the piece is an interesting one, and it's hard to pin down just how much actual atonement there is when we reach the final stages of the novel: is Briony atoning for her sins as a person, or as a writer?I found Part One to be the tightest section of the novel. It created the pre-war atmosphere of the mid-1930s beautifully. The fact that all of the action was kept to a single setting and over a very short period of time made it all the more sumptuous to read, as we delved into the lives of the Tallis family and those around them. I felt for a short time in the middle of the novel that the entire thing may collapse - when it was all very centered around Robbie's time as a soldier in France, but in hindsight, it is an essential part of the structure. The final scenes between Briony, Cecilia and Robbie were beautiful - so visual, yet full of characterisation and an atmosphere that really caught me.The final section brings into question the idea of the reliability of the narrator, which is something I remember encountering whilst reading Enduring Love also. I think it is better handled in this novel, as it is brought to our attention as a choice, rather than a lack of sanity (as with Joe in Enduring Love). The way that it is handled - I'm trying to describe this without spoiling the novel - is so successful because it creates a stronger hold over us long after the final page is turned. There is always a series of lingering 'what if?'s. The ending itself is more than a little bittersweet.Overall, a fantastic novel. McEwan's skill is incomparable - a writer who can be truly literary and also tell one hell of a tale. He is an example of twenty-first century writing at its very best, and I look forward to reading more of his work when I get the chance.",8,0.9966,0.044,0.787,0.169,0.4711390358612582,POSITIVE,0.9996
166,452761251,11/10/2012,5.0,"I have never read a book that captures guilt and consequences so brilliantly, and heartbreakingly at the same time. It’s absolutely gorgeous. And just in case you’ve seen the movie and think you’re all set: the movie is good, but the book is so much better yet.Briony, the lead character, is a girl aged 13, very much living into her own head, authoring stories and plays. Her mother describes her fittingly: “[Briony] had vanished into an intact inner world of which writing was no more than the visible surface, the protective crust which even, or especially, a loving mother could not penetrate. Her daughter was always off and away in her mind, grappling with some unspoken, self-imposed problem, as though the weary, self-evident world could be re-invented by a child.”There are many examples of that, most of them beautifully executed, but the scene with Briony flaying nettles when feeling utterly frustrated is one of the best. Here she is, destroying nettles, and all of a sudden that act becomes something grander, much more impressive than it is: “No one in the world could do this better than Briony Tallis who would be representing her country next year at the Berlin Olympics and was certain to win the gold. People studied her closely and marveled at her technique, her preference for bare feet because it improved her balance—so important in this demanding sport—with every toe playing its part; the manner in which she led with the wrist and snapped the hand round only at the end of her stroke, the way she distributed her weight and used the rotation in her hips to gain extra power, her distinctive habit of extending the fingers of her free hand—no one came near her. Self-taught, the youngest daughter of a senior civil servant. Look at the concentration in her face, judging the angle, never fudging a shot, taking each nettle with inhuman precision. To reach this level required a lifetime’s dedication.”McEwan introduces the characters slowly and carefully, so we have very solid mental sculptures of who these people are before the story really unfolds. And then you hit chapter 13. Opening sentence: “Within the half hour Briony would commit her crime."" The crime she’d spent the rest of her life trying to atone for.“She would never be able to console herself that she was pressured or bullied. She never was. She trapped herself, she marched into the labyrinth of her own construction, and was too young, too awestruck, too keen to please, to insist on making her own way back.”Because McEwan build his characters so well before going to the main action, what follows is utterly believable, and gut wrenching at the same time. This is no feel-good book, but it shows how powerful fiction can be. I’m absolutely kicking myself for having bought this book years ago, and leaving it unread on my shelves. It deserved so much more.",8,0.9963,0.07,0.75,0.181,0.4868508535489666,POSITIVE,0.9968
167,68583491,08/23/2009,3.0,"Atonement takes place in England during the time of World War II, and begins with 13-year-old Briony Tallis narrating her experience of writing a play, titled the ""Trials of Arabella"". The story takes a turn for the worst when Briony later witnesses and misinterprets an act of sexuality displayed by her older sister and the family's gardener. That same day Briony contributes to the unjust sentencing of a completely innocent man due to her innocence and misunderstanding of a set of events too mature for her to comprehend. What took place on that heated summer day alters Briony's life forever and sends her on a quest to seek redemption for her wrongdoing.Ian McEwan can write. No doubt about it. I don't even have to comment on how magnificent and beautiful his prose is, that's probably the most evident plus about Atonement. At times I found myself pondering if one could just read this book simply for the words, and not the story, because most of the actual writing was flawless and never seem contrived or dull. McEwan's writing largely (mostly) contributed to this book's three stars.I would summarize Atonement's plot with two words: mind games. I personally thought that this book's whole theme, whether it be the redemption/atonement theme or the paranormal/manipulative theme was just a bit much. While I really enjoyed thinking about the false events that occured or the realistic writing that was proved not to really happen, it just came off as a bit fake for me. So while McEwan's writing structure was new and innovative, I'm part of the minority and thought that it was a bit gimmicky.There were some scenes I found well-written though. Like part 3, when Briony was in the nursing ward. Other times the plot moved too slow (part 2) or too fast (ending of part 4).The character development was pretty good in Atonement. I really have to give props to McEwan for understanding how a 13-year-old girl's mind works, although when I really thought about it the whole thing was kind of creepy - but the creepy that draws people in to a book, not repels them. It was a truly unique experience to witness Briony's actions, motives, thoughts, and ideas throughout the entire book. I didn't really get any of the side characters though, escpecially with what was revealed in part 4. My whole previous mindset of them seemed to be just a pointless facade implanted by the author.Overall this was a good, solid read and if you're a fan of metafiction and psych, then Atonement will be right up your alley. Unfortunately, it just wasn't what I was looking for.",8,0.9348,0.046,0.872,0.082,0.5322599169537944,POSITIVE,0.9636
168,2778299884,04/11/2019,3.0,"This was a relatively easy read, yet one I found myself skimming over as it progressed. Atonement begins in an idyllic countryside house and thirteen-year-old Briony witnesses her sister in the thralls of a passionate embrace. Following her ignorance regarding the meaning of this situation, Robbie is wrongly convicted of an inexcusable crime.While Part 1 featured various character perspectives and intrigue, the latter parts were less introspective. The lengthy bleak descriptions dovetail the novel into a generic wartime story and the captivating prose woven throughout Part 1 was nowhere to be seen. The descriptions lend well to the scene setting, however, the characters were devoid of any unique personality. I struggled to connect or feel anything for them and not one of them developed as the story progressed. Briony is insufferable. Cecilia lacks any depth. Robbie is the only character who feels like a real living, breathing, being. However, even he is rather dull. If anything, this book reaffirms that I tend to only enjoy books with well-developed characters. I felt as if I wasted some time reading the second half of this book, reading endless, uninteresting descriptions which lead the story nowhere. Personally, McEwan could have chosen for this to be a novella without the lengthy descriptions and accomplished as much.

I loved the ending (I won't go into that either), and didn't even see it coming. I started flipping backwards, and as I realized what McEwan did there, I was even more impressed with what I'd just read. It was definitely one of those endings you don't forget easily, and one that sneaks up on you. I'd recommend it to anyone who loves a good work of literature and who wants something a wee bit different. McEwan never fails to amaze me with every book I read, and this one was no different. No wonder the man has been nominated for so many literary awards. The story itself is very well done, the characters are all exquisitely drawn and the ending sort of hits you like a ton of bricks.

I wanted to witness the drama, the feelings, the story. Aaaaand, then here comes Briony in the third part. Aaaarghhhh! I was in no mood to listen to her, and I really took pleasure in her misery and guilt, but still searched for clues and stories about Robbie and Cecilia.

181,557458087,03/10/2013,4.0,"I saw the movie for Atonement years ago (when it first came out) and have sort of intentionally waited to read the book so that some of the plot and imagery were out of my head. I have read some of McEwan's other stuff and tend to like him and was excited to see what the book offers that was not as evident in the movie.I think that the single biggest difference between movie and book is how much more sympathetic Briony appears in the book. In the movie, she comes off (as I remember) as a spoiled brat who is angry and bored and sort of invents a story to entertain herself. In the book we see the adolescent struggles of a young girl trying to understand the adult issues in which the older girls (Cecelia and Lola) are already enmeshed. Not only are the older girls wise in a sexual way (although certainly the book leaves no question that Lola is simply raped twice in one day by her future husband), they are also more sophisticated in their manner of expressing derision through acquiescence: ""And yet, Briony struggled to grasp the difficult thought, wasn't there manipulation here, wasn't Lola using the twins to express something on her behalf, something hostile or destructive? Briony felt the disadvantage of being two years younger than the other girl, of having a full two years' refinement weigh against her"" followed by, ""it was Lola's briskness, her obliviousness to anything beyond her own business, and Briony's certainty that her own feelings would not even register, still less provoke guilt, which gave her the strength to resist.""As Briony develops intellectually (rather abruptly through the course of a single day in the novel), she moves to question her understanding of other-ness as also incorporating a self. This reminded me of a quote from David Foster Wallace about children believing that the world springs into being as they awake in the morning: ""Did her sister also have a real self concealed behind a breaking wave...Did everybody..? if the answer was yes, then the world, the social world, was unbearably complicated, with two billion voices, and everyone's thoughts striving in equal importance and everyone's claim on life as intense, and everyone thinking they were unique, when no one was....It wasn't only wickedness and scheming that made people unhappy, it was confusion and misunderstanding; above all, it was the failure to grasp the simple truth that other people are as real as you"" Ironically just a few hours after this thought, Briony takes away Robbie's individual hood both by literally sending him to jail and by confusing his figure with that of Paul Marshall.I loved the parallel when Turner watches an RAF man being tortured on the beach in France between his own arrest. Certainly, Lola stood passively by while Briony attacked him (as Turner does on the crowded beach); it takes a brace man (Mace) to ""rescue"" the RAF man (similarly to the way the Cecelia rescues Robbie.I liked that the rejection letter that Briony gets about her story of the two figures at the fountain (clearly the day that Cecelia and Robbie fought) contained references that were not in McEwan's text. I wondered if this was because Briony's story is an imperfect representation (which of course it is a story within a story and our ""true"" account is that which is presented first and written by McEwan) or if McEwan's original draft received some criticism that resulted in the final version that we read. Just a fun post-modern look at itself from within the story.Overall it is a compelling book (solid plot) with some interesting psychological comments.",7,-0.8299,0.104,0.803,0.093,0.514985994397759,POSITIVE,0.8103

For instance, why would her older sister Cecilia take off her clothes and plunge into the fountain, wearing her underwear, in front of the Tallises's char lady's son, Robbie? The answer is quite simple, but Briony is a very imaginative child, who wants to be a writer. By the end of that very same day, while a party in going on, something horrible happens, and Briony is the first to point her finger, thus changing irreversibly everyone's lives, especially Cecilia's and Robbie's.'Atonement' is divided into four parts. The first tells of that particular hot summer day, in rural England, when Briony commits her ""crime"", as it is put. We have perspectives from Briony, Cecilia, Robbie, and even Emily Tallis, the girls migraineur mother. Fourteen chapters long, spanning for 187 pages, this first part is very slow paced, as every action, every thought, even background, is related. The climax is slow to come, but we can feel it building up.Then there's part two which is only 74 pages long and tells of the war and what it was like to be in occupied France. This part belongs to Robbie, who, while in jail, agrees to be sent to the front. Although short in pages, is long in details and no pill is sugared in terms of what soldiers went through.Part three, 80 pages long, tells what became of Briony (and of Cecilia as well) five years after that summer day. Briony, who spent her childhood wishing to be a writer, is at that time a nurse in training, and, as the wounded soldiers are brought back from France, she is faced with a terrible reality. By then, she has more than acknowledged that what she did five years before was terrible, and that she must find a way to atone. But will she?The fourth and final part of the book is set in 1999 and is told by Briony herself. In the last nineteen pages of the book, Briony tells us it is her birthday and of some events that have happened later. She also lets us know the truth about what happened to Cecilia and Robbie, and asks ""how can a novelist achieve atonement when, with her absolute power of deciding outcomes, she is also God?"". Briony continues by saying ""There is no one, no entity or higher form that she can appeal to, or be reconciled with, or that can forgive her. (...) No atonement for God, or novelists, even if they are atheists. It was always an impossible task (...)"". Thus, in this last part, we understand how Briony tries to atone for that despicable act when she was thirteen years old.I loved this book. Despite the great amounts of sadness. Although I had seen the movie back in 2008 (or was it 2007?). I didn't mind that it was slow in the beginning and that the war part was so terrifying. It was absolutely fine that I cried loads, and finished each part with tears in my eyes. It's a great story!And yes, I hated Briony. She was young, yes, and naïve. Sure. But couldn't she have done things differently?! Why not try to clarify things before jumping into conclusions and accusations? But I must say I liked her a bit better when she's training to be a nurse. Briony seemed almost like a normal person.This is my second book by Ian McEwan and I must say I was a bit frightened with the perspective of reading it. On one hand, because I already knew how sad the story was. On the other, because I didn't exactly love McEwan's 'Sweet Tooth'.

It is divided into four chapters with the first chapter portraying the 13 year-old Briony and her overactive imagination. The second part is about Robbie Turner several years after, as a soldier in World War II while the third part is about Briony, now 18 years old and a student nurse. The Epilogue is set in the year 1999 with Briony now a successful novelist.I did not only like Atonement — I loved it. It was beautifully written, in fact, it was the prose that really first caught my attention. It is no wonder that Ian McEwan has gained such a reputation as a wonderful writer among the reviews I’ve read in Goodreads. And then of course there’s the extraordinary plot. I really loved how the book depicts a single scene through different perspectives and how these POVs would affect the action of each of the characters involved. And since I am now talking about characters, it is also but fitting to commend the depth of character that Ian McEwan has given for each of the major characters. Briony as the source of all the controversy is an entirely believable character.

184,465610895,11/28/2012,5.0,"""Atonement"" is the story of a relationship. Mainly, the relationship between the Author and his work. Strongly emphasising the eternal question: what is writing? And extrapolating – what is Art? A God-like tentative or simply an atonement? Does it show superbia or humility of its maker? “No atonement for God, or novelists, even if they are atheists,” concluded the heroine/ narrator/ Author Briony Tallis. An echo of the famous “Madame Bovary, c’est moi”, acknowledged (or praised?) by Flaubert. Same for Briony, here, who pours her story, apparently making amends by leaving an open ending and thus finishing symmetrically her tale with the same mistake (or inspiration) that generated it: by blending reality and fantasy. Briony, the (very) young artist who has just written a melodramatic play whose main character she intends to interpret until she is tricked into giving up her role to her cousin Lola (an overgrown Lolita, of course), only to reoccupy the center-stage later, when she decides to reconstruct reality according to imagination. After that, she feels free to model her characters as she sees fit – she became their God, they became her creation. Briony’s tale is thereby re-written, Woolf-style, in what Geoff Dyer inspiringly called ""a slow drift of association"" and text and intertext intertwine with metatext in the guise of a letter from Cyril Connolly, editor of Horizon, who has read and analyzed and finally rejected her short story as too precious, lacking in “forward movement"". That’s how a narrative goes on, apparently, and trama is from now on developed to encompass war, in order to compare and maybe diminish personal drama in front of universal tragedy: ""But what was guilt these days? It was cheap. Everyone was guilty, and no one was."" And Cecily and Robbie’s feelings and lives are freely outlined by Briony, fed by her knowledge and love and guilt and an echo of the past that becomes the leitmotiv of the novel – her sister’s magic words that once had helped Briony to wake up from nightmares and now link her with her lover: “Come back.” Reality and fiction are mixed anew.Finally, the Author’s choice is, as always, to privilege fiction, to redeem, not himself, but reality itself, to meet, one way or another, the expectations of the reader: “I know there’s always a certain kind of reader who will be compelled to ask, But what really happened? The answer is simple: the lovers survive and flourish. As long as there is a single copy, a solitary typescript of my final draft, then my spontaneous, fortuitous sister and her medical prince survive to love.”That’s how it has to be. That’s how reality should be – forever through sliding doors, forever changing to accommodate not only hero’s expectations but also bystander’s expectations. Of course, it’s the reality of the fiction I’m talking about. As imagined by Briony the Author. ",7,0.9525,0.034,0.889,0.077,0.5230952380952382,POSITIVE,0.9614
185,317678403,04/23/2012,5.0,"For someone who hasn't read for pleasure in a while, what joy it is to open a book and find it perfectly suited, and then to chase that book in the moments between classes and when waiting on the platform for a train, reading it in spite of the other work that must be done. What relief to find a great escape when you need it most! My feelings toward this novel are more of gratitude than love. Still...McEwan is one of the writers whose prose alone could make a book. (Other notable cases include: Sylvia Plath, Ralph Ellison.) But he's different in that Atonement feels... easy. McEwan uses heavy words and heavy themes, but the book in itself manages to be light. I think it has to do with the clarity of vision. What clear, clear vision! What consistency of thought! Streams of consciousness are never too muddled, they are never too boring. The book opens in Austen's world and then steps through the looking glass into Remarque's. The characters don't necessarily win our hearts, and I myself am still uncertain as to my feelings toward Briony. Maybe we're not supposed to judge from a distance. Maybe our submersion into the characters' respective worlds is meant to provide us only with their confused heaps of feelings, and leave us to untangle the mess ourselves. If not perfect in context, then Atonement is perfect in its ability to completely capture the vision of another world. It's descriptiveness does not feel overdone, particularly during Robbie's time in France. (When so many war novels fall prey to bad depictions and cliches, McEwan's poor France, set upon by the second war for the world, is fresh and at the same time reminiscent of Erich Maria Remarque's equally poor Germany.) Self-centered, cowardly protagonist Briony is more than a match for the surly Surrey summer which opens the novel. Bright or dark, love or pain, everything in this book is vivid. After all, what can one expect from a writer who uses the words ""nacreous"" and ""filigree"" when describing baked potatoes? I also wonder how I would have felt about the book if I hadn't seen the movie first. I highly, highly recommend the film. The beach scene at Dunkirk has been named one of the best tracking shots of all time - but I thought that the book did more justice to Dunkirk, while the film dominated in all aspects romantic, dramatic, and rosy. And, of course, the film's ending comes like a punch to the gut. I'm not sure the book's ending delivers the necessary impact - but then again, there are so many issues (mainly concerned with writing, truth, and playing God) which aren't touched upon in the film. Ah, well; same story, two different mediums. *(Eh. Bad review is bad. I haven't been at this in a while. Will get my game back soon.) ",7,0.894,0.124,0.72,0.155,0.5322123015873016,POSITIVE,0.9999
186,585759594,04/09/2013,4.0,"My musings on Atonement.This is a chewy novel, by that I mean it is definitely not written in easily digestible prose. Ian McEwan is a very wordy guy. It takes him a bit to get where he's going here. However, where he is going is this exquisite torture. I would never say that this is a well-written novel but the subject matter is simply amazing. I love the idea that Briony witnesses a completely innocent act and with her child's mind misconstrues it. Chaos ensues! Lives are ripped apart, dreams are shattered and there is no going back. I loved to hate Briony. (view spoiler)[ The fact that there was never an opportunity for Briony to be forgiven felt honest to me. She had the first love/lust/sexy-times partner of her sister thrown into jail and then the army for a crime he never committed and yes, she was incredibly naive and young but these actions stand. I liked that McEwan gave us a glimpse of that happiness (or relative happiness) and stole it away again to tell the tale of the reality.  (hide spoiler)]The non-traditional ending of this book is really what earns it that 4 you see up there. I enjoyed the characters and their inner fights. And yes, I loved hating Briony. I loved Cecilia's abstract thirst for life. I loved Robbie's faults and accomplishments. McEwan found a way to make me care despite all the flowers he painted this book with.

I was enchanted by the writing throughout, especially the writing about writing. I loved the thought processes of Briony. I also remember wondering once if everyone else had the same unique thoughts and aspirations that I had. I loved reading about her journey as a writer. I also enjoyed reading about Cecilia and Robbie, but my enjoyment was tainted. I was hoping too hard for a happy ending. From what I had heard about the book, I was sure there wouldn't be one and I was prematurely disappointed. I struggled to continue reading through most of the middle third of the book. I was on a cruise and this book did not fit my usual light vacation reading requirements. I complained to my companions about the book at regular intervals. Then I finished the final chapter. I was blown away. I think the juxtaposition of what I thought happened and what really happened was powerful and beautiful. I reread the final chapter of the war section and the final chapter of part two and those parts took on new meaning. I was laying out in the Mexican sun and crying to myself.

I like to feel like the characters in a book are people that I know well and that I want to revisit later. These characters, well unfortunately, I just will forget I met them.

The first section of the novel captures the feeling of being a young writer at thirteen, buzzing with ideas while at the same time confronting one's own immaturity; the second drowns the reader in the horror of war, in the fight for survival; and the third encapsulates the desperate frustration one feels when contemplating a terrible action that can never be undone or forgiven.

200,2005773840,05/20/2017,4.0,"My habit of launching into a book without re-reading the blurb typically works well for me but not so much this time. Having just finished a YA contemporary novel I'd loved I found it difficult to settle in to this more formal style and slower paced story. My first mistake was in failing to realise the period in which the book was set (which I would have known from the first sentence of the blurb). Initially I guessed 50's because there was a reference to the end of the war some years previous but soon realised it had been a reference to the Great War. Adjusting my calculations and placing the characters in the 1930's certainly made more sense and immediately helped me to accept the voice of 13 yo Briony Tallis. That said, I was still six chapters in before I found a chapter I enjoyed and that was wholly for the quality of the writing. It was yet another chapter before I met Robbie, the first character I'd actually liked. By now I'd already considered putting this book aside and in my notes I'd written about my impatience for something to happen.When finally something did happen it was a pivotal event and had lasting impacts upon the lives of each of our main characters Briony, Robbie and Cecilia. Briony, a young girl with a vivid imagination and penchant for writing stories finds herself the central witness to said event. Her version of reality however was blemished, based as it was upon upon her perception of earlier incidents she'd witnessed out of context and without the benefit of the maturity to understand them. The results were devastating and once her statements were locked in she felt powerless to change them despite the emergence of her own niggling doubts. Over the years her guilt over her role compounded. This was beautifully described on pg 173 
""How guilt refined the methods of self-torture, threading the beads of detail into an eternal loop, a rosary to be fingered for a lifetime.""
Though it took it's time capturing my attention by the end of part 1 I was hooked. Parts 2 and 3 provided vivid images of the senseless actions and violence rendered by the war. FIrstly from the narrative voice of Robbie who is on the front and then from Briony in her role as a probationary nurse tending the wounds and providing comfort to the dying in their final hours. The final part of the book was set in 1999 where Briony is celebrating her 77th birthday, looking back over her life and her writing career. These she knows to be her dying years and she is tidying up everything whilst she still can. Though providing me with food for thought this was an anti-denouement. Instead of tying off loose ends it created new ones. I was left unsafisfied, feeling unclear about what had happened to Cecilia and Robbie, and questioning what I had read. I can only remember this happening once before in books I've read. I didnt like it then and I dont like it now. Yet I know it's the very thing that will probably make this book memorable for me. As I started this review I'd settled upon 3.5 stars but as I've written I've reassessed. The writing was excellent with some amazingly beautiful passages. The story was thought provoking with the theme of guilt thread throughout. Given my initial lack of interest Ian McEwan clearly did a good job of hauling me into the story almost against my will. Though my expectations were not quite met I am not sorry to have read this book. 4 stars afterall.",6,-0.6343,0.113,0.781,0.106,0.5706341806341807,POSITIVE,0.9625

203,579609248,04/03/2013,2.0,"I have two very different opinions about this book. I rated it based on the stronger opinion. Both opinions contain some spoilers, so if you haven't read it, or if you can stomach me trying to be vague about some of the specifics, read on. If not...stop here.Why I like this book and would give it five stars:The author is clever. Very clever. Too clever. He uses the book to create its own logic, and then he meticulously follows that logic through to its conclusion. The main character has done a terrible thing. She wants to atone for it, and so she crafts a product that is the atonement. That product is the thing in your hands, thereby putting you, the reader, into a certain kind of dynamic with the fictional character (you are her judge). The entire book is an appeal to you to judge her since she cannot judge herself.However, it doesn't stop there. The character Briony also wants to become a writer and to get lost in the art of writing. She spends her time in the novel working on creating a story that will represent what she truly feels inside. Several other works are mentioned in passing (Virginia Woolf is one that stuck out), and the work itself alludes to the style of those who are mentioned. In other words, the character is creating a work that is the work that is emulating other words that this work (Atonement) is also alluding to. In addition to this, Briony is also lying--deliberately--to the reader. She never shies away from telling the reader this (or at least hinting at it in the early portions), and she does it because it is, in some senses, what authors do. She wants to lie because it creates a certain kind of reality. That reality is a novel with its own set of rules; those rules are the rules of this novel (Atonement) that is about writing a novel about...so forth and so on.This makes the book about the relationship between an author and her work. No matter what the back matter on the book says, the book and its author (Briony? McEwan? Take your pick) are the two main characters. In some ways this is all Atonement is about--figuring out this relationship inside the process itself. This is what makes me love this book so much that I would read it again.**As an addendum, I would also offer that the book does a wonderful job of crafting historical fiction. I think that McEwan must have pulled liberally from his source material to show such vivid scenes throughout.The reason I hate this book and want to give it one star (but rounded to two for what I have listed above):BrionyThat is the only thing I need to put here. Briony. I hate the main character with all the passion that a reader can summon for a character that does not even exist. She is selfish, impulsive, and a liar. She holds her convictions dear without having spent a day in her life really examining what those convictions are; this lack of self-examination creates the main plot point in the novel (and drives what I wrote in the above section). However, Briony also asks the reader to accept this lack and to understand her position. I do not accept or understand her, not do I want to. I think that Briony is a vile, disgusting character that has no spine and who further attempts to escape from her problem by trying to show how clever she is--she wants to create something worthwhile to replace the real world that she has destroyed.Now, maybe you could say to me that I should relax because this is a fictional character. I shouldn't judge the book so harshly just because I don't like the main persona in it. To that, I would respond that I believe that the purpose of a piece of art (in this case, a book) is to elevate the reader. I do not believe that my life has been elevated by a book that creates a character who constantly lies to the reader, and then attempts to justify this lying by being clever about it. As portrayed in the novel, Briony has destroyed life itself and attempts to excuse it with art; I find this inexcusable and vain, and I reject a book that attempts to engage the reader under these pretenses.**To add another reason to this category: The novel also goes for long stretches without anything central to the plot happening. For instance, the entire middle section is about one character walking. If this entire section were skipped, I don't believe the reader would be missing anything essential to the plot.______________________________________________To summarize: I do find the IDEA of the novel (the relationship between a writer and her subject) interesting, but I find the CHARACTER unredeemable. The novel itself asks too much of me; it asks too much that it should want me to judge (compassionately?) the main character, and thus, as an extension, the work itself.**As another aside, I understand that some people find this type of challenge exhilarating. I simply do not when the main character is so vile.",6,0.951,0.053,0.852,0.096,0.4750724637681157,POSITIVE,0.8385

206,44132412,01/23/2009,3.0,"The three stars – three and a half, actually – was more about my personal enjoyment, me who was a bit disturbed by and couldn’t sympathize with some of the characters and their fates, not anything directly concerning McEwan’s writing dexterity.I have no problem with Ian McEwan’s skillful mastery of the language he used to tell this story of love, crime, war and tragedy. In fact, I like his style in this book (his first ever I’d read), much more than I do some other contemporary writers I’ve come across. I admire his fluent, vivid descriptions of places, weather, atmosphere, the heatwave, emotions – although at times they make me a bit tired and think “Alright, I understand what you mean, no need to throw more than a fourth of the thesaurus at me anymore!” The lovers of this novel – around whose tragic lives the story was spun – were too… not uncommon to me. Two childhood friends who grew older and grew apart as they found out that there were too many differences between them; differences that made them realise that they’re bound to be eternal lovers. But probably that’s exactly why they’re needed to be so: because something came inbetween them, and ruined the fairy-tale like ending everyone likes to dream of.You might have seen the girl, Cecilia Tallis, in other places, more than once: a ‘modern’ girl, whose love, education and work cut her off from her family. Her mother thought Cecilia had contemptuously put herself on airs just because she went to Cambridge to read books like Austen’s and Dickens’ that all could be found in their home library. Her lover is Robbie Turner, called ‘Robbie’ in the parts of the novel that deal with his life in the Tallises’ house and when he’s with Cecilia, and the cold, distant ‘Turner’ in the narration when he’s away in Northern France retreating from the Jerry. Robbie was the bright son of a gardener and a charlady serving the house of a self-made rich family, the Tallises. His mother’s master, with his dream of equality, paid Robbie’s tuition and even sent him to Cambridge along with his daughter. A good-natured lad, falling in love with the master’s older daughter. A handsome guy who tried to act helpful, but became a victim of a girl’s seemingly unshakable imagination. Robbie’s so nice a guy that he didn’t feel it right for Cecilia to estrange herself from her family just because of him.The most unusual character – and we can safely say that she is the central character of the novel – is Briony, Cecilia’s far younger sister, a dreamy kid with wild imaginations and a true, honest love towards the members of her family. The wild and the honest mixed to create what later Briony would, when she reflected on her early teen years, think as a crime, but at the time when it was done it was only an innocent act of a girl too imaginative for everyone’s good: accusing Robbie for something terrible he hadn’t done.But wait. Cecilia, despite all her liberalism that sent her love-making with the charlady’s son and living independently, was still a bit of the snob after all – blaming and hating another gardener’s son without evidence just because of her blind faith that it was not Robbie. And Robbie failed to grab young Briony’s true intention, assigning a jealous, adult love that only… well, only an adult is capable of. And didn’t he, in some way, kick the ball for the first time anyway? My, how one thing leads to another.Oh, yes, love is cruel, love blinds you, and you’ll think that however the lovers will live happily ever after. Will they? Read this book to know for yourself; it is one of the book’s merits that it can captivate the readers’ attention long enough, making them wonder about what will happen next and how it all will end, and how unpredictable characters can turn out.

208,257075106,01/05/2012,4.0,"Let me start by saying that I've watched the film adaptation years ago before I read my second Ian McEwan novel. And as in many cases, reading the book is more rewarding and satisfying. Atonement is about an adolescent girl, a fantasist, who commits a crime unforgivable and life-changing by sending to prison an innocent man, who's also her sister's lover. The precocious thirteen-year-old girl who's impatient to grow up is called Briony . As a favor to Robbie, her family's cleaner's son, she delivers to her sister, Cecilia, a letter he wrote in mindless passion, and which Briony reads sans permission. In a fateful incident involving a cousin raped, the eager Briony becomes more careless and bolder with her interpretation, completing the crime that she started, with little thought of the consequences. The first part of the book was a bit difficult to read, I must confess. Here, the writing style McEwan used doesn't quite move things along unlike in The Comfort of Strangers, where he used a more traditional, but very accurate description and which I admire. Besides, I've experienced how stream-of-consciousness can be effective in telling a story (See A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius). But near the end of the novel,in a rejection letter received by Briony, McEwan reveals his intention in experimenting with the style.  The same letter also explains why in the first part, the adolescent Briony used mature language. So one needs to suspend disbelief in Briony's abstractions, for instance, of returning to Tallis manor after daydreaming as the realignment with what had been before. And we soon find out that because Briony is no ordinary girl in a white frilly dress, giving her an adult voice worked beautifully. In the movie, Robbie and Cecilia meeting in the cafe is the most heartbreaking lovers' reunion I've ever seen on screen. In the book, I'm greater moved by the last letter Cecilia wrote to Robbie. We know that when he carried that letter with him during the war, it is not owing to sentiment, but a faithful clinging to life after the war, to a life with Cecilia.In part, by their forbidden love, and in part, by the precariousness of their situation, one feels that Robbie and Cecilia are the most tragic lovers. Five years after the crime, eighteen-year-old Briony manifests her guilt by submitting to physical hardship; she chooses to clean bedpans and to mop floors 12 hours a day as a nurse-in-training over spending her student life in Cambridge. Even in the end, Briony gets no reprieve; for the first time she sees her play, The Trials of Arabella, acted out by her cousin's grandchildren on her seventy-seventh birthday. Such endless reminders of that fateful day must never feel ancient, must always bring fresh guilt, even as she herself is fading. Can Briony ever be forgiven? Can we accept her atonement?I suppose, as a writer she felt and believed, that in confessing her crime in a book she wrote, she has atoned. But because she never actually sought Cecilia and Robbie's forgiveness while they were alive, the happy ending she desires for both,  the atonement, can only be created in fiction. Sadly, it is not the truth, but it's the truth that she can live with. ",6,0.8245,0.128,0.729,0.143,0.5706331168831169,POSITIVE,0.9911
209,2490195374,03/21/2019,3.0,"An ultimately half-baked exploration of guilt, regret and repentance, infused instead with upper class prattle on First World problems.My main criticism of Atonement is that it lacks focus. On an elemental level, McEwan’s prose is convoluted and almost consciously pretentious; relatively insignificant events are described to death with little effect, whilst the most engaging plot points are afforded absolutely no detail whatsoever (view spoiler)[this pivotal trial, for instance (hide spoiler)]. The ensemble renders the narrative a meandering slog which achieves very little. The narrative itself, in fact, seems to have no true aim or direction. The novel relies heavily on an unnecessary, though vaguely compelling, skew into World War II, and for no apparent reason. This shift in focus is not enlightening, or at all relevant to the original plot. It contributes nothing. But… war sells. It is a topic over which writers circle like vultures. The only object I can infer is that it would add some weight to an otherwise bloodless story, perhaps to suggest that there is something here at stake. Not only is this lazy writing, it falls under the category of one of my most detested plot devices: World War II serves no other function than as a melodramatic backdrop for a romance and to amplify the associated angst - because only in the presence of sadistic Fascist regimes and all their inconveniences can you prove your love for someone, right? The characters themselves are archetypal and prone to stereotype. Every member of the cast is entirely devoid of personality beyond a brief caricature, and only ever characterized by exposition. The classically bored, beautiful older sister. The sexually promiscuous cousin who gets her 'comeuppance'. The resigned and sensitive mother and unfaithful father. Then there’s the narcissistic teenager, vilified beyond all reason and yet never expressing or disclosing any plausible motive. (view spoiler)[Briony had a crush on Robbie, right? (hide spoiler)] The romance around which the central conflict revolves is at once absurd and repelling. Cecilia and Robbie do not connect on any emotional level, and there should be warning bells ringing if a come-on like that was all that was needed to orchestrate reciprocation. Robbie is reminiscent of George from A Room With A View: a predatory, horny stalker. Perhaps a relationship between two detestable characters was crucial to McEwan’s plans for the moral conflict it triggers within Briony. Either way, it’s extremely difficult to engage with or indeed to root for. All this culminates in a complete lack of investment - and it’s certainly never psychologically compelling.Atonement does little more than dance around deeper themes to an achingly predictable conclusion (view spoiler)[Of course it was Marshall. Didn’t fool me for a second. (hide spoiler)] It doesn’t delve into the complexity and implications of rape, guilt, loyalty or betrayal. It instead concerns the perils of a fanciful imagination and specious observations, without interrogating the antagonist’s objectives. The novel is, however, charged with a clear love for literature and the act of creation, for which I am grateful. But my overwhelming sentiment upon closing the book was disappointment and frustration. McEwan allocated disproportionate degrees of detail to the wrong sections, to the detriment of the prose and the authority of the novel overall. It’s too floral for its own good - turn your attention embellishments only once you’ve clarified your focus.",6,-0.9623,0.142,0.751,0.107,0.617440476190476,NEGATIVE,1.0

It just seemed to be on everyone else's top 100 lists, it had a high rating and the blurb sounded interesting.I am now half way through the book and I have no idea why anyone likes it.The plot is basically:Part 1 Blah blah blah blah blah blah. Followed by a Salem witch trial moment in which the thirteen year old protaganist vindictively points her finger at her sister's boyfriend and blames him for raping her cousin. Part 2I am going to read it as soon as I get this out but I am going to take a stab based purely on the picture on the front cover.Let's see how close I can get.Everyone is five years older. Boyfriend leaves prison and goes to war to fight on front line. Protaganist feels guilty. blah blah blah blah, Protaganist uncovers truth and feels less guilty. Boy and girl get back together after he is wounded somehow.The main antagonist, Briony, is a vindictive spoilt bitch. The whole book me of The Crucible with a touch of Virginia Andrews. Her character is oddly described, she is young and lacks knowledge and yet has these hugely complex thoughts. She is punishing the boyfriend and her sister for their sexuality.The author has done everything by the book, but the result lacks personality. I get the tone that he is trying to set, but I am bored by it. The descriptions are neither too long nor too short, and yet I am bored by them. I feel like has anaylsed what is required for a perfect book, has inserted all the require elements and changed the names. The book feels like a fill-in-the-blank book. I can see why this was turned into a movie, I think the cast and crew would have been able to film it on auto-pilot.The best bit of writing about the whole book is the back cover blurb. It is the only bit that is remotely interesting and it is probably the only reason so many copies have been sold.ETA: I have finished the rest of the book. The second part was a little more interesting but the third part was worse then the first. There was nothing original about the book.

211,1283527716,05/18/2015,4.0,"What I loved: the author's style of writing! I really enjoyed reading the excessive narrations and the thoughts of the characters in full description and I also loved the vivid use of adjectives and nouns in the story - I actually felt a bit as if I stood right behind the characters, because the language was so visual that it transported me to time and place of the story line. I could perfectly imagine how the estate of the Tallis and the characters looked like etc. But: the very pictorial representation was a bit terrifying when it came to the description of war wounds - I only could handle those parts by skimming through those pages because it was so nauseating. What I also liked were the characters - especially Briony was a really interesting protagonist for me because she was so unreckonable, imaginative and in search of big drama and a story for her to write (which she even received in the end) - she couldn't see the damage she'd caused until she was old enough to really understand it and even then she had problems to really explain WHY she'd done this. While I often read that people didn't like the first part of this book because it's too slow-paced and didn't get to the point, I have to admit, that it was probably my favourite part of the book: It was just fascinating to see the plot through different eyes and to realise how all of the perspectives complete each other and how all the events of this hot summer day in 1935 led to the one big misunderstanding that ruined the live of two people. I liked the other parts as well but it was the first 200whatever pages in which the foundation for the later storyline has been laid, it was the first 200whatever pages in which we had a look at the thoghts of all the characters and it was the first 200whatever pages in which I decided: This book is a masterpiece. And I loved the end, oh the end - I really was left in my bed, my head completely empty and just realised how brilliant this was. So here is what I didn't liked (that much) about the book: Actually I was a bit sad, when part one ended without really describing the aftermath of Brionys behaviour. You get an idea of the effects in part 2 and 3 but I think this could have been more elaborated - especially Cecilia's thoughts and feelings missed out a bit what I think is a pity because for her, turning her back on her whole family and trying to get along alone, don't get to see her love for three years, would have been interesting to read about. But nonetheless it was an exciting and captivating read and I liked the ending of the story pretty much, although --- SPOILER ALERT --- it wasn't a happy ending at all.",6,0.9922,0.056,0.807,0.137,0.5403174603174603,POSITIVE,0.7538
212,706215870,08/28/2013,4.0,"[rating = A-]Ian McEwan has a certain way of writing: a way that I like, but I can't fully identify why I like it. He breathlessly dives into the story and as easily comes back up for air and then goes right back down. This is probably his best known novel, though it seems all his novel after this one are very widely read. And yet, that does not make it his best. At times the story lags from an over-telling; there is an augmentation of plot that may be unnecessary. The only failure in the story is the attempt for atonement by Briony. This act itself shows that she is still that jealous, ignorant little girl who first ruined her sister's life. Still, the story is very endearing and rings with a delightful, if not tragic, sound of irony. Two different character perspectives are used to depict this story. These characters are essential to the development plot and certainly allows for a unique exhibition of what McEwan wants to say. The main ""moral"" that I got out of it is that is important to take everything with a grain of slat, not to jump to conclusions, and not to over-exaggerate the simple things in life. It is indecisive if our little novelist, the protagonist, gets her atonement, but I think she deserves some sort of reconciliation. Robbie narrates the second section of the novel. He is in the war (WWII) and is travelling back to England with two others in a retreat from the German attack. He laments his bad luck, people in prison were made to go into the army, and he speculates what could have been. His hate and indifference towards Briony fight for domain, and nicely personify the ongoing struggle of the war. The next two section are Briony's and in the them she visits Cecilia and sees her cousin (Lola). This cousin acts as an underlying subplot that actually initiated the main plot. Lola and Paul Marshal, the subplot, failed in its ability to surprise me; this, I think, was meant to be a big ""reveal"" yet it failed to startled me. Mr. McEwan is just too deft at his characters' psychology to make this revelation shocking (but that just goes to show how marvelous Ian McEwan is at writing).  A childhood destroyed and a love-life interrupted. The novel is wonderfully realistic and heartfelt in a way that sticks with the reader. A wonderful read that shows the minute (or major) actions people can take to make or break life, and I don't regret it taking over thee weeks to read.",6,0.2542,0.155,0.685,0.159,0.5027220533603513,POSITIVE,1.0

There are some really beautiful phrases and paragraphs, but Ian McEwan is just so depressing! He reminds me of Frank McCourt, except that I enjoy Frank McCourt's writing enough that I end up not hating his books, even if I won't seek them out anymore.Briony Tallis witnesses a moment’s flirtation between her older sister, Cecilia, and Robbie Turner, the son of a servant and Cecilia’s childhood friend. Unfortunately, Briony already fancies herself in love with the older Robbie, so does not rejoice in her sister's shared affection.Poor Robbie writes numerous drafts of a love letter to Cecilia that he intends Briony to deliver. He puts the wrong draft into the envelope, the draft that mentions his secret, not so pure desires using naughty words, and Briony reads it before Cecilia. It's this slip that seals poor Robbie's fate. Briony has a big imagination and precocious literary gifts–but no adult understanding of emotions and this disconnect brings about a lie that will change all their lives. The novel takes us through the aftermath of Briony's betrayal, World War II, Robbie's service, Cecilia's nursing career, and Briony's eventual nurse training, which gives way to her literary career.There are moments when McEwan tries to redeem Briony. One especially touching moment is when she comforts a dying soldier, but Briony is simply unredeemable to me. I disliked Briony so much that I had to force myself to keep reading. Even on this second reading, knowing how it truly ends, I was angry from the start and never seemed able to let that go.I can appreciate McEwan's unique and clever ending, I didn't enjoy it and it only cemented by anger.

It start with a slow, introspective pace, like Virginia Woolf, includes carefully drawn characters like Austen, and has an amazing ending, one that hits the reader like a 2 by 4. So beautifully done.SPOILER ALERT**************************The story open with Briony, the younger adolescent sister, who has written a play that will be put on for her arriving brother, Leon. The cast is to be her cousins, who are staying with the Tallis family due to the divorce of their parents. But then Briony sees something between her sister Cecilia and the maid’s son, Robbie. He has been promoted by Mr. Tallis, and sent to all the best schools, and gotten good grades. And because Briony has seen this thing that she doesn’t understand, she develops an anger at Robbie and a protection of her sister. As the events of the day unfold, Briony’s anger is further inflamed, and she tells a lie that changes Cecilia and Robbie’s lives forever.Then the book moves to the battlefield in France. Robbie and two other soldiers are making their way on foot to Dunkirk, for the British withdrawal. The scenes are vivid, and Robbie is propelled by love letters he has from Cecilia. These are some of the most well-written war scenes I have read.Briony has decided to give up the comfort of a Cambridge education, and becomes a nurse. This is her atonement. Nursing school is hell, and then the injured soldiers arrive. She nurses one French soldier who has half of his head blown off. Briony is still a writer, and she receives a rejection letter from a publisher for her story, which is quite helpful in telling her how to fix her story of two lovers.There is one other pivotal scene, and then the ending, which is a reunion of sorts. The ending is Briony telling us what is real and what is not, in the story the reader has just read. This is amazing, since the whole thing is fiction.

238,10994137,12/25/2007,4.0,"I like this book better the more I think about it. My initial reaction was that it was an elaborate bit of clever trickery, but the depth of the writing is what redeems it.favorite quotes (possible spoilers):Chapter 1At the age of eleven she wrote her first story—a foolish affair, imitative of half a dozen folktales and lacking, she realized later, that vital knowingness about the ways of the world which compels a reader’s respect. But this first clumsy attempt showed her that the imagination itself was a source of secrets: once she had begun a story, no one could be told. Pretending in words was too tentative, too vulnerable, too embarrassing to let anyone know. Even writing out the she saids, the and thens, made her wince, and she felt foolish, appearing to know about the emotions of an imaginary being. Self-exposure was inevitable the moment she described a character’s weakness; the reader was bound to speculate that she was describing herself. What other authority could she have? Only when a story was finished, all fates resolved and the whole matter sealed off at both ends so it resembled, at least in this one respect, every other finished story in the world, could she feel immune, and ready to punch holes in the margins, bind the chapters with pieces of string, paint or draw the cover, and take the finished work to show to her mother, or her father, when he was home. Her efforts received encouragement. In fact, they were welcomed as the Tallises began to understand that the baby of the family possessed a strange mind and a facility with words. The long afternoons she spent browsing through dictionary and thesaurus made for constructions that were inept, but hauntingly so: the coins a villain concealed in his pocket were “esoteric,” a hoodlum caught stealing a car wept in “shameless auto-exculpation,” the heroine on her thoroughbred stallion made a “cursory” journey through the night, the king’s furrowed brow was the “hieroglyph” of his displeasure. Writing stories not only involved secrecy, it also gave her all the pleasures of miniaturization. A world could be made in five pages, and one that was more pleasing than a model farm….Her passion for tidiness was also satisfied, foran unruly world could be made just so. The pages of a recently finished story seemed to vibrate in her hand with all the life they contained. Chapter 2It made no sense, she knew, arranging flowers before the water was in—but there it was; she couldn’t resist moving them around, and not everything people did could be in a correct, logical order, especially when they were alone.Chapter 3Was everyone else really as alive as she was?… Was being Cecilia just as vivid an affair as being Briony? Did her sister also have a real self concealed behind a breaking wave, and did she spend time thinking about it, with a finger held up to her face? Did everybody, including her father, Betty, Hardman? If the answer was yes, then the world, the social world, was unbearably complicated, with two billion voices, and everyone’s thoughts striving in equal importance and everyone’s claim on life as intense, and everyone thinking they were unique, when no one was. One could drown in irrelevance. A story was a form of telepathy. By means of inking symbols onto a page, she was able to send thoughts and feelings from her mind to her reader’s. It was a magical process, so commonplace that no one stopped to wonder at it.It was a temptation for her to be magical and dramatic, and to regard what she had witnessed as a tableau mounted for her alone, a special moral for her wrapped in a mystery. But she knew very well that if she had not stood when she did, the scene would still have happened, for it was not about her at all. Only chance had brought her to the window.None of these three was bad, nor were they particularly good. She need not judge. There did not have to be a moral. She need only show separate minds, as alive as her own, struggling with the idea that other minds were equally alive. It wasn’t only wickedness and scheming that made people unhappy, it was confusion and misunderstanding; above all, it was the failure to grasp the simple truth that other people are as real as you. And only in a story could you enter these different minds and show how they had an equal value. That was the only moral a story need have.Chapter 4She lolled against the warm stone, lazily finishing her cigarette and contemplating the scene before her—the foreshortened slab of chlorinated water, the black inner tube of a tractor tire propped against a deck chair, the two men in cream linen suits of infinitesimally different hues, bluishgray smoke rising against the bamboo green. It looked carved, fixed, and again, she felt it: it had happened a long time ago, and all outcomes, on all scales—from the tiniest to the most colossal—were already in place. Whatever happened in the future, however superficially strange or shocking, would also have an unsurprising, familiar quality, inviting her to say, but only to herself, Oh yes, of course. That. I should have known.Chapter 7But of course, it had all been her—by her and about her—and now she was back in the world, not one she could make, but the one that had made her, and she felt herself shrinking under the early evening sky.She decided she would stay there and wait until something significant happened to her. This was the challenge she was putting to existence—she would not stir, not for dinner, not even for her mother calling her in. She would simply wait on the bridge, calm and obstinate, until events, real events, not her own fantasies, rose to her challenge, and dispelled her insignificance.Chapter 8Despite his first, the study of English literature seemed in retrospect an absorbing parlor game, and reading books and having opinions about them, the desirable adjunct to a civilized existence.Part 2“I’ll wait for you. Come back.”He walked/across/the land/until/he came/to the sea.It was madness to go to the man’s defense, it was loathsome not to. At the same time, Turner understood the exhilaration among the tormentors and the insidious way it could claim him. He himself could do something outrageous with his bowie knife and earn the love of a hundred men. To distance the thought he made himself count the two or three soldiers in the circle he reckoned bigger or stronger than himself. But the real danger came from the mob itself, its righteous state of mind. It would not be denied its pleasures.PART 3For a while she thought of herself as a kind of medical Chaucer, whose wards thronged with colorful types, coves, topers, old hats, nice dears with a sinister secret to tell. In later years she regretted not being more factual, not providing herself with a store of raw material. It would have been useful to know what happened, what it looked like, who was there, what was said. At the time, the journal preserved her dignity: she might look and behave like and live the life of a trainee nurse, but she was really an important writer in disguise. And at a time when she was cut off from everything she knew—family, home, friends—writing was the thread of continuity. It was what she had always done.What excited her about her achievement was its design, the pure geometry and the defining uncertainty which reflected, she thought, a modern sensibility. The age of clear answers was over. So was the age of characters and plots. Despite her journal sketches, she no longer really believed in characters. They were quaint devices that belonged to the nineteenth century. The very concept of character was founded on errors that modern psychology had exposed. Plots too were like rusted machinery whose wheels would no longer turn. A modern novelist could no more write characters and plots than a modern composer could a Mozart symphony. It was thought, perception, sensations that interested her, the conscious mind as a river through time, and how to represent its onward roll, as well as all the tributaries that would swell it, and the obstacles that would divert it. If only she could reproduce the clear light of a summer’s morning, the sensations of a child standing at a window, the curve and dip of a swallow’s flight over a pool of water. The novel of the future would be unlike anything in the past. She had read Virginia Woolf’s The Waves three times and thought that a great transformation was being worked in human nature itself, and that only fiction, a new kind of fiction, could capture the essence of the change. To enter a mind and show it at work, or being worked on, and to do this within a symmetrical design—this would be an artistic triumph.She learned a simple, obvious thing she had always known, and everyone knew: that a person is, among all else, a material thing, easily torn, not easily mended.Might she come between them in some disastrous fashion? Yes, indeed. And having done so, might she obscure the fact by concocting a slight, barely clever fiction and satisfy her vanity by sending it off to a magazine? The interminable pages about light and stone and water, a narrative split between three different points of view, the hovering stillness of nothing much seeming to happen—none of this could conceal her cowardice. Did she really think she could hide behind some borrowed notions of modern writing, and drown her guilt in a stream—three streams!—of consciousness? The evasions of her little novel were exactly those of her life. Everything she did not wish to confront was also missing from her novella—and was necessary to it. What was she to do now? It was not the backbone of a story that she lacked. It was backbone.London, 1999No atonement for God, or novelists, even if they are atheists.

239,496581027,01/05/2013,1.0,"I love the movie. I really do. However, there are special cases where the book is less vibrant than its adaptation and for me Atonement is one of them. If you haven't watch the movie yet, please do. It is one of my favorite movie of all time with great actors, actresses, cinematography and music and still have the ability to make me bawl.Atonement is about the cowardice of a girl who think she knew everything and made a terrible mistake that tore apart the lives of her sister and her love because of a lie. The novel have won multiple of awards and claims for the writer's own prose and literary merits that I was surprised to experience how badly this novel behaved to me. I could say, I was fooled by Joe Wright's expertise that I never would have expected how badly constructed this book is.I'm not kidding.I do read classical works but I don't read much from the literary fiction genre but I do when I was really young. All of my utter distaste of the genre was reflected completely by this book. But I couldn't find a fault in trying but I did read so all of this is my opinion alone despite the long list of critical acclaim that this book have. I, however, am not pleased. (And started to sound british at this point)Written in four parts, Atonement is a false-memoir and a romance that should have inspire some sort of feeling in it which I never seem to find anywhere among the inconsistent narrating which blind even the most intuitive readers into embracing this shit. The first part of the book which was bloated with unending prose that seemingly would frighten anyone who dare to disregard the genius of the man called McEwan. I was stunned by the ridiculousness of what I was about to immerse myself into as soon as I brace the essays (yes) of Briony Tallis. In the adaptation, we are consistently aware of Briony as a writer by the clever typewriting sounds but in the book, we are constantly aware that Briony as self-absorbed writer who is so attuned to praises of her ability and her upbringing made her think she was an adult enough for situations that she think she knows but stupid enough not to be thorough in the first place.Among other things, beside the occasional speaking lines, McEwan seems to have attention-deficit-inducing syndrome with his writing.Yes, I know it was intended to reflect a thirteen year old point of view as a creative decision but at the end it provided a paradox where the author himself is writing a female version of himself into the book where the female version is writing about herself as the child and the young adult version of herself for most of the story. This confused me a lot at the beginning as it does at the end. Because I know how the story goes, so I wasn't as surprised by the resolution, instead, curiously, I found multitudes of plot holes in this.Is that what literary fiction supposed to be? Hundred of pages of mindless writing with unimportant information wedge in an endless paragraph that begs for a heavy duty yellow highlighter?Even the physicality of the book is deceiving. Because of the seemingly lack of consistent paragraphing and the tiny font would made one who have perfectly good reading sight to question its own ability to read. However, curiously if you increase the font to suit your reading comfort, you could only see unending lines and if you read closely, it doesn't even mean anything but redundant ramblings!What made Atonement comfortable to be seen in the the form of a movie was the fact that Joe Wright was able to use the scene and fluently interpret it faithfully according to the novel. You don't really need to read a long paragraph when you could only see talented people doing everything non-verbally in several camera shots.In fact, most of my favorite moment in the movie was the non-verbal parts which would be ridiculous that I would hate the book..... and yet I did.I was trying to get into the mood of reading this book but I was intrinsically aware that I was almost halfway into the book and realize I was nowhere in the middle of the story where everything converge itself. I never seem to escape the bloated writings until Robbie's part of the story years after the first part of the book. Here is where I realized the limitation where McEwan has put himself into. Maybe because he was able to be a man in the writing, he was able to translate himself well as Robbie than him as Briony. Robbie's voice only occurs several times in this book although briefly to allow more Briony into the storyline, but I found this is the only part that I identified where the book have soul in it. (However, it wouldn't be Atonement if the guy just wrote Robbie's story so...) Robbie's experience in war while reminiscing his stolen time with Cecilia and the letters was more pronounced in the book than the movie. Here as a man wrongly accused and was still suffering from the past which never seem to escape him, this was the part where the novel blossomed its core to the eyes.But it didn't last.Because this is also where Briony Tallis became Nurse Tallis. Curiously, the writing went from bloated to soulful to clinical in one go. Maybe because it was intended as that as a trainee nurse, but I seem to remember I was familiar with hospital setting and here I was faced by the most unsatisfactory realization where how some of these was also avoidable. Then I realized that at this point McEwan is really trying to make everything a tragedy without thinking how problematic his plot would become ; just by including Robbie's intention to be a doctor and both Cee and Briony as nurses.The last time I checked, Robbie was a very well read student of both literature and basic medicine. He was already studying anatomy and psychology so wouldn't it be so suicidal to not consider reading up on basic pathology. In fact, he did want to go back to medical school after war and was consistently discussing with Cee about her life as a nurse and the subsequent cleverness in his military training that even several corporal was tagging along with him then wouldn't it be so idiotic and unconventional for an aspiring doctor to not take care of his injuries in the first place or not to realize something is wrong?Maybe because it was Briony's take on Robbie's condition from the letters she received but it soon again we're overcome by another of those deary Briony narrating where she was cast into a tragic guilt-ridden character until the end of the third part of the book where we saw the resolution happening so suddenly. Perhaps as a way to satisfy the readers as the elder Briony maintained herself.But.... when compared as a whole, the later part seems to be rushed and frankly never seem to look like it was done with the considerate 'care' like it was disjointed after the author's whole energy was spent perusing the first part under a microscope. Had the parts been consistent, it would have translated well in the novel.And I don't even start on the whole character analysis from Cecilia, Emily, Paul Marshal, the twins and down to Lola incident. Like seriously, I could even start comparing how ""Kasih Yang Suci"" is really familiar with this book. I don't even have to go to the love scene. How is it one could make a love scene sounded sterile?Frankly, the book is never about atoning anything. Its about Ian McEwan telling a short story and blew it up to make a redundant novel. Oh, of course, it was intended to be that way. Its literary fiction.There are some part of the book which I like because of the movie but most of all, I'd rather stick to watching the movie instead of scanning a couple of pages of lines and trying to find the exact place where I like because Mr McEwan's intense dislike of paragraphing made my effort useless in non-ebook form.",5,0.9797,0.089,0.801,0.11,0.4760326834145733,NEGATIVE,0.9966
240,9349084,11/20/2007,4.0,"Funny story about how I came to read Ian McEwan's novel, Atonement.It must have been a year-and-a-half ago when my old college pal Chris recommended it to me (you know Chris as a frequent credit on the more interesting links posted around here). I acknowledged his suggestion, filed it in the back of my mind, and, as I do with so many book suggestions, expected to let it incubate there--remembering it when I browsed bookstores, perking up to reviews and commentary about it, and waiting for the moment when the spirit strikes to finally pick it up and read it.Chris was more persistent than most folks who suggest titles to me. He emailed me one-liners: ""Have you read it yet?"" He not-so-casually mentioned it in longer letters. He recommended no other books--not a single title escaped his lips except for Atonement--and he generally conveyed the message that id I didn't read Ian McEwan's novel, our friendship would wither and die.So I picked it up at the Boston Public Library last summer. I informed Chris of that fact, rather satisfied with myself, and I started reading.I read slower than usual, as my already dubious habit of three-books-at-atime didn't translate well into my summer lifestyle, where, between a dayjob and overnight live-in position, I was pretty much on someone else's clock 24 hours a day.Sixty pages in, I had to renew Atonement. Then I renewed it again. And finally I was told that some other anxious person was in line for my copy (probably Chris' cousin or something), and I had to return it. I intended on taking out another copy the next day--and was told that there was a lenghty waiting list.'What the hell,' I thought. 'I'm moving in a few weeks anyway, and I'm reading the book so slow, I may as well be illiterate. I haven't a prayer of finishing it.'As shamefacedly as one can be over email, I told Chris. He was not impressed.Several weeks later, I was still on a high whenever I got mail at my new Detroit address. Yup, this is where I live! This is my place in the world--and the U.S. Postal Service acknowledges it!Best of all, of course, is packages of books. Since I set up shop here in the Internet, I've had the privilege of receiving a lot of interesting titles, ones I might not have had the chance to check out otherwise, and the best of which I enthusiastically tell you, dear reader, all about.But one of my first book packages in Detroit wasn't from a publisher or a publicist. It was from Chris. You can imagine what he deigned to mail me.He said he figured I'd never read it if he didn't put his copy directly in my hands. Which is true.And so I read Atonement, much more quickly this time. My first Ian McEwan title. And with all that preleude, here, finally, is my verdict.Atonement is a smart, well put-together novel that--as you probably know from the upcoming film adaptation's publicity, if nowhere else--is grounded in the wonderful character of Briony Tallis, and the horrible thing she does one day in 1935, when she is ten-years old. That act spins through the lives of others--particularly Cecilia, who is Briony's older sister, and Robbie, the man Cecilia loves--for years, well beyond World War II.McEwan does tricks with omniscence that us lesser writers can only dream about. Atonement is a delightfully patient novel; it builds tension not in traditional linear style (""what happens next?"") but in a circular manner (""what actually happened? how? why?"")In a novel that conscpicuously manipulates the repetition of scenes and revelation, Atonement qualifies as a craft lesson on how to maintain the profuluence of a plot--the engine that moves the story forward--when it keeps spinning back to the same moments. It's quite a feat, actually, and McEwan has my utmost respect for achieving it: suspense built into an obsessive narrative hinged on a single thunderous day.And speaking of supsense, Atonement got more interesting as it went on. The first section of the book really does plod a bit (it wasn't just me!); a lot of pausing in a moment and looking about for pages and pages; enough technical description of the house and grounds where Briony's crime takes place, that McEwan may as well have provided an annotated map.Looking back, I realize the intentionality of the initial slowness. Much of the groundwork for McEwan's tricks with omniscience is laid out; and the narrative mimics the memory of Briony, Robbie, and Cecilia, who will later compulsively re-enact every moment and every detail of the day-and-a-half covered by the novel's fist section.I understand that. I still think it should've been edited down by about 35 pages.Not that it's a huge chore to read. As the book moves forward, changing what you thought you knew about the preceding pages, the experience of both familiarity and surprise is a joy. And the final pages of Atonement are a fascinating consideration of the craft of fiction, of creation and imagination, and of how it simultaneously enable the very best and the very worst in us.Which, for this passionate reader and writer, is a thought that uncomfortably sits on the mind.So let me say, once and for all: Thank you, Chris, for the recommendation. I look forward to more. And I might even have a few of my own.",5,0.991,0.046,0.86,0.094,0.4590332839674945,NEGATIVE,0.9997

To add to the cast of the novel there are three cousins from ""the north"" come to stay with the family whilst their parents divorce. Lola is a 15 year old adolescent and the two boys are identical twins. We also have the housekeepers son Robbie who has enjoyed the patronage of the absent Father and has also recently returned from University.Some quite bizarre things happen on that day in 1935. Briony is forcing her cousins to rehearse a play she wrote for her bother's homecoming party in the evening until she has a revelation about what it means to be a writer. She confesses to the reader that she loves creating order out of chaos and writing novels allows her to do just that, she then goes on to view the all the events of the day as the draft of a novel she needs to push into some semblance of order. The reader is then treated to the same bizarre scene from three different narrators points of view, Robbie and Cecilia manage to break a priceless vase by a fountain and two of the pieces fall in the water. Cecilia strips down to her underwear in front of Robbie and submerges herself in the water to retrieve the broken vase. Cecilia sees this as an annoying interlude to her day, Robbie sees it as an erotic strip tease and Briony is very confused by the scene. Later that day Robbie writes two drafts of a note to Cecilia, a perfectly polite apology for breaking the vase and a second sexually charged note. He asks Briony to deliver the note but accidentally gives her the sexual one. Briony reads this and with the help of her cousin, comes to the assumption that Robbie is a sexual predator. Cecilia reads the note and almost instantly realises she loves Robbie and starts having sex with him in the library. Briony catches them in the act and thinks Robbie is raping her sister. Meanwhile, the cousin Lola is being raped by the brother's friend - which is only hinted at in the novel.At dinner the plot device, known as the twins, runs away. Thus giving the whole family an excuse to be out in the darkness. In the darkness Briony stumbles across her cousin being raped again, puts two and two together to make 5 and accuses Robbie who gets arrested and put in prison.Part two follows Robbie's experiences in France during World War 2 and is actually interesting until it cuts off abruptly never to be spoken about again and cuts back to the insufferable Briony for part 3. Briony is 18 now and a trainee nurse and to be fair, the section is quite action packed and interesting. Briony seems to have grown as a character and the militarised environment of the hospital sucked all the superfluous descriptions out of her narration. The section ends with her witnessing the marriage of Lola and her rapist before Briony visits her sister and Robbie who are still together despite five years of everybody believing Robbie raped Lola which forced Cecilia to cut contact with her family. Briony agrees to begin telling the truth to all her family in order to clear Robbie's name when it stops and Part four begins.The last section of the book sees Briony as an old woman. She has become a famous author and is nearing death but she has one book left to publish. The book you are reading! Yes, the whole book has been narrated by Briony, the epitome of an unreliable narrator. To me that ending is only one step away from ""it was all a dream"". To top off the cheesiness of the book, we end with a production of the play Briony was attempting to produce at the start of the novel.This book gets a one star rating from me because it's whole agenda seems to be to show the reader how much power the author has over a story rather than actually telling a story. I am just not a fan of Modernist self congratulating themes but I can see that there are myriad themes and motifs to dissect if you are so inclined. Just not my cup of tea.",5,-0.9896,0.105,0.82,0.075,0.497094017094017,POSITIVE,0.9499

An extraordinary piece of literature. I'm glad to have taken the time & effort to read it.
I'll start by saying again. What an extraordinary piece of literature. I saw the movie years ago. I found it interesting, yet a little confusing. I was really not sure what to expect from the book. It seems to get mixed reviews. Some hate it. Some love it. I lean very close to the latter and feel a great deal of respect toward the author and his offering. My personal opinion is that those who may not care for this book maybe didn't read far enough in to get its rhythm. I myself admit that at first reaction I thought it wordy and wondered where exactly all of this was going. However, once I delved further in to my surprise I was enamored with a comprehension that this was not just a bevy of extra words. This was skill. This was detail, extreme and thorough. This was not a dictionary romp this was a complex example of what writing should be. It took for me to read a good bit in to get the full rhythm of the authors writing style. But something within me felt that if I press on, not allowing its complexity to daunt me, I'd be rewarded in the end. I was. I don't really read books twice. There are too many books I desire to read for the first time. But this book, I'd read again. I'd linger on the verses. Stopping periodically to turn over their meaning. I'd quote profound thoughts. I'd contemplate the words used. I'd look them up to capture the full weight of their depth. I consider my reading a type of education in my constant preparation for that day when I finally have my own photo in the jacket of a book. This book is most definitely one of the classes I've attended dutifully. I wouldn't want to detract a single element by giving some brief summary of what this book is about. I think it's really beyond any little adjectives of appreciation that I could conjure. Although I will try. This is a complex story within a story. I always love those when they are done well because to succeed it must be done well. There is the real story of Briony, Leon, Cecilia, Robbie, Lola, Marshall and the twins... And there is the fictional one. These lives, these characters intertwine in an account of misconstrued truth vs lies vs passion vs pain tangled with emotion and the raw reality of war. The setting? There is too much to try to tell. The landscape of the country house. 1940's London and the military hospitals during the war. And of course the brutal frenzy of the British soldiers retreat to the French coast. All of this delivered in such painstakingly researched and great detail that the reader can picture every single bit down to the very sense of doom in the air or touch of gritty sand grains through the fingers. I liked that historically this book taught me a lot. It was interesting to go right into the hospitals treating the war wounded military. How the staff attempted to be ready and weren't. How things seemed so primitive from my 2014 perspective. I'm so curious about the WWII first hand accounts and I was glued to the pages during this part of the book. I wanted ""the lovers"" to be together and the liars to go to hell, or experience it at least. I do not forgive the biggest culprit, personally. The author, for whatever discretion he was in an attempt to atone for, he has received but the biggest culprit, she doesn't receive my atonement. I'll give this a 5 star. (Remembering that my top score is 7.) I will read other books by this author. I do recommend this and deem it a classic read. I recommend that the perspective reader push far enough in and that connection will be found. Once I connected with certain characters.. I've closed the book and they are still with me. This is a saga that I won't soon forget or wish for an alternate ending. ",5,0.9801,0.047,0.856,0.097,0.4803244980328313,POSITIVE,0.9994
247,11881653,01/07/2008,5.0,"A few years ago, I was reading an issue of Granta, and found myself immersed in a short story by Ian McEwan. It was one of the best stories I'd ever read, and when I finished reading it, it was one of the few times I've ever thought, God, I wish I could have written that. I wanted that control of language, that mastery of the narrative, and I was in awe of the skill it took to create that piece.Eventually, I recycled that issue of Granta -- it's a thick journal, as literary journals go, about 250 pages in each issue -- but before doing so, I was careful to cut out the pages the McEwan story was on, and clip them together with a binder clip. I'm sure that story is still somewhere in my childhood home; I could never bring myself to get rid of it, in any of my periodic cleaning sweeps.Imagine my shock, when today, trying to distract myself from the pain in my foot, I tugged down Ian McEwan's Atonement, and found that short story again. The retreat from Dunkirk is about 190 pages into my copy of the novel (yes, I read it all today, I'm a really fast reader and I was concentrating because my foot hurt like a -- well), and re-reading it, with the preceding chapters still fresh in my mind, settled the matter for me. I was right to cut out those pages, and I'm still in awe of the skill McEwan wields.I'd been plunged into a very different world for almost two hundred pages, caught up by the lush language and the intimacy of the family setting, and then suddenly to be confronted with the violence of the retreat from Dunkirk, still cloaked in McEwan's incredible way of writing, was just amazing. And the plot, which begins slowly, is ultimately very satisfying; it's never resolved traditionally, we're never sure of what happened, but it's tied up so neatly, with the stunning twist at the end of the part of the novel written in third-person, which is so tiny you might not notice, that it becomes something far more than we expected.Everyone, I suspect, knows my love for unreliable narrators and epistolary fiction narrative-within-narrative, and this satisfies those kinks in the most subtle way I've ever come across. Add the fantastic use of language, the complexity and completeness of the universe (the throwaways are just amazing in their richness), and the excellent characterization, and there is no way I wasn't going to love this. The fact that McEwan writes rape -- and adolescent rape at that -- wasn't enough to put me off, although I wish we followed Lola as well; watching how the rape played out for the convicted Robbie and the accuser Briony (and it's a nice touch separating the victim from the accuser) as well as Cecelia, who's torn between her family and her lover (and possibly I really fell for her when she deliberately turned her back on her family -- I didn't like her much through the first part, but when she chooses Robbie and sticks by him, and when she doesn't give in when Briony visits, I was enchanted), but I had no real sense of what happened to Lola internally, right after the rape. The marriage is a fascinating thing, but...I'd have liked a scene in which she suggests, a little, a very little, that maybe it wasn't Robbie and Briony insists, ""I know it was him, I saw him, I know it was him,"" and she gives way under the considerable force of Briony's personality.But as I say, I'm not rational about this. This is a story I love, and will be rereading, not just for the pleasure of the novel, but in order to learn from it.",5,0.995,0.094,0.735,0.17,0.5592701863354037,POSITIVE,0.9995
248,1069181197,10/01/2014,1.0,"Honestly, I hated this book. If it were not required for class, I would not have finished it. I see this as Ian McEwan's pointless ramblings mixed in with a manly idea of sexual assault and how women react to it. Briony, although certainly annoying and overly zealous, is painted as the villain of the story, while also being the narrator. Yes, she makes a terrible mistake, but no one is willing to forgive her even though she asks for forgiveness and retracts her statement, rather than acting like a coward. I don't think Briony deserves the role of villain, and I certainly don't think Robbie deserved the role of hero. And honestly, the love story between Cecelia and Robbie was extremely unrealistic. There is no way a woman could completely abandon her family for a man she hasn't seen in more than half a decade, whom she only decided she loved one day before he disappeared from her life. I have to believe that eventually she would concede and at least speak with her parents, if not Briony. But no, Cecelia stands by her man like a loyal housewife. In reality, there is no way this romance would have lasted. Love is not some overpowering thing that leads us to abandon all we've ever known in life, it is simply a relationship with a person. But this relationship proves to me that this is a boys' book, meant for men to read in order to feel good about Robbie's triumph and Cecelia's undying loyalty.This idea is also exemplified by the character of Lola, who reacts to her rape by marrying her rapist. Briony also claims that Lola would defend Paul Marshall (her husband and attacker) to death. Of course McEwan would write a sad, pushover female character that readily gave her life away to be with the man that ruined it. The only seemingly strong female character is Briony, and she is painted as an idiot and also the sinner within the story. At first I hated Briony as a character as well. So basically, none of the characters made me feel anything positive. Towards the end when she has grown she is much less annoying and I began to identify with her struggle for ""atonement."" But in the beginning she was a clueless child and I didn't much like listening to the pointless ramblings inside her head.For the majority of the book I was bored. I felt that 300 pages could have been cut out, and McEwan's simple point would have gotten across just fine. Also, his inclusion of the war seemed pretty pointless and to have nothing to do with the story, other than to add to Robbie's struggles and beg the reader to sympathize with the wounded, heartbroken male character.Let's not forget that Briony ends up being the narrator all along, and compares herself to Virginia Woolf. Ha, as if we don't notice this is McEwan's way of subtly trying to compare himself to Woolf. But his style is nothing like hers, making him come off as extremely pretentious. Come on, you can't compare your own prose to a famous author within your own prose. Also, McEwan's claim that the novelist is like God cannot be forgotten.",5,-0.873,0.164,0.683,0.154,0.5980850781871191,NEGATIVE,1.0

The Beginning: The play – for which Briony had designed the posters, programmes and tickets, constructed the sales booth out of a folding screen tipped on its side, and lined the collection box in red crêpe paper – was written by her in a two-day tempest of composition, causing her to miss a breakfast and a lunch.

This book is very special. I find it hard to describe it and what it was that made it so amazing. I think it was clever beyond my ability to either explain or understand. A true masterpiece.It is quite impossible these days to assume anything about people’s educational level from the way they talk or dress or from their taste in music. Safest to treat everyone you meet as a distinguished intellectual.First of all, the plot is brilliantly thought out. 13 year-old Briony witnesses a scene between her older sister and her childhood friend. Being very imaginative, she misunderstands the situation and, later, makes an accusation that will change the lives of all the characters.Ian McEwan really knows how to write characters, making them seem so real. In this book, I felt I’d known them for years, known their dark sides and annoying little habits, after just a few pages. McEwan is the master of creating characters like these and he keeps amazing me.Cecilia wondered, as she sometimes did when she met a man for the first time, if this was the one she was going to marry, and whether it was this particular moment she would remember for the rest of her life – with gratitude, or profound and particular regret.Last, but definitely not least, we have the writing. Beautiful and very descriptive. He can use pages describing something, but it never gets dull! He does it to make the readers see the nuances, and it is served to us beautifully. I already long for my next Ian McEwan book – so much that I dreamed last night that I started reading one!

251,5172926,08/27/2007,4.0,"I blazed through this the first time I read it. While I remembered most of the big plots points, there was plenty I forgot.On a second read, there's a lot I'm surprised I had forgotten - so much of this book is extremely vivid. I'm glad they've made it into a movie, because so many of the scenes beg for cinematic treatment. I've obviously never fought in a war, but the way McEwan writes it... he either must've been in one himself or really studied the matter, because his portrayal feels very accurate.The writing style is very graceful. It's an easy read, but not without charm. He relies heavily on tension, and there's plenty of it in this story - a young girl, Briony, oversees various interactions between her older sister, Cecilia, and the house keeper's son, Robbie. She takes her misunderstandings as a chance to put the spotlight on herself and ends up driving a wedge between the family that she spends the rest of her life trying to atone for. Yet, oddly, while there's plenty of tension throughout the story, he allows for there to be few climaxes and dramatic moments - often he divulges the most alarming and exciting news in the most casual way, almost like an afterthought.One of the things that makes this so particularly good is that he creates a great balance of character and plot. There's a lot of action going on in the story, but his characters don't buckle under the weight of it all. Quite the opposite, in fact - they flourish. As in real life, their experiences help develop their characters, and how they handle their lot in the war shows a great deal about who they are, were, and become.I have to say, though, the ending feels a bit like a cop-out. It works, but after all of the tension and excitement of the rest of it, you want an ending that suits it - which he acknowledges - but what's the point of saying ""I know I can't give this a proper ending"" after the rest of the book is so magnificent?

252,26673230,07/08/2008,3.0,"This created such a stir when it came out that I borrowed my brother-in-law’s copy to see what the fuss was about — sadly, not as much as I’d hoped. The story opens at a large country house on a stifling hot summer day in 1935. The central character, Briony, an irritating tweenie with an overactive imagination who fancies herself an author, has just finished writing a play that she wants to put on for her visiting older brother and his friend. Also on the scene are her obnoxious cousins, whom she is supposed to be nice to because their parents are getting a divorce, a mother who is AWOL with a “migraine”, a father who is busy with something else, her older sister, and their housekeeper’s handsome son Robbie, who’s getting ready to attend medical school. Briony witnesses a couple of encounters between her sister and Robbie (one rather graphic, so brace yourself) that she doesn’t understand, and then is party to a deception that wildly changes the course of their lives. The second section of the book takes place five years later and follows Robbie, now in the army, as he retreats to Dunkirk. The third section returns to Briony, who is working as a nurse as part of her “atonement” for what she did, and the final part takes place at her 77th birthday party. While sections are beautifully written, overall I thought it lacked unity, and some of the characters were so irritating that I just wanted to slap them and close the book. Frankly I enjoyed the movie far more, which I know makes me sound like a philistine, but at least the film was cohesive. ",5,0.8038,0.042,0.872,0.086,0.4712585034013606,NEGATIVE,0.8599

Let me count the ways.(I thought I should start out by attempting McEwan-ish levels of pretention.)Successfully avoided the movie, but was ultimately unable to dodge the book.I listened to this on cd, and I knew I was in trouble when, out of 12 discs, absolutely nothing happened until disc 5. Then, right after something finally did happen (and something fairly interesting, at that), the reader is trundled off to fight World War II. All of it. Day by endless day. Exhausted and shell-shocked, the reader is given no respite, but immediately transported from the front lines to London, and required to attend nursing school.Finally, after much bedpan cleaning and a cameo by a guy whose brains are being held in place by gauze, we learn why (back in the beginning of the book) Briony comes across as simultaneously precocious and impossibly innocent. Because she’s not real. She’s not meant to be real, even in the confines of the fictional world she lives in. McEwan pulls the rug out from under the reader at the very end, and expects us to marvel at the sleight of hand. Instead, I moan at the tragic fact that the author had *two* chances to tell us a compelling story-- what “really happened”, and what the author thought was a better story than what really happened-- and failed both times.I would be hard pressed to name a novel that I thought was more turgid (thanks to Linda C.-- that was indeed the perfect adjective) and “full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.”",5,-0.8292,0.132,0.765,0.103,0.4920493197278911,NEGATIVE,0.9993

The world of letters is lucky to have him, but once you've encountered his soul-freezing storytelling, you may never recover.One member of my book club remarked that the psychological depth to the character development in Atonement is more reminiscent of great Russian novels than typical western character-drama novels. I think that's a fair assessment, but I would add that I also felt a kinship to the tragedies of the Greek writers, or of Shakespeare; the slow unraveling of events, set off like a domino chain by a single mistake, carries that same feeling of dawning horror and inevitability.The prose is clear, careful, articulate; every detail finely drawn and perfectly placed to construct a flawlessly balanced whole. The characters, while not always likeable, are layered and well-rounded and sympathetic. Atonement is everything I could ask for in a novel.But I also hated it, because it leaves me wanting more--more resolution, some final piece to turn suffering into catharsis. We are left, at the end, unsure of whether Briony has in fact achieved atonement for her crime which she so desperately craves. The coda, rather than providing closure, leaves us with an even bigger question mark.It takes a certain level of brilliance as an author, I suppose, to inflict this kind of existential discomfort on your readers that lingers long after the pages are closed.

285,18111847,03/19/2008,4.0,"Atonement is divided into four sections. The first part describes in minute detail a series of events that will change the lives of everyone involved. The second is about World War II, specifically the Dunkirk evacuation in the spring of 1940. The other two parts: I’ll get to them.PART ONE: Briony Tallis mistakenly accuses her sister’s lover, Robbie Turner, of rape. Atonement starts strong. McEwan takes nearly half the novel to tell us what can be summarized in one sentence, yet he chose not to. That choice is really the shining jewel of the novel, as Part One held me in continuous thrall. The regularity with which McEwan kills it is just astounding. The sentences are economical, not flowery in the least, and when strung-together, somehow elevate the most abjectly mundane aspects of life to utmost importance. He is a master of ""show, not tell,"" and his most hardworking tools are the minds of his characters: their private thoughts, processes, and personalities. These juxtapose artfully, yet so smoothly, with characters’ perceptions. For example, when the lens is through Briony's eyes, you learn small things about Cecilia, and these small things stack up to create a person. Then we switch to Cecilia's thoughts, and they flesh out (or contradict) the clues Briony gave us. And so on, until you realize you are witnessing a very realistic character study. It is like glass bricks swinging and locking together in their quest to form a wall.(An example: Emily Tallis, the household matriarch, suffers from migraine in the days before modern treatment and medication. We know this because Briony and Cecilia let us know about it; Cecilia regards her mother as more of an absent figure, and Briony is rather protective of her. Then, during Emily's chapter, we catch a glimpse of how her illness has indelibly marked her. The very way she thinks and processes information, her circuitous interactions with people, her way of putting out her ""feelers"" to absorb information without having to expend much energy -- this is all a result of developing ways to avoid headaches. It sounds so simple and boring when I describe it, but it's lush and so, so telling when McEwan shows you.)In this manner, a foundation is laid. We now know the players intimately, perhaps more intimately than they know themselves. While it may seem like indulgent over-writing, it’s all incredibly important because it affects the plot. The individual quirks of each character are the key catalysts in the eventual reaction. McEwan takes such special care with it because it makes his novel richly interesting and personal, but also because the reader needs to understand how and why the events unfolded the way they did. Back to the plot: Briony is at the peak of her insufferable girlhood. Emily at her vague, avoidant best. Cecilia and Robbie have just discovered their passion that very day. It is excruciating watching them get ripped apart from each other because we know every in and out of their emotional and sexual discoveries. Briony orchestrates the most major instance of coitus interruptus in my literary memory, but it’s okay, it’s only the beginning; there will be more, more time, more release. Or so they think (their hope and excitement is heartbreaking), and McEwan gives us all this so the eventual consequences are as painful as possible. PART TWO: Dunkirk, France, Spring 1940Part Two of Atonement is a departure in tone and style from the first section. In fact, the entire rest of the novel leaves that intense introspection behind. It’s fitting, because the other three parts deal with the aftermath of “what Briony saw” and we don’t need to know any more about the inner workings of minds: there’s a war on for Fuck’s Sake.It’s the beginning of the war. The British Armed Forces are leaving France. They’re losing. We slowly learn that Robbie Turner, convicted of rape using Briony’s eyewitness evidence, has been allowed to enlist after serving three years in prison. The trenches are preferable to the acute boredom, claustrophobia, the sheer rotting away of life in prison. We follow him as he and his two companions make their way to Dunkirk, France to be evacuated by sea back to Britain. The endeavor, code-named Operation Dynamo by the British, was in response to the absolute pummeling Allied troops were receiving from the Germans. It is an interesting decision to choose an earlier part of the war, an act of desperation and submission no less; it’s almost as if we’re meant to experience the same exhaustion and hopelessness much of Europe was. V-Day is still five years away; of course Robbie doesn’t make it.In the movie adaptation, director Joe Wright chose to film Part Two in one sprawling, 5 ½ minute long shot. I thought it was genius then, and my opinion holds. At this point, McEwan’s words turn visual – they dump us in the middle of Robbie’s reality and show us what he’s seeing. There’s a certain dryness that lets the reader simply see and process it all. Civilians and soldiers alike are on the march, and we are given a nice cross-section of the human spirit as well as the landscape: we encounter the helpful, the terrified, the sick, dead, and dying. The ones looking for a bottle or a fight. Robbie isn’t Robbie anymore; he’s “Turner.” He loses himself. We lose him, even though we don’t know that for certain just yet. The best bits are his small slips of the mind, the confusion and despair unraveling the shoddy stitchwork keeping him together. It’s fairly heartbreaking, because Robbie is that incredibly likeable male protagonist, made even more relatable by his humor, youth, good nature, and the love and lust he holds for Cecilia; the real, new, surprising, honest kind. Part Two is the real effect of Briony’s actions, and it really sours that girl we met so long ago.PART THREE: Briony is a nurse.We meet her again in Part Three. This is the least stylistically impressive section -- which makes it the easiest to read -- yet its role is imperative. If Part One is the brick foundation and Part Two the depleted bank account, Part Three is the house they built. Briony has followed in Cecilia’s footsteps and has become a nurse in the initial baby steps of her lifelong quest for atonement. She is doing it to help with the new war machine, but also in an effort to estrange herself from her family and somehow mend her relationship with Cecilia (who has completely disowned everyone else implicit in Robbie’s conviction). This section reads more like a traditional story. In a very Reviving Ophelia-esque turn, the older Briony has none of the surety and general clarity of spirit as her younger self. Tormented by guilt, she is also a slave to her new regime, leaving no time for writing or even thinking, which is just how she wants it. In Part Three, we are treated to fresh horrors of war as they trickle in from the Channel. London is gearing up for its inevitable devastation, pre-Blitz, its citizens evacuating or lying in wait of the onslaught. In rare spare minutes between bedpan duties, Briony tries to make amends: she writes to Cecilia, promising to unveil the truth of Robbie’s innocence, and when she receives no answer, shows up at her doorstep. In the description of that day, we learn some more about the events of three years ago, which still lie in shadow. Before visiting her sister, Briony crashes the wedding of Lola and Paul Marshall, and we find out that she has put the pieces together: it was Marshall who raped Lola, and while it was relatively easy to see that one coming, the full force of everyone’s motives are finally revealed. You want to blame and hate Briony, but her ignorance and full commitment to do the right thing pulls you back. You want to blame and hate Lola, but she did what she had to do. These were not kind times for freshly raped and ruined young girls. The whole situation is just a Godforsaken mess, and the realization that the world is made of such messes begins to dawn. Briony and Cecilia’s reunion is awkward but brings a modicum of closure. We see Robbie again, changed: older, haggard, ravaged, angry, but – reunited with Cecilia, married and in love. Steps will soon be made to clear his name. Life marches on.PART FOUR: Briony is old and revisits the past.In the final section, we are again Briony. This time she is an aged and successful novelist with newly diagnosed vascular dementia. She will soon forget everything she ever knew. We are, once again, subjected to minute details: this time they are the bits and pieces of Briony’s 77th birthday. Once again, we learn some new things.Briony Tallis is working on her last novel, which is also her first. In fact, it is the very same one we have been reading. It becomes clear that she is trying to achieve her own form of atonement, however meager an offering it might be. She is attending a dinner in her honor given at the old homestead, which has been converted to an inn. This is how we see some of the old players again, and insight is gained into the lives they have led in our absence through Briony’s reflective mood on this day. We even run into Paul and Lola Marshall, still going strong. Briony can’t publish her novel as it stands for legal reasons since it incriminates the Marshalls. She will have to wait until they are dead. This is unfortunate, as Lola Marshall is still in sprightly good health. This realization adds another layer of melancholy; Briony won’t even live (and if she does, she won’t remember) to see her life’s work, her life’s heaviness, put to task.Briony hasn’t been entirely faithful to the facts, and she is comfortable with that decision. She wrote Cecilia and Robbie as married and happy and together. She wrote Cecilia and Robbie as alive, when in fact they both died during the war; Robbie at the end of Part Two, and Cecilia from German bombing sometime in the aftermath.And this is where McEwan leaves us. My thoughts on Atonement are complicated. I see from some of the other reviews that readers had a variety of reactions to the novel’s actual events. I will go ahead and assume that McEwan’s main intent was to create a story that ignited fires of judgment, introspection, and sadness in a reader’s mind. In some ways, Atonement is rather formulaic (incredibly likeable male protagonist is wrongfully accused, shit happens, WWII, consequences, etc), yet it still manages to be incredibly effective. This is because of the nature of the titular theme; it is universal. Briony’s guilt differs vastly from yours in scope and detail, but the series of misunderstandings, warped points of view – the basic tipping of the scale, that could happen to anyone. The left-unsaid manipulation of time, location, and cultural atmosphere hang heavy and add their heavy grains to the appropriate dish. Additionally, we are all familiar with the ingrained subtle pressures of family and our immediate communities. It’s easy to say we wouldn’t have done the same as Briony, but she was so close to sure that she was doing the right thing to save her sister and help her cousin. Close, but no cigar.I will admit I was somewhat distracted from the story by the writing and overall technique, and that it obviously skewed my assessment. It was just so good, especially in Part One.I think the theme of writerly thought is an interesting one. Briony is a young aspiring authoress, and her mind is a place of intense self-absorption. She is a natural at turning events from her small life into grandiose things worthy of being written about. There’s a scene in Biloxi Blues: Matthew Broderick’s character is a writer, and he loses the notebook he uses to scribble down observations. Anybody seen my notebook? Which notebook? The one I’m always writing in. It’s bad news, because some of his boot camp bunkmates find it and read unflattering things about themselves. His defense is that: he’s a writer. He looks at things and transcribes them in the way that would make a better story. Usually that makes life a little more interesting and beautiful. And sometimes, it is an incredibly cruel thing to do. Eugene Morris Jerome: Why is it that we come from the same place but I can't understand you?Arnold Epstein: You're a witness. You're always standing around watching what's happening, scribbling in your book what other people do. You have to get in the middle of it. You have to take sides. Make a contribution to the fight. Eugene Morris Jerome: What fight? Arnold Epstein: Any fight. One you believe in. Until you do you'll never be a writer Eugene.I will leave you at that.

286,891952139,03/25/2014,5.0,"This historical family saga is one of my favourite literary works, which surprises me as it was written not in antiquity with my other all time favourites, but in 2001. My introduction was director Joe Wright's 2007 BAFTA and Academy Award nominated movie, starring James McAvoy and Keira Knightley. Then when I read the book, Ian McEwan's pros had me glued. The stylistic element is the strongest hook. Had it been told less masterfully, this tale may have had little more going for it than its sweeping timespan and those popular mid twentieth century historical landmarks that just tickle the outermost reaches of living memory. The beautifully structured story divides cleanly into three parts: 1935 England; World War II England and France; then modern day England.It begins on a sweltering summer day in 1935, when thirteen-year-old aspiring writer Briony Tallis, at her wealthy family's grand country estate, makes a clumsy and naïve error of judgement which will ruin lives:Having received her maternal cousins, twins Jackson and Pierrot and their older sister Lola, as summer houseguests, Briony writes a play for the four youngsters to perform at a family gathering. But her three cousins have come from an unsettled home, with their parents expected to separate.In the oppressive heat, Briony becomes exasperated motivating her disorientated cousins into order for the play. Unable to push them to her standards, Briony seeks solace in an upstairs bedroom, from where she witnesses through a window what looks like an altercation, down below at the front garden fountain.Her older sister Cecilia, home from Cambridge University, is involved in a flirtatious tiff with childhood friend Robbie Turner. Son of the Tallis family housekeeper and nowadays Cecelia's fellow Cambridge student, Robbie is also home on leave. Briony misconstrues the scene, concluding that Robbie is being aggressive to Cecilia. Back at his home Robbie writes several drafts of a love letter to Cecelia, handing a copy to little Briony, outdoors, to deliver. As Briony skips away with it, Robbie realises he has accidentally given her the wrong draft, one he had meant to discard, containing obscenities. En route home with Cecelia's letter, Briony opens and reads it, becoming shocked and perplexed as to Robbie's intentions.Later at home, Briony walks in on Robbie and Cecilia making love in a quiet corner of the family library. Having come to think Robbie a 'maniac', Briony misinterprets their lovemaking as rape and feels protective towards Cecelia, who is saying nothing.A dinner party is held to welcome home Briony and Cecelia's older brother Leon, who brings along his wealthy friend Paul Marshall. During this, young twins Jackson and Pierrot are discovered to have run away, possibly in fear of being forced to appear in Briony's play, possibly in distress over their own uncertain domestic situation. The party forms a posse, searching the darkened grounds for the boys. Briony happens upon her older cousin, Lola, apparently being raped by a man whose identity is veiled in shadow. Back at the house everyone fusses over a shocked and bedraggled Lola, who seems unable or reluctant to identify her assailant. The twins are still missing. Briony takes it on herself to speak out, accusing Robbie Turner of the awful deed. Robbie is still outdoors, possibly afraid to return and hand himself in, maybe awaiting his next victim. The police are called and Briony identifies Robbie to them as the rapist. She claims to have recognised his face in the dark. Having eventually found the missing twins himself, Robbie then arrives back at the house as day breaks. He is arrested, charged and jailed for Lola's rape, with only Cecilia and Robbie's mother believing his protestations of innocence.The story jumps to World War II, after Robbie has served some years in jail. He is released for army enlistment, to fight in the war. Cecilia has left home and trained as a nurse, severing contact with her family for allowing Robbie to go to jail. Robbie and Cecilia have only maintained contact by mail, since she was earlier forbidden from visiting him in jail. But before Robbie is sent to France, the couple meet once briefly during Cecilia's lunch break, sharing a kiss before separating.In France, the army retreats to Dunkirk. Badly injured, Robbie seeks out shelter. There he thinks about Cecilia and reflects on past events, still puzzling over possible reasons for Briony accusing him. The memory of his brief final meeting with Cecilia is all that keeps him going, his only aim being to see her again. He falls asleep in Dunkirk, the day before evacuation.Back in England, remorseful eighteen-year-old Briony has refused her place at Cambridge, instead training for nursing in London, as if undertaking some self-imposed duty of penance. With the benefit of hindsight and maturity, she has realised the gravity of her terrible mistake five years ago. She now suspects it was Leon's friend, Paul Marshall, who she saw raping Lola. This suspicion is strengthened when Briony attends Lola's London wedding to Paul Marshall. After watching these twisted nuptials, Briony journeys to face Cecilia at her sparse rented flat near Balham, to make long overdue amends. Robbie is there, home on leave. As the couple refuse Briony their forgiveness, she insists on trying to make amends by initiating legal proceedings to exonerate Robbie. Briony offers to change her original statement (even though Paul Marshall will never be held responsible for his crime because of his marriage to Lola, the victim). However, the couple point out that Briony would be seen as an unreliable witness, if suddenly admitting her own lies. In London 1999, we read seventy-seven-year-old Briony Tallis, a successful novelist with terminal dementia, tell us her dying truths. She has penned an acclaimed novel (the book-within-a-book we've read in parts one and two of this novel) in which Cecilia and Robbie are reunited after Dunkirk. In reality, however, they never met again, as Briony here humbly acknowledges.Old Briony concedes that Robbie most likely died at Dunkirk, from septicaemia caused by his injuries. Cecilia was probably killed by a bomb that destroyed gas and water mains above Balham tube station. Whilst Briony's plotline of Lola's wedding to Paul Marshall was true, Briony had not, in reality, visited Cecilia at her rented flat near Balham to make amends. Such is often an author's purpose in fiction - to imaginarily undo wrongdoings. To atone themselves of something they otherwise cannot. Briony justifies her rewriting of history in reuniting Cecilia and Robbie, claiming she saw no point offering her readers a pitiless ending. No sense or satisfaction, she rationalises, could be drawn from that. She also wanted to give Robbie and Cecilia their due happiness by bringing them together. Since they could not reunite in life, Briony permitted them this in her fiction.By tracking older Briony's life journey, the reader has examined the human need for personal atonement.This had the makings of an instant classic, with all the qualities of so many great epics yet the intimacy of those deeply personal works we curl up with on cold winter nights. It is no wonder it sold so well, was shortlisted for the 2001 Booker Prize for fiction and listed in 2010 by TIME magazine as of the 100 greatest English-language novels since 1923.Impossible to predict where the story is taking you, yet utterly compelling, this is a haunting mystery but so much more. One of those rare, special novels that will likely never date, which everyone should read at least once.",4,-0.9948,0.145,0.745,0.11,0.4943331849873905,POSITIVE,0.9992

It fit this week’s genre choice for a class I’m taking, so I thought I’d take the opportunity to finally knock it off the list. I had so much to say, but the last 10% of the book has undone me. Now I begin to understand why the publisher’s description seems so misleading. It’s hard to describe this book without giving away everything. I went into it with the knowledge that the character Briony does something horrible, with long-lasting ramifications. I spent the first half of the book bracing for the Horrible Thing, which I expected to happen fairly early, since I assumed it would be the catalyst for everything else that happened in the plot. Instead, I was treated to exquisite description and a deep dive into the minds of Briony, Cecelia, Robbie, and Emily. I vacillated between admiring McEwan’s writing and impatience for the Horrible Thing to happen already so the story could get going. At the 25% point, I thought to myself, “OK, here we go.” At the halfway point, I thought, “Wow, here? OK, clearly this isn’t what I thought it would be.” At the 75% point, I thought, “OK, still good, and I have thoughts,” and at the end, I thought, “Well, shit.”McEwan masterfully portrayed how subjective our interpretations of others’ thoughts and motives are and how that skews our internal narratives of their stories and ours. I saw Briony’s horrible act as the embodiment of that idea. And then he turned everything on its head at the end and sent my mind spinning. (view spoiler)[ To find out that the whole book is Briony’s voice, that it’s the reason for the title, but that the atonement comes too late for justice, to find that she fictionalized what brought me so much relief for Robbie and Cecilia, to find that she’s the one writing about flawed perceptions but the whole thing is her flawed perception...it utterly blew my mind and killed me.  (hide spoiler)]This book really stretched me and made me think. The author is monumentally talented. It didn’t get a full 5 stars because sometimes it was such a describe-a-thon it wore me out. It’s still a fantastic book, and worth the time and effort.",4,-0.444,0.09,0.819,0.09,0.5318376068376068,NEGATIVE,0.9842
288,2386745368,10/11/2019,5.0,"Love, war and literature. These are the themes populating the pages of Atonement by Ian McEwan.Spanning more than 60 years, this novel tells the love story of Robbie and Cecelia, forever changed by a lie told by Cecelia’s 13-year-old sister, Briony. The first part of the novel takes time setting the scene, richly (and in way too much length) detailing every aspect of the Tallis household and lifestyle, and displaying Briony’s need to arrange the world as she knows it in fairytale fiction and her desire to be a grown up and write adult fiction. In the second part, we are taken at once from the comforts of the Tallis manor to the war-riddled Dunkirk where Robbie is trying his best to survive and get back to Cecelia, while Briony spends her days atoning for her wrongdoing. The third part takes us back to the Tallis manor which is now a hotel for a reunion of the family. Some are still living, some are long gone but the story stands unfinished. The last pages of the novel finally lets you see the full picture, which was only being delivered in parts and parcels from the perspectives of Briony, Robbie and Cecelia. The cracked vase that put in motion this story breaks irreparably during the war. Now that the war is long over, did love survive? McEwan answers or he may have employed another author to answer, either way it’s not a simple answer.At some point, you realise it’s a book within a book. At another, you recognise the author as one of the characters. At the end of the book, literature, as you know it, will have forever changed. 5 stars!",5,0.8643,0.044,0.867,0.089,0.3978571428571428,POSITIVE,0.9995
289,4098362922,07/20/2021,4.0,I couldn't remember if I had read this book before or was just familiar with the story from the 2007 film adaptation so I decided to read it and find out. I am still not sure if this was a re-read or not but I did really enjoy this book. I love the story and the exploration of how the consequences of a mistake can be far-reaching and devastating. The book is divided into three parts. The first part is set in the summer of 1934 where we see a 13 year old Briony misunderstanding her sister Cecilia's relationship with their childhood friend Robbie and telling a lie which will pull the family apart. The second part is set a few years later when an older Briony is working as a nurse during WW2 and trying to find a way to atone for her mistake and the third part follows a now elderly Briony reflecting on whether she truly did make up for her mistake. The different timelines work really well in telling this story and I thought Briony was a fascinating character who I alternated betweeen disliking and sympathising with throughout the book. This book has made me want to read more by McEwan. ,4,0.838,0.103,0.763,0.134,0.4128472222222221,POSITIVE,0.9996
290,261674528,01/14/2012,,"For the first nearly 100 pages I simply couldn't see the point of this, or understand why - even before the film - it had become a modern classic. But then I was only reading the thing because for several years now it had felt like an embarrassing oversight not to have done. Not simply due to its appearance on most ""best books of the last decade"" lists, but, having usually owned a copy of at least one of McEwan's books since the week Enduring Love was released sixteen years ago, I'd always found it alarmingly easy to forget that I hadn't actually read a single novel of his. Atonement's early chapters were positively Downton Abbey-ish. (I suspect that the later nursing scenes also inspired part of that series.) It was like a well-written version of supermarket fiction. Though the sort you'd find in Waitrose alongside Joanna Trollope. I daresay that it helped inspire quite a few of those books. And even its cover has become a generic type - one of whose recent incarnations can be seen on the British edition of Kate Atkinson's 
Life After Life
. Historical fiction set in the inter-war period seems especially superfluous; there were so many wonderful, still-readable novels written at the time which give a better flavour of the era than however many years of research could now. So its only significant value is if it says things that couldn't really be said in print at the time. Like Sarah Waters' Victorian books. And sexual politics and the unspeakable also eventually become one of the themes of Atonement; there is also a certain cynical irony to a story about a miscarriage of justice set during the ""Golden Age of Crime"".I had seen a few reviews critical of this aspect of the book such as this one - which is probably more spoilery than mine - and did keep them in mind whilst reading. It probably won't surprise people who know me or who read a lot of my posts that I disagree, though I did honestly give careful consideration to the idea. (And I felt profoundly sad for Briony in the 40's carrying around remorse for such a terrible thing. I also don't blame her in the least, for, like most people in most situations, she probably wasn't able to do anything better at the time anyway. McEwan's exploration of her thought processes in 1935 is thorough enough that I'm convinced this is also what he means to say. It was odd that her thought processes of later realisation weren't explored though; this should have been one of the most interesting parts of the story but it wasn't there at all. I was disappointed and puzzled that writing became her later career, but then not everyone grew up with the public service ethic I did, which says her former work is better and more useful both in society and to help assuage guilt and wrong action, whilst art usually involves self-promotion.) What I see in the plot is an indictment of a culture of prudery and silence that was hurting both men and women. It's perfectly obvious, if you know much of the story, how a man is adversely affected. But it was also unthinkable for Lola that she could have said what really happened in the afternoon. And if she had been able to do that, everything would likely have been different. Both Briony and crucially her mother, from whom she probably learned her views, equate passionate sexual expression in words with a person being a physical threat. The police and judicial system aren't exactly dismissive of the idea either. Class discrimination fuels the situation as well and it's certainly no accident that the narrative mentions Robbie's illicit purchase of the banned Lady Chatterley's Lover. There aren't as many big ideas as I thought there might be in Atonement: it is, mostly, a story (one which draws heavily from L.P Hartley's The Go-Between as a starting point). The only other explored theme is writing and the study of literature. By default, I find this a tedious and slightly embarrassing theme in novels. ""Aren't we bookish people so special and different?"" they say. There are quite a few that manage to buck the trend of irritation (recently Possession and Scarlett Thomas' Our Tragic Universe). But Atonement is one in which I didn't like this typical outbreak of meta, apart from its clever and justified use in Robbie & Cecilia's letters. What I enjoyed more than anything though, were bits which were mostly just story. Part 2, about Dunkirk, especially, was very interesting. I quite like war films and even took a military history module once, but for some reason I've always avoided fiction about fighting in wars; perhaps I should re-think that. Most of Part 3, about nursing ... There's nothing quite like doing useful work that benefits other people to take you out of yourself and feel justified and purposeful. I miss it terribly. But reading a long account of someone else doing some is just as good for taking me out of myself, it turns out, and during those pages I quite forgot petty online debates which had riled me that day.It did become perfectly apparent why the book is so popular, that it is well-written (even if the lyrical realism was too glaring and cold for my liking in Part 1) and it's a pretty good story with a few meta bits and things to debate. Some of it was still a bit dreary, obvious and unsatisfying, but I'm glad to have ticked this off at last.ETA: I've recently read James Wood's essay on Atonement in The Good of the Novel and whilst I can't say it made me like Atonement any more, it did give me more appreciation of the work that went into it, e.g. that some of the plot points are a response to a 1935 essay by Cyril Connolly.
