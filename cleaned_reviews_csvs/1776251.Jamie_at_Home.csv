0,106605826,06/11/2010,4.0,"I love the unconventional format of this book. Oliver groups the recipes by season/ingredient. This is a great companion to his television series, ironically titled ""Jamie at Home."" His passion and enthusiasm for fresh ingredients and simple recipes translates very well to the page. Personally, I like to have a companion photo with as many recipes as possible for presentation ideas and this book has wonderful photographs of the food. I haven't cooked all the recipes yet but, I must say that most are quite tasty. I've found that some of his recipes do have a definite English quality. That is not to say they are awful but rather have a bitter quality. In my humble opinion, he tends to use too much lemon. His Italian recipes are fabulous, especially, his pizza. They key is his very simple four ingredient sauce, the best you'll ever have. In addition to recipes and commentary, gives simple instructions on how to grow most of the ingredients in a home garden. It inspired my first foray into gardening. What I’ve learned from other great cookbooks and chefs is that the simplest recipes are the best and “Jamie at Home” (the book) supports this thesis.

Using simple, everyday pantry items (for the most part) Jamie really brings out the best in fresh, ripe produce. The photos are gorgeous, and the recipes are very easy to follow. The book is broken up into seasons, and the Mothership tomato salad is not to be missed. It is stupidly easy, but tastes like everything tomatoes ever promised to be. A bottle of wine, a loaf of crusty bread, and maybe some cheese is all you need to round out a meal featuring the bright salad (recipe here: http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ja...). A slight warning: this book will definitely make you long for your own garden, and quite likely, an outdoor wood-fired oven (especially if you watch the companion television show). Even if you already are a pro in the kitchen, this should be added to the collection of cookbooks. Oliver is able to bring out the best that each vegetable (or fruit) has to offer, revealing techniques not to be missed.",2,0.9763,0.036,0.79,0.174,0.5826994434137291,POSITIVE,0.9999

I tried his asparagus dishes, which were all fantastic. And I made his onion soup, which turned out yummy. The best thing I think I made so far was the blackberry and apple pie. He also includes a pastry dough recipe, which is fantastic and kind of MADE the pie (though it was a little bit on the thick side, all due to the fact that I fail rolling out dough).And as an art major, I have to shout out the the designers of this book.

Frankly, I'm appalled it's taking me so long when everything I make turns out lovely.Jamie Oliver, my cooking icon, uses veggies as the centerpiece in the majority of the recipes grouped here and every passthrough I find something droolworthy. One of my favorite recipes, the Asparagus and Potato Tart, has made numerous dinner appearances, despite the pitfalls of creating a filo crust. Grrr, filo. Although many recipes have meat in them, it's usually either something that's simple to leave out or something I'm inspired to make with a meat substitute. The Italian Ham and Spinach Tart, for example, I'll be making this week and leaving the ham off. Easy peasy.All the recipes I've tried have been successes. Many have earned repeated rounds on the menu, like Sweet Pear and Apple Salad with Endive, Superb Squash Soup, Creamy Asparagus Soup, Fresh Tagliatelle with Sprouting Broccoli and Oozy Cheese Sauce, Rhubarb and Sticky Ginger Crumble, Mothership Tomato Salad and more. Top two recipes on my 'to make' list: Baked Cauliflower & Broccoli Cannelloni, Incredible Smashed Peas & Fava Beans on Toast. Note to self: plant fava beans.I admit, I'm a sucker for Oliver's excitement over good-quality, fresh produce. Why shouldn't I be? He's absolutely right. Jamie's abstract directions (a 'good handful of parsley') may worry a more methodical cook, but I find them an opening, a verbal head-nod to improvisation and creativity.

Very cool way to organize recipes, IMHO. And the photography is gorgeous.In the Introduction Jamie gives a shout out to the Brittish sitcom The Good Life. I fell in love with that show back in the late 80s. The show was produced in the 70s and was way ahead of the curve telling the story of a couple who went off the grid to live a sustainable, simple, self-sufficint lifestyle. The show made a real impression on my all those years ago and perhaps it influenced the person I am today.I tried 3 recipes from this book and all 3 were good to very good. My favorite of the 3 was the the grilled butterflied monkfish with a sweet runner bean stew. I could not find monkfish at my market so I used swordfish....and it was a real winner! I also loved the humble home-cooked beans. I love beans and this was a nice way to prepare them and I plan to use this recipe often. The last recipe I tried was the Welsh Rarebit with Attitude.

He does 3-4 recipes for each section (all complete with beautiful photos) as well as a short write up about each - mostly his planting, growing and harvesting tips, but also important issues (why factory farm eggs aren't awesome, etc).
