0,271057572,02/01/2012,2.0,"I was completely unaware of the Naked Chef until I picked up this gorgeous cookbook at the library. Apparently, he's been on tv for years...lol. The food is gorgeous, healthy, substantial.However, there's no way that these are ""quick, throw-together"" recipes. At least one ingredient in each recipe is difficult to obtain (suggesting websites for online ordering). I had to google ingredients to even understand what the American translations would be.Finally, I found one to try to duplicate, with less exotic ingredients I could find in grocery stores. Without going into great detail, I will say that it was a disaster. I made a wrong turn when I decided last-minute I did not want to put raw sausage in my blender (to add further spices to the meat-mixture). What was the point of all this? I almost forgot in the middle of the ordeal -- making a new pasta sauce from scratch (although sausage-based). Needless to say, my picture did not look like their picture. And I'm not a slouch in the kitchen, really.The book did inspire me to cook something, but he doesn't translate well to typical, suburban American life. Martha could take him with one hand behind her back, in delivering beautiful, quality new dishes to try, with just the right amount of challenge.His methods for reducing time are sort of interesting, though, and pretty much involve chopping all ingredients with one swipe of the knife or not chopping at all (boiling entire head of cauliflower) (let it fall apart after or as it cooks) and always keeping a kettle of water boiling to add to other pots, eliminating the wait for those to come to a boil.I have since become more aware of Jamie and his efforts to take on corporate McDonald's (I believe his statement accused them of feeding food not fit for dogs to humans on a worldwide scale) and to improve the horrid food served in public schools. He's a great guy -- I wish his cookbook was great, too.",4,0.5835,0.098,0.807,0.095,0.4920429997353073,NEGATIVE,0.9997
1,389798049,08/12/2012,4.0,"This cookbook has an interesting concept. It includes the recipes and shows you how to use your time to prepare the individual dishes so a complete, rather impressive meal is ready all at once. This is not a bad idea in theory. In practice, it is tricky, because you may want to have an individual dish without having the entire meal. Also, several people follow ""restrictive"" diets (e.g., vegan, gluten-free, etc.) and this cookbook is more geared towards those who are fairly open to all foods.That said, although there are some slightly advanced cooking skills required, I think this book may appeal to the beginning cook who is still developing the ""flow"" to creating an entire meal. It reminds me a Whole Foods or Central Market cooking class in which people build cooking competence and enthusiasm by cooking a wonderful full meal under the guidance of a pro. We all have to start somewhere in the kitchen and it's far more rewarding to end with a Jamie Oliver created meal than mac & cheese (not that there's anything wrong with mac & cheese, of course.)Jamie encourages cooks to use ethical, higher welfare food sources. Thanks, Jamie! You have earned a bonus star for this. There are also a variety of recipes that draw from several types of cuisine. I can't say that anyone would necessarily cook every meal in this book, but I think even the pickiest eaters could find ones to enjoy.Finally, I believe Jamie Oliver is genuine in his love for food and for his concern about others' health.

So I picked up this book.With practise, it is possible to do the recipes within 30 minutes, providing you have all the equipment. (Jamie makes a note of this at the start - I didn't have a mircowave, so some meals were going to take me longer.) Even so, any meals I've cooked I've done so in under an hour.I found the format fairly easy to follow, as each section of the meal is under a header, so I just skip out the dessert parts if I just want to do the main meal. (The school-days trick of read the whole thing before you start helps here, so you know what you are doing!) I found the range of meals to be good, and it is possible to swap out ingredients you don't like, providing you don't mind that it may take longer (or sometimes less time!) to cook. For example, the Green Thai Curry works as well with Quorn pieces as with Chicken. I also find it very helpful that there is a colour photograph of every meal, so I know what I am aiming for.

3,198302638,08/14/2011,4.0,"When I purchased this book in Australia it was called ""30 Minute Meals"". I daresay the title is misleading which could well be the reason why it's appearing here under a different name.This is a book full of appetising recipes and I have cooked several of them with very good outcomes. I consider myself to be an experienced home cook and I have a very well equipped kitchen with all manner of appliances to assist me in the cooking process. Jamie says in the book that you need to have certain essential pieces of equipment in order to be able to make the recipes in 30 minutes. I have the equipment, I have the know how but there is absolutely no chance I'd ever be able to cook these recipes in 30 minutes. In fact I'm not sure I'd manage some of them in 60 minutes. Unless of course, I was highly excitable and hyperactive... like Jamie Oliver I guess.The recipes jump around all over the place so that the cook can theoretically get the entire meal (usually a main, side dish or entree and dessert) prepared in 30 minutes. It is a bit difficult to follow if you're only making one portion of the meal that appeals to you. In fact the format is a bit hard to follow in general and this is only compounded by the sense of urgency of having 'many pots on the boil'. However I'd challenge anyone to flick through this book and not find several recipes that appeal to them. The chicken pie, satay chicken skewers and piri piri chicken recipes are casual meals that are absolute standouts taste wise. If you can get past the recipe formats and accept that these meals do take a bit longer than the book would suggest then it's a pretty good book to cook from.",3,0.976,0.038,0.842,0.12,0.6420932539682539,POSITIVE,0.9144

And I do too. Falling back on fast food options is hurtful in so many ways. Even if you were raised, like I was, on crap fast food. You can change that. You can make that difference in your life. This is Jamie's message. You can change the way you eat for the better. And it doesn't have to be a hard change. It can be fun and flavourful and most awesome. Real food tastes nothing like the fat/salt/sugar saturated menu you'll get when short cutting to fast food. Real food is...succulent, savoury, and oh so tradition causing. If you have a mom, dad, grandma, grandpa, who is holder of the food tradition. Learn as much as you can, while you can.If you don't have a holder of knowledge, learn from the cookbooks out there.

I haven't cooked a thing yet from this book. I will. I have made copious notes of that which interested me. That being said, Oliver's instructions are never hard to follow and the guy knows what he is doing. He gets props for that. I have no doubt that they will turn out. I do find some of his recipes though throughout his books are sometimes a bit out of the ordinary. He whips stuff together than I would never eat and I know my family wouldn't dream of consumming. Some of his ingredients are not easy to find at your local supermarket. Minus points to these two areas I am afraid.Was I inspired to cook after reading this book? No. Did some things look interesting? Yes. Do I think I can whip up any of the meals in this book in minutes? Hell no. How many recipes did I make a note of from this book? Only a small handful.

16,1287799195,05/23/2015,3.0,"While Jamie Oliver always has a certain appeal, this cookbook has so many problems for the average home cook. Initially, this premise is really great: everything is grouped into meals (usually an entree and either two accompaniments or a salad and a dessert) and the instructions are written to have you cooking all components simultaneously. Everything is thought out and planned for you! Awesome, right?If you are part of a foodie couple, or a family open to all foods with no health concerns, it would work fine. If you are like most families, dinner hosts, etc. you are contending with special diets, picky eaters and other issues. It is very hard to go through and mark which ones can be cooked, as is. It is also very difficult to extract one aspect of a meal you want to try and mix with something else. It can be done, but even Oliver says it is best to make the meal at least once before trying to extract elements.I don't want to poo-poo cookbooks that have planned meals, as life is tough, time is finite and we all need a little help. They make a great addition to any cookbook collection. However, they have to be part of a collection; this cannot be your everyday, go-to cookbook.

Admittedly I don't really use it to create the full 30 minute meals but pick and choose bits from it. The fail-safe recipes have turned out to be excellent mid-week saviours and perfect for last minute dinner guests.Roll on a year and a half, and with a baby now in tow, time has become ever the more critical. There could be no more relevant book to land on my doorstep than Jamie's 15 Minute Meals because that's pretty much all I have to knock up a meal these days.For this latest book, courses or meals have generally been trimmed to two dishes maximum but this suits our mid-week eating better, we are not really a pudding household unless you count eating Nutella out of the jar! Flicking through, I could easily eat most of the food here. I like the relaxed yet often indulgent recipes and most would be a welcome break from the usual pasta and sauce, minestrone and risottos which form the bulk of our standard dinners.Photography-wise, this book is very on-brand with the Jamie empire; spalttered platters and creative mess which makes the food look all the more deliciously relaxed. The book itself seems to be less ""designed"" than past titles and relies heavily on the good food photography for interest. It's passable, but not as beautiful or well crafted and the typography (which really gives the last few of Jamie's books an edge design-wise) is bland and awkward in the introduction sections of this book, although clear and simple for the recipe layouts.",0,0.9944,0.047,0.759,0.194,0.5094954648526079,POSITIVE,0.9973

Mostly cause if you are not that good in chopping veggies, it will definitely take time. Also some ingredients are hard to find in my country, so I have to look for substitutes. That does not mean that I do not love the book.I have seen here other reviews where they blame the chef and the book about the list of ingredients, but hey, I have news for you: The chef is British. He is making British cuisine. Of course some ingredients are not that common. You should have known that, before you bought the book.I knew it, so that factor does not affect my rating. Im just a bit sad that I cannot make the original recipe. The other reason for the 3 stars is the fact that most of the main dishes are pasta. I do understand the reason (full course in 30 minutes time), however I would like a bit more of variety.Overall I do recommend the book to busy ppl and persons who wish to make a quick friendly/family dinner with pretty nice recipes.Go ahead and see for yourselves.

The premise of the book is good-that you can make a quick and delicious meal for your family any day of the week; but I don't find it to be particularly family friendly. The meals are made of multiple dishes (which for me is just too much), most of my dinners consist of a main dish and a very simple vegetable side. This recipe book includes multiple sides, deserts and sometimes drinks. And while it is very easy to cut things back, because the way the book is written with instructions about order of execution-it makes it difficult to navigate back to where you're supposed to be if you've eliminated things.The idea itself I believe to be revolutionary to most home cooks, but I think you'll learn just as much about cooking quickly from watching his tv show as you will from this recipe book.
