Bridget returns as the hapless and can't-get-it-together heroine with plenty of love, work and weight troubles. The first book has a happy ending and I thought that was the end of it. Since it's so successful, of course the author cannot resist conjuring contrived plot lines for Bridget's second adventure. Bridget came across as charming and endearing in the first book but here she becomes annoying and irritating. I (or the readers) love her int he first book because Bridget is not flawless. This makes her a very accessible character. However, the contrived plot lines of this book has managed to create a gratingly stupid Bridget which I cannot empathise with anymore.This is what happens when authors go on beyond the 'happily ever after' last line.",41,0.5546,0.139,0.706,0.155,0.6811507936507937,NEGATIVE,0.9889

Of course this was a huge misunderstanding on her part because he doesn’t have any feelings for her at all. However, it is Bridget and it wouldn’t be a book if she found out that she was wrong right away. Nope.

11,82579758,12/30/2009,3.0,"Although Bridget Jones is still a fun and delightfully unpredictable character in this second instalment of Helen Fielding's series, there is simply too much presented, featured exaggeration and resulting disbelief for me to be able to totally and utterly (without reservations) enjoy The Edge of Reason. For while with the first book, with Bridget Jones's Diary, although Bridget often was indeed outrageous and even at times (and perhaps even rather regularly) inappropriate, she was still and usually engaged in antics that could easily and even normally happen (events, personal behaviours to which I could at least mildly and personally relate), whereas, at least for me, the majority of the scenarios presented, featured in The Edge of Reason, but especially the entire Thailand episode, simply feel a bit too strange, too over-the-top, interesting enough perhaps, but also somewhat alienating. And thus, while definitely still for the most part an enjoyable and entertainingly light romp, with The Edge of Reason, I sometimes and perhaps even more than sometimes do tend to feel more like a dispassionate and even analysing (coldly critical) observer and monitor of Bridget, while with the first book, with Bridget Jones's Diary, I very much and often felt like I was Bridget (or at least that I could be Bridget), actually experiencing her frustrations, her dietary faux pax, her searches for the perfect man (and I just cannot seem dispense with my personal sense of disbelief with much of the action featured and presented in The Edge of Reason, simply because much of it is so far beyond my own personal experiences that it feels strange, even at times rather majorly disconcerting and disconnecting). But all that being said and my issues with reality and exaggeration notwithstanding, The Edge of Reason does remain for me a generally enjoyable read and as such one which I do still heartily recommend for fans of Bridget Jones' Diary (but with the caveat that it is certainly nowhere near as good and as entertaining as the first book, and the additional personal warning to absolutely NOT bother with the second movie instalment, as it veers so far beyond the plot of the novel to be simply massively annoying and majorly frustrating).",12,0.99,0.049,0.809,0.142,0.5147276379534445,NEGATIVE,0.9794

I have to say that with both books, there were definitely laugh-out-loud moments, although there were more with Edge of Reason than Diary.I'm embarrassed to admit it took me at least to the middle of the book to realize that this book was a take-off of Persuasion. And once again, I admire Ms. Fielding's facility in translating a classic to the modern age. Before I picked up this book, I wondered, idly, ""Pride and Prejudice ended with a marriage. What on earth is Helen Fielding going to do in her sequal?"" I assumed it would be one more of those books written by Jane Austen devotees who cannot stand not knowing what happens next, where Elizabeth and Darcy, happily married, turn detective, or where Elizabeth, happily married, works on getting Georgiana married off. Turning to Persuasion for inspiration was felicitous.In Persuasion, Anne Elliott and Captain Wentworth loved each other in their youth (fully ten years ago), but were driven apart by the machinations and bad advice of Anne's family. At the end of the book, happily, they have reconciled and their love is as strong as ever. In Edge of Reason, Bridget and Mark have been together for a full four weeks before they are driven apart by a series of misunderstandings, the machinations of vicious Rebecca (an exceedingly well-drawn character), and the bad advice (at least, in Mark's opinion) that Bridget has gleaned from the self-help books that comprise her library. Well done, Ms. Fielding -- I think that's a wonderful way to begin a sequal and also an inspired retelling of a classic.This book was great fun and brought me great joy reading it. I think Ms. Fielding's satirical pen has sharpened somewhat. ",11,0.9939,0.047,0.768,0.185,0.4574404761904761,POSITIVE,0.9998

20,107869650,06/19/2010,5.0,"Fits of uncontrollable laughter. That would describe me reading this book. What a great followup to the first one! For those of you who have only seen the movie and not read the book, warning: the movie script cuts quite a bit out, and changes quite a bit. For instance, the whole lesbian thing in the movie? Never happened. The ""other woman"" who Bridget thought was after Mark really was after Mark in the book. Daniel Cleaver barely makes an appearance, just a brief few times, literally only 3 brief occasions. He was never in Thailand with Bridget and Shaz, as he was in the movie. Therefore, the fight scene with Mark and Daniel never happens...however, he does (Mark) punch him (Daniel) in a later scene, but nothing like the fight in the movie. Also, Mark doesn't go to Thailand to rescue Bridget - he did his work at home and in Dubai to catch Jed. The one thing that amuses me vastly about what they cut out was the fact that Bridget interviews Colin Firth for a freelance newspaper article!!! HA! For obvious reasons, that would have been impossible to have in the movie script, as Colin Firth ended up playing Mark Darcy in the movies. They really, really did leave out A LOT, and this is definitely one of many occasions where the book so surpasses the attempt at the movie. That being said, I love the movie and it's hilarious. It just doesn't match up with the book, and that always pisses me off. It's really too bad that Helen Fielding never came out with a trilogy for this.

22,385911881,08/07/2012,4.0,"Helen Fielding is basically the world's greatest feminist. In her first Bridget Jones book, she taught us that no woman is complete unless she has the love of a foppish, sub-Hugh Grant, barely heterosexual posh man to complete her. To add to the confusion, Bridget is in love with the actor Colin Firth, who they end up casting in the film as her actual love interest, Mark Darcy. If that wasn't confusing enough, they throw in Hugh actual Grant as the Bad Boy Whom All Women Are Attracted To In Spite Of Themselves. And he doesn't really play a Hugh Grant type either. Well, he does, but it's more like the Hugh Grant in About A Boy. Or the Hugh Grant in real life, who fucks crack whores in the mouth.This is a review of the book though, which is not a film. It's not the first book either, it's the sequel to the first book. And it's not the film which is a sequel to the first film. In this book, Bridget gets her dream job, interviewing Colin Firth for some magazine or TV show or whatever. This is very confusing if you've seen the first film, obviously. This is the book though, so we'll carry on.Does anything of note happen in this book? LOADS of stuff, but none that I can actually remember. There's a scene at the start of it which is funny because foreign people are hilarious, and gay people are icky. I think that's the point the author was trying to make, anyway. The key themes of the book are that women are useless without men, other women stab you in the back at every opportunity, and that no one thin or good looking can be a good person.Fielding's novels are loosely based on a couple of Jane Austen books, although they're not that much like them; well, except for the fact that their attitudes to women, men and relationships are two hundred years out of date.Can't wait for the third one!",7,0.9801,0.077,0.763,0.16,0.4383130904183536,NEGATIVE,0.9976

It's also a bit scary to see how much some aspects of the genre changed since the turn of the millennium while other themes sadly stayed the same.

I was disappointed to learn that Fielding had decided to throw Bridget to the wolves of sequels, and deliver to her readers a multitude of setbacks that became less believable as the diary went on.Jones in her underwear outside and being happened upon by her ex. Jones finding a small Oriental boy and a bunny rabbit in her boyfriend's bed. Jones arrested for drug trafficking. Jones being targeted by a lunatic murderer. The ridiculousness of it all made the story less funny than its predecessor, as one spent the entire time exasperated by this hapless bad luck magnet. It was so forced. It felt like Fielding was capitalising on Bridget's wit and irrevocable calamity, so she hammed both of these up to an uncomfortable degree. Utter slapstick.The diary format I so loved in the previous novel failed miserably this time. Fielding opted for longer diary entries, giving the story more of the feel of a novel, where previously the shorter glimpses into Bridget's life gave the air of writing on the go, again in the most unfeasible places. God knows how she managed to smuggle her diary into a Thai prison, or to write exactly 0 minutes after having sex.A catalogue of stories you'd hear from exaggerating drunks, and, quite frankly, an organised mess.

33,201079809,08/22/2011,1.0,I didn't like the first book as much as I enjoyed the movie but I wanted to read it anyway cause I love the movie - the characters were much more superficial and I couldn't relate to Bridget as much. The story about her mother was pretty crazy - totally unbelievable - they tamed it down for the movie. Anyway I thought I would try out the 2nd book thinking maybe the character had grown some but she was still just as bad and annoying and her friends were worse - being married and a mom I was really annoyed at the way her friends treated and talked about their married friend who had recently had a baby. I just couldn't find the humor in it and they were all just totally not likeable. The only character I did like was Mark Darcy who had some funny dialogue. I also enjoyed some of the interview with Colin Firth altho Bridget just comes off as such an idiot. I didn't finish this book cause I just had no sympathy for Bridget and just couldn't relate to her. I didn't love the 2nd movie based on this book as much as the first movie but it was a vast improvement on the book. In the movie you can sympathize with Bridget a lot more and her quirks are endearing not completely annoying. ,3,0.9113,0.147,0.674,0.179,0.5813620071684586,NEGATIVE,1.0

Am going to be alone for rest of life. Alone!This is Bridget Jones 2 - I was debating whether to give this a three or four. Settled on three stars in the end. Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason does have a lot going for it: Bridget is so relatable, she is a romantic with a love of self-help books, and we get to follow the ups and downs of her and Mark's relationship. Bridget's characteristic tone and voice permeate every page. She has fantastic friends, and The Edge of Reason is as much about friendship as it is about love.However, there are a few things that I struggled with. Bridget's unbearable mother is back, including all her cringeworthy escapades and detachment from real life challenges. Really can't stand Pam. Some of the stuff has not aged well - Bridget's so called 'fat weight' is 15 kg less than what I weigh, and I'm a size 12. Adding to this, I do like Bridget, however in this instalment she often gets a bit too whimsical for my liking. The Italian Job sub-plot was meant to be funny, but Bridget's complete lack of self-awareness and professional understanding just rubbed me the wrong way.Overall, Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason is a good and entertaining read.

44,101991656,05/09/2010,3.0,"The great thing about this book is that it completely preserved the tone, voice, characterizations, and humor of the first Bridget Jones book. It is easy to read but not dumbed-down. In fact, the nearly telegraphic style makes the reader work just a bit harder than she is used to, in order to divine the meaning. So that's all good. Why, then, have I given this sequel only three stars, where the first book received five?There were three things that led me to this decision... and at one point, I was even hovering at two stars, but there was some redemption toward the end.First, I felt myself not liking Bridget much in certain parts. In the first book, although obviously flawed, she was still very likable, and even easy to identify with. I think that is in fact the main reason for the success of this series, that Bridget's personality and experiences strike a chord with an entire generation of women who see themselves in her. Well, when Bridget started dumping on Mark, just to please her girlfriends, and being inexcusably stupid, neglectful, and incompetent at work, she lost completely any sympathy she had with me. Bridget is at her best when being mortified at her mother bringing home a Kikuyu from her African safari, or suffering when she sees her boyfriend being fawned over by a gorgeous, rich, thin rival. Even when she pitches off-the-wall, slightly embarrassing or shallow ideas for Sit Up Britain, and things don't quite pan out the way she expected. But when she has a big interview with Colin Firth and acts like a thirteen-year-old schoolgirl (if that), and then doesn't even bother to write the article afterward, her unlucky bumbling turns into flat-out incompetence that makes me wonder what redeeming qualities she could possibly have. And she doesn't have a clue where Germany is? Germany! Okay. Moving on. The next peeve I had was that it felt like the author was stretching too far, coming up with outlandish plots, possibly in order to make it play better on the big screen. Getting caught for drug-smuggling in Thailand is just so far out of the scope of a normal thirty-something single girl's experience that it just didn't fit for me. And then the whole stalker thing with the builder? It felt so last-minute and stuck together. The last thing I didn't much like was the fact that Bridget never saw Mark's message on the back of the poem (and why would he have written on the back of a poem anyway? Surely there was a blank piece of paper around). I mean, come on, she was in a prison for a week with no other reading material, and she took the poem out and re-read it several times. She would have noticed something on the back. This may seem like a minor detail, but it was actually a pretty big point for drawing out the uncertainty over their relationship right up to the end. There were a couple of other things, too, like the fact that there was a gaping hole in the wall of Bridget's house for months, and no one said anything... and she didn't need to get a building permit for the addition, either. I just felt like there was too much suspension of disbelief necessary, that things could never have happened like that in the real world. That might not be a huge drawback for some books, but Bridget Jones' success banks on the reader being able to place themselves in Bridget's place, and for these things to actually happen to them (or someone they know, or someone who at least lives on the same planet). Now, what is the redeeming quality that brought this back up from 2 stars? It's the fact that Bridget does actually seem to learn something. She actually does make some major changes in her life (throwing out all of her self-help books, quitting her job), and sees that she was wrong to treat Mark the way she did. She gains insight into her character and acts on that. I was also very touched by the mother-daughter scene near the end, where Bridget's mother actually seems to come down to Earth for a few minutes and gives some very good, profound advice. So, in the end, I did like this book, and I can admire the author's skill in writing and creating a worthwhile piece of entertainment. ",2,0.9971,0.071,0.776,0.153,0.4392713293650794,NEGATIVE,0.9986
45,528814499,02/07/2013,5.0,"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, a fictional work of British literature by Helen Fielding, is a whirlwind of a romance set in the city of Notting Hill. Bridget, the calorie, cigarette, and alcohol obsessed thirty year old, finds herself in unfortunate relationships that hardly ever work out for her. But eventually, she finds the man of her dreams, Mark Darcy. It has been “four weeks and five days [that she has] been in a functional relationship with an adult male,” portraying that she is not a crazy repulse of love (Fielding 3). But not everything goes in her favor throughout their relationship. Mark begins talking about a woman he works with more and more in front of Bridget, and Bridget becomes over-worried and extremely jealous. She constantly thinks the worst about her relationship with her perfect man. The two English soul mates seems like the perfect couple, however, with some bumps along the way, Mark and Bridget break up, which puts Bridget in a state of depression. Will Bridget ever convince Mark that he’s the only one she loves? Or will she never make it back together with Mark, the man of her dreams? 	Helen Fielding makes the reader feel like they are one of Bridget’s best friends through all of her unmanageable boy troubles. Fielding wrote this book with an intention of making the characters easy to identify with and communicate with. Her writing, quick and relatable, helps the reader cultivate an understanding for Bridget and her “said-so”, irreplaceable, connection with Mark Darcy. There is no way you can not be fixated to this book and the dynamic characters placed in the British work. 	In Bridget and Mark’s relationship, anything can be expected. The main point of the work is to point out that anyone can find love, even if it seems impossible. Bridget makes this clear, as someone who believes she is a repellant of love. No one ever knows what will happen between the two unpredictable characters, as a couple. However, if you want to know what the fate is of this couple, you will have to read Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason. ",2,0.992,0.057,0.779,0.165,0.5419270833333334,POSITIVE,0.8347

I also watched the (first) movie and thought it was boring. But I did steal Bridget’s diary-writing style for years so at least there’s that. And the ebook was really cheap back when I bought it.Writing ★★★☆☆Characters ★★☆☆☆Plot ★☆☆☆☆The plot is, well. There's not too much of it. Bridget is dating Darcy, at least for about 2 weeks, before it all goes to hell again. And after that there's still a lot of book left for Bridget to obsess about getting back together with him. Then there's also the usual drama with Bridget's mom, and her friends, and a trip to Thailand, and something to do with her job.
'Am assured, receptive, responsive woman of substance. My sense of self comes not from other people but from ... from ... myself? That can't be right.'
There's also the usual recounting of calories, weight, cigarettes, alcohol units etc. at the beginning of every diary entry, which mostly made me wonder1) what kind of weight unit is a stone? Is that a unit that scales in the UK actually show?2) how the fuck does she get to amounts like 6,452 calories? does she add up all of them in her head? The plot gets really repetitive really fast. Bridget obsesses about her weight. Bridget obsesses about her (mostly non-existent) relationship with Darcy. Bridget whines about the fact that she doesn't know what to do. Bridget and her friends get drunk together and give each other really terrible dating advice. Bridget meets Darcy at some party and absolutely nothing happens. Repeat about a thousand times.(Although there are some nice parts in between, like the short episode relating to Diana's death or the terrible Colin Firth interview.)But the main reason I found this book hard to get through was Bridget. She's a person I would hate if I ever met her irl, and even as a character in a book she's sometimes unbearable. I know that the fact that she's naive and a little shallow and not too bright is supposed to be cute and funny but it's too much for me. She's annoying and her friends are even worse. The only thing they care and talk about are men, and their relationships with various men, and why those relationships didn't work out.But to be fair, that is also more or less what I remember the first book being like, so it's probably exactly what I should've expected.

What I do really about this book is similar to something I really like about Nick Hornby's ""High Fidelity"" implied by the movie ""The Graduate"" which is that romantic comedies are great and all, but what happens after? Well, ""High Fidelity"" has another 100 pages or so, and this book is the sequel to the romantic comedy and is about whether or not a relationship can even take off the ground (not even to speak about lasting). So I do think it's great that Bridget Jones's obsessive cataloguing of her alcohol, her eating, her smoking, her obsessive thoughts etc have to carry on into the actual relationship. I also really like how little other people actually exist in this book. Yes, they exist, but only kind of when defined through the lens of not only her specific kind of narration but also her narrow perspective as a person. I also like the meta parts of the book, which are actually hard to parse out here such as how aware is the book of the movie version, which might not have come out yet, but will be coming out soon. Mark Darcy is played by Colin Firth but also Mark Darcy is partially based on Darcy in Pride and Prejudice, but also there's a bunch of references to Colin Firth as Darcy in both books, and in this book Colin Firth plays himself, being interviewed by Bridget.What I don't think works here is the farcical elements such as the trip to Thailand, the emigre stuff, and even huge parts of the builder character.

62,2887441129,07/15/2019,2.0,"Jane Austen wrote six novels. Not one was a sequel. I think she had the right idea. Of course there are exceptions to the better-off-without-a-sequel rule, but in the case of The Edge of Reason, there was little reason to continue where Bridget Jones's Diary left off (except for author, publishing, production company, actors' profit). As a result, BJ2 is a bombastic imitation of the original, operating on the principle adage: if it worked once, it can work again--only with more unbelievable stakes! Because exploring a mature relationship is a bore (apparently), the alternative is to ruin everything with miscommunication. Ugh.It was also disappointing that Bridget went from lovable nit-wit to insufferably self-sabotaging & stupid. Not to mention Mark Darcy was served no favors (or real growth) in his role as stuffy white knight. I will say I preferred the second half to the first, which was trying too hard to be funny and punch-up secondary, cringe-y story lines that weren't of much consequence anyway. And at least Bridget had some development in the self-esteem category, though she wound up still soft for Daniel and even Gary, after what each of them did. Will she ever learn!?! I suppose that's the idea. Wondering if Bridget will get her life together is the on-going mystery.

It's sometimes a bit too cringe (*mild spoiler*: the Colin Firth interview made me want to jump out of a window) but I guess that's part of the concept. I started reading the books after watching the movies and while I prefere the first movie over the book I'm not sure if it's the case with the second one too. They are just too different from each other to compare them that easily. But both were great in their own way. Except for Rebecca maybe. Movie Rebecca was my definition of bi panic, while the book Rebecca was just panic. Overall a fun read for a good mood, that I highly recommend.

110,1633485972,05/09/2016,5.0,"No one can claim that Bridget Jones lacks focus. In her diary, she is totally focused on three things: Keeping Mark Darcy, Losing Weight, and Giving Good Advice. But even with that with all that focus, things seem to go awry on her.For one thing, it's hard to be receptive to a good snuggle while you're trying to hide the fact that you're wearing ""really scary underpants."" Bridget's undergarment struggles, begun in the first diary (Daniel Cleaver was strangely aroused by her ""giant"" beige knickers), continue as she conceals her tummy bulge with corsetry.
Cannot help but wonder if was free to rearrange own fat according to choice, would I still wish to reduce amount? Think would have huge big breasts and hips and tiny waist...
The movie substitutes a near-triumph in Trivial Pursuit by Bridget at Mark's swanky Law Dinner party for her hilarious précis of Labour vs. Tory politics in the book. (Perhaps the movie producers thought the political discussion would be inaccessible—or worse, not funny—to US audiences.) Either way, Bridget's careening, almost-there headlong style is always capped by the final humiliating ""oops!"" ending, faithfully recorded in her diary under the daily record of weight, cigarettes smoked, and lies told about her diet and smoking.Despite her obsessive focus on her Relationship With Mark Darcy, Bridget has time to obsess about other people's relationship issues, too. Her mother is off again, this time to Kenya, and Bridget believes her father's ""stiff upper lip"" reaction is hiding a broken heart. Her buddy Jude is starting to worry about her biological clock, but not enough to want the baby-belly and cabbage-bra issues of Magda, their ""Smug Married"" friend. And Sharon, or ""Shaz,"" has abandoned her feminism for a troubling proclivity to watch soccer with the boys.Bridget is battling work relationship issues, too. Her boss gives her assignments (""locate two Middle-England voters who are pro"") and waits for her to screw them up. Meanwhile, he will put her on camera only in situations where she can display her complete incompetence (and her undergarments). Mark's office has him paired with Rebecca, who obviously has designs on him. (For some reason, the movie invents a whole other character to be the ""jellyfish,"" whose every encounter with Bridget results in her delivering multiple verbal stings; ""Bridge, how's it going with Mark? You must be really pleased to get a boyfriend at last."")In an effort to escape the snarled cares of her life, Bridget agrees to visit Thailand with Shaz, ""and NO MEN!"" In fact, she gets her wish, as she winds up in a Thai women's prison. Fortunately Bridget's blithe take on life, and her thorough grounding in the religion of self-help (and Mark Darcy) come to her rescue.Despite the substitutions and amendments noted above, the movie captures the breezy voice of Bridget Jones' diary entries perfectly. Casting is wonderfully apt; Colin Firth as Mark Darcy is especially appropriate, considering Bridget's and her girlfriends' sovereign remedy for the blues is a viewing of 
Pride and Prejudice
 starring Firth as Jane Austen's mannered hero Lord Darcy. Excellent reprises by Gemma Jones as Bridget's Mom, and Jim Broadbent as her Dad also shine. Hugh Grant shows up to reveal Daniel Cleaver's middle-aged angst, and to let Mark Darcy settle his hash. In the end, though, it is Bridget Jones herself, with Renée Zellweger plumping up for the movie role again, who carries the story. You just have to love a woman who can look at herself honestly in the mirror, and still proclaim,
""I truly believe that happiness is possible... even when you're thirty-three and have a bottom the size of two bowling balls.""

However, because the movie version and novel version are vastly different, there is likely to be very little partiality or prejudice in this review, if any).In this gloriously funny sequel to Bridget Jones's Diary, readers find themselves, once again, immersed in the chaotic and comedic world of Bridget Jones. If you expected Bridget to lose some of her neuroses or her proclivity of winding up in humiliating and awkward situations because she is now in a relationship with Mark Darcy, you were wrong my friend! Bridget is still Bridget, weighing herself daily and smoking too many cigarettes; but this time instead of obsessing about finding a boyfriend, she is consumed with doubts and insecurities about the relationship she is already in. The signs are there... Mark Darcy is a commitment phobic! With the help of her relationship experts/best friends, Shazzer and Jude, Bridget's eyes are opened to the fact that her relationship with Mark is precariously hanging by a thread. She realizes that she is his “Just For Now Girl” and that he is probably thinking about sleeping with other women due to his “Mentionitis.” Not to mention that he is oblivious to this other woman's attempts to get her claws on him. After some unfortunate misunderstandings and misconceptions, Bridget decides the best thing for her to do is to “detach” from Mark Darcy. But when Mark no longer calls her and is rumored to be seeing this other woman, Bridget wonders if this “detachment” theory was a good idea after all... For me, this is one of those times where I enjoyed the sequel more than the first novel. What I liked most about Bridget Jones: Edge of Reason is that there was more of the sexy and intelligent Mark Darcy! I was delighted that Mark Darcy's character was distinctly developed and received more page time in this novel. I greatly enjoyed how the reader was able to discover and perceive things about Mark Darcy that Bridget was completely unaware of (like his feelings for her). Another aspect of this novel that I loved was the frequent use of references and plot devices borrowed from both Pride and Prejudice and Persuasion. For example: Bridget being persuaded to break up with Mark by her friends; Mark's work colleague Giles Benwick (Captain Benwick) relying on self-help books (not poetry) to help him through his difficult divorce; and, Rebecca, the woman chasing after Mark, possessing some of Louisa Musgrove's flirtatiousness and stubborn willfulness. I found Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason to be a delightfully and amusing sequel. If you have seen the film, be prepared for the book to be nothing like it. In my opinion, the book beats the pants off of the movie! I loved all the absurd and amusing escapades Bridget gets herself into, my favorite being the Colin Firth Interview. Eight brilliant pages of Bridget asking Colin Firth questions like: “How many takes diving into the lake did you have to do?” and “Do you think Mr. Darcy would have slept with Elizabeth Bennet before the wedding?” I highly recommend this novel!Austenesque Reviews",0,0.9978,0.076,0.73,0.194,0.6477407407407408,POSITIVE,0.9944

Her half-hearted attempts at a worthwhile career consumed some of her time, but Bridget was more concerned with her personal life and at the end of Diary, it seemed her persistence paid off.Well, Bridget is back, and ready to enter a new phase of life, one of spirituality and truth. Bridget Jones: The Age of Reason picks up about a month following Diary. Mark Darcy is still around (quite a coup for Bridget, who rarely hangs on to a boyfriend long enough to call him one) and while she is no longer a Singleton, she is fast becoming a Smug-Going-Out-With-Someone.  But, guilty-pleasured Bridget fans, don't despair: Trouble always finds Bridget, usually at her own invitation. It doesn't take long for Bridget, Shaz, Jude, and their complete library of self-help books to convince Bridget that she is Mark's Just for Now Girl, and once again our dear heroine is catapulted back into the familiar and dreaded world of Singletons.Magda and Jeremy pop in and out from their Smug Married Life, and have Vile Richard and Pretentious Jerome mended their ways? Depends on who's talking. Unfortunately, Tom does not happen 'round as much as we would like; well, after all, we were there for him during his nose job and musings about Pretentious Jerome in Diary, only to have him deliver most of his witticisms via telephone in Reason? How dare he? How dare Fielding? Instead, we get a large dose of Mum and Shaz, and they are annoying (thanks to Fielding's clever writing). And Bridget, still being abused by her crazed boss Richard Finch (not to be confused with Jude's Vile Richard), does manage a short-lived career high when she interviews Colin Firth in Italy. She also hits a new low when she is imprisoned in Thailand for drug trafficking. While prison life is often over the top (even for Bridget), most readers will empathize with her longing for a shower and a copy of Marie Claire.I didn't think it could be done, but Fielding has once again written a laugh out loud chronicle of Bridget Jones's misadventures. And yes, someone does leave the ranks of Singleton permanently, but to become a Smug Married? Never! Don't be fooled into thinking you're too high-browed for this sort of fun, for Bridget is a case in point: Pride cometh before the fall. I enjoyed this so much, I read it all in one day and then watched the movie. Both are so much fun!",0,0.9375,0.096,0.779,0.125,0.4694506974506974,NEGATIVE,0.9248

These books are so well crafted and so much fun to read, I love being able to write these 5 star reviews!I'm really glad I saw the movie prior to reading the book; this way I was able to enjoy the film for what it was on it's own merits, blissfully ignorant of all the missing content from the book. Now, I wish they had included so much more in the film, it could have been even better...but I still love the film anyway.Now, to the book! Ms. Fielding has a real talent for creating characters that are so very relatable. I can't think of a single female friend of mine who wouldn't be able to relate to Bridget and her friends as I do. In Rebecca she has done it again by creating that backstabbing social climber so many of us has come across. You know the one, the girl who is only worried about how others perceive her and how she can use people around her to obtain what she wants. Rebecca is THAT girl, she's the character you absolutely love to hate. She is so transparent, conniving, and manipulative that you find yourself thinking ""Bridget, just deck her already!"" The Rebecca in the book is completely different from the Rebecca portrayed in the movie but that was actually kind of fun for me...it made this book a new experience for me having the book and the movie depart so drastically with this character.Naturally the up's and down's and awkward tension between Bridget and Mark remains in spades with Rebecca complicating things exponentially. Their bumbling miscommunications and misinterpretations are of course an integral part of the plot with this book often leaving the reader never precisely sure if things will work out for them or not. As with the first book, once again I really love Bridget's voice. She's so real, so flawed, so utterly messed up and charming while she strives to improve herself and maintain some type of calm composer at the same time. So often saying exactly the wrong thing at the wrong time....but this is one of those things that makes her so endearing. We've all had that moment of instant regret when we think ""Did I really just say that? Idiot! Idiot! Idiot!"" and Ms. Fielding lets us into Bridget's mind as she has that realistic inner dialogue.If you liked the first book, definitely....get the second! It will leave you chomping at the bit to get your hands on the third in the series (Mad About The Boy) to see what happens to Bridget next.",0,0.9935,0.088,0.749,0.163,0.523877738423193,POSITIVE,0.9999
115,1619758005,04/24/2016,3.0,"Question: Did Bridget Jones's Diary really need to have a sequel? The answer: Of course not! That being said, as far as sequels go, The Edge of Reason is a pretty decent one, and that's about the best a person could hope for, given the stinking cesspool of unnecessary sequels to solid (even excellent) books that exists in the world of literature. It's not as good as the original (most sequels aren't), but it's still an entertaining read and, at times, even a page-turner. I have a particular sore spot for stories that take the ""happily ever after"" of their predecessor and tear it apart, but I wouldn't say that's quite what happens with The Edge of Reason. Sure, there's plenty of romantic drama and the book has its fair share of ridiculousness, but it felt far more authentic and honest, like two people struggling to make their relationship work amidst their own insecurities and the not-so-helpful input from their friends. The first third of the book, with Bridget and Mark working their way through various events and misunderstandings, was easily the best part of The Edge of Reason. For a short while, I hoped they wouldn't separate at all, but spend the rest of the book pushing forward and fighting for their relationship, rather than the break-up/inevitable reunion that happened instead. But what we do get is quite good; I liked it even more than the Pride and Prejudice style of romance used in the first book.Unfortunately, I would accuse the book of being a little too long and a little too ludicrous. It's been about two years since I read Bridget Jones's Diary, but I don't remember it delving into the far-fetched territory that Edge of Reason starts to occupy around the halfway mark. There's a particular episode in Thailand that feels especially out there and there are a lot of other slapsticky encounters that read as ""trying too hard"" rather than genuinely funny. But overall, The Edge of Reason is a pleasant enough read. It has some important things to say regarding love and friendship and how love can be corrupted by over-analysis and paranoia rather than trusting in your relationship and your partner. I've never been quite as in love with Bridget Jones as the rest of the world is, but I enjoyed her first book and I enjoyed her second (we'll see about the much-reviled third). I had my doubts about going past book one, but Edge of Reason has enough going on to make it worthy of a reader's time. 3 stars. ",0,0.9978,0.076,0.703,0.222,0.5888888888888888,POSITIVE,0.9909

There's not better feeling that when you finish a book, close it and you've got a smile on your face! :)The writing got better for me. She continued writing drunk on her diary but that's Bridget!!heheThe story got better and better!! First the great Rebecca debacle.... Ha! Rebecca... what a bitch, what a useless bitch (I hate that type of person!!) Then the life continues, such a dread, and then that final adventure!! Ha! Sadly I was prepared for that but still it got to me.... and then when you think everything is over and happy times are around the corner, there you go, your last surprise!!! My mind went directly to that person... that one was always quite strange.Character wise, I am so glad we got to see a lot of Darcy and almost non of Daniel!! Some of the characters went mad , aka Bridge's boss, and some others were found to have a heart after all, aka Pamela.Bridget continued on her style, that quirky personality that I love, and just like Darcy correctly pointed out had too little own opinion and put too much importance in her friend's opinions... and self help books... (I never completely understood this self help book obsession!). But that interview though... I was so ashamed!!!! For her and myself... so ashamed...Mark Darcy was so transparent and lovable... even if he had his moments when I wanted to hit him because I didn't know if he was doing things knowingly or with that naive manly spirit. But his mere presence made all giggly!! What a crush!!The entourage, mainly Sharon and Jude, had a lot going on... I am glad for Sharon at the end (this will shut her up) and surprised like all of them were about Jude, very very surprised!!And then Rebecca... I don't know what to say only that I wish she got suddenly pregnant with her partner... I don't want her to be unhappier or anything, because she already is (inner witch is laughing non stop for this ugly creature!)... she is painfully sad after all, typical rich girl with airs of superiority...A enjoyed this movie 'adaptation' (' ' because there was so much missing, so many details missing that...) but the book I found thrilling!!

117,52466446,04/12/2009,4.0,"This is probably the one rare time I'd say that a book's sequel is much better than its predecessor. In this continuation of her diary, Bridget again recounts the ups and downs of the single life, coupled by the indifference shown to her by Mark Darcy, her now established boyfriend. ""Hurrah! The wilderness years are now over. For four weeks and five days now have been in functional relationship with adult male, thereby proving am not love pariah as recently feared.""  Add to Darcy's indifference the arrival of Rebecca, who absolutely has no girlfriend code of ethics when it comes to poaching another woman's man.Whole dating world is like hideous game of bluff and double bluff with men and women firing at each other from opposite lines of sandbags. Is as if there is a set of rules that you are supposed to be sticking to, but no one knows what they are so everyone just makes up their own. Then you end up getting chucked because you didn't follow the rules correctly, but how could you be expected to, when you didn't know what they were in the first place? Everything else also proves to be topsy-turvy, as Bridget's mother has returned from a trip to Kenya with a young Masai in tow, to her father's consternation; her best friends Jude, Shazzer, and Tom are all trapped in dating hell themselves; her apartment has a gaping hole thanks to an unreliable carpenter; an ex-boyfriend (Daniel Cleaver) has just reentered her life; and now someone is sending Bridget death threats--could it be Mark Darcy as the detectives suspected?Bridget is a slightly silly person, a bit on the unrealistic side (who knew that she had practically bought almost the entire section of self-help books of a bookstore?), but I suppose diaries (as the format of this novel proves) may include ones ultimate unrealistic fantasies (like being rescued by Colin Firth or Prince William).

118,1337937076,07/17/2015,4.0,"I am often typecast by friends and family as “the one who likes books.” To non-readers, a book is a book is a book, so I often end up getting some really weird books that I would never pick up for myself. This is how I ended up in possession of The Edge of Reason, Helen Fielding’s second Bridget Jones novel.In this novel, Bridget stumbles through her day-to-day life, surviving one ridiculous mishap after another, until she is finally reunited with her love.The writing is designed to imitate a form of shorthand that might be used to keep a diary. It reminded be somewhat of Flowers for Algernon in the sense that the form was an important part of the content (something that we (should) see often in poetry, but that is quite a bit rarer in novels). It was interesting and it gave the story quite a bit of verisimilitude. The short sentences kept me reading at a faster pace than I do normally, which was rather interesting. And even though I read this about four years ago, I still use the “v.” (or “vee,” if I’m speaking) as a shorthand for “very.”Bridget Jones herself is a hilariously inept character, bouncing from one situation to another with little agency of her own. I have a soft spot for such characters, so long as they aren’t annoying about it, so I rather enjoyed her as well. The situations themselves were so ridiculous (particularly the one involving a naked boy and a bunny – yes, really) that they had me laughing quite a bit as I read through.This is the ice-cream of the reading world – it’s enjoyable, not particularly nutritious, but it won’t rot your brain out either (provided it’s consumed only sparingly and interspersed with meatier fare).",0,0.9759,0.033,0.846,0.121,0.6186666666666667,POSITIVE,0.9924
119,1399595047,09/23/2015,5.0,"I thoroughly, for the very most part, enjoyed this book! Had constantly found myself comparing my life to Bridget's and seeing many parallels- some very embarrassingly- but is made me glad that I wasn't going through it alone, and Helen Fielding very accurately expressed on paper my own emotions about the confusing world of relationships and one's purpose in life. Bridget has great friends and I loved how in her worst moments they were always there for her, talking about the same topic over and over with understanding and patience. You know that it's a fictional novel, however, when even with Bridget's constant procrastination, laziness and (okay I'm going to say it) honest stupidity she manages to be offered the position of Assistant Producer at the company she had just resigned in, as well as being offered a freelance position at a prestigious newspaper agency after a failed article submission. But I have to admit, throughout Bridget was just honest. Plain honest and kind to the people she met. Calling situations as she saw it, dealing with people who were rich, poor, sad- on the brink of depression- with compassion. At times she would complain about the difficulties in her life- her smoking problem, her alcoholism - but wouldn't really take active steps to doing something about it. However everyone has their vices, and it just turned out that cigarettes and wine were hers. Overall a great read, had a lot of laughs and, by her example, justified a lot of my procrastinating choices in the past. Nah, it was a fun read and I loved it.

120,25459089,06/25/2008,3.0,"How I Came To Read This Book: I borrowed it from Robyn.The Plot: Bridget Jones is back (just a mere month or so after the first book ends) and seemingly happy now that her and Mark Darcy are all lovey-dovey. Things start to crumble in dear Bridge's life however, when his coworker Rebecca sticks her nose into Mark & Bridget's relationship, wrenching them apart. Bridget, in between wine and chocolate binges, is busy however with other pressing manners including her best friend's wedding (to vile Richard?), an interview with Colin Firth (perhaps a tongue-in-cheek nod to the film's casting), and of course a trip to Thailand that goes horribly wrong. The Good & The Bad: In general I have a ranking in the Bridget Jones' series that goes from best to worse: First Movie, Second Book, First Book, Second Movie. The second movie is absolutely awful, yet the book is surprisingly good. In general Helen Fielding is probably the most overrated/awful chick lit author out there, her follow-up to the BJ series ""Olivia Jules..."" proves my point. Bridget is painfully annoying, the books are hard to get through with their irritating characters and not funny wannabe humour, but this one does a better job then the other pitiful examples I listed above.

Last time I read it, I was around 20, so I'm more in a place now to identify with Bridget. It's been over 10 years since I last read it, and I was delighted to find one thing I'd forgotten: like the first book with Pride & Prejudice, this plot is loosely based on Jane Austen's Persuasion. If you're not a Jane Austen fanatic, it might not be entirely obvious--but elements of Persuasion are definitely there, right down to the lovesick Benwick. Brilliant. The plot is held together with what I might call the Meg Cabot Conundrum, in that nearly every single problem in Bridget's life could be solved if she just chose to communicate. Case in point, her breakup with Mark Darcy is 100% due to lack of communication--just saying the simple words ""Hey, I want to stay together because I love you"" would have worked. BAM, problem solved. So all right, the problems are mainly a bit flimsy and you want to bash Bridget over the head with a Milk Tray throughout the book for not just using the brain you know she has (more because of the first book than this one, sadly) and trying to solve her own problems.And yet, I'm still sucked in, entertained, amused, and delighted when Bridget does ultimately find happiness.

I mean time and technology needed to make a movie exactly like the book is just not possible but wow with these books they were very different, barely the same. This is one of those times that the books and movies are so different you have to treat them like original and distinct works by themselves and not adaptation of each other.

226,84756887,01/13/2010,3.0,"Time may have skewed my memory, but I recall Bridget Jones' Diary as being delightful. Gahhhh became my favorite interjection of all time. I experienced the same joy during the first 50 pages of this sequel, but then became increasingly irritated. During the final stretch, I kept thinking every sentence would be ""the end"" and felt crushed when it wasn't and realized I had to spend minutes more in the heroine's company.Fielding's wit is sharp and she is a master of observation and human nature. But to say she's poor at plotting would be an understatement. The writers of Three's Company would have turned their noses up at some of the contrived misunderstandings Fielding concocts. Ultimately, Bridget is rendered so dumb that one questions the legality of Mark Darcy engaging in physical relations with her. No one this dim-witted could give informed consent.But stupidity is not Bridget's greatest crime. She's also too self-centered to be ""in love,"" making this romance novel less than romantic. There's one sweet moment when she cuddles a frightened and naked Mark, but other than that she shows no concern for his feelings whatsoever, except to wonder how they reflect upon her. Her heartlessness is even more maddening because, as diarist, she must give a first-person account of the pain she ignores. It's Bridget's diary, so we must, ostensibly, see everything from her point of view. Fielding is forced to slip narration in through the back door. So, Bridget has to describe what she herself doesn't perceive. For instance, after she rejects him, Mark drives away and Bridget says that she sees him wiping something from his face. We, the audience, knows that he is crying. Bridget doesn't know or even consider this somehow, but it's irrelevant, because I really don't think she'd care!The book starts with them together and reasonably happy. Yet, Bridget is persuaded by her jealous and hypocritical friends, Jude and Shaz (dubbed the relationship war command by Mark) that what she and Mark share is not enough. Mark comes over to Bridget's apartment every night and Jude and Shaz convince her it's because he doesn't want to share his home with her. They say he's keeping her at arms length. Bridget believes them and angrily demands that Mark take her back to his cavernous mansion. He doesn't even know his way around his own kitchen. Eventually we learn he preferred Bridget's home because it's cozy and intimate, while his is vast and cold. But Bridget never considered this.When they prepare to retire to Mark's bed after sparring, they open the door to find a boy on the bed, holding a rabbit. Bridget is convinced he's having a kinky affair with the boy and runs off, without giving him a chance to explain. Of course, there's a wacky explanation for what happened. The boy was a stranger to Mark. He was the housekeeper's crazy son having a break down. Why Bridget wouldn't listen to Mark when she herself is involved in one incriminating mishap after the other is hard to fathom.When Mark walks into the room and finds her kissing someone else, he questions her, but they end up laughing and having sex. He's given her the benefit of the doubt, but is also hesitant, seeking confirmation that she actually still does want HIM. Bridget doesn't give him any. She lets an awkward silence and distance grow between them, only to wonder endlessly why he doesn't call. When he does call and she's not at home, she doesn't return his voice message because her friends and self-help books assure her that women should not pursue men and she must force Mark to make each overture. This would be fine, if she didn't also reject every overture he DOES make.Of course, Mark is not completely without fault. On one occasion, when she reaches out to him, he's in the middle of watching a soccer game and abruptly says he'll call her back. This is maddening, but it's his one lapse versus 25 on Bridget's part.On another evening Bridget finds him attending the opera with her rival. He says he has an explanation and when he calls to offer it, her friends spur her into telling him off and hanging up on him. Again, Bridget spends weeks after that wishing Mark would call her, never reasoning that since she was the one to hang up, the next move should be hers.Obviously, our star crossed lovers must remain crossed until the book's last pages. This is understood by both reader and author, but even the most amateur Harlequin romance novelists can find better ways to keep a couple apart than Fielding does. Every time Mark and Bridget have a stumbling encounter, Bridget seems to be with another man. Gary the inept construction worker who leaves a hole in Bridget's apartment wall for months is one faux beau. Daniel the swine Bridget dumped in the first novel is another. Then, there's the dry cleaners. Bridget finds a mysterious charge in her bank account for $149. She thinks it's the dry cleaners and that he has tried to swindle her. She goes to confront him, but doesn't say he's made fraudulent charges on her card. Instead, she talks in circles, telling him she knows what's going on (wink wink) and leaving her lingerie with him. He thinks she is making a pass at her and sends a love letter to Bridget, but addressed to Mark's home (an address Bridget gave him). Mark gets the card and, not surprisingly, wonders what Bridget is up to with the man. It's supposed to be funny, but is too stupid to evoke laughter. It's then that I become certain that Helen Fielding could NOT be a descendant of Henry Fielding.Bridget's friends, Jude and the man-hating Shaz would be amusing, if they didn't seem to derive satisfaction from their friend's misery. Even at her lowest, Bridget wishes them happiness, when it eludes her. On a hellish vacation with Shaz in Thailand, when Shaz hooks up with another traveler, Bridget makes herself scarce. She feels lonely and misses Mark, but she doesn't try to undermine Shaz's short-lived joy. Conversely, Bridget walks on egg shells, afraid to show contentment with Mark, lest she be accused of being smug and condescending to ""singletons."" If Bridget spends time with Mark instead of them, she's selfish. But when they have dates of their own, she's counseled that she must learn to be independent and not crave their company. Even when it's funny, it's not likable.There's a passage on Princess Diana's death that I find irritating now, but might have forgiven if I'd read it 18 years ago. Basically, Bridget thinks Diana was an ambassador for belittled women the world round. If Diana felt inadequate with all of her gifts, then it simply proves that everyone should have more confidence in themselves. Of course, my view of Diana differs from Bridget's, so these pages were meant with great eye-rolling on my part.As the book winds down, the plot devices separating Mark and Bridget become so ridiculous that Fielding doesn't even try to resolve them any longer. At one point, Mark gives Bridget a note. She sees only Rudyard Kipling's poem ""If"" written on it. It turns out that in the letter Mark told her that he still loved her and asked that she called him that evening, if she felt the same. She never saw his message and didn't call, so he assumed the worse. What I don't understand is why she didn't see it? Did she not read the entire thing? Did he write on the reverse side of the page? Did his note inadvertently get mixed up with his drunken father's? Fielding doesn't say and Bridget doesn't ask.That's the problem. Bridget doesn't ask ANYTHING. If she had a five minute conversation with Mark, the book would have been over in the first chapter. But a story built on a house of cards does not deserve to stand anyway. Bridget doesn't ask questions. She doesn't explain herself. She mulls and then explodes. Nothing in between. Of course, part of her charm is that she dreams big and then suffers when reality and fantasy cannot fit. For instance she sees a huge, picture perfect Christmas tree in a magazine, orders it and finds that it's two sizes big for her apartment. So, she has to wack it to pieces and ends up with a mess. We all make such mistakes. That's what makes Bridget identifiable. But her post-fiasco reactions alienate me.When she first hires Gary the construction worker to hang shelves in her apartment, he does a horrible job and never fixes it. So, it makes no sense that she would later hire him to add a second story room. Yet she does and pays him 7000 pounds for a job he barely starts. Not only does he knock a whole into her exterior wall and leave it there, but in the middle of the chaos she begins to smell something decaying in the stairwell and NEVER investigates. Finally, a neighbor calls the police about the odor. Fearing they'll find a corpse, the police nearly arrest Bridget. Turns out the smell was caused by molded beef filet that had been left in her shopping bag. Okayyyyy. But why wouldn't she ever go and find that smelly shopping bag herself. Why did she wait for a neighbor to call the police? Too often, initial laughs are replaced by groans, because not even the most whimsical, distracted person would act like Bridget does.Bridget's stint in prison, after she's suckered by a conman while on vacation in Thailand, was actually the most realistic and least inane debacle that ensnares her. Back in London, when Bridget threatens Gary with legal action for the botched construction job, he mails her a bullet. She doesn't recognize what it is and thinks it's a present from a secret admirer. She's placed under police guard and told to vacate her apartment, until they track down the person who sent the bullet. She stays with Mark. She goes down into the kitchen for a snack, runs into him, scares him silly and when he's shaking in embarrassment, she finally reaches out and tells him how she really feels. It's a sweet moment, but far too little too late. After that, I wanted to read no more, but had to suffer through Jude's wedding and Bridget's zany Christmas card mailings, nonetheless. She gets drunk while writing Christmas cards and sends salacious missives to every crook, misogynist and accountant she's ever known, telling them that she appreciates them as men, admires their physique and feels closer to them after everything they've been through that year (even if they hadn't been through anything except a dispute over VAT deductions on her tax returns). Of course, this leads the men to think she's hot for them. Mark finds it funny. I find it proof that Bridget should probably be institutionalized. That makes the title, ""Edge of Reason,"" appropriate, at least.In the end, I still found Fielding funny, but Bridget much less so. Worse, she and her friends are unlikable. In fact, except for Mark, his mother Elaine, and Bridget's father, all of the characters are fairly awful. Continued reading became a test of my patience. And yet ...being a completest, I have every intention of reading the Ms. Jones' next diary.",0,-0.9889,0.125,0.765,0.11,0.5377805145046525,NEGATIVE,1.0

229,2052141559,07/07/2017,4.0,"Bridget Jones : The Edge of Reason by Helen Fielding is the second book in the Bridget Jones series. Following the journey of the protagonist, Bridget, this book gives us yet another peek into her life with her newly found Mr. Right Mark Darcy, along with some hilariously dangerous situations which she manages to land herself into without much ado.Bridget is in a relationship, a genuine and fulfilling adult relationship with Mark, for over a month now, and for once in her life, she is not feeling miserable. She is in love, happy and elated. She even has a new job! Still making it a point to write into her diary, she now has another count, that of the shags she has had with Mark to jot down, along with her scores of cigarettes, drinks, weight loss and eating healthy. She starts reading a lot of help books, about dating and keeping your man. She also knows that Mark loves her, until, Rebecca, Mark’s colleague comes into the picture. Apparently Rebecca is a young, slim and trim lawyer, and to Bridget’s horror, she finds Mark appraising her professional ability. Fearful of losing Mark to a competitor, Bridget divulges herself into more help books, how to ward off competition and how to bring your man like kinda books. She starts suspecting Mark’s faithfulness to her. She even enlists the help of her close friends, all of whom suggest she either confront Mark or leave him before he emotionally tears her apart. And since our Bridget is not all that confident, she dumps Mark on the pretext of him not loving her anymore and giving attention to Rebecca instead.Meanwhile, in her new job in the television industry, Bridget is the oldie in her team. While some of the youngsters like her, some don’t for she is the one who keeps hogging the limelight with all her marvelous ideas, most of which turn out to be hilarious when she actually does it on live TV. She even gets to interview Mr. Darcy aka Colin Firth of the famous TV series, Pride and Prejudice, in Italy, which she screws up and is ultimately fired. On her return, her friend Shazzer convinces a dejected Bridget to put everything behind her, which can be only done when they go out and enjoy. Impulsively, they decide to tour Thailand and embark immediately. Enjoying themselves immensely on the beaches and the cottages by the side, Bridget starts missing Mark terribly, more so when Shazzer seems to have found a fling. It is not long that the identity of Shazzer’s fling is revealed to be that of a drug smuggler, who tries to use Bridget for transporting the stuff. As a result, she is caught and put behind bars for days without any scope for help. Shazzer, now back in London, enlists Mark’s help to get Bridget freed and the culprit gets caught as well. Thanking Mark for his generosity, she once again leaves him.Bridget is now heartbroken and grieving over her loss and lack of good fate. As fate would have had it, she keeps encountering Mark in social gatherings, her goddaughter’s birthday party where he saves her from a rowdy child and when Rebecca invites her to a weekend outside the city, with she and Mark being the hosts. While Bridget’s fears come true about Mark and Rebecca, everything doesn’t go as planned. Over the stay, it is revealed that Rebecca had wanted Mark for herself, and to throw Bridget out of his life, had manipulated and doctored the situations in a manner such that Bridget had no choice but to get suspicious and leave Mark. Bridget and Mark, both realize that they were at fault, her for not trusting him and he, for not understanding her. It ends with them, in each other’s arms.This book gives the readers an insight into their protagonist’s mindset. It allows us to understand Bridget a little more and bring about her personality in open. While I was happy to see Bridget settle down finally after years of chaotic life in the beginning of the story, it was equally saddening to see her break-up with her Mr. Right on the basis of sheer suspicions. Her gullible and skeptic nature came out of the box to be scrutinized by her fans. The one thing that was quite relatable yet demeaning, was her constant under-confidence and insecurity, especially when Mark came into picture, which so often happens with all of us, even if we are in a much better position than Bridget. But maybe, it is because her character is painted out to be so, like the way Mark’s is to be understanding and completely in love with the weird Bridget. This part of the series can be literally termed as the most romantic yet funny, with frame worthy and he-loves-me/he-loves-me-not scenes, Bridget’s lovey dovey episodes with Mark, her stupid decision of rebuffing him, her drooling over Mr. Darcy aka Colin Firth from Pride and Prejudice, her trip to Thailand and it’s dangerous consequences and finally her getting back with the love of her life. For those who have loved Ms. Jones since reading her first diary entry, will now find her entering into their lives, effortlessly, with her out-of-the-place attitude and knack for inviting trouble, but hale and hearty.",0,0.8917,0.1,0.792,0.107,0.573349443554923,POSITIVE,0.9372
230,2127479033,10/15/2017,3.0,"This was alright.I'll be really honest and say that I didn't really get into it when I started even though it was a pretty decent read MAINLY because of the fact that the last book I read was Harry Potter and I was still pretty high with HP (That sounded like I smoked something).Initial thoughtssss.I think the first book was better. I haven't really read other reviews of the this so this is completely an unbiased opinion. I don't think I really saw much of a relationship with Bridget and Mark. Sure they interacted and they loved each other still but they weren't together for almost the entire time and that's disappointing to me because I really wanted them to be together.It's like this Ross-Rachel thing where they brought them together after a long time and when you started loving them as a couple, THE SHOW TORE THEM APPART FUCCCKK.I have notesss. OKAY.I adore Mark and Bridget's relationship. It's so funny. One thing to note though their relationship on film is waaay better than how it is in the book. Soz. This is probably one of the few times that I do like the movie adaptation better. Bc it's Colin Firth. okay don't judge me.Their relationship. Favourite points: when she was staring at him while he slept and he bolted upright and was like ""Stop staring at me lol"", when she called him at work and he was speaking to an ambassador or something. Probably something I would do is call at the most inconvenient time. Oh and when he said he loved her. Holy shit Mark Darcy. Y? mah hart mah sole. There were so many moments between Mark and Bridget that I love. Any time they were in the same room or they were talking to each other, you could just feel that they want to get back together. uuuuuu. It only took them 300+ pages to realise that *scoffs*The whole thing with Gary was shady ass man. Did he really need to be there in the story? The plot there was funny because Bridget's always annoyed with the state of her apartment bc of Gary but I think that was it. Did he really need to be there? Probs not tbh.It's so cool how Colin Firth is written into the story and he portrays him in the movie. I love anytime Colin is mentioned bc it's always about the lake scene in Pride and Prejudice. ahahahahaha. I know that Helen Fielding wrote Mark Darcy imagining Colin Firth so I guess it all worked out in the end.During that scene where they attended the event. Bridget was worried she'd have rolls showing everywhere what she wore something like a girdle or corset. And it kind of took me back to when I was 14-ish and I used to wrap belts around my stomach because I wanted to hide them. I realise how ridiculous I looked. cringe.You know what I absolutely hate the most about this book is the fact that Bridget is bat-shit crazy with her relationship with Mark. Everything is from a fucking self-help book and magazine or whatever bullshit. All I wanted to do is burn everything that she's reading that makes her overthink what she should or shouldn't do in a relationship. Obviously it's not helping so STOP REFERRING TO THEM FFS. I think what they lacked was trust, you know. All she did was think Mark is sleeping with Rebecca and Mark thinks that every guy who talks to Bridget wants to shag her or something. Daniel you fucker. This is a light bulb moment. Just now. This is all Daniel's fault. Bridget is freaking out bc Daniel cheated on her and Mark is like this bc his wife cheated on him with Daniel. OOOOOO. I get it now. No wonder they're this way. aaaaa.One of my favourite things in this book though was BRIDGET'S INTERVIEW WITH COLIN FIRTH. i'm laughing in my head just thinking about that. It's was so awkward and unconventional reporting-wise and it's so bad it's so good. She was like planning not to ask too much about Pride and Prejudice but ended up bringing every question back to that lake scene. AHAAHAHAHHAHAHA.Oh another character I adore is Constance. She's so cute and so smart too. She was not having any of Rebecca's bullshit and she's definitely Team Bridget. ahahaha when she pointed to Rebecca as being older than Bridget. oo kids don't lie.Although I don't like Bridget's mum or how her friends are in this book (they all seemed really stuck-up)...side note: the page just crashed and i thought i lost everything... her mum gave really good advice of showing Mark who she really is and be honest with him and yes. THAT'S THE ADVICE YOU SHOULD'VE HAD IN THE FIRST PLACE BRIDGET.Good ending good ending.Yup.

231,2461614547,07/18/2018,4.0,"I read two books in the Bridget Jones franchise in 2017.Bridget Jones’s Diary, I didn’t like much, even though it is on a number of must-read lists and is considered to be an exemplary piece of writing. Popular opinion, I guess, is sometimes crushed under your feet. And that’s how variety buds – by being unashamedly proud of individual opinion. I liked the humor in some places, but I found it strangely lacking in a lot of places. It’s a prime example of how we all make plans and don’t follow through them, most unintentionally because we forgot. Here’s the full review of the first diary.Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, the second in the series is a different matter altogether, even though it is still written in epistolary form, in this case, a diary format. This book is longer than the first and it grew on me. It makes me sympathize with Bridget Jones.Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason follows Bridget’s adventures (or misadventures) after what seemed like a happily-ever-after with Mark Darcy. There are no weight issues, though her struggle to understand the demarcation between single life and life in a relationships is still real. Oh, and like the first book, maybe more, she has the shittiest luck ever.Bridget Jones’s masochism has died, thankfully, though she has the talent to unintentionally put herself in uncompromising situations. She is still bumbling, but she is who she is, unapologetically so. But there are layers to her character that somehow make me proud. And when she says things like “Personality is undergoing seismic change,” it’s basically all of us in the throes of reining adulthood to our liking.She still has idiot friends who give her stupid advice on occasion, almost looking like they are pulling her back from where she ought to be. But I guess, if these friends are loyal, then you can bear to have them in your life. She still has a knack for being innocently confident, following which everything comes tumbling down. She still has a henpecking mother who does the stupidest things and is a little unwary of what’s going on in her daughter’s life. There are a lot of characters who retain their eccentricities, but Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason gives them more layers.Reading Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, a thought that crossed my mind was that Bridget is sort of a de-motivator for women. But in her defense, it’s a diary – one place where we put our deepest and darkest feelings and secrets. So maybe it isn’t farfetched after all. It is, for me, better than its predecessor. The Edge of Reason made me laugh more, and I can somehow, in some twisted way, relate better to Bridget in this book.Yes, Bridget Jones has the worst timing ever. Even the events that happen to her. And that’s why, probably, she’s always out of luck. In a perennial loop, she seems to be. She demonstrated this in Bridget Jones’s Diary and she does it again. But this time around, we merely sigh and go, “Oh, no, Bridget! Not again!” rather than “What is wrong with this woman?”The point of a first-person narrative is to build sympathy with the protagonist. And when thoughts like “I wish to sock Bridget’s Mum in the face” crossed my mind, I know Helen Fielding has done a good job. With its unique brand of British humor, the book has given me a new favorite word that makes me laugh even now: bollocking. It’s there in a few places and it made me snort. While Bridget Jones’s Diary is light chick-lit with annoying characters, Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason is closer home in terms of lessening stupidity in people.I haven’t watched the second instalment in the Bridget Jones movie franchise, but I am told it isn’t as good as the first one. So in this case, the community of booklovers stands vindicated. The book is better than the movie!Look at how she puts relationships in simple words:It is all very well you yourself thinking things aren’t right in a relationship, but if the other person starts doing it is like someone else criticizing your mother.It is in lines like these that I started falling in love with Bridget Jones’s humor and her story of that year. Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason made me laugh multiple times, more in a couple of chapters than Bridget Jones’s Diary did in its entirety.Bridget Jones did redeem herself after all!",0,0.9971,0.078,0.756,0.165,0.4934311789574948,NEGATIVE,0.8001
232,1875386701,01/24/2017,3.0,"For the first half of this book I only had complaints - the book reads as thoughts from Bridget's head, which means unless it is a direct conversation, the ""sentences"" are almost always incomplete. That drove me absolutely bonkers throughout this novel. Time is marked by dates, and under each date is a short note from Bridget about her weight and caloric intake along with other information about the day. Although I couldn't find a mention of Bridget's actual height, it was distressing to read her constantly fretting about weighing 130 lb (give or take). Seeing as The Edge of Reason reads as if primarily geared towards young adult readers, it seems that it would be detrimental to those same readers to have yet another character thrusting numbers at them about how much is okay to weigh and how many calories are *too* many. Not to mention, Bridget and her friends are heavy drinkers, and at one point experiment with *natural* (still illegal) drugs. The obsession Bridget, Jude, and Shaz have with dating/self-help genre novels is frankly rather distressing, but I'm happy to report that was one of the things that improved towards the second half of the novel. In the first half, Fielding randomly incorporated a boy with supposed schizophrenia for no visible purpose other than shock value, which I was angry about. The addition of the boy was unnecessary - he only appeared in the story for a short time and quickly disappeared again - and was also very unhelpful for the general fear about mental illnesses. Another anger-inducing slight to people with mental illnesses in their loved ones was found on pg. 152, when a homosexual character claimed he didn't want to talk (due to sad feelings about an ex-boyfriend) ""Because I have lost my former personality and become a manic-depressive.” Fielding does realize that mental illness does not work that way, right?There were other, slightly less offensive things included for shock value, but the book did get better sometime after the halfway mark. There were a few things funny enough that I laughed out loud, and at the end it seemed that Bridget had grown since the beginning of the novel. All in all, I would not want to read this book again - or anything else by this author - but I am glad to have stuck with it until the end. The story ends well, but it is still not recommended reading material for those who have less self-confidence or sense of self. ",0,-0.2754,0.121,0.77,0.109,0.4485576923076922,NEGATIVE,0.9999
233,3940358137,04/13/2021,4.0,"It seems Bridget has fallen into Persuasion this time - and a great many awful scenarios besides. Was a bit disappointed that her eating disorder level obsession with her weight was not addressed (at one point she attempts to lose like seven pounds in seven days), but there are two more books yet and she seems to make incremental progress as she goes. While Persuasion is my favorite Austen it felt more like some of it was lifted directly into this installment rather than being creatively reimagined (kid in hair, Admiral Darcy suddenly, overheard convo between beau and flirty girl, etc.). Also I wasn't expecting to be cycled through another Austen book (let alone my favorite), but just expected a continuation of Bridget's story. I fully expect to look for more Austen and find suddenly that the author has dropped the gimmick. Also it would have been great to use one of my favorite quotes from Persuasion in this plotline (about Anne and Wentworth being perpetually estranged), but did not see it directly referenced or paraphrased. Plus the fact that they got back together after 8 years apart and after both experiencing extreme changes in fortune made the plunge into it here seem extra gimmicky...I also sort of expected Bridget would address some of the casual sexism that she faces, and notes, daily. Like creeps constantly making advances at her or her boss consistently talking to her tits. But nothing really comes of this. I am completely unsurprised that the cops suspect Darcy as he hangs around her apartment quite a lot once they've broken up (I'm not generally a fan of the breaking up over nothing/up-played misunderstanding trope either...there are plenty of legitimate relationship issues to trip over). I'm surprised that it never occurs to Bridget that he's passing her house on purpose just like she drives by his. Another thing I don't understand is what Rebecca's deal is. She's kind of friends with Bridget but spends so much time everywhere Darcy is that I started to think she worked with him but that didn't quite seem to be the case either. She's a real creeper. I think both Darcy and Bridget need to set better boundaries around toxic, crazy people.",0,0.976,0.076,0.799,0.125,0.5499999999999999,NEGATIVE,0.9996

No longer a singleton, Bridget is revelling in her new romance; however, she soon realises that being in a relationship is not quite its all cracked up to be in a novel that had me laughing, cringing and crying all at the same time!Mark and Bridget have been dating for six weeks and everything is perfect, well, except for the fact that he folds his underwear. But then Rebecca starts hanging around Mark a little too much for Bridget's liking and her jealousy gets the better of her. Ending their relationship, Bridget reluctantly returns to single life and is forced to deal with her erratic boss, an ex who refuses to leave her alone, a prison stint in Thailand and that massive hole in the wall.Although this book was very different to the film adaption that I adore so much, I enjoyed all of the added detail we were given and it really highlighted how much has to be cut to fit into a movie. The events that take place in this book were perfect in a this-would-only-happen-to-Bridget and you-couldn't-make-this-up (or, in fact, you can) kind of way. Fielding really does have a knack for coming up with the most bizarre and fantastical story lines which I love! Bridget Jones will never get old for me; I love her humour and she really does have me laughing out loud at her hard to believe antics!One of my criticisms of the last book was that we didn't get to meet Mark soon enough so I was not completely convinced by their relationship. Mark was so much more present in this book and his personality really came through. We got the awkwardness that is so recognisable in the film, but he also has a dirty sense of humour which I loved! I also found it extremely comical how he kept turning up in Bridget's life at the most random times. It added to the whole awkward persona he has and their encounters always made me laugh.One thing I do think I would have liked to have seen from this book would be for Bridget to stand up to her friends a little bit more. There are a few comments made, mainly by Mark, about how her friendship group is very involved in Bridget's life and quite often gives her bad relationship advice, which ultimately leads to Bridget's decision to end her relationship with Mark. Moreover, Bridget is always at the end of the phone for her friends but they never clear their diaries in the same way for her. As Bridget always has these eureka moments where she learns to stand up for herself, I think it would have been a great addition for her to stand up to her friends and remind them to let her live her own life how she chooses!This was such a fun, easy read to dust off some of those January blues. Although this book may be a little dated now, I don't think it will ever fail to make me laugh and I love getting sucked into the Bridget Jones universe.

Most of the entries she will write at night. 	In this book Bridget has a boyfriend named Mark Darcy. Mark is a lawyer for the town in which they live in. Bridget and Mark are head over heels for each other. They love to spend time together doing pretty much anything. Well that is until Mark thinks that Bridget is cheating on him. At this point Mark decides he wants to be single for a little while just to have a break so he can think about what he really wants in life.

Jed and Sharon become inseparable. Jed takes Sharon around Thailand, he shows her a lot of things most people don’t think about going to see when they’re in Thailand. Before Bridget and Sharon leave Thailand Jed buys Sharon a statue, Sharon's bags were so full so Bridget put the statue in her bag. Let’s say there is a surprise that comes along with that statue.

Things took an interesting turn in this book, and her clumsiness caused problems on a global scale, which I forgot about, even though I've seen the movie a few times. But the character development from the first book continues; Bridget is more confident and self-assured, and things work out for her in the end. A year in her life is very eventful, being the young, successful Singleton that she is, however she seems to spend most of her time worrying about things that *might* happen, and then when they do, she just gets on with it. There's a bit of Bridget in all of us.Quite funny, although not sure if less funny than first book, perhaps because know Bridget better and she becomes more predictable (not plot itself, just characters and such).

I didn’t understand the drastic change in the movie compared to the book. Also Rebecca’s character doesn’t really go anywhere in the book and towards the end other than “getting together” with Marks lawyer friend Giles isn’t really mentioned. The jail part in the book isn’t very realistic. Unless Bridget was actually dreaming throughout her time in prison I can’t see her really singing “like a virgin” and parading around for the time she was there. My most favourite part had the be the end. Bridget gets drunk and decides to write Christmas cards to friends and colleagues and posts them in the same night.

Overall, it was a great and sweet novel that I enjoyed, and would recommend to anyone who needed a cheer up! :)",0,0.9949,0.015,0.702,0.283,0.5078947368421053,POSITIVE,0.9996
271,1145829328,06/18/2012,2.0,"Whenever something is a huge sales success, it inevitably spawns a sequel. This isn't always a good thing and more sequels are a bad idea than are good ones. After all, sequels are difficult things. With a sequel, the fans what more of the same quality and all the things that made the original so popular, but if you replicate the original too closely, those same fans complain that it's exactly the same as the original. More often than not, you discover that you can't win with a sequel and they're better avoided.With ""Bridget Jones - The Edge of Reason"", Fielding has been careful not to fall into the trap of making a sequel too similar to the original. Part of the reason for this is that Bridget's life is moving on from the end of the previous year, rather than from the beginning. So she's now settled into the job she gained part way through the original and she is now part of a couple, no longer needing to hunt for a man.This does mean certain changes between the original novel and this. There are fewer nights out with Shazza and Jude, for example, with Bridget preferring to spend time with Mark Darcy. There is also less chasing around worrying if men fancying her, as there is really only one true object of her affections. That said, the course of Bridget's love life has never run smooth and there are enough ups and downs in her relationship to keep things interesting.Of course, all the hallmarks of the original novel are there, in that Bridget is still obsessively watching her weight and still relying on any number of self-help books to try and make sense of her muddled love life. Her mother is still at once controlling and flighty, filled with strange plans which make no sense and which are made with little consideration for others.The writing style is much the same, although the diary entries seem sparser, but longer. There are few entries this time around, but many of them are a lot longer. At points, this almost gives the writing style a novel like feel, rather than the diary format that the original was written in. Whilst this perhaps makes things a little easier to read, it is less effective that way, as part of the charm of the original was the style of the writing.Unfortunately, with some of the standard parts of Bridget's former life, such as her on-off relationship with Daniel Cleaver and her many nights out with the girls missing, Fielding is having to find additional material to pad things out. This is where, for me, ""The Edge of Reason"" is less successful than its predecessor. The whole Thailand segment, although possible in theory, is a little too neat in its execution and completion to be totally believable and the parts after this stretch the realms of reality even further.The major drawback about that is that much of the wider appeal of ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" was that she had so much in common with so many women. Very few packed as much into their lives, but most could read that book and spot something of themselves in there. This seems to be less the case this time around. In ""The Edge of Reason"", the comparisons that could be made between Bridget Jones and the people I know, especially the people who I could see signs of in ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" are either missing or very fleeting. It seems as if, in her attempts to make Bridget Jones more exciting, she's lost sight of who Bridget Jones was in the first place. There is less of an ""everywoman"" feel to Bridget here.The male characters are again a little all over the place. In one way or another they have to be flawed. Whilst some aspects of male behaviour are a little more accurate than in the original diary, the men here are still largely sketched in as required, rather than being major characters. Strangely, it's Jude's Vile Richard, a man much mentioned in the original, but never actually seen, who seems closest to reality this time around. The characters that cross over the two novels don't have quite as much luck, maybe as Fielding has had to show some kind of continuation across the two, even with the less successful parts.""The Edge of Reason is not a complete disaster, however. There are still some quite funny parts to it, even if some of them do get their humour out of being over the top. Bridget Jones constant worrying about her weight and her boyfriend are still very much common behaviours. And Bridget's mother is still an absolute nightmare.For me, however, this falls between two of Fielding's other books. It has some of the charm and humour of ""Bridget Jones's Diary"", but lets that down badly by combining it with some of the ridiculousness of ""Olivia Joules…"" Sadly, the combination does more to damage Bridget Jones than it does to elevate Olivia Joules. I'm sure Fielding was trying to open up Bridget Jones to a new audience, but she may well have ended up alienating the one she already had.This isn't a book for the casual reader. If you've not read the original Bridget Jones, or at least seen the film, you may struggle to follow many of the events here, especially at the start. If you have seen the original, this might be worth a read for curiosity value, just to see how Bridget turned out once she'd landed her man. For those who didn't enjoy the original very much and couldn't care less what happened, ""The Edge of Reason"" is certainly not going to change your opinions.This review may also appear, in whole or in part, under my name at any or all of www.ciao.co.uk, www.thebookbag.co.uk, www.goodreads.com, www.amazon.co.uk and www.dooyoo.co.uk",0,0.9981,0.067,0.787,0.146,0.4916494639428524,NEGATIVE,0.998
