0,12845786,01/18/2008,1.0,"Why can't there be a negative star rating? I hated, hated this book. And yes, I did finish it. All way-too-many pages of it. But, in my defense it was (foolishly) the only book I brought with me when I was hospitalized for 24 hours after wisdom tooth surgery, and when your options are daytime soaps or this wretched book...well, at least I got to read the ending and conclude definitively that it wasn't worth it. Okay, now that I've gotten a bit of a rant out, let me be a little more organized about my dislikes:1. The sex. More accurately, the sex after sex after sex, in graphic detail (not pornographic detail, granted, but WAY more than I wanted to picture), at all sorts of different ages. Wow. Yeah, I just hated that. If it serves a purpose to the plot, fine, include it, but don't give me every single move. I just don't need to know that.2. The plot was convoluted. I can say this fairly because I read it in practically one sitting, and while I was able to keep things straight, it would have served the book better to not attempt to take in so many sub-plots and minutia. 3. Okay, I will admit that for having a sci-fi premise, the concept of time travel as outlined here was at least moderately believable. What I didn't like was that it wasn't especially original (anyone seen Journeyman?) yet had the pretension that it was.4. The whole crux of the novel was the great love story between Henry and Claire. Yet, as a reader I'm much more interested and moved by two NICE people ending up together, and staying together, than two people I just don't like that much. Let's face it, Henry is not a great guy. And there's that whole poor-rich-girl thing going on with Claire. I just wasn't feeling it.Okay, all of that said, I really don't recommend this book to anyone. I realize there are a lot of people that like it (I know; I checked the reviews expecting to be completely vindicated, but alas, it seems I'm in the minority) but those people who like it apparently enjoy a different class of book than I do. There are so many great works out there, why waste your time with this?",732,0.9867,0.097,0.742,0.161,0.5505140692640693,NEGATIVE,1.0
1,4145322,08/06/2007,5.0,"Warning: Spoilery review. Short version: Hurry up and read this. Holy crap. Someone should have warned me about reading this book at work. I have been sitting here bawling my eyes out, tears streaming madly down my cheeks, flooding my eyes until the words swim into fields of glistening black lines. This book is so beautiful and anguishing to read I can't even be objective about it, because it was one of those stories that just burrowed a lot closer to home than you could ever feel comfortable with. Really, though, even objectively I have little to offer in the way of criticism. What was probably a nightmare of a book to write was woven together seamlessly, so beautifully constructed it seems more like a living, organic thing than an idea born inside someone's head. I liked the foreshadowing, I liked the intricacy, I liked that we never really know what Alba chooses in the future, whether she embraces the time travel or tries to stop it. I loved the poignant pain that begins to trickle across the pages as the pieces begin falling into place. I am curious to see how Clare and Alba's relationship developed once Henry was gone, but I was happy it was not in the story. That there are plenty of things for my imagination to fill in makes me happy. I also really liked the approach the author took to the paradox of time travel. It seemed the most plausible, unarguable position I've ever heard (and I have taken a class on it), though I have not allowed myself to think about it too hard as I have no wish, at least within the context of this book, to unravel how much sense it makes. What really hit me in the gut (seriously, I did not even cry this hard when I read ""Where the Red Fern Grows"" for the first time, and I got red-faced, puffy-eyed and ugly over that one), was the horrible feeling that I could see myself as Clare and know exactly how she felt about Henry, and could fill the unwritten pages of her future with grief that I would know and understand. I cannot imagine losing my husband. I cannot imagine ever having to face a day knowing that he was not there, and never would be again. No matter how much I would want to think that for his sake I would be strong, go on, live out my life with joy and accomplishment as he would have wanted, the truth is I would probably wind up just like Henry's father, a wasted, squandered creature who does not know how to exist alone without the sound of his laughter, the warmth of his arms around my body, the feel of his head resting against my chest, the drowsy murmur of ""I love you"" against my ear as we drift off to sleep, the domestic intimacy and companionship that accompanies the hiss of bacon frying in the skillet as he and I stand side by side fixing breakfast on Sunday mornings. I do not know who I would be without those things, but I would be someone unrecognizable from who I am now. This book is also listed on IMDB, which really excites me, as I think it could be a beautiful movie. Everything it needs to be good is right here in the book, and because of the manner of Henry's death, it even lacks the melodramatic twist that most dramas rely on, such as a car accident, an act of God, or something else outside of the character's control. No, there is culpability here, and that is an incredibly powerful thing. While it was not the purpose of this book to examine how Claire dealt with her father and brother after Henry's death, or how they dealt with themselves, it would have been so interesting to see. There's too much to like about this book, and something so real and raw and powerful about the sadness and grief it portrays. Incredible.

2,16815515,03/01/2008,1.0,"Let me start this by saying I was very excited to read this book. I thought it was going to be good. It is not in any way good. It could have been good, the idea could have soared but in Niffenegger's hands it was destroyed by laundry lists of grocery bag contents, street directions, and punk bands until I even said, out loud, more than once, ""okay, I get it."" He bought groceries, he knows how to get around in Chicago, Clare likes to clean her studio, he is not just a punk rock poser but the real deal, complete with his cherry red Docs,etc. Seriously, this stuff does not pass for good writing in any circles. The tedious minutae of life is boring and makes the author look like she is trying to pad her story for more bulk.The worst part of this book was that the whole thing was based on contrived plot devices. The whole time I was reading I was wondering why the author chose to have him time travel naked. To me it seemed like if it weren't for his constant pursuit of clothes there may be some real chance at something actually happening in the story. Then at the end of the book I realized that the whole naked thing was a tool to achieve the amputations at the end. Where was this woman's editor? How do things like this get published, this story was nowhere near polished and pared down enough to make it to publication. Also, the gory miscarriage scenes, yuck! There was no introspect into the character's hearts and minds. How does Henry feel about knowing when he is going to die? How does Clare deal with him being a time travel? We will never know because the book was too full of what they did and how they did it and nothing about how they felt. I don't care about that stuff. These characters were selfish, pretentious and self absorbed. And the credibility goes right out the window when they win the lottery. Come on!I honestly don't see why this book is so well loved! This book angered me.",312,0.9258,0.086,0.79,0.124,0.591015466015466,NEGATIVE,1.0
3,2027454181,06/12/2017,5.0,"This is my 400th book review for Goodreads. Wow. I am either one sick or one inspired woman (or both). Apparently when I reach my 500th review, Goodreads will put a little encouraging ""button"" on my profile (they might as well just give me a bookmark), but 400 feels big, too, so I wanted to review a book that I love but have never reviewed here.The Time Traveler's Wife is a controversial novel, and when my book club discussed it, there were burning pitchforks, buckets of hot tar and glasses of Pinot Noir being splashed in faces. The room was like a parking lot after a football game between contentious rivals. It was awesome.I give a HUGE amount of credit to the ladies of my book club. For 11 years they have suffered through having me, both a Lit teacher and a writer, as a member, and they have put up with A LOT of my empassioned opinions. When I don't like a book, I make it ABUNDANTLY clear why it sucks and when I love a book that others don't, I verbally knock them out of my way.And I love this book. Boy howdy, do I love this book. I originally read it 11 years ago (then re-read it, and took a bunch of notes), and the characters and the plot just hopped on into the synapses of my brain, curled up there and have remained comfortably in that position, forevermore.In my opinion, you can read this book for its surface value (as a romance or an adventure), or you can go deeper. This novel is loaded with metaphors, and you can get both Biblical here and/or follow the story with Homer's Odyssey by your side.For Henry is a modern day Odysseus. He's a Christ-figure as well. He represents the spring, the adventurer, the one who is both sacrificed and reborn.And his love, Clare, is both the archetypal mother and the wife, the perpetual autumn, and Penelope, the one who waits.Niffenegger's plot point of time travel is immense. It serves here as a lush metaphor for the cycle of life: the living, the dying, the what comes after. And it doesn't hurt that Henry loves my kind of music, too.The ladies of book club who passionately disliked this book cited several reasons. They complained that Niffenegger's style was not linear, they had a hard time following the plot, and they found Henry's relationship with Clare bordering on predatory or creepy. I acknowledge that they experienced these problems, but they just weren't an issue for me.And the ending. . . my God. I cried to the point of embarrassment, even though I was home alone as I finished. I actually GASPED at the end, and my steadfast rule is. . . if a book makes me GASP, it automatically earns 5 stars. It is truly one of the best, most heart-breaking endings to a novel that I've ever encountered. My sweatshirt was soaked by the end and I ached and mourned and grieved all over those final pages.I actually started to cry while writing this review, just revisiting that ending. A decade later.

The two protagonists, Henry and Clare were not only meant for each other, but it was as if they were destined to be together.

5,17990635,03/17/2008,4.0,"I am conflicted about this book. Do not let my 4 stars fool you, they are an emotional rating.I'll start with the things I really liked about it:Loved all the foreshadowing. The knowing something was going to happen, and maybe even a little bit of what it was, but never knowing or understanding fully until both characters had experienced the moment. And then all the foreshadowing of the tragic end. Once I started putting the puzzle together I really couldn't put it down. And I had several moments where I couldn't control the tears even long before the tragedy happens, because the foreshadowing was that emotionally charged.I felt that the way the author set it up was ingenious. While you are reading along in a fairly chronological timeline, it is interspersed with moments of past and future as Henry travels through time. At first it felt very disjunct, but by the end I really loved the way it mirrored how Henry and Clare must feel as they lived their life in such a non-chronological manner. Especially Henry.The love story was indeed epic. I bawled like a baby at the end, it was so tragic to me. And sweet at the same time. The way that the author addressed themes of love, fate, destiny, personal choice and, of course, time was mind blowing at times (as all time travel issues are to me) but very cool to see how it all intertwined. I liked how she dealt with the whole time travel issue in that Henry could never actually change anything in the future. Everything already happened, whether in the past or the future, because for Henry, his future is his past and his past is his future. I told you it was a bit mind blowing. But yeah, the love story was riveting.Things I didn't like so much:The absolutely uneccesary detail of the mundane. I felt the author spent too much time describing grocery lists (literally!) of things and music and whatever when she could have been examining the thoughts and feelings of the characters. It took me 3 weeks to read this book, and not because it was long. I didn't have any problem ignoring it for days at a time because of the tedious reading at times. Nothing in the writing made me want to keep reading until the last half of the book, which I did read much more quickly.The language. F-word on nearly every page. Two sitings of the C-word. Totally unnecessary. The love scenes were often a bit graphic, and there were so many of them. Because of this, I started feeling that the love was based in sex more than anything and I would have like the author to explore some of the more deep feelings that did show up when Henry and Clare weren't in bed. Again, unnecessary really.Sometimes I got confused and experienced deja vu. Knowing it was because one of the characters had already mentioned a certain event and I would often have to go through the book and find the previous mention so I could have full understanding.Mostly though, it was a very cool book. And very emotional...at least for me. It really spoke to something in me about relationships and choices and destiny (not that I totally believe in destiny, but you know.)p",247,0.9955,0.038,0.831,0.131,0.4694077232883202,NEGATIVE,0.8052

When he vanishes, where he goes, and how long his trips will last are beyond his control. However, his destinations are tied to his subconscious—he most often travels to places and times related to his own history. Certain stimuli such as stress can trigger Henry's time traveling; he often goes jogging to keep calm and remain in the present. He searches out pharmaceuticals in the future that may be able to help control his time traveling. He also seeks the advice of a geneticist, Dr. Kendrick. Henry cannot take anything with him into the future or the past, which means that he always arrives naked and then struggles to find clothing, shelter, and food. He does amass a number of survival skills, including lock-picking, self-defense, and pickpocketing.

10,22372415,05/16/2008,2.0,"Just because something is popular does not mean it's good. Mass ""taste"" is often incredibly bad. Such is the case with this book, only it's not incredibly bad, just not worth the hours it takes to read it.It seems like every fiction book I've read in the past couple of years is highly depressing, this one included. My life is full enough of it's own challenges and disappointments that I'd like to read to escape. Yes, if novels are full of heartache and struggle, they are realistic and more accurately reflecting real life. Well, this book is clearly not realistic anyway, and the amount of trauma that happened to Henry went beyond what an average person encounters. I appreciate what Niffenegger was trying to do, and it certainly has it's romanticism, but it was not enjoyable to read. At the beginning, I had a hard time getting past the ridiculousness of the time traveling man that is the main premise of the book. I compared it to the annoying, short-lived tv show ""Journeyman"", the (also depressing) movie ""Premonition"", and the time-traveling bits in ""Lost"". To better swallow it, I thought of it as a children's book for adults. So I finally got past the goofiness of time-travelin' Henry. It was interesting how the author put together all the different past and futures. I thought she did a good job with how she chose to order them in the book. Where was the plot though? While this is not a traditional story in its presentation, if you put the different scenes in sequential order it should be. Instead of a story with much of a plot though, it was more like an anthropological ethnographic study of Clare and Henry. One third of the book was just them having sex and making coffee. It read to me as more of a descriptive chronicle than a tale with messages to relay. I also thought that Niffenegger never fully developed certain pieces like what happened to Henry's dad after Henry visited him and he was barely holding it together. Later in the book, he comes across as a typical, mostly functioning father, but we don't see how that change occurred. It also isn't clear why Henry likes Gomez. It must be nice for Henry to have a friend who knows his secret, and Gomez does some stuff to help out Henry and Clare, but why the bond? The first time they all have dinner together, Gomez is highly rude to Henry, but then the next time they meet during one of the time travels, they're all buddy-buddy. It's not like Henry's just using him for help; he actually likes him on some emotional level. One would think Gomez being in love with Clare would get in the way of that. To wrap this up, I also think the author tries too hard to make Clare and Henry cool: Clare with her dramatic artsiness and Henry with his incredible scope of book knowledge and languages, plus all the stuff about their music tastes. I don't think she does a very good job of showing how Henry goes from being the selfish, lost young jerk to the caring, mature husband. It's supposed to be Clare's influence, but the process is not really shown. There's another huge gap in info that bothers me, but it would be a spoiler. (Hard to believe you could have a spoiler without much plot, but there are a couple pieces that are major events in the book.) All in all, interesting concept tying time travel to romance, but with real life being trying enough, I need something more light-hearted.

11,13416530,01/24/2008,4.0,"I have a serious love/hate relationship with this book. The good stuff:I really liked the jumps back and forth in time - surprisingly, the author was able to keep it all straight and I never really felt so terribly confused that I just wanted to give up.I loved the Henry character. I really loved him. He was flawed, he tried so hard to be a good man, etc etc. I just really loved this character.I liked the love story - I felt that the feelings between the two of them were real and so deep. So often a love story goes for huge dramatics to prove the deep love between two people and I liked that she didn't do that - you see their love for each other in what they do, how they talk, how they touch.I liked how the author kept the time traveling dark - the idea that he has no money and no clothes and has to scramble to stay alive and not arrested, etc etc. was great - very realistic for an unreal premise.I actually liked that they threw in the genetic testing and whatever of the time traveling disorder. I know many people felt that it was ridiculous, or felt like it was just shoved in there, but I really thought it brought a realism to the story. It helped take the story out of the sci-fi realm and put it more in reality. All of a sudden it became about a person with a disease and a family fighting to hold it together rather than a mysterious hole in the universe. I don't normally like pseudo science, but I actually thought it worked here.The bad stuff:I hated the name dropping, etc. I know some people liked it, but I just hated it. Yeah, I get it - he liked punk music. Wow. It just felt so contrived and fake to me. It felt more like the AUTHOR likes punk music and art and architecture and whatever else and was putting in those names as a shout out to her ""peeps"". Like, hey guys, if you know who this is you are part of a super secret cool club - yeah!! Not so much.I thought the Claire character was criminally flat. I agree with another reviewer that said the book was called ""The Time Traveler's WIFE"" and yet she is mostly a non-character. Now, I don't have a problem with the idea that she ended up devoting her life to Henry. That her commitment to him overshadowed other choices she could have made in life - well, I thought that was pretty realistic and understandable. If her husband got in a car crash and was a vegetable for the rest of his life, and to take care of him she ended up having to forgo many choices and let her life be dictated by this man and his medical needs, we wouldn't be arguing as much about it. But that doesn't mean she doesn't have her own dreams, thoughts, needs, desires, etc. which the author could have spent more time dealing with and developing. I really felt that Claire was mainly there as an object for Henry to love - not her own person. You never feel that Claire loved Henry and made this choice, this sacrifice - you feel that it was inevitable because the author said so.Claire's family was ridiculously flat. If Claire was not developed enough, her family wasn't developed at all. They are pretty much cardboard cut outs of stereotypes propped up at certain points in the story to help keep the plot going. And where the heck do they live again that EVERYONE has money. Not just money, but Money. I got sick and tired of the pregnancies and miscarriages. How many times before you realize you are harming yourself and your husband to the point that you will never recover? Given what happens to him and all - aren't their lives hard enough?? Why do that to yourselves over and over? I understand the strong desire for a child, but why not adopt? Why was that not an option? I can't remember at that point if they knew it was a genetic disorder or not - but if they did, would they really want that for their child - wouldn't that be even more of a reason to adopt? And what the heck were they going to tell that child?? Given how talky the characters were, I was pretty surprised that there were no heartfelt discussions of how exactly they were going to raise a child in that type of environment and what they would tell other people, etc,I really didn't like the abrupt cut from the grief on Henry dying to her being 85. That is a lot of time to cover and it felt cheap to not give even a token synopsis of how her and her daughter dealt with his death and her having the same disorder. I honestly can't decide whether her being able to see him one last time (it was him as a younger man jumping way ahead in time, so it was the past for Henry who was still dead) was touching or cruel. To deal with a devastating loss like that and so much time has gone by and to just have him pop back in like that - are you glad for one more precious moment or is it terribly cruel to give hope and snatch it away? And to do that to the daughter too?? I don't know.....My feelings about the ending depend on my mood. Somedays I feel that the ending was depressing but realistic. Not everything has a happy ending and I hate it when movies and TV show that ANY problem can be solved in 30 minutes! So having something real, even if difficult, felt right. Other days I feel like it was crap. Sure life isn't always great but it isn't always crap either. And I hate fatalism like that - I hate the idea that life is crap and there is no escaping it. I was also annoyed with Henry quitting - just giving up on life for so long after the feet thing. I get that he was depressed and all. I do. But he has lived his whole life not being able to depend on anything - not where he will wake up, not if he'll have money, not be able to see or be with the people he loves, having to be deposited in the middle of no where and scramble for clothes, food and money with no idea when and where he will return? This is a man who is incredibly resourceful and resilient. I just had a hard time believing that he would quit like that. Then again, I would imagine all those years of doing just that would take a toll on him and that was the final blow he just couldn't handle. But no, I still think it was out of character.And the truly terribleThe two things that are just atrocious in this book - the references to her families black servants and Henry's friend and downstairs neighbor growing up, Kimmy. Wow. Holy Stereotypes batman!! Even given Claire's family having money and being upper crust and all - the whole description of them and the black servants was so odd and anachronistic. Wait - when did we all time travel to 1776?? Why is Mammy here? And with Henry's downstairs neighbor - she was slightly better written and I enjoyed her character in relation to Henry and all, but again, she was so stereotypical with the broken en-ga-rish and all. I don't know how she got away with those representations at all - how did not one editor or something say,"" uh, Audrey, could we talk about these ethnic characters? They might be a little too ethnic."" Seriously. Absurd.So that is it- I loved parts of this book and hated parts of this book. There was a lot that was well done and some that was criminal. I don't know if I wish someone else had taken this idea and written it or if I wish the author had held onto this idea until she had more books under her belt and could do it justice. Either way, I just can't truly recommend this book but I can't tell people to avoid it either. AARGH!",148,0.9941,0.125,0.716,0.159,0.5898509294068509,NEGATIVE,0.9659
12,438780187,10/21/2012,1.0,"I am not a romance reader by nature. That's not to say that I don't enjoy them from time to time, but I just don't usually gravitate toward romance. And to be completely honest, I had absolutely zero intention of reading this book, ever. But then it was chosen as my October Bookclub book, so my intentions just became irrelevant. So, now that I've read it... Umm... Well. I think that this book did have an interesting premise, and in another author's hands, could have been fantastic. But most of the time while reading this, I just kept feeling, well, manipulated and skeptical. All I kept thinking as I read this was how implausible it all was. And I'm not just talking about the time-travel.Just to forewarn you, this long (really long) Ranty McRanter Review may contain spoilery stuff.This book's description says ""[...]this is the remarkable story of Henry DeTamble, a dashing, adventuresome librarian who travels involuntarily through time, and Clare Abshire, an artist whose life takes a natural sequential course. Henry and Clare's passionate love affair endures across a sea of time and captures the two lovers in an impossibly romantic trap[...]"". Uh huh. ""Impossibly romantic trap""? Well. A trap of some kind, anyway. My biggest issue here is that Clare's life has been entirely determined by Henry, with a little help from his unknown ally, the Catholic Church. Henry's told her what her life is and will be: She will be his wife. And because of her Catholic upbringing, the concept of predestination is not at all foreign to her (remember, God has a plan for us all), and so she accepts it as a matter of course. She sees him as her closest friend, the person who knows the most about her in the world, the person who loves her the most in the world, and as a young girl who is just starting to form ideas about romantic love, I'd imagine that to her he's like a God. An all-knowing (he knows her future) but mysterious (because he won't tell her about it, or anything about himself), unconditionally loving (I don't think I need to explain this one), metaphysical or supernatural being (time traveler, remember?), and who is just waiting for her to accept him (well, actually, just to get old enough to do so). I don't think it's much of a stretch, honestly. So, leaving aside the paradox of their relationship technically being impossible (they only meet in the present because of Henry telling her where they will while visiting Clare in the past), it strikes me as incredibly unfair to Clare that from 6 years old, when she meets a naked man claiming to be a time traveler in the meadow near her house, her life becomes tethered to Henry. Now, I can see a 6 year old accepting a story of a time traveler. A 6 year old's imagination is a wild thing, and children can accept and cope with concepts that would drive adults to drink. But as Clare gets older, and learns more about her life with Henry - that they are married, specifically - it becomes less and less plausible to me that someone would be able to accept that.How does she know that he's not lying to her, or manipulating her into the life he claims she will live with him? She doesn't know anything at all about him other than the fact that he shows up naked in her yard repeatedly and claims to be her husband in the future. To me, the time travel itself isn't enough evidence. He could be a time traveler AND a liar. It just seems to me like a waste. A waste of a life that Clare could have had that would have been fulfilling and satisfying without Henry in it. Considering the fleeting nature of their relationship, and the massive extent of time she spent waiting for him, I just don't think it was worth it, and to me, Henry is incredibly selfish for pursuing that life for her.The waiting is just endless... And here's where it gets confusing, because Henry believes that the past can't be changed to affect the future, right? So, 42 year old Henry meeting 6 year old Clare in the past leads to 28 year old Henry meeting 20 year old Clare in the present. It's destined because 42 year old Henry's past contains that meeting at 28. Right? But, Henry's theory is kind of crap because the whole thing is a paradox. He went to a past from a future that couldn't have existed UNLESS he changed the past in order to affect the future. And this is another reason why this book felt manipulate-y. I feel like we're not supposed to examine it in this way, and just read it for the love story and the heartbreaking sadness that this time-travel thing causes in the time traveler's wife's life. We're supposed to see this as an epic romance. We're supposed to see the relationship as the central focus, we're supposed to accept this at face value (as everyone accepts Henry's time travel and 20 years worth of him gallivanting around naked in the Newberry Library without losing his job, which is completely plausible, of course) and not give it too much thought, because if we look too closely, we can see there's not much there. Henry is described as something of a player by everyone but Clare. A cheater, a heartbreaker, emotionally unavailable... yet we never see this. Not one time. Ingrid (who we don't see with Henry in a Clareless present) is the bitter, devastated ex, and whatshername Celia? is the one trying to catch Ingrid on the rebound, so of course she's going to play up the Henry-the-Dog thing. But I don't buy it. Pics or it didn't happen, as they say. If you're going to claim someone's a player, you need to back it up - in real life and in fictional time travel stories. Show him time travel back and interrupt his younger self mid-affair. Then I'd believe it. Whoops!Instead, all we see is Henry the Totally Devoted To Clare. He loves her more than love ever loved love and therefore they are DESTINED, and so it shall be. Henry knows what's going to happen, and therefore he doesn't even try. He just sits back and let's the future come to him. Kendrick's going to be his doctor because he is. It happens because it has already happened. So no need to get all rowdy and make an effort or anything. *Yawn*In fact that's another thing. There's absolutely ZERO conflict in this book. None. Henry gets arrested for indecent exposure on a freeway in 1963? Conveniently he disappears before he's booked. Want something? Take it. Something's weird? Accepted. Family troubles? Just introduce your new wife, then all tension is gone. If there's a snag, it's always a momentary one, and it always works out in the end. UGH. Jeez! Anyway! Where was I? Oh yes, characters. Clare. She is... Well. This is going to be unpopular, but Clare is just an older, slightly (very slightly) less annoying version of Bella Swan. She has no life other than Henry. Her friends become his friends (because it's not like he has any of his own. Oh, wait, his old Korean babysitter counts, I guess). Her life is completely engrossed by his and there's no part of it that is Henryless. She's completely devoted to this guy who had to ship in an extra to appear at his own wedding because he's too unreliable to actually be there in present time. Just the kind of life every girl dreams of on their big day! :DOops, close, but not quite!Supposedly Clare's an artist or something...? Yeah. Something like that. I guess. I live with an artist. And the art TAKES OVER EVERYTHING. There's art and art supplies and potential art supplies and scribbles and drawings and markers and paint and art... just... EVERYWHERE. It's not a hobby, it's a part of the Boy's LIFE. This creative need. So when Clare is described as making stuff like 3 times in the book, complete with step by step directions and an accompanying Create-It-Yourself! shopping list for the reader... it rings false with me. I don't see her as being an artist. I see her as being a toy that Henry picks up and plays with when he's around, and who sits on the shelf and waits for him to come back and play with her again when he's not around. And when it's convenient (aka: will reinforce the romance, like when she sketches Henry), Niffenegger sticks her in a studio with some art supplies and calls her an artist. That's not character development, that's just lazy. Oh but wait, you say, what about the bird sculptures? Oh right, those, how could I forget, because they were so massively important to the story that they were mentioned like one time. Henry's job is mentioned a bazillion times, and Clare's work mentions I could count on one hand. Lazy. For real. The book is called The Time Traveler's WIFE, why is there not more about Clare? Why is there not more TO Clare? And, speaking of shopping lists, seriously, I don't need an entire recipe recitation for each and every meal they eat. And the kinds of meals they eat are ridiculous. I don't believe that a 20 year old and her 2 punk-rock rebel anarchist roommates are drinking merlot and eating wild mushroom risotto. I can't even roll my eyes enough at that shit. But that's not even the best. I mean, Niffenegger's descriptions are insanely long anyway (the quality of the light glinting off of this or that, dew on the thinger I don't care about at all, the texture of the whatchamajig, blah blah blah) but at one point Henry is unpacking groceries and EVERY. SINGLE. ITEM. is listed before getting to the point of the list: a shocker item. THERE WERE 32 ITEMS. THIRTY-EFFING-TWO!! I counted. Unlike Clare, I am not fascinated by celery stalks and cans of creamed corn. So I gave approximately 0% of one shit about 31 of the items that were listed before the SHOCKER ITEM. Gah. Thirty-two. Seriously. Another thing that really bugged me were the miscarriages. There were times that they were written in such a way that I wasn't sure if it was a nightmare of Clare's or reality - I'm still not sure, but I think it was supposed to be reality. I admit to skimming quite a bit, so maybe I missed something. Blood-soaked sheets and bed, and a little tiny fetus breathing its last in her hand? What? Maybe Niffenegger isn't familiar with the stages of fetal development, but lungs are pretty much the last things to develop, so that's just... weird. But then finally, FINALLY Clare gets preggers, with her husband who is time travelling from the past. She cheated on her hubby with her hubby while in bed with her hubby, who is sleeping. But hey, that's OK. They are used to being in bed with each other, eh, 15 year old Henry and 15 year & 6 months old Henry? *elbow nudge*Anyway... Toward the end of the book there are quite a few events that feel manipulative in order to cause a certain event. Henry's feet are important to him. This is drilled into the reader time and again. He runs because he needs to run when he time travels and lands somewhere buck-naked, raising all kinds of suspicions. So of course, something happens to his feet. Not just one, which would have had the same effect, likely, but BOTH. For the shock value. And to me, it was just not necessary at all. Because THE EVENT would probably have happened anyway - it happened in an eyeblink. And the repercussions from that event are... well. We're supposed to be crushed. I think this book is doing it wrong. I won't lie and say that I wasn't affected, though... but it wasn't because of the characters themselves. It was because I imagine myself in the position of losing someone I love, and know how heartbroken I'd have been. But then I get angry, because in the goodbye letter he leaves for her, the one in which he tells her to live her life and be happy, he mentions - just as an aside, you know!- that he visits her in the far flung future. And that leaves her waiting for him again... for 50+ years. How horribly selfish do you have to be to do that to someone? Is that a comfort? I don't think so. I think it's exactly the opposite. It's torture to make someone wait in uncertainty for over half their life for one brief momentary visit. Such a waste, and the more I think about this book, the more I find to dislike in it. It's not romantic, it's depraved. Yeah... so. I could go on, like about how the different perspectives were written and how even with the abrupt shift in POV I could never tell who was narrating unless I either checked or got lucky and one was talking directly to the other, because there was no difference in character voice at all, but the longer I do, the more annoyed I get, and I have better books I could be reading.

13,1884663384,01/31/2017,1.0,"A big no thank you to The Time Traveler's Wife. To the legions of fans of this book, I'd like to know what you enjoyed about it. What did I miss? I see that it's won a pile of awards- I feel like I completely missed something and I would like to understand your point of view.I thought I was in for a sweet romance but all I got was a time traveler who cheated at the lottery, beat people up for clothes, and engaged in sexual hijinks with time traveling versions of himself.I was completely creeped out by the fact that Henry is Clare's best friend from the time that she was 6. She was groomed from that young age to be his wife, no matter that it wasn't consummated until later. How awful is that. When she is essentially date raped, she doesn't go to the police, Clare goes to Henry who engages in some vigilante justice. It was horrible what happened to her, but she should have reported it to the authorities.The yuck factor from a bunch of places absolutely ruined the book for me not to mention that fact that Clare never really had a childhood or life at all without Henry in it.

14,18157351,03/19/2008,5.0,"I adore this book. I love it with all my heart. The first few pages were a delight, a surprise, and from then on it was a sweet love affair. I wanted both to have read the book all at once and also to have it all yet unread so I could savor it. I simply didn't want it to end.The story is about two people, the time traveler and his wife. On the surface, they are like any two people who love each other in modern times, except for the fact that he travels through time. You'd think that fact would make this science fiction, but this is more a romance -- actually, more a great love story than anything. A love that transcends time.While the science fiction part of it IS interesting, it really is all about the couple, Henry and Clare. Henry's ability to time travel almost becomes a metaphor. For what? Whatever it is a reader wishes to imagine. But there'd be no story without it, as it's very intricately woven into the romance. It's unlikely they ever would have met and come together without it.Henry and Clare both tell the story in their first person points of view, in the present tense, to indicate the here and now, though the scenes might be all at once the past, the present, and the future. They take turns, not only in telling the story, but in knowing what's to come. So the story unfolds like a flower, with each scene a petal of rosy revelation, where you see both sides -- first the outside, then the inside -- as it blooms and shows yet another petal within, ready to unfurl.The plotting is amazing. Things that happened in one's past, halfway mentioned, become a foreshadowing of what's to come for another, and in the end, things just fall into place; bad or good, you know that whatever just happened was supposed to happen. You can't really worry about the paradoxes, though. You just have to let go of the feeling that something might never have happened were it not for one thing or another. However tangled up the cause and effect become, the whole thing seemed fated and comes full circle.I suspect that this book inspired the TV series Journeyman, which I also love. However, they have made it light years easier for the time traveler in Journeyman. When Henry time travels, he brings nothing with him. He can't. Anything that isn't a part of his body is left behind, so he arrives naked and must steal clothes and shoes. When the man in Journeyman travels, he takes with him whatever he is wearing or holding, so he has his clothes and his cash. When Henry time travels, he is unable to change anything that, for him, has already happened. When the Journeyman time travels, it is expressly so he can go back and change the past, and when he returns to his present, things are not quite what they were when he left.And even though the science fiction part of this book is actually fairly understated, Henry's version of time travel seems much more real to me, more plausible. His life with Clare makes it even more so because we see how it affects the two of them and their relationship with each other and with other people. Only the media seems left out of it, and I think that if Henry's ability was real, it would be very much in the media in one form or another.I really wish I could articulate everything that I love about this book, but I think the best way to share what I'm feeling for the book right now is to recommend it to everyone I know.Hints of Lolita again, but sweeter and more innocent.Finished reading March 30, 2008.",127,0.9984,0.027,0.813,0.161,0.4290085870413739,POSITIVE,0.9995
15,7364769,10/06/2007,2.0,"If I had to define ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" by Audrey Niffenegger in two words they would be: poignant and excessive—two words that also illustrate my mixed feelings about Niffenegger’s first novel.“The Time Traveler’s Wife” is about many things. Obviously time travel is an important feature, but this novel is also about librarians, artists, punk rock, and alcoholics. It’s also about love.Henry meets his wife, Clare, for the first time when he is 28 and Clare is 20. Clare met Henry for the first time when she was six and Henry was 36. Henry is, literally, a time traveler. Henry has a disease: a cellular disorder that leaves him unglued in time, traveling at random to various points in the past and future of his own life and, inexplicably, to Clare’s childhood. Henry cannot hold onto any of his possessions when he time travels—no clothes, no food, no money—a fact that often has a disastrous effect on Henry’s life.Throughout it all, Clare is at Henry’s side faithfully waiting for him to return to her and their life together. Niffenegger alternates viewpoints, narrating the story in both Henry’s and Clare’s voice. Despite giving the characters equal narration time, Clare remains painfully one-dimensional. She is defined by her love for Henry, her artistic career and, unfortunately, little else.Thankfully, Henry is written much more fully. Working as a librarian at the Newberry in his present, Henry also has a complex life “out of time."" He is also well-versed in the culture of drugs and drinking. Really, Henry is a mess in every sense of the word. Despite all of his problems, though, Henry remains redeemable. Throughout the novel he clings to a certain charm, a quality that makes it plausible to believe that Clare really did love him long before Henry first met her.The novel jumps from past to present and back again as Niffenegger aptly looks at how Henry’s past intersects with his present and his future, and his evolving relationship with Clare. These examinations are a particular strength of the novel. Niffenegger manages to discuss events multiple times without being redundant. At the same time she creates a complex storyline without making it impossible to follow.Unfortunately, she does also falter. Most of the novel’s shortcomings stem from some kind of excess. First and foremost, it’s too long. (The hardcover edition runs 600 pages.) Particularly in the second half of the novel, it feels like Niffenegger takes on too much. There are too many characters to remember, too many events only tangentially relevant to the core plot. All things considered, the novel could easily have been at least a hundred pages shorter.For this reason, the premise of the plot has some fundamental flaws—points that make no sense in relation to the rest of the narrative. On the whole, these blips are annoying but not damning (especially given the fact that the novel is marketed as general fiction as opposed to science fiction).“The Time Traveler’s Wife” also veers dangerously close to melodrama, raining biblically disastrous situations on both Henry and Clare. Given the ending of the novel, one would think that merely being a time traveler would be enough bad luck to last both of their lifetimes. Aside from being plain old mean, this focus on events makes it difficult to develop the characters. Many interesting people walk in and out of Henry’s life, but few of them are adequately utilized in the book.The scope of the narrative is vast and strongly cinematic, which leads me to two conclusions: One is that this story might have been better had someone else written it. The other is that the upcoming film adaptation will be better than the novel. Given the fascinating story and characters here, hopefully that will be the case.You can find this review and more on my blog Miss Print",123,0.9901,0.078,0.791,0.131,0.4719175170068026,POSITIVE,0.9993

20,3077024,07/14/2007,4.0,"Rating this was really hard, because I really liked it (really, really liked it) but I have such qualms with the ending, which could very possibly be a testament to Niffenegger's writing, I'm not sure. Anyway.There were several things I wanted to talk about while I was reading it, more or less having to do with the notion of time-travel in the book. Obviously, there's always the immediate connection between Henry DeTamble and Billy Pilgrim, both of which are unstuck in time, Henry because of a bizarre disorder and Billy because of an existential break-down possibly hightened by Post Traumatic Shock Syndrome (I believe that's what it's ""technically"" called, but don't quote me) (this is also a literary theory I find to be too easy of an excuse). But also I found parallels between TTW and Octavia Butler's ""Kindred,"" the story of a black woman pulled back through time by one of her ancestors, a white slaveholder, to the period before the Civil War. The interesting thing I found about both of these are the link between Dana and Rufus (in ""Kindred"") that defies time and space, and an almost identical link between Henry and young Clare as an agenda to look at the concept of ""soul mates."" This then creates an ontological question concerning the nature of free-will and destiny, as Niffenegger herself states numerous times that Henry believes in free-will to a point, in that he's free to do whatever or so he believes, but because he is so immeshed in time what happens between him and Clare is more destiny: they are free to do what they will, but they'll always end up where they are meant to be type thing.Another aspect that struck me was the idea of time being a biological construct, which was like ""holy shit rock on!"" Because time itself is little more than our perception of change and cause-and-effect, and the physical concept of space-time is nonlinear, that all time happens right now and it will always happen at any given moment, not so much circular as it is ever-present. But the notion that time itself can be a flux in our biological make-up was STUNNING. If I were a little more awake, maybe I could expound a little more about why that interested me so much.(But to that effect, it did bother me a little that Niffenegger told her story more or less linearally, despite the constant jumping back and forth that Henry undergoes. I almost wish the whole thing was like that, with very little linear telling [which of course would be problematic with Clare's perception of events; hmmm . . .:]).IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THE BOOK AND YOU PLAN ON READING IT, PLEASE STOP READING THIS REVIEW HERE! I DON'T WANT TO RUIN THE ENDING FOR YOU!This was one of the saddest books I've ever read, aside from ""Where the Red Fern Grows,"" but what I didn't like was that there was no real time to devote to being sad and crying over Henry's fate/destiny/end because the story kept going, no moment to allow the reader a bit of catharsis. And this probably wouldn't have been so bad if Henry hadn't lost his feet and could do nothing else but wait for his final moment. I felt that Henry was such a dynamic character and that he would have been one of those types of people who burn out instead of fade away, if he were a real person, but in the narrative he's not given that chance.

And the story kept going after! Which, granted, it is actually more of Clare's story (she is, of course, the time-traveler's wife and gets the first and final words of the story), and this does illuminate Henry's ever-present being in time and space.

21,2890366707,01/11/2021,2.0,"(Regular Review) This is one of those very few books that people either really seem to love or seem to hate. I wistfully belong to the latter half.1) The character development of Henry and Claire were deplorable, especially after they became adults.2) The narration and the plot were too complicated to follow, mainly due to switching to multiple periods via time travel.  After finishing this novel, I was exhausted like a flight attendant who had continuous work for 36 hours on different flights to different time zones without rest.3) What was the real purpose of time travel in this book? The author fails to connect it with the reader4) Was Henry in true love with Claire? It seemed more like a jealous, abusive type of relationship. The way he spoiled the childhood of Claire by time traveling to her childhood naked and marking her like an animal, telling her that he will be her future husband was ridiculous. He totally scarred Claire's youth, and she was not able to explore her life and relationships freely after that. We can see Ayn Rand's objectivism shades in how Audrey Niffenegger created Henry's character.

5) The way infertility and miscarriage are mentioned in this book is atrocious.6) The way the author tried to create a didactic novel about true love by depicting sex with almost every tiny detail was ludicrous.7) The way the protagonist tried to revisit his mother's death again and again using time travel to view it from multiple angles is hard to believe. If we have the power of time travel, we will go back to see the happy moments with a person instead of going back to revisit their accidental death multiple times. It was absurd, creepy, and sadistic to the core. It was just like Henry was celebrating disasters. Just look at how the author chronicles Henry revisiting his mother's death. “My mother dying. I time travel to it, over and over. If you could be there and if you could hover over the scene of the accident, and you could see every detail about it. If you had time to look at everything, you would see me behind the cars, behind the bushes, on the bridge, on the tree. I have seen it from every angle.""   We can see glimpses of the author's brilliance in some areas of this book, and I truly loved her writing style in some parts of it. I had huge expectations when I picked up this book for reading.

22,258117683,01/07/2012,3.0,"3 stars to Audrey Niffenegger's novel, The Time Traveler's Wife, published in 2003 and later made into a movie. This one is a hard book for me to rate. There was so many great things in it, but there was also a lot that made me step away and think about how it all happened...

Overview

A young couple are constantly ravaged by the husband's ability to move between time periods, but rarely in a controlled way. They are stuck in a haphazard relationship, never knowing when he may just disappear for months at a time. As a result, readers put the pieces of their love story together chapter by chapter... knowing the conclusion to some things before you find out how it happened. 

What I Liked

1. The entire concept of moving around throughout someone's life, not knowing what time period it is until a few things happen. This created a lot of suspense and drama, which for the most part worked significantly well; however, on a few occasions, it pushed me over the limit of confusion.2. It's a heart-breaking tale of what happens to a young couple who very much want to be together, in love and share a lifetime of orderly memories. Note, I said, orderly memories.3. The images created are quite wonderful. With words being the tool to convey the emotion of something none of us have ever been through, it's especially important to have strong visuals. This was successful on most occasions. And when it wasn't, I didn't dislike it; just wasn't anything special.4. It was unique... hardly ever, if ever, done before, in such a way or manner. The author should be praised for it.

What I Didn't Like

1. The concept was too complicated. I kept stopping to think if the author built the scene correctly. I naturally doubted it, assumed there was a mistake in the time sequence. Maybe that says more about me being a Doubter than it does about the book... OK, maybe I should stop here on this item.2. Some of the passages were included purely for humor, and the effects on other people of his time travel were a bit too much. I'm good with someone getting beat up, or some silly naked embarrassment... but it felt too contrived and one-sided.3. I wasn't happy with the ending... and that's all I say.

Now What

You really should read it and then watch the movie. It's a different way of handling the story, so that's why I suggest both. Ultimately, it's the kind of book where you think you love it, but then things start falling apart in your mind about the gaps and the confusion... and you feel like you had part of a story, not the whole thing. But this is one you need to check out for yourself. Just go in knowing it's not a brilliant and perfect piece of literature. Still a good story, and possibly a bit higher than a 3 on my scale, but I'm sticking with the rating.

For all the book's faults (in particular a draggy middle), I haven't read a book yet with such chemistry between the two main characters.

24,12117756,01/09/2008,2.0,"There’s a reason I hate Oprah’s Book Club, and the reason is that I think she does a disservice to the millions of American women who adore her by recommending terrible books. Oprah’s problem is that rather than directing her legions of fans to classic books (or ones destined to become classics) with complex plots and fine writing, she directs them instead to crap like The Notebook. The Notebook and The Time Traveler’s Wife belong to the same genre – you’ve heard the term “chick flick”? These two books are chick books, books whose romantic plots and themes are written to appeal to women, a device in books and film that do a disservice to the women’s rights movement. Niffenegger’s book revolves around a man who has a genetic disorder that randomly makes him travel backwards and forwards in time. He pops into and out of the life of a woman who ends up being his wife. The book revolves around the theme that love transcends time, and describes how the couple deals with the man’s time-traveling problem. This book gets some points for an original concept, but unfortunately, it is atrociously written. First, it’s way too long, almost 550 pages. Much of the length of the book is due to the author’s inclusion of every minute detail she can think of, as if an overabundance of detail makes the scene somehow more realistic. Secondly, there are tons of rants in the book, which is really just the author using her characters to voice her own tastes (for example, a whole scene devoted to punk music and the punk scene as if the author were reliving her youth, which adds nothing to the characterizations). Thirdly, the book is filled with tiresome cliché love imageries. For example, the time traveler wishing to himself that he were home and finding himself in bed with his wife and stating something inane like “I’m with Clare, so I am home. I am home.” So awful, the author should be jailed. The only reason I don’t have this book ranked lower is that the end of the book deals with issues of death and separation and loss that genuinely touched me, but that’s more me being sentimental than the book’s ability to convey strong emotion. Read it if you like chick flicks.",78,0.1421,0.089,0.818,0.093,0.5520202020202021,NEGATIVE,1.0

There was plenty to like in Audrey Niffenegger's The Time Traveler's Wife beginning with the concept of Henry slipping in and out of time to meet his wife (or wife to be, Clare) at seemingly random points in her life. The behaviors he's learned because of his involuntary time traveling add a certain poignancy to them even having a sustainable relationship. That and the details of Henry interactions with Clare's family gives their unlikely relationship a certain realism. While it did remind me of Doctor Who's relationship with River Song because this time traveling wasn't done in 'correct' order, there was appeal in how it unfolded.

27,7691043,10/13/2007,5.0,"I loved this book. It's not perfect, but it made me feel and think and want. It's one of those stories that pulls you into the characters' lives and leaves you wanting more, mulling over the scenes and premise for days after you've reluctantly turned the last page. Rarely is such an original idea portrayed with such vivid language so you believe the time travel possibility and the characters are almost people you know. It's about a guy who involuntarily travels time. He can never predict where or when he will jump the time/space continuum, but when he does, he is drawn toward significant events and people in his life. The science fiction is a medium for a love story, not a cheesy or unrealistic (besides time travel which she makes believable) one, but a deep enduring love in for the long haul of life and hardship, told from both his and her perspective, and how time travel affects their lives and relationship. It starts when Henry meets Claire for the first time and she is ecstatic to finally have found the love of her life in the present. Henry must get to know this stranger introduced to him as his future wife and Claire has to nurture him into the man she loves. As you relive scenes from Claire's past and Henry's future you see how they fall in love, at different times with someone already madly in love with them, and conquer the challenge of his disorder. Because their relationship is non-chronological, you discover events out of order--as do they--making the story interesting and leaving you with the same sense of longing the characters feel. I thought the odd age difference, Henry playing father figure to the girl who will be his wife, was handled well instead of pedophileish, as was the delve into both Henry's and Claire's minds and emotions (although I wish their voices differed more) to get a better grasp of how this condition would affect normal life. I really cared about these characters. Henry trying to protect Claire and Claire left wanting. In one scene she is racing to meet him after a prolonged absence and he fades before she can reach him. I felt for her, what she had to sacrifice to revolve and dedicate her life to him. Some of the minor characters strange and distracting, but overall the story is powerful and vivid. One is left to question the origin of fate and ethics. Does the past affect the future or the future the past? Or is it all predestined? Claire knows what dates Henry will visit because he gives her the dates he memorized from her diary and told her to write down so he could later memorize them. Where did the knowledge originate? How would you explain and hide abnormalities? What would you consider ethical in playing with time? I didn't have a problem with the thievery (he transfers nude) but I did with using money knowledge from the future. There is a lot left to contemplate.Be forewarned, there's a lot of loving in the story, and not just the act, but the dirty reference to the deed as well. I think Niffenegger must have wanted to steer clear of being too cheesy so she regrettably went too far the other direction. Many of the sex scenes are graphically portrayed, but there is one scene, only hinted at, the idea of which almost made me close the book. Gratefully the concept didn't linger, but unfortunately the language did. Gratuitous and unnecessary for the story, oh but what a story.Update: loved the book-to-movie screen adaption. They really captured the longing, the sense of being guided (trapped even) by fate. Well played too.",70,0.9981,0.054,0.778,0.168,0.4813368055555554,POSITIVE,0.9999
28,6902066,09/27/2007,5.0,"Very few books have ever made me cry. Off the top of my head, only two really stand out: Charlotte's Web and Thunderwith. I am now adding The Time Traveler's Wife to the list, and to the list of books I can't get out of my head for days after. This is a highly ambitious debut novel. That doesn't mean it doesn't work. I had my doubts, I truly did. And I can never read a book without also noticing typos, editing errors etc., but although they're distracting they can't ruin a good book. The time traveler is Henry DeTamble, only child of two musicians, whose mum died in a car crash when he was 5 (he was saved only because, due to stress, he time travelled outside the car - which reminded me a lot of the tv show Charmed (one of my secret, now not-so-secret, indulgences), in which Paige ""orbed"" out of the car crash which kills both her parents - could Niffenegger be a fan also?!?). His time traveling is genetic, like an imperfection or flaw in his genetic code. He can't control it, and it causes more than a few problems in his life. When he travels, he does so suddenly, and turns up in the past or the future, completely naked, with no idea of where or when he is. But he's not completely vulnerable - he taught himself (in one of those mind-bending scenes that only make you ask, Yes, but how did he teach himself?) how to pick locks, pick pockets, steal, fight, run, anything necessary to survive until, equally suddenly, he pops back into the present, be it a few minutes or several days since he disappeared. This creates not just problems in his social and love life, but also in his job - he's a librarian and his colleagues think he has some kind of kinky thing for running around naked in the stacks. When he's 28, he meets Clare Abshire for the first time. Only, she's known him since she was six. How? He starts time travelling to her past after he's met her in ""real time"". It's a disorientating experience for him, to be confronted with this beautiful, red-haired, 20 year old art student who knows a great deal about him - if not his life, certainly his personality - and, though he doesn't know it yet, even lost her virginity to. It's a bit disorientating for us, too, but it's like riding a bike: after a while, you get the hang of it. This is a love story, and a tragic one at that. Because I like to be optimistic, I began reading this in the expectation of a happy ending. I didn't get it, but that's not really what made me cry. I cried because I had invested so much of my own emotions in the characters, I had come to care for them, to feel for them and hope for them, that the ending shattered me. I cried for Henry, I cried for Clare, I cried for their passion so early ended and the loneliness with which Clare must now live with, despite the child they managed, after 6 miscarriages, to have. >Set in Chicago over several decades, up to 2008, Niffenegger is obviously in love with her city. Despite that, I didn't get a strong feeling of Chicago, nor a great mental image of it. Perhaps because Henry is all over the place, and Clare's parents live in a different state, or perhaps because the author fails to really get across the true elements of the city, which I have never been to. I've read several books lately that kept going long after they should have ended. The Lovely Bones, for one example. Not so here. It's a long book, at 518 pages that just flew by, but in those pages you really get to know Clare and Henry and the characters, friends and family and doctors all, around them. The time travel element is what makes this an ambitious book. Keeping track of their lives, of the insights and hints and clues divulged in one sequence, with when it happens in ""real time"". At first, I had a sharp eye, looking for slip-ups. By the end, I had to admit I couldn't find any. Although some things are never returned to, like Henry divulging his secret to Gomez, a lawyer in love with Clare but married to her best friend, because he will help him out a lot in the future (the Henry doing the divulging is from the future, and so knew Gomez a lot better than the 28-year-old Henry Gomez had met just the night before) - but this is never returned to, there is no more clue as to what kind of legal trouble Henry gets into, no trials, no arrests (Henry is often arrested for things like indecent exposure, but always ""disappears"" before they can fingerprint him and find out who he is). Perhaps it did get a bit melodrammatic toward the end. My perception is clouded, now. I don't want to give too much away, so suffice it to say that certain events leading up to the end were so raw and tragic, I lost myself to the book completely, and went with the flow, no longer trying to find slip-ups or inconsistencies or judging the writing style. Speaking of which (sorry about this ""review"", it's all over the place), it's written in present tense, which works well since the time frame is, like this review, all over the place. One line, or description rather, that I particularly loved, was when Henry from the future and Alba, his daughter, from the future, meet and spend time together in 1979 at the beach. ""Tell me a story,"" says Alba, leaning against me like cold cooked pasta. (p.512) ""like cold cooked pasta"" - ooh I can feel it! That clammy feeling, a perfect description for after you've been swimming. In general, though, Niffenegger's style is not ""high brow"" literary. I found it easy to read, with a good flow, excellent pace and those philosophical, thoughtful insights and asides you get from a layered writer. She made an effort to get the ""voices"" right for young Clare and young Henry, though Clare's was more convincing than 5-year-old Henry's. Really, here, I'm just trying to get all my thoughts down. If they appear a mess, and out of order etc., then that means my brain will be less so, and that works for me. Essentially, having been lucky enough to find ""the love of my life"", the idea of losing him rips my guts apart. And since I actually want to invest in fictional characters, whether they be in books or in movies etc., I felt their pain, as well as their love and happiness and all the feelings in between. There's a strong story here, told by characters who may not be out of the ordinary in any other way, but who feel and, in feeling, live.",66,0.997,0.115,0.73,0.154,0.4764152676027677,NEGATIVE,0.9954

30,1844054,06/11/2007,5.0,"Before Audry Niffenegger wrote The Time Traveler's Wife, she was a art teacher at a Chicago university. Thankfully, Niffenegger believes that art should imitate life, so we get a rip-roaring tour of her life passions: punk music, the Chicago art scene, the Newbery Library, and Chicago itself. These are the core elements that add ambiance to the love story of Henry Detamble - librarian and reluctant time traveler - and his wife, artist Claire Ashbury. Henry has crono-displacement disorder and in times of stress, he ""time jumps"" to other periods of his life, leaving Claire alone in sequential time. I stayed up until almost four AM, engrossed in Time Traveler's Wife. I cheated by reading the last page first when I was halfway through it and put it aside for six months. TTW is the story of the (gorgeous) Henry DeTamble, sexy librarian and accidental time traveler, and his circular relationship with Claire, who is often left behind when Henry accidentally goes hurtling through time, usually against his will. The most unique part about it - and the most intelligent - is Niffenegger could have done the cliche plot - time machine, other centuries, etc - but chose not to, instead keeping the time travel in the modern day. No Jack Finney plots for her characters. Henry's unique path almost entirely focuses around dramatic incidents in his life - his mother's death,his father's depression, or his meeting Clare. The latter is the most unique part about this story - Henry first meets Clare when she is 6 and he is in his 20s, thanks to the time traveling. Ironically, when he accidentally visits her as a child, he is leaving the adult Claire, bereft and confused, in the ""present."" The book is told through monologues which I usually find pretty annoying but this was extraordinary.The kick? In Niffennegger's world, time travel is a disease, an uncontrollable ailment which holds the victim in it's grip, manifesting only under extreme mental stress. As a result, Henry fights to stay ""present"" at his own wedding, only to loose and have an older ""Henry"" (age 43) pop into the ceremony to say the vows. What would be a groom's normal nerves set off the chrono-displacement gene (CDG). Also, our Henry time travels in the buff, which makes it pretty important to do things like pick locks, steal clothes, etc. You know - all the stuff they should teach in Boy Scouts.And? The sheer real world *intelligence* of Henry and Clare - the references to AS Byatt, Violent Femmes, Ulysses, french poetry, J.B. Priestly, Rilke, Dickinson, etc. Thanks to Henry's librarian status, we get tons of delicious references to gorgeous poems, lit figures, etc. It's a rarity in fiction to have a librarian character who is a man, a time traveler, reader and lover, while still leaping off the page as the world's first well-read, punk librarian.Henry and Clare never dip to anything less than human, brilliant, vital, and remarkably alive. Guess who cried like moron through the past 42 pages? Moi. I haven't cried at a book since the end of Fried Green Tomatoes or maybe Harry 3. I made it through Jane Eyre, Tree Grows in Brooklyn, The Hours, Jude the Obscure, Crimson Petal and White, and tons of other gut-wrenching books without a tear. I'm a little embarrassed by how much I adored this novel. Whew. ..And The Beatles, Fleetwood Mac, and the Violent Femmes make appearances. Bless Niffennegger's visionary, music-adoring little self.Apparently Gus Van Sant is directing the movie. Personally, I think Michel Gondry (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) would have been the perfect director. Rachel McAdams (The Notebook, Wedding Crashers) will be Claire, while Eric Bana (The Hulk) will be Henry.Dippy with love for this book.

Admittedly, I don’t read much romance at all, but every now and again I will come across a book, or even a romantic storyline in a non-romance genre, that will just reach into my chest cavity and tug on those heartstrings. Clare and Henry’s love story is one of those situations. The fact that Henry travels through time and yet nearly always seems to find Clare… *tears up* My favourite aspect of their relationship is that they’re basically really normal people (apart from the whole time-traveling thing, of course) – they have their arguments and disagreements, but at the end of it all, they’re just a couple who are deeply in love.I love how *double checks spelling* Niffenegger tells this story – she flips back and forth between Clare and Henry’s perspective. At the beginning, she also moves back and forth in time, from Clare and Henry’s first meetings when Clare is young, to present day. Initially the “rules” of the time travelling can be a little confusing, but once you get a grasp on it, it flows pretty seamlessly. I really like how Niffenegger portrays their relationship, she covers quite a lot of the minutiae of their everyday lives, seemingly “boring” events, but it weirdly makes you feel like you’re also a part of their relationship and I found myself more attached to them for those reasons. I finished the book a few days ago now and I STILL miss them.I don’t have many complaints for this one, although the amount of sex can become quite repetitive and makes me want to roll my eyes.

It started off with a strong quality in the writing, which was at first a story about two people coming together. After that, I feared about misunderstanding what the story was about. But the beginning was simply a purely intimate exchange between two people. I thought that by being fated to be stuck together, Clare and Henry lost some free will. Like their high point was consuming an arranged marriage like it occurs mostly in the third world. But maybe they never compromised at all. Maybe, compromise is a portmanteau of ""comme promis"". There is some arbitrary French and even more German peppered through the story. Also bands and music artists' names. References to art. I can imagine that the writer is making a comparison between free will and destiny, and life and art. You see, I never bother about guessing the writer's intent in most books. And in my current avatar as an Amazon customer, I've read primarily mysteries. But here the subject is so private that I'm anxious. But that in itself is impossible and silly. It's also nice to ruminate about the titular character. Clare is the time traveler's wife. The title could not have been the time traveler's child, for example. I think the last chapter decides the earnestness of the whole book, and is the latter's spine. I wish I had read this beautiful story earlier. My God, how could they make a mess of adapting the book for the big screen? The movie is absolutely dreadful. The author remained inspired throughout, and the book never loses steam. I have read about Henry and known him in a way not possible in other mediums. I would, however, not like to meet him. Like Gomez said, he's not right. It's safe to conclude that the meeting with Clare tempers Henry's devilish side. This is not a science fiction story. It's not perfect. If the book WAS perfect, I'd say 'read it and weep'.

It was Audrey Niffenegger's first novel, and is a surprisingly accomplished feat, involving a complicated time structure and alternating first-person perspectives. The two main characters, Henry and Clare, are introduced by way of a Prologue. The couple meet in a library in Chicago, but while Clare clearly knows Henry very well, and has done for a long time, Henry does not seem to know who she is. He is vaguely dazzled by this ""luminous creature"", who insists that she has known him since she was six years old ... at which time he was 43. Since Clare is now 20, and Henry is 28, this seems a confusing scenario for the reader. We gradually come to understand that this is because Henry has been travelling from his future to her past, and that in her past they had fallen in love. We understand that Henry hasn't actually yet met Clare in his own present. Henry, therefore is the time traveller, and Clare is his eponymous wife. This sets a pattern for the rest of the story, which largely follows Clare's life but is interspersed with some of Henry's time-travelling adventures. Audrey Niffenegger explains that Henry has been born with a genetic dysfunction, which she terms, ""chrono-displacement"".The Time Traveller's Wife is divided into three parts. The first Book: ""The Man Out Of Time"", broadly covers Clare's growing understanding of the unique relationship she is to have with Henry. Clare has carefully kept a diary, which details all the future dates for Henry's visits, and she shows him this on almost their first meeting. The obvious result is that Henry feels rather overwhelmed and confused, and does not know what to make of it all, but also finds himself very attracted to Clare, her obvious passion and fervent loyalty. It also squares with his own experience and what he knows about himself.Henry can remember the first time he time travelled, on his fifth birthday. He had enjoyed his first visit to a Museum of Natural History in Chicago so much, that later on he found that he had suddenly been pulled back there in time to the museum. The novel breaks the accepted rules of most time travel books at this point, (view spoiler)[by having young Henry meet an older, 24-year-old version of himself. The older Henry explains that he is a time traveller, but that it is a great secret. All through Henry's teenage years, the older Henry teaches him various tricks which he will need to know to survive, such as stealing, breaking and entering, and running from the police. (hide spoiler)]A major shift in the narrative comes, as we next read a description of the event Clare has already referred to. We jump to the first time she as a 6-year-old met the 43-year-old Henry in a meadow, near her family's house on Lake Michigan. Henry had called out to Clare from behind a bush, where he was trying to conceal his naked self. Oddly, this apparently rather dubious situation comes across in the story as being rather sweet, with a very self-possessed young Clare, merely handing Henry her picnic blanket so he can cover himself up. The book follows her childhood and teenage years; her longing for a physical relationship with the 43-year-old Henry, since she knows that she will be with him in her future. We see her growing recognition that her peers think her strange, wondering why she is not interested in boys of her own age. (view spoiler)[A particularly poignant part of this first section is set at Christmas time. Clare has hidden Henry in the reading room of her parents' house. She knows that Henry hates Christmas, because he had told her that was when his mother died. On the morning of Christmas Eve, when Henry was six years old, both he and his mother had been involved in a car accident on their way to pick up his father. Henry managed to survive only because he had time travelled. Ever since that occasion he had been overcome with guilt for not being able to save his mother's life, travelling to the scene of her death over and over again, but helpless to do anything except watch the tragedy unfold. Henry thinks he should have died then too. (hide spoiler)]However, the book has many comedic moments, since Henry can never take anything with him into the next world, not even his clothes. Usually he can name the date of his next trip, and Clare becomes used to arriving with clothes for him, but as the novel progresses there are more of the spontaneous shifts, where at any moment Henry finds himself sucked out of the present and thrown naked into another time and place.(view spoiler)[One example is when Clare and Henry get married. With all their family and friends in attendance, Henry is whisked away without warning, just before the ceremony. But through a coincidence beloved of novelists, an older Henry shoots through the years to take his place. Oddly only the most observant of guests wonders about his suddenly grizzled appearance. (hide spoiler)]The second Book: ""A Drop Of Blood in a Bowl of Milk"" begins with Henry and Clare's married life, which is marked by Henry's frequent absences and Clare's inevitable worries about him. (view spoiler)[She has begun to feel trapped and frustrated in their small apartment. Of course with the premise of the novel, Henry is able to buy a winning lottery ticket, which he duly does, they move into a larger place where Clare has a studio and can pursue her Art ventures, and all is hunky dory again. (hide spoiler)]Audrey Niffenegger carefully explores the emotions of the couple, and it is interesting to the reader to observe the dynamics of their characters and relationship. The time travel element serves to highlight and sometimes resolve any cracks in the relationship. There is a point in the novel, for instance, where Clare is in her thirties, and Henry is 41. Their relationship is rather jaded, as Clare narrates,""Henry's been gone for almost 24 hours now, and as usual I'm torn between thinking obsessively about when and where he might be and being pissed at him for not being here... I hear Henry whistling as he comes up the path through the garden, into the studio. He stomps the snow off his boots and shrugs off his coat. He's looking marvellous, really happy. My heart is racing and I take a wild guess: 'May 24, 1989?' 'Yes, oh yes,' Henry scoops me up, and swings me around. Now I'm laughing; we're both laughing.""The reason for this,(view spoiler)[ as their present selves both know, is that Henry has been swept back to the date when he and Clare first made love, when Clare was just 18, before once again being pulled back into his present. And the recognition of this (hide spoiler)] mends the breach they are both feeling, and also serves to demonstrate to the reader a shift or dichotomy within any relationship, new or established, where one is feeling and experiencing different emotions from the other, at any one time.This dichotomy then is the crux of the novel. One person's story is always going to be slightly different from another's, even when they are experiencing the same relationship.The novel does have limitations. Its focus is really very narrow, even though the complexity of the time travel element does mean that the reader tends to give up on carefully following the chronology - the dates heading each chapter - and just go with the flow. But these two characters seem to be almost fanatically trying to have the conventional American dream of happy, ""normal"", domesticity, and in the end this begins to pall a little, to feel a little tired.There is even an attempt in this middle section to give the fantasy element more validity, with the introduction of a new character, a Dr. Kendrick. With his assistance, Henry's involuntary time travel will later become known as ""Chrono-Impairment"". Sadly this plot development leads nowhere. (view spoiler)[The doctor says he won't be able to cure him, because this newly recognised disorder is too complex to work out and treat during Henry's lifetime. The condition does appear to be hereditary, which explains Clare's repeated miscarriages. The unborn babies seem to time travel, which means that Clare's body aborts them. There is a way around this however, again using the premise of time travel, and eventually Henry meets the child, Alba, whom they will have together in the future. He discovers that she has more control over her travels than he does, but also learns from her the imminent date of his death.  (hide spoiler)]There is also a mysterious shooting accident in this part, plus a gruesome operation making Henry's ability to time travel very dangerous. Neither of these episodes I found terribly convincing. The accident seemed to be put in purely for the mystery element - to make the reader wonder at the reason for all the blood, to wonder if it was fatal - during a couple of time travel episodes. The unconnected medical operation merely seemed rather ludicrous.The third Book: ""A Treatise on Longing"" is possibly the least satisfactory part of the novel. (view spoiler)[It describes Clare's life after Henry's death. Although a letter from Henry has urged Clare to move on with her life, she also learns from it that he had once travelled to her future, where he had seen her as an old woman. This makes Clare decide to wait for him. For many years Alba sees Henry on his visits, but he never visits Clare again, until she is 82 years old. (hide spoiler)] Although with this final section the ending is inevitable, and meant to be poignant, it comes across as rather sentimental and maudlin. Throughout the novel the reader knows that Henry and Clare's lives are already mapped out, and the time of their deaths already written. This impinges on the fantasy element rather too much. In fact it smacks a little of a spiritual religiosity - and one without free will. However, this is a very ambitious project for a first novel, and for much of the novel it translates onto the page with skill, an authentic believability, and a fair amount of charm. If there had been no time travel element, this would be a romantic novel, perhaps with a psychological focus, or a simple family saga. The domestic details here are more enjoyable because they add the necessary realism to the fantasy. Even though the relationship element is predominant, the fascination with the time travel element tends to enhance what might otherwise be a mundane if romantic story. Some of it works, some does not; some is rather mawkish. It is very possible that Audrey Niffenegger's best novel is yet to come. She has since written another novel, ""Her Fearful Symmetry"" and a balletic fable, for the Royal Opera House Ballet in London, in addition to her previous graphic novels. She is professor of creative writing at Columbia College, Chicago. It will be interesting to read the novel she is currently working on, ""The Chinchilla Girl in Exile"", and to see whether this novelist has grown in stature.“I won't ever leave you, even though you're always leaving me.”“I wanted someone to love who would stay: stay and be there, always.”“Maybe I'm dreaming you. Maybe you're dreaming me; maybe we only exist in each other's dreams and every morning when we wake up we forget all about each other.”",53,0.9973,0.072,0.819,0.109,0.4566723499963723,POSITIVE,0.9988

Ten years later, I spotted it peering out of my bookshelf, and I thought it deserved a second chance. It looks as if my Mum will finally be receiving her book back. (She loves it) This book was pretty average. I realise many, many people love this, and from reading some reviews, it is up there on their ""favourites"" shelf. Unfortunately though, it fell flat for me, in many ways, and I realised some time ago, that just because a novel is ""well read"" doesn't mean it is actually worth the time to read it. The idea of ones Husband partaking in involuntary time travel is actually an intriguing premise, and some parts, especially the beginning, kept my attention adequately, but as the story developed, the irritation and boredom set in. The plot was odd. I appreciate what the author was attempting to do, and in some parts, it worked, but all the jumping back and forth became tedious, and I felt emotionally detached from the characters. Henry came across as a man that you wouldn't exactly see as a ""catch."" He was a womanizer for one, and we don't really learn anything significant about him, and how he changed, except that he somehow, travels through time. Henry and Clare spend a tremendous amount of time eating ridiculously posh food, making and drinking coffee, sleeping, and fucking. It doesn't get much better than this. There are a few questions left unanswered, such as, why is Henry so attached to Gomez? I mean, we get bits of their relationship throughout the book, but at the end of it, how could Henry still be best friends with the person that loves, and sleeps with Clare twice over? Strange. I wasn't expecting to love this, as I usually find myself in the minority, but this book was just depressing, it didn't uplift the soul, the time-travel and romance didn't blend together, and, it makes me wonder why Niffenegger wrote this in the first place.",53,0.9688,0.071,0.804,0.124,0.4640873015873016,NEGATIVE,1.0

First of all, it's way too long. The plot is not so action-packed that it merits 600 pages and hour upon hour of my time. Why you ask? Because nothing happens! There were about 400 pages where Henry just floats back and forth through time, Clare is annoying, and no plot advancement occurs. I mourn the loss of all those trees.The second major problem I have with this book is how little you feel for the characters. I felt no sense of dread, or pain, or happiness for them, ever. Considering the author had pleeeeenty of time to endear Henry and Clare to the reader, I never once found myself affected by their strange fates. I think part of this is because she keeps them emotionally guarded even though we are in their heads the whole book and also because it's hard to imagine people like them existing in real life, much less dating and marrying. I mean, what is a rich little prim and proper girl like Clare doing living and philandering with communists? I know she's an artist, but come on. Okay one last gripe: I am so irked at how the author inserted a snippet of The Odyssey at the end of the book. She can't possibly think her book should be considered a classic like that--and even if it's only meant to compare the two stories, I hate the deliberateness and pompousness of such an inclusion!It's a shame this book wasn't executed better because the idea behind it--how time affects relationships, how relationships exist at different phases in our lives, and how timing plays into relationships--is brilliant.

38,32454490,09/09/2008,1.0,"I don’t actually hate this book or maybe I do; I can’t make up my mind. There were plenty of things in this book for me to hate about it, that’s for sure. I hated the consistent cussing—-every cuss word in the dictionary from mildly bad to absolutely unnecessary is repeated too often. I hated some of Clare’s choices. I hated some of Henry’s choices. I hated the miscarriage chapters—-ugh too close for comfort. “Save me” is the best way I can express my feeling about the middle of the book. I hated how the author created a wonderful idea and concept-—time traveling, seeing your spouse in the past, present, future—-but then executing that wonderful idea so poorly. Time traveling could answer one of life’s more frustrating questions: “Would I have done things differently if I had known?” Unfortunately the author didn’t dwell on the concept. The author also disappointed me with her display of Henry’s character. Henry is “good” (meaning better than he was in the middle of the book but I wouldn’t want to be married to him) at the beginning and ending of the book, but awful in the middle; because of what? What happens to Henry that changes him later in life to be a better person? The author never really expounds—-you kind of guess it’s from life’s challenges and Clare’s influence, but you don’t really know because the author doesn’t talk about Henry’s moral development and change. The only reason you even know something changes in Henry is a little from Clare’s dialog and from the fact that he’s cussing up a storm in the middle of the book but not cussing as much in the beginning and end. Boy, I thought Twilight was frustrating; The Time Traveler’s Wife drove me crazy. I wish the author would have displayed Henry’s growth differently and more firmly. Another character that drove me crazy was Gomez. First, I pictured him dark haired until like mid-way through the book where Clare describes him with blonde hair, what? I know the Gomez name was a nickname from his ridiculously long last name not because it's his ethnic first name, but still. Anyway it is totally my own fault for picturing him dark haired and darker toned, but it still bugged me to have to recreate a picture of Gomez in my mind—-some tall, fair-skinned, blonde guy. Anyway, why I brought Gomez up wasn’t about his hair color, but his moral character. He’s a jerk not a friend, but Henry and Clare seem to think he’s so great to them. Why? Even Gomez's own wife, Charisse, kind of knows he’s a creep, but doesn’t expound on this or discuss it with her best girlfriend, Clare. Oh yeah, that's right, Charisse decides it is best to discuss Gomez's lack of moral character with Henry. What? Why isn't Henry freaking out about his best friend lusting after his wife? And why does Henry think this is healthy for Charisse to have Gomez basically love someone else? This author is so frustrating. This book could have been so much better; it was often close to being great and then would fall flat instead of climaxing.The best part of the book for me was toward the end when Clare reads Henry’s note and he tells her to not waste her life because of his death. He encourages her to live life, love the world, and LIVE; finally, someone learns from past behavior. I enjoyed seeing Henry be a wonderful man to Clare by helping her live instead of hide. He learned from his dad’s tragedy and made something that could have been tragic great. That was the best part and everything else fell short. The concept of the book is so wonderful—-time traveling; I loved the concept, wish I could say I loved the book. I will not recommend this book to anyone because of the foul language and poor choices made by main characters that seem to have no consequences for these bad choices; do the characters even feel remorse for these choices? Where’s the dialog for that? ",46,0.995,0.119,0.708,0.173,0.5312454906204903,NEGATIVE,1.0

I place my finger on her forehead and say, “Vanish,” but it is she who will stay; I am the one who is vanishing.
The allure of time travel is timeless. It is classic. Too many authors have tried their luck at making time travel the backdrop of their novels and they have always been rewarded with a huge success. Unlike many other time-travelling heroes, our Henry DeTamble isn't a mastermind that invented his own time-travelling contraption. He is an average librarian who wishes more than anything to be nothing but a librarian. He has his own share of regrets, mourns his mother and contends with his father and believes in irredeemable alcoholics. 
“He's an alcoholic. That's what alcoholics do. It's in their job description: Fall apart, and then keep falling apart.”
Time travelling is in his genes. Just like any other nasty, undesirable trait, time travelling is in his genes. Also, unlike other broad spectrum time travels, his is confined to the accursed years of his own life. As romantic as it sounds, watching your wife grow as a kid and into adulthood is a creepy twist of fate. The story spans across the entire lifetime of Henry and validates time travel as the effective means to keep coming back into the lives of your beloved ones even after you are dead; both of which turned out to be major damp squibs for me. I can't imagine, if my head is reeling with all the alternating POVs and bestrewn timelines, how Audrey Niffenegger would have laboured at keeping the narrative straight and events in proper succession. There was nothing spectacular about the language(bear in mind that the author has equal command over French and German too), but that's one boo-boo you'd soon forget as the story progresses. You'll be riding the crest of the wave until you reach the shore, where all of a sudden, the tide ebbs and you will land on the ground with a heavy thud. I have seen the end coming in the most insipid way, but that's also something you would accept for the stupendousness of the way the age-old concept is handled to suit the needs of an average 21st-century reader. I doubt the science-fiction-ness of the story, though. Building a time machine is one thing and being one is another!Also, one can't overlook the subtle but scathing criticism for one particular country, which goes on like this-
I told Ing once that she dances like a German and she didn't like it, but it's true: she dances seriously, like lives are hanging in the balance, like precision dancing can save the starving children in India.
Or this- 
“Oddball religions. Sappy boring music. Pathetic attempts to convince oneself of the superiority of anything connected with Indians. Non-Western medicine.”
This one counts too- 
“Does the Newberry really have a book made out of human skin?” Charisse asks Henry. “Yep. The Chronicles of Nawat Wuzeer Hydembed. It was found in the palace of the King of Delhi in 1857. Come by some time and I'll pull it out for you.”

Few people went to see the movie and fewer seemed to like what they saw. This made me afraid at first, but now I think the movie must be better than the novel. The author uses very plain language.

The author alternates between the couple, CLARE and HENRY, who tell their story in first person. Like I am. Like a script. CLARE talks. Then HENRY talks. It's all very plain.

There's too much ""telling"" in this book and not enough ""story"". The telling continues on and on. Like this long, plain paragraph I'm writing. Clare tells about missing Henry, who disappears into thin air to pop up in the past. A metaphor for men absent in their relationships. Maybe I am not the demographic for this novel.

47,67287842,08/13/2009,3.0,"Just in time for the movie release, I finally got around to reading this after it'd been sitting on my bookshelf for months. There's a lot of hype surrounding this book, which automatically makes me want to hate it in a very superior way. But I can't hate it because, frankly, I liked reading this. Not loved, just liked. The simplest thing I can say about this story is that it's nice. But just for fun, I'm going to do this review in a style I call The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. Because then I get to complain and nitpick more.The Good: Niffenegger (say that five times fast) gets maximum points for originality, plus ten bonus points for writing a book centered on time travel that never makes the readers go cross-eyed from confusion. Yes, the time travel aspect takes a little getting used to, but it didn't leave me nearly as mystified as plot devices like that usually do. And while I wish she hadn't felt the need to come up with a scientific explanation as to why Henry time travels (genes? really?) I understand why she wanted to make the story as plausible and realistic as possible. The Bad: the book is a romantic story first and foremost, and you have to be in the right mood for that. Since I possess a level of cynicism and disillusionment usually reserved for ninety-year-old war veterans, schmoopy romances like this are rarely my cup of tea. But for the most part, it was okay. The next thing is a minor nitpick, but it's still bugging me: at one point in the story, Henry describes his former girlfriend as ""looking like her usual Bond Girl self."" I wonder, how many Bond movies has this author actually seen? I'd guess the answer is ""not many"", but maybe I've just seen too many. Is it just me, or does describing someone as looking like a Bond Girl seem way too unspecific? I mean, think about all the different Bond Girls - they don't all fit into one specific mold. Pussy Galore vs. Vesper Lynd, for instance.The Ugly: To be perfectly frank, I got a little tired of constantly hearing about how mind-blowingly fantastic Henry and Clare's sex life was. It seemed like every five pages they were fucking again. (and Niffenegger almost never says ""having sex"" or ""making love"", it is always ""fucking."" Classy.) Really, Niffenegger: we don't need to know all of this stuff. You say Clare goes crazy for oral sex? How fascinating, can we move on now? Oh good, now Clare is fucking someone else. I hope we get a blow-by-blow description and then a tasteful, far overdue fade-to-black! The author gets credit for keeping Henry and Clare's early relationship relatively not-creepy (this was when he was in his forties and time traveling to Clare's childhood), but that goes out the window when Clare turns eighteen and Henry visits her as a 41-year-old. This, incendentally, is the point at which Clare discovers just how much she loves having cunnilingus performed on her. Excuse me while I go stand in the corner doing the cootie dance.

It’s quite a long book but I enjoyed the detail and found the relationship between Henry and Clare lovely. There’s a bit of humour and sadness (How does anyone get through that many miscarriages?) but of course as with any time travel stories if you think about it too long the paradoxes become more obvious!

49,972485224,03/22/2017,3.0,"I've wanted to read this book for years, and I finally got around to it. This book has a shit ton of hype and is considering the greatest romance of all time, when in reality this story is just okay. I think the concept is interesting for sure, it follows Henry a time traveler who meets his wife Clare when she is a young girl. It follows them over decades as he tries to figure out why this happens to him, and it sucks because he has no control over it so he can just disappear out of Clare's life at any moment in time. Clare and Henry are okay characters, but I never really connected with either of them. Clare has no life outside of Henry and all she ever thinks about and talks about is Henry, so it got kind of irritating at times. Henry, on the other hand, has a pretty interesting back story and I found his character slightly more interesting than Clare, but not by much. Can we also talk about how creepy this concept is..? I mean... a full grown man appears completely nude in the meadow behind Clare's house when she is only a little girl and it's love at first sight I guess. He asks her to bring him some of her Dad's clothes, and he doesn't flirt with her or do anything weird but it's still weird. Imagine if Clare's parents found out about him when she was a little girl. They would freak the fuck out I'm sure of it.Overall, this concept is interesting and this story is okay, but it's nothing sensational and certainly not something I'm going to remember in a few months. Also, this book was way too long for what it was. It was over 500 pages and it could've easily been cut down by 100 pages or more. There were so many filler, pointless scenes, especially the scenes of their dreams. I was expecting more from one of the apparent ""greatest love stories of all time"" but I guess that's setting the bar kind of high. ",36,0.9824,0.081,0.771,0.148,0.5910175202156335,NEGATIVE,1.0
50,1100701062,11/08/2014,2.0,"So... As you can see from my rating, I'm one of those very few people who didn't absolutely love this book. I started out reading with an open mind and high expectations because I had heard so many great things about this novel; however, I finished reading the last pages with an urgency because I wanted for it to end. I had quite some problems with this book, but let me start with the main one: While reading this book, I came to a realization about my reading preferences: I like for my storylines to be (mostly) linear because I like to dive into the story and understand things from beginning to end. The storyline of ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" is obviously not linear because it deals with time traveling, and the protagonist Henry can actually travel both forward and backward in time. That results in a very messy plot line where you really need to be focused in order to understand ""the rules"" to this time traveling and what is going on. I spent so much time being confused while reading this book, and I wasn't really enjoying myself. There is one chapter that stood out to me because it was magical and adorable, but I think that's because that's the only long chapter in the book with almost no time traveling. We got to actually stick with the period and the characters and actually get to know them and their situation in depth. In contrast, the rest of the novel was a blur to me with too much shifting in time and space for my taste. Furthermore, I don't think Audrey Niffenegger does a good job at explaining this time traveling. I can't go into spoilers, but while the book gradually gave me some answers, I'm still left with some troubling questions after having finished it. To me, the time traveling just didn't make sense, and that just made me even more frustrated. Niffenegger is also very fond of ""telling"" the story instead of ""showing"" it, which is another literary devise that I strongly dislike. Some of the ""telling"" became too exaggerated for me and decreased my reading experience. I saw some things coming that were supposed to be a surprise, and I wasn't amused. Last but not least, I need to mention the one thing that I liked about this story, and that is the relationship between Henry and Clare. They are adorable together and I wanted to follow their progress, but even that was ruined with questions that kept appearing in my head about Clare's tolerance towards Henry's traveling. So even though I did find small parts of this book enjoyable, I wouldn't recommend it if you know that you like the kind of books that I like.

With no conscious control over staying put in the present time or knowledge of where he will end up next, the (often naked) Henry encounters many dangerous and embarrassing moments, relives some horrendous occurrences of times past, and handles it all with wit and a forthwith manner of acceptance.As a huge fan of time travel novels, I really enjoyed this story even though I vaguely remember not liking the movie......do not recall why.",34,0.5768,0.145,0.689,0.166,0.6233333333333333,POSITIVE,0.9998

I had high hopes years ago when purchasing the book since so many people were absolutely thrilled by it. Until this very day I don't get why. The author seems to be unable to make up her mind if she is writing a time-traveller-story (fantasy) combined with a love story or rather a book for cuisine-lovers and cultural attachées. Many times there are lengthy descriptions of food and other stuff that crawl with high and mighty words only to be followed by the most dull dialogues. So on one hand it seems like Niffenegger wants to be an over-achiever creating an artful book and not just tell a story while on the other she is incapable of even only getting you to like her characters. And it's sad, really, because the story had so much potential!For years I have tried to read this book (two or three in fact) and every time I stopped because I just couldn't take it anymore. People critize ""Twilight""'s Bella (and for good reason, don't get me wrong) for her utter self-abandonment in favour of a ""perfect"" being - but what is this book's protagonist doing? Exactly: THE VERY SAME THING! She's sitting around, waiting for Henry, arranging her daily routine so that she can comfortably wait for him. Yeah, right.Also, I really couldn't feel for any of the characters. Maybe it was the lack of distinction between them. Sometimes I actually had to turn back to the start of a chapter to see from whose point of view it supposedly was because their ""voices"" were all the same.So all in all it was an interesting idea but very poorly executed with dull and often unnecessary dialogues (followed by antagonizing dissections of the very same dialogues in the following monologue of one main character or the other), an absolute lack of character development, no distinction between the characters - oh, and let's not forget the almost racist descriptions of the servants at Clare's home!An absolute waste of my time and I'm so happy for it to be over! Actually, I wish I would simply have stopped reading the book years ago instead of wanting to know the ending and dragging myself from page to page!Which only goes to show that you cannot trust in hypes and praise all too much.

53,26285442,07/04/2008,3.0,"OK, to be honest, I'm having a hard time reviewing this book. I had a mixed feeling that sometimes I like this book and sometimes I dislike this book. There were moments when I just want to throw this book and moments when I suddenly realized that I'm having a hard time putting it down. It's difficult to write the review cause somehow I want to tell you everything.Henry has chrono-displacement disorder, and he will be sucked backs and forth in time (mostly when he was stressed). He can't control it, didn't ask for it, and is not exactly happy with it. But he learns how to handle it. He shows up naked and has to figure out how to survive for however long he is there. Sounds sci-fi to you? I have never been a fan of sci-fi, but I can tell this is not ""pure"" sci-fi. In my opinion the time travel is just an element background for the story. Perhaps some people might be more carried away by the romance and relationship between Henry and Clare.The story unfurls through time with first person perspectives from both Henry and Clare. The first 100 pages really engaging and intrigued me. I remember that I found it a little difficult at first, I mean, I couldn't keep track of anything cause the time line shifting back and forth rapidly. But on the contrary that was the main point that hooked me. I eagerly awaited the moment where it would become obvious that Clare and Henry were meant to be together. The battle between free will vs fate plays an important role in the story. That's was the biggest issue for me that keep me wondering all the time, even after I finished the book. But then things turned for me at some point midway through the book. I don't why, but I felt the book suddenly turns out to be so tedious for me that I decided to put it off for a week. Too much unnecessary details for me I guess :D but then there's something itching in my mind that somehow triggered my curiosity to find out what will happen to Henry. So I decided to finished it. OK.... SPOILERS ALERT!!!DO NOT READ BEYOND THIS POINT IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THE BOOK OR YOU HAVE PLAN TO READ THIS BOOKAfter finished this book I have so many question dangling in my head. Do I like it? Do I hate it? should I gave two stars? or four stars instead of two stars? I mean, this book sometimes funny, shocking, boring, heartbreaking and disturbing at the same time. I don't know whether I'm confuse or just stupid.The GoodThe non-linear narrative was interesting. The idea about love story blended with the time travel adventure are great. It make me wondering this question ""what if..."" constantly. I know that certain scene made some people sobbing and bathed in tears. Well, I admit that I had my moment too :D Not the ending part though. But the moment when Henry and Claire meet the seven years old Alba (I loved her!) from the future. How Alba ran toward Henry and crying in his shoulder and Henry whispered in her ear not to tell Clare that he will be dead soon (Henry died when Alba was five years old). So I understand how happy Alba and Henry to see each other. It's heartbreaking, I feel like an ugly giant sap at that scene. Ok, there I said it. Enough about that :DThe BadI don't know how I felt about Clare character, it seemed to me that she is never given a real chance to have her own life. Some of her decisions were made because she knew about the future, for example; would Clare learn to like coffee if Henry didn't tell her that she already like it in the future? and I think Henry and Clare relationship is pretty much built on sex. Did I mention that there's so much sex in this book? I remember I uttered the ""F"" words out loud in the middle of the night when I stumble upon the scene in which Clare had sex with ""Henry"" while the ""present"" Henry is a asleep next to her. I don't know... but for me, that's just freaking annoying. I also found the relationship between the young Clare and the older Henry disturbing. For me it was kinda child molestation by an adult male, it seemed wrong even though nothing wrong happened between them; at least until Clare turns eighteen years old.

Nevertheless, as Henry goes skipping through time against his will, we hear both points of view. One of the main issues that troubled me in Audrey Niffenegger’s story is that neither protagonist has much choice in their destinies. He suffers from a condition that makes him disappear from one time and appear on another randomly. If Henry seems to have no control of his life, Clare’s life has been entirely determined by Henry. Since he met her, when she was only 6 years old, Henry seems to have in a sense seduced her, for from them on her life becomes tethered to his.

You betcha. A.N.'s prose is good but her dialogue is stilted (strange, unique maybe, to have dialogue in a much HIGHER register than descriptive prose). There are three too many supportive friend characters who are minorities with stereotypical attributes whose plot function is solely to help the white protagonists (a literal actual Mammy, a sassy Korean lady, a gay man with HIV). I think the ending, though decent, could have been better (the hazards of writing your end first).But man, not only could I not put this down, I was genuinely moved by it.

56,728618701,02/17/2022,4.0,"Some of my friends are allergic to science fiction. To them, I say, “Consider trying this book.” Yes, there is time travel. The title kind of gives it away. But there is so much more going on here. Just think how much effort it takes to maintain a regular relationship, then imagine if your partner just faded out every now and then, unpredictably returning naked, scared, hungry, and upset. You have to give up the fantasy of having someone to lean on, to share the vicissitudes of life.Henry and Clare get to know each other backwards. It is an older Henry who shows up repeatedly in her childhood backyard, who helps her with her homework, and dispenses sage advice. When Clare meets him in real time, none of that has happened to him yet and she keeps surprising him with her knowledge of him. Plus, there are things they can't reveal to each other because, as Henry puts it, that makes things weird(er). Interestingly, the author doesn't hold to the usual time travel rule that two versions of a person can't inhabit the same time frame, thus allowing an adult Henry to mentor his younger self, teaching himself how to pickpocket, to pick a lock, and to defend himself.One of the parts that I found particularly poignant was the car accident which killed Henry's mother. He survived because he time traveled, appearing back on the side of the road, a naked, confused nine year old. Deeply emotional experiences seem to suck the time traveler back repeatedly and soon there are multiple versions of Henry all around the accident scene as he tries to process the loss. But he also gets to go back and view his family's life from the outside and derive comfort from watching his mother's pleasure in life. OMG, I wish I could do that and I'm so glad that I can't.Things get sad late in the book. I sniffled my way through the last few pages.

57,39455163,12/06/2008,4.0," I married at age twenty, a dozen years ago. Every year of marriage only confirms that I chose well, or was lucky, or the fates were smiling upon me, whatever (and if my married years aren't proof enough, there's Facebook as a nice reminder). But I remember that at the time of my wedding, I didn't really feel like I had a big choice to make. There was no nail-biting scenario where a cartoon drawing of myself might have looked pained over having to choose between a heavenly or hellish future drawn in bubbles above my penciled head. There was no crossroad of decision, there was only forward along a path that wanted walking, that I had always been walking. Because everything in me wanted to eat, sleep, breathe next to this other person. I don't think that feeling that way is unusual, most songs are either about feeling it or not feeling it...what is unusual is that I still feel that way. I know, I know, it's a bit embarrassing, but it is true.  And that, above all, is why I like this book. I have to admit that although at first I winced at Clare, as a young child, being visited by Henry, it didn't take me long to get used to reading about it. And the reason is that I have often wished that my lover had been there alongside me growing up, that he had been there to watch me empty out that whole industrial size bottle of glue on that eighth grade asshole Burton. I just never wished that he could watch it, high-five me, and collapse with laughter over it next to me as an adult. I mean, as long as I'm wishing, I might as well wish that he could have seen Burton's face while only four years older than myself.  There are plenty of negative reviews about this book. The time traveling aspect has holes in it, arguably. It is a fiction book chronicling two people in love and one of them time travels. There will be holes. Some reviewers didn't like the sex in it- too much! Too graphic! But life is graphic, and sex is graphic, and, well, I guess I am just one of those that doesn't mind a little graphic sex now and then. And I feel kind of sorry for those who do mind. So sorry, so very sorry. But there are books for you too. Sweet books where two characters are so into each other, so drenched in themselves when together that they...make tea, sit in rockers. Hold hands. I think they are called inspirational romance, but I wouldn't really know, I'm too busy having sex.  The only thing negative I have to say about the book is that the ending should have come sooner. A clean ending is always nice, even when heartbreaking.

61,30893238,08/22/2008,4.0,"Yeats once wrote, ""Man is in love and loves what vanishes. What more is there to say?"" I kept thinking of this line while reading The Time Traveler's Wife, not only because one of the protagonists, librarian cum time traveler Henry De Tamble, keeps disappearing, but because the through-line of this story is the finiteness of our existence, coupled with our fervent attempts(e.g., love) to capture the infinite. In Wife, Henry, the time traveler, is in love with Clare. The problem is, he keeps getting unstuck in time, traveling backwards and forwards to various parts of his and Clare's life. Trying to keep the narrative clear is quite difficult, even with the helpful headings for each chapter, which tell you the the day and date, as well as the character who is telling the story (the book uses alternating first-person narrators: Clare and Henry). I suppose I could've have kept better track, but I didn't find it necessary to my enjoyment. Indeed, while the central conceit is a touchstone of science fiction, the time traveling aspect is taken as something of a given. There's an explanation, of sorts - chrono-displacement disorder - but the point of the book isn't the time traveling, it's the consequences of not being able to be with the person you love. On the back cover, one of the reviewers states this is an ""unconventional love story."" I disagree, wholeheartedly. This is a most conventional love story, complicated by time travel. By conventional, I mean it hews to the traditional arc of love in literature: boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back. Adding time travel serves as a profound way of exploring what it means to love. This isn't LOST or Back to the Future or, God help us, The Butterfly Effect, in which the paradoxes and ""dangers"" of time travel are explored. Rather, Audrey Niffenegger uses it to highlight the highs and lows of any great love: the hope, the faith, the waiting (as Bryan Adams once sang, ""Your lonely nights/have just begun/when you love someone""). I recently saw Fincher's The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, which explored a similar theme as Wife, namely, that when we choose to love, we choose to give our hearts to something that will end. All love is doomed. That is what makes it special. In the face of eternity, we humans willingly sneer at our mortality. Even knowing that all things come down to heartbreak and dust, we press on. In that way, Wife's use of time travel is haunting: all things are, and all things have already been. Throughout the course of the book, Henry bounces to different time periods. Everytime he leaves his present, he appears naked in the past. This of course has its problems. He is beaten, arrested, must steal for food and clothing. He is forced to relive the death of his mother, who is decapitated on the Dan Ryan Expressway. Henry often goes back to meet Clare, when Clare is a child (which is a little creepy, of course, but Henry is very adamant that he not go all Roman Polanski on us, and waits till Clare is 18). Clare comes to believe that time traveling Henry is telling the truth; she falls in love with him and must wait for years to finally meet him, when she is 20 and he is 28. This is where things can get confusing if you are paying too much attention. It's never clear who the main character is: is it time traveling Henry or the Henry that time traveling Henry visits? This is important, because you need to know who to invest with. At times it gets very unclear what the rules of space-time-travel are. I don't really care for all the paradoxes, and gladly point anyone who is to the Futurama episode where Fry becomes his own grandfather. Still, if you're going to get into this business, you should make some groundrules, ala Back to the Future's model of ""whatever you change in the past will change the future."" Henry often says that you can't change the future, which leads to a sad passage on September 11, 2001, when one version of Henry wakes up early to enjoy the world's last peaceful day. Then, at other times, Henry uses his foreknowledge to give his friend's stock tips and lotto numbers. Isn't that changing the future? Or is that the future, and everything he's doing now is as its supposed to be? In which case, time is sort of an endless loop, right? My head just exploded. That's why it's best not to think about it. Ignore the quantum physics of the time travel and enjoy what it reveals about us humans and our foolish hearts. Also enjoy it for its amazing verisimilitude, for its description of Chicago at different times over the decades is quite amazing. I visited recently for the first time and could have used the book as a road map. The final thing I have to say is that Niffenegger is something of a musical/literary/cultural snob. And I say this admiringly. She owes a debt to A.S. Byatt's Possession, as well as to Andrew Marvell's To His Coy Mistrees (the phrase, ""world enough and time"" is repeated throughout the story). It's helpful to know these underpinning works. There are also numerous allusions to operas, singers, and famous works I've never heard of. I don't usually feel provincial when it comes to these matters, but I certainly did here. I just had to face the fact that her characters were much better read than I was; they also eat much fancier food. I cried throughout the last 20 or so pages, and I don't usually cry while reading. After spending so much time with these two characters (it's a five-hundred page book), fighting through space and time to be with each other, I felt their terrifying desperation as they were stalked by inevitability. There was only one way for this book to end. There is only one way for anything that lives to end. We all are born and we all die and the meaning comes in the fleeting love we share during the interregnum. ",30,0.9985,0.088,0.752,0.16,0.5061476504793336,POSITIVE,0.595

Do I feel more pity for Henry who is cursed with this gift to jump through time at unknown junctures where anything can happen to him? Or do I feel more pity for Clare who is seemingly doomed by Henry himself for him getting involved in her life before they actually ""meet"". In my opinion poor Clare was doomed from the very moment Henry showed up in the meadow. She was his from that time on and would never have any other. I guess Henry's gift became a curse on both of them. But I digress.Let's get to the writing shall we? I very much like the unique idea of time travel in this book. It hasn't truly been done in this manner before and for that I really do commend the author as it is a subject that is widely written about.I personally found the writing to be slow and boring especially in the beginning and made for a very difficult read to jump into (no pun intended). But eventually the story does pick up and the book does get better. I guess you just have to push through the beginning.Because of the nature of Henry's gift and the way the author chose to write about it there is a lot of repetitiveness in this book. And I will forgive the author for that because she did such a great job keeping things straight with dates and times and ages of the characters so that way the reader can read both Henry and Clare's stories in a comprehensive way. Everything in the book is very well put together so that we are reading a story instead of just fragments in the timeline.It is very difficult to write a good book about time travel. Considering the fact that we know next to nothing about it and can only theorize and conjecture what it would be like, imagination is key here and this book definitely has enough of that to make it a good read.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good fantasy, romance, or is interested in time travel in general.",32,0.993,0.099,0.73,0.171,0.5454166666666665,NEGATIVE,0.9999

65,1099680820,11/06/2014,3.0," The time traveller's wife is probably one the rare few books that I read after having already seen the movie. But it was on the list and you don't argue with the list. My friend and I, last year decided to take the challenge to complete the BBC 100 list. This is number twenty five.  On the surface, it is the same old boy meets girl, girl meets boy, they fall in love and then something bad happens. La de dah . But here's the thing- the boy has a rare genetic affliction that allows him to time travel without any nifty little time machine hidden in a compact guitar case or a DeLorean. And it doesn't really 'allow' him, so much as 'make ' him jump in time and therein lies the problem. He cannot control where in time or place he ends up in. Also he cannot take anything with him when he jumps. So no money, no clothes and bye bye identification. Poor bugger.  Audrey writes in style. The slow, quiet prose was a good addendum to the lull left behind by the holiday season slowly receeding like a fog in my brain. Perhaps it was that or the guilt of not having read much over the course of the month that got me through the book. Or perhaps it were these little paragraphs strewn thoroughout the book :There are a few faint lines, at the corners of her eyes and mouth, that are the merest suggestion of the beginnings of Clare 's face in middle age. I will never see that face of hers, and I regret it bitterly, the face with which Clare will go on without me, which will never be kissed by me, which will belong to a world that I won't know, except as a memory of Clare' s, relegated finally to a definite past  About the latter, is it because Audrey belongs to the gender that she writes so poignantly yet beautifully on the ravages of time. With my head swarming with labels and sparkling people who are supposed to set the bar on beauty in these times , not to mention one very irritating duo that my Facebook newsfeed informs me every day has 'broken the internet' with their 'awesomeness', this capacity to axle on the metamorphosis of beauty is refreshing.  The above, for me, was the high point of the book and it's all downhill from there. The story itself is very one dimensional focused on taking the characters from one point to another without much to speak for the development of the story. Being primarily a love story, the book plays on the concept on inevitability, such that girl falls in love with a boy who happens to appear out of nowhere to her on a meadow. I can understand the curiosity but not the premise that it served as the linchpin of their supposedly epic love story. Am I to believe that she fell in love with boy because he 'appeared' to her? Sounds kind of desperate and Audrey doesn't really provide me much of a counter argument. Even when girl and boy meets in real time, all girl wants is for boy to quickly become the man she knows from her childhood.  Another flaw that stuck in my mind is the accident that kills boy's mother that affects him so deeply that he travels in time countless times and ends up observing the accident from all angles, revolving around the epicentre of the site of accident. But that is it. There's no road leading to or from this point, and it just acts as one tidbit of information on boy's background that is thrown our way. There are galores of such subplots in the story that lead nowhere and in a book that is 614 pages long is really really, well, weak writing.Audrey herself admitted in an interview of the many loop holes in her concept of time travel. There is no butterfly effect since boy does not really travel to a different time stream and all the bugs he steps on are pre-ordained. So when the old boy meets his younger self, there isn't any consequence since his timeline itself is askew. Thus, old boy teaching young boy tricks of survival, leads to a very chicken and egg situation, that makes my head hurt when I try to understand the intricacies of it. According to quantum mechanics, time travel beyond a boundary layer of time with the invention of the machine itself as the centre, starts breaking the fabric of time. So as far as boy is concerned, he adheres to this rule but his daughter is capable of bending in some cases utterly shattering this rule. I get that an author has the freedom to construct her own rules in her fiction, but considering that there is no explanation for why the daughter is different from father, and the science in the story very very vague and leaves much to the reader to construct upon his/her imagination. After completing the story, it seems to me that the only idea in the story was to give a character the capacity for time travel and the rest of the story is poorly constructed based on that premise. A pity considering the potential. The engineer in me scoffs, the reader in me shakes my head No.",27,-0.9666,0.082,0.858,0.06,0.4751948051948051,NEGATIVE,0.9874

It's just SO manipulative that even I, I of the Jacqueline Susann novels (and the W.S. Merwin, o.k.? I spread it around. I go to all the neighborhoods. I'm not snobby, is the thing), I just can't abide this.

Even the writing gets better, it's grainier and she uses these really beautiful and frightening dream sequences to lay out what is happening to her characters emotionally and it is just so GOOD. I would almost want to reread it just to find the place where it changes, because there is a spot in the book right after they get married, I don't remember exactly where, when I all of a sudden knew that I was reading a different book. I still have a couple of quibbles. The thing is, and don't read this part if you haven't read the book yet and you don't want it ruined, how did he not know that his feet were going to get removed? He knew all kinds of stuff, why not that? Or did he, did I just miss that he knew? And I didn't understand how the death of Clare's mom fit into the story structure. Ingrid and Celia? Anyone? It just seemed like there was another book sitting on top of the good part of this book. Like someone shuffled the pages of two drafts together or something.O.K., so not that I don't have some issues with it, but for the most part I retract my earlier statement about the book being bad. It's actually really good. Just keep reading even when you are sure that it's not going to be what you need it to be, because then it changes, and it is.

71,236611965,11/17/2011,2.0,"THE TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE is an interesting concept focusing on one of those what if questions that makes the contemporary setting suddenly fantastic. While this is really a sci fi story it was marketed as fiction to attract more readers. Hollywood is in the works to turn this into a film with rumors of Brad Pitt starring. So the overall concept here is that a man and woman are married but the husband has a disease that makes him time warp either into the future or into the past of his life. When he appears he is naked as nothing can be taken with him and so this begins to work to his disadvantage later in the tale. He sometimes recognizes his wife and other times he does not when she recognizes him . . . and this is all ages. The main overall problem for me is that I found it tedious and slow to get through. If that wasn't the case, I would give this a higher score as there are some very interesting sub components to the theme, even though there are some holes or logic gaps. Thoughts below: #1: The story is told more in vignettes than a feeling that it is all structured together. This can make it hard to follow if you are looking for an overall story thread.; #2: The husband keeps time warping yet he somehow holds his job at the library. Heh.; #3: At one point, the husband states the rule that even though he is time warping, he cannot change the past or the future. This rule seems to have been broken later when he wins the lottery so that they can move into a bigger house. Woops.; #4: The illness can pass to your children. I found it peculiar that they decided to have a child who ended up getting this illness. I am not saying parents would not do something like this as it happens all the time. I would have preferred the reason for having a child be more explained by the parents.; #5: The husband ends up visiting the wife when she is a child and this is supposedly their first meeting. It didn't bother me but some people are going to be screaming pedophilia over it.; #6: The husband comes across as a putz and weak around women. I am unclear why the wife fell in love with him and I found her paper designs a bit too much for my tastes in the details.; and #7: The guy meeting his older self and doing you know what was a bit much.

73,14306045,02/01/2008,4.0,"I want the option of 1/2 stars. I give this one 4 1/2. I’m always afraid of two things when I’ve been as captivated by a book as I have been this one. The first is that no one else will feel the same way I do about it. What if it’s actually horrible, and for some reason I love it? I’m no literary genius, after all. But I suppose we are all entitled to our own opinions, and there are certainly plenty of “great” reads out there that I am sure I did not love, or would not love if I ever read them. The second happens about ¾ of the way in, and can be a little suffocating, if you think you know what’s going to happen: the fear of finishing. What if it’s as sad as I am expecting? What if all my questions aren’t answered? What if I just don’t want the story to end. What if I’m not as satisfied as I think I should be once it has actually ended, and there’s no hope of more? Nevertheless, I always finish. And I am resolved to the fact that just because I love something doesn’t mean you will love it too, and that’s ok. This book brought out these fears in an immensely incredible way for me. Sometimes I connect with a book because I feel like I am actually watching the story play out, but only as an outsider, sort of as if I am good friends with the characters. But sometimes, rarely, I connect with a book because I feel like I am the character. That was the case with this book. And that’s why I couldn’t stop reading. David is finally finished, so I can say more. I loved the first half of this book. Since we meet Clare when she is so young, I felt like I sort of grew up with her, getting to know this time-traveling Henry at the same time as her. But even in the first half, I struggled with a few things: Where did The List come from? And how did two Henry's appear at the same time and place so often? Maybe we aren't supposed to know those things, but they bothered me a bit. But I was easily caught up in the lives of the characters and sort of swept away by their story. Captivated, really. The 2nd half was a little more frustrating, and not quite as lovable, though still very enjoyable and able to keep my attention for looong periods of time. But my fear of finishing with my questions still unanswered was a legitimate fear here, and I think maybe that plays into my not liking the 2nd half as much. I, contrary to David, did not like the ending. Maybe I just wanted more, I'm not sure. I just know I felt a little let down at the end. Clare and Henry went through a whole lot of crap, all for it to end way too early in their lives. And Alba never really gets to know Henry. I know that not all stories are supposed to end happy, and I am not a fan of writing a happy ending just for the sake of a happy ending. But I think Clare and Henry got a little cheated here. Her knowledge of Henry coming, at some point, is not enough for me. She spends the rest of her life just waiting on him to show up, never knowing when he will. After having The List as a child, and then having him almost constantly as an adult, until his death, it just seems unfair that after his death, she gets up every day and waits to see if it's a day he will arrive. I finished feeling rather sorry for Clare and Alba, and frustrated for Henry, but having enjoyed their story immensely up until that point.

Impossible but true, because Henry is one of the first people diagnosed with Chrono-Displacement Disorder: periodically his genetic clock resets and he finds himself misplaced in time, pulled to moments of emotional gravity in his life, past and future.

But aside from the themes that lend the story depth, this novel is first and foremost a powerful love story.The science fiction premise of time travelling is dramatic and effective to keep the story moving along (albeit in a disconcertingly non-linear--and occasionally confusing--fashion) and to illuminate the themes. I found myself interested in how the conceit was working and trying to sort out the internal logic of both the time travel and of Henry's chromosomal disability. But that quickly took second fiddle (!) to the main story arc. (Glossing over the inconsistencies in the logic of Henry's time travel is important to preserve the 'believability' of the rest of the story. Niffenegger has a less-than-adequate mastery of the time travel conceit. She would do well to study Roddenberry's Star Trek: The Next Generation time-space continuum rift narratives if she chooses to continue in a sci-fi vein for her second novel).Regardless, time travelling serves primarily here as a device to illustrate how people, and in particular Clare and Henry, find each other and how their individual stories and the events of their lives become interwoven into an ""us"" that is both inevitable and random. If we reject the science fiction premise as poorly executed or too science fiction-ey to be believable--especially as nested within this story that is otherwise so very 'normal'--we can still look on the bouncing around through time and space as being an apt analogy for memory, and we can all relate to that. We reminisce about the happy times, reliving them again and again to sustain us in times of difficulty. We ruminate about past hurts and traumas, unable to let them go. Both the good and the bad memories shape us into the people we are. Henry is frustrated by knowing what is going to happen but is unable, because he didn't the first time around, to change the outcome. Often, we wish we could go back in time and change things, recognizing all the while that--whether for good or for ill--every experience we've had has made us into who we are.Niffenegger is clever in showing us how our place in time--the music we listen to, the books we read, the clothes we wear--do more than just define us at any given age: they carry forward into the people we become. Niffenberger plays with the theme of time travel in myriad ways, some subtle and some ironic, but all with the intention of looking at time, place, space and memory from every possible angle. As Clare looks down at the dance floor at the Violent Femmes' concert, she notes the audience is in their teens, 20s, 30s and ""even some older."" Henry and his younger self travel backwards in time from the 19th, to the 18th, to the 17th Centuries as they stroll through successive rooms in the museum. On a trip from Chicago to Michigan, Clare and Henry remark on how strange it is to skip ahead an hour moving from Central to Eastern timezone.These images reinforce the much larger question of how we are shaped by the times in which we live. Henry's affinity for punk music gives him a certain identity in his 20s, but is no less important at defining him in his late-30s. The opportunity Henry has to re-experience events at different ages and stages, as a child, then as a young adult, then in middle-age, give him an enviable omniscience. The implication is that Henry gains a perspective and wisdom that we lesser-evolved lifeforms never have: he occupies some realm between human and angel. (Clare's fascination for angels and birds; and her lapsed Catholicism--none of which are overtly explored in any heavy-handed way--resonate when played off of the spiritual connotations of Henry's uniqueness).But the bottom line, the consistent theme and the anchor point for the story is the love between these two characters. Henry is a planet revolving around Clare, his sun. She gives his life shape, direction and purpose. And the sun is nothing without having something to shine upon: Clare needs Henry as much as he needs her.

82,11093953,12/27/2007,4.0,"I am not a linear book-reader. That is, I rarely ever read a book contiguously, from start to finish. I have a very bad habit of reading the last dozen or so pages first, just to see if I will like the story. (It's a bit irrational; I don't know what I'm looking for, but somehow, reading those last words gives me an impression of what to expect, of whether I should buy a book or pass on it, or even if I will like a book or not.) Personally, I don't think that reading the end first takes anything away from the story since I don't know what led up to it, and I often feel (strangely) rewarded at the end by those ""aha!"" moments when what I know of the ending becomes evident. Still, I know it drives some people (i.e., Jim) crazy, and for that, apologies. Once I start reading, I also have a tendency to go back to certain sections repeatedly (including the ending), thus prolonging the experience while also gaining more insight into the characters, situations, the language used, etc. So in many ways, my style of reading probably suited the way how this novel was written: the beginning presupposed the end, and the time traveling aspects of the story - jumping back and forth through time - did not detract from my going back and forth through the novel, either. It complemented it very well, in fact, that I am now a proud owner of a very dog-eared copy, with the binding a bit ragged and very nearly unglued. :-)That said, I must say I really enjoyed The Time Traveler's Wife. I stop short of claiming that I loved it only because there were parts of the novel - specifically towards the end - that bothered and frustrated me. My discomfiture, however, did not take anything away from relishing the narrative itself: I loved the characters, I loved the writing style, I loved the intelligence of both the author and the narrative. The prose - her writing, the attention to detail, the exquisite imagery - was sublime and oftentimes visceral. Sometimes what she wrote was almost too painful to read (in a good way). Similarly, the poetry was heartwrenching; it made me want to re-read Rilke, Homer and Dickinson (as well as Byatt's Possession) with a different lens. I did feel as if there were a few questions left unanswered in the end, such as, what happened to Alba? (Yes, the title of the book is not The Time Traveler's Daughter; I suppose what happened to Alba, in the grand scheme of things, is irrelevant since we find out what happens to Clare.)The parts that troubled me the most occurred in the third part, at the end. Her one-word chapter titles, ""Dissolution,"" ""Dasein,"" and ""Renascence"" said more than enough. I found these last chapters the hardest to get through (I was telling Jim I could've finished the book 2 weeks ago, but I had to keep putting it down because there were parts I found extremely upsetting), even though they were probably the most critical chapters in the novel because, for the first time, it finally dealt with Clare after Henry. For as much as the novel was about Henry's wife, it was also his story, and a majority of the book dealt with their lives. They were inextricably linked through time and space for most of the book, but here, at the end, it was all about Clare. Clare alone, Clare lost, Clare trapped, Clare waiting.Throughout the novel, Clare typified her art as being, simply, about birds and about longing. But as her story unfolded, her art became a metaphor for freedom: it became about finding her wings (and Henry's), and gaining freedom from the body, from time, from its intricacies and paradoxes, from the problems it caused, from the world. What was so unnerving, however, was the meaning behind those three chapter titles, and what happened in each chapter. Dissolution: disintegrating, breaking bonds, falling apart. Dasein: a being that is constituted by its temporality, something that illuminates and interprets the meaning of ""Being in Time"" and a way of choosing to either remain engaged in the world or distanced from it, all the while questioning what it means to be (now there's a throwback to my literary criticism days when we were studying Heidegger - I never liked Heidegger because everything was a circular argument; everything seemed paradoxical because everything seemed causal). And then Renascence: a rebirth, a renaissance. There's a passage in the book, towards the end of the second part, when Henry says ""The pain has receded but what's left is the shell of the pain, an empty space where there should be pain but instead there is the expectation of pain."" During Dissolution and Dasein, Clare lived these words. Clare never achieved the freedom she longed for; her life and her freedom were directly linked to Henry's, and when he was gone, a part of her died with him, too. She becomes nothing more than a shell; someone who gives up her art, someone who just drives her daughter around, someone who is a part of the world, but is not engaged in it. Someone who just is. In Renascence, Clare finally creates something new. After decades of creating birds, wings, angels and drawings of Henry and Alba, she finally creates one of herself. And this new art form surprises her because it takes on a much bigger scope than anything she had created in the past: this time, it's a constellation, a galaxy, a universe of stars, and she's lost in the vastness of something so huge, so intangible. At the end, she states, ""I regard my likeness, and she returns my gaze. I place my finger on her forehead and say 'Vanish,' but it is she who will stay; I am the one who is vanishing.""There is beauty in such tragedy, and that's what made it so hard to read, so hard to end.",19,0.9966,0.082,0.785,0.134,0.5033317733317733,NEGATIVE,0.7379
83,61034238,06/25/2009,5.0,"If I was a struggling or mid range sf author I'd probably be very annoyed with Audrey Niffenegger, how dare she write a romantic first novel using a popular sf trope and sell them on mainstream shelves by the truck load? Fortunately I am not an author of any kind so I feel more forgiving. I think she dared because she has a very good story to tell and knows she is capable of telling it effectively. My only annoyance with this book is that it is not marketed as sf when it clearly is sf even though the emphasis is not on the sf side of it. I am also annoyed that since the commercial success of this novel Ms. Niffenegger has not decided to pursue a career as an sf author. This novel shows that she belongs to this genre. She even coins a very sf-ish term ""chrono-impaired"" for the protagonist Henry DeTamble's involuntary time travelling condition, how ""sci-fi"" is that? Of course since this book is not hard sf no rhyme or reason is given for Henry's uncontrollable time traveling. He just does it OK? It is no more unbelievable than FTL travel through hyperspace or teleportation. That said, the time traveling element is very well done, I personally can not find any illogical paradoxes that can bring the whole story down like a house of cards. I don't suppose the internal logic of the story is entirely water-tight, more observant or analytical sf readers than myself will probably find some logical fallacies to grumble about, but it is smooth enough for me.Given that time travel is not the point of this novel the characterization need to be the priority for the author. Both the lead characters are likable and believable, their romantic relationship which is the heart of this book is suitably poignant, and the pathos at the end is rightly emotional. At no time did I cry like a little girl but the corners of my mouth did droop a little bit, and I finished the book with a warm and tingly feeling.So yes, a solid recommendation for anyone who likes a good time travel story with a touch (well, a massive heap) of romance.",19,0.9924,0.034,0.792,0.174,0.5037127371273714,POSITIVE,0.6706

This one did.I honestly enjoyed the first part of the novel with my whole heart, to the point that I even thought I was falling in love with it. I found myself interested in how time travel worked for Henry (he basically can travel to the past and the future but only to places bound to people he loves, instead of jumping through time and space without a specific criterion), I adored Clare as a character and their relationship, even if a bit problematic at times, was definitely entertaining to read.The second part, instead, was disastrous. It tried so hard to be overdramatic and a tear-jerker (which I think worked for lots of people) that made me sick. I literally felt nauseous while reading certain things. The character of Clare was completely ruined: she becomes suddenly whiny about Henry time traveling, even if she always knew this would have happened, we had to read about (view spoiler)[her six abortions in details, which were very gory and weren't really pleasing or even easy to absorb, only for her to finally have a daughter the seventh time - and we don't really know why she didn't abort this time - and not caring about her child. At a certain point, she says that she prefers to spend her time alone, without Henry and Alba; therefore, to me it seems like this whole plot had only a function: manipulate the readers' feelings (hide spoiler)] and we discover that she even (view spoiler)[cheats twice with her best friend's husband, Gomez: the first time when she was 18, and she was supposedly in love with Henry, and the other time when she is 37, after Henry died: she never feels guilty about having had sex with him and keeps lying to her best friend (hide spoiler)]. For these two reasons, I started to strongly dislike her.I hated how the author tried to explain time travel scientifically for no reason at all, since the whole work this Dr Kendrick did does not have a function inside the plot, so what was the point?The ending was the most terrible thing I've ever read in a book (view spoiler)[Henry dies after having had his feet amputated because of an hypothermia and, time traveling but not being able to walk, is shot by Clare's brother who was hunting, which doesn't make sense. Beyond that, them meeting when Clare is 82 is an overused cliché (letting old people see their lovers for a last time) clearly used to make the readers cry so hard. Who are you, Nicholas Sparks?

88,1791979133,10/23/2016,2.0,"Somewhere between 2 and 3 stars, but we'll go with 2 for now...I got curious about this book when the ""Doctor Who"" writers mentioned that it had been a big influence on the story arc of River Song - who was arguably one of my favorite things about the Matt Smith years of the show. God, I miss those two. Moving on...Henry suffers from a curious medical condition called chrono-impairment, which makes him travel in time in a completely uncontrollable and unpredictable way. To makes matters more complicated, when he time travels, he can't bring any physical objects with him, which means he vanishes out of his clothes and pops, naked, wherever Time sees fit to drop him. These episodes are of varying and irregular lengths, which obviously makes him life rather challenging. The only thing that's constant in his life is Clare, his beloved wife. The problem is that they are on different time-lines, so to speak: when he first meets her, he is in his late twenties and she has just turned twenty. But she remembers meeting him when she was six and he was much older...There's not denying that the idea is very original. Sure, there's temporal displacement in ""Kindred"", which I loved (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...), but the focus of the book is completely different. ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" is first and foremost a story about impossible love - something a lot people find inexplicably romantic. I, on the other hand, am a fan of possible love: life is sufficiently complicated without adding a million hurdles between yourself and the object of your affection, but I digress. I approached this book cautiously, ready to be mildly nauseated by the romance. And then I got annoyed with other stuff...While the set up of the story is very interesting, and opens up the door to many thoughts and discussions about pre-determination, free-will and love that endures ""beyond the bounds of time"" (to quote the back cover), I couldn't help but notice that Henry has... no personality. Everything about him hinges on his temporal displacement problem, his character is not developed any further than that! We know he runs, that he is a good cook, that he's a punk-enthusiastic librarian (which I admit is a sexy combination) and that the relationship with his dad is strained... and that's all. So Clare falling all over herself for him just feels sort of random.Speaking of Clare, I suppose families like hers, who dress in formal attire for dinner and have servants, are still a thing in a few places, but it added to my feeling that writing this story was really a huge projection of the author's personal fantasies. Not to mention that she is also terribly underdeveloped: red-headed artists who have been emotionally damaged by their mothers are kind of a dime-a-dozen in romance novels. And then of course there's the tiny problem that her entire life is determined by meeting and falling in love with Henry (when she's six...), meaning she never really has any kind of agency, which bothers me... But it wasn't until she got obsessed with having a baby (a naturally conceived one, because adopting would be ""fake"", whatever the fuck that means) that I started actively disliking her. And they say its the ones who choose to be childless that are selfish...So much name-dropping! Of books, musicians, architects, exotic dishes!! We get the hint: Audrey Niffenegger is cultured and sophisticated. It makes a perfect example of ""telling, not showing"", but ineffective because if you don't know the references, you have no idea what's going on. This will either make you feel dumb or super smart, I guess. Add to that a rather average kind of prose with mostly unnatural sounding dialogue and you get and easy to read, ""meh"" novel that starts out very promising but doesn't really push the envelope in any way. I thought it was a good book until I really started to think about it. River Song's story is more interesting.",18,0.9985,0.085,0.716,0.2,0.6186658629696606,NEGATIVE,0.9989
89,130675718,11/14/2010,3.0,"The last thing this book needs is another review, so I will just share some brief thoughts.I’m struggling a little to determine a rating for this book, and I find myself thinking of concept vs. execution. I liked the concept of the plot and structure of this book, but I found the execution lacking.The Time Traveler’s Wife is told from the alternate viewpoints of Henry and his wife, Clare. Unfortunately, there is absolutely no distinction between their voices. By necessity, each passage identified who was narrating, otherwise it would have been very difficult to determine.I am also intrigued as to the title of the novel. I had expected this novel would explore the character of Clare and provide insight into the effects of loving someone who disappears in time without notice or reason. As it was, the title character was singularly underdeveloped. We never got to really know Clare. She was defined by her love for Henry and, to a lesser extent, her art. That was it. We received no exploration of her emotions or state of mind, no insight or understanding of her character at all, and certainly no growth.In fact, on reflection, most of the secondary characters were stereotypical cardboard cut-outs. Henry was the only character we really got to know in any detail, and even then, great chunks were missing and inconsistencies were not explored. Most significantly, we never got to see Henry fall in love with Clare after he first meets her. It just was.Which probably leads me to another concern I had with the execution. Everything was told, not shown, so it was difficult to feel any real connection to the characters.So, while I really did like the story being told, I also felt that this book was a missed opportunity. What could have been a powerfully moving novel, became interesting in an almost detached way. The ending was sad, but my emotions were engaged as a result of my own imagination rather than solely through the experience provided by the book.3.5 stars, but it could have been so much better.

In some ways, it reminded me of the old Quantum Leap show. Henry is the time traveller, Clare is suffering lover/wife. This is an incredible love story and a tragic one. I really loved it.

It also takes place in Chicago — a place where I went to college and lived for several years. So for the Time Traveler’s Wife I knew all of the landmarks in the book. One major obvious difference between books is that the Time Traveler’s Wife has no real villains unless you count the boyfriend duck taped to the tree. The lack of an antagonist is quite unusual With its many short chapters it is neither a polished nor a consistent drama. The dialogue, while good, does not leave much space for narration. So I found myself moving quickly to find out what happens. It was that kind of book where the writing was generally not so captivating, with some exceptions like the letter from Henry to Clare near the end of the book that was very touching. The story did grow on me, probably because the relationship between Clare and Henry stays strong and continued throughout the whole book and the protagonists were generally likable. There were a lot of weird threads that could have derailed the plot but never did. Yet there were a few disconnects that always come up in time travel books.

93,2140889981,10/09/2017,1.0,"Hey ho, let’s go! This is the first book I have ever given one star to. Part of that is purely my own fault. I asked if anyone had any recommendations for romance on a different website and this is the only recommendation that I received. So I decided to go for it knowing fully well that science fiction is not a genre that I enjoy. Nor do I like sad books. (This seemed sad the whole way through.) And here we are! Not surprised at all that I did not enjoy this book and spent 90% of it bored out of my mind! This review is going to have spoilers.For much of this book I kept on zoning out because the author would give ridiculously long descriptions of silly things like what Henry bought at the grocery store. Sure, list a couple of items, that would be a nice glimpse into the characters and their every day life. But, for god’s sake, do not list fifty regular grocery items that mostly everybody buys. Or go on and on and on about stuff that Henry does at the library or every step of the process Clare goes through for her art. That is just too much. You lost me long ago. Please move on.None of the description really gave insight into how the characters were feeling, either. Well, I guess there were little things here and there, but there just wasn’t enough. And there wasn’t enough about their emotions when it really counted. I did not like how POC characters were treated in this book at all! They felt like caricatures who were only there to serve the two main characters. You’re telling me that these characters only exist for their lives to revolve around these two main characters and their families? I think this was made worse by the audiobook, so this could just be my personal opinion. The narrators kept on doing obnoxious voices that seemed vaguely racist and it irked me. I wanted better for the side characters, they just weren’t treated right. I really didn’t like how mental illness and suicide was treated as well. There was one character, Ingrid, who dated Henry and was brushed off as attention seeking because she had overdosed and attempted suicide so many times. And the main reason she ends up killing herself is because Henry married Clare instead. She was treated as a villain near the end and it was really upsetting. Also, Henry was creepy af. I think we were supposed to start liking him somewhere along the way, but he started out creepy and he remained creepy and I never liked him. By the end, the reader is supposed to sympathize with him, but I just couldn’t. I didn’t like how he basically took advantage of Clare. Honestly, she deserved better. She wasn’t a super likable character, but she was still a lot better than Henry. When he was out of the picture I liked the story a lot better and I’m (pretty) sure that’s not supposed to be the case. And she was still such a bland character. Her whole life revolved around Henry and worrying about Henry and waiting for Henry. Girl, calm down, he is nothing special. She didn’t even have a chance to enjoy her own life because she was told from the time that she was really young that she was going to marry this creepy man.The fact that she loses her virginity to him when she is eighteen and he is in his forties is so gosh darn creepy! Is anyone else creeped out by that? It can’t just be me!Literally expresses exactly what kept going through my mind throughout the entire book whenever Henry showed up to bother Clare. Clare and Ingrid deserved better.Perhaps the worst thing is that this book was so long! I feel like I wasted so much valuable October reading time forcing myself to get through it. I had already bought the audiobook, so I felt like I needed to finish it just so I hadn’t “wasted” my money. But I could have lived my whole life without reading this and been perfectly content. Plus, this book simply made me depressed. It went past putting me into a reading funk and just made me purely depressed and made me question why I read books at all. That is all. In the words of Henry at the end of this book: “I am very tired, myself.” I am off to find something better to read that will remind me why I love to read again.Edit: I forgot to mention the fact that this book sends a damaging message about adoption and the idea that an adopted baby is a ""fake"" baby.

94,2407796090,04/07/2019,3.0,"So though I thought the ending was quite good, I had some issues with certain aspects of this book. All in all I saw love as a dangerous thing to be in since it seems to not work out for anyone that is in ""love"" in this one. And the first part of the book takes a while to get going. It helps that Audrey Niffenegger takes the time to include headers that show the date and age of Henry and Clare so you can keep things straight. A very strong three stars. We have a young girl Clare who is 6 that meets a 40 year old man named Henry. Henry is naked and tells Clare that he is a time traveler. He will see her repeatedly while she is growing up and without Clare realizing it, she's met the man she will one day marry. The book then follows Clare and Henry through the years until they finally meet up in her present and then walks through their marriage and the difficulties with Henry time traveling. The book speaks of loneliness throughout and even when Clare is near Henry, she's constantly bracing herself for him to leave at any moment. Clare was a bit hard to take once some things are revealed. No spoilers, but she's a terrible friend. She loves Henry and that's all she cares about. She doesn't worry about the issues they will have with him time traveling. She loves him and is going to be with him no matter what. Though Clare's art is important to her, it often feels secondary to her love of Henry and her inability to say no to him. Why Clare tells certain people about Henry's time travel baffles me too. I would have thought she was a liar and stayed away from her. Henry is pretty much a jerk I thought. He is rude and sarcastic though he loves Clare. He ends up becoming enmeshed in her life and becomes friends with her friends though one wonders why when he realizes what is going on with the character of Gomez. We hear about Henry's love of books, but I was pretty shocked that he barely seems to read. I guess if one is time traveling, you are just focused on not being killed when you pop up naked with no money or clothing. He and his father don't have a relationship since his father is still mourning his dead mother and has no love left to give Henry. Henry seems obsessive about sex with Clare (and she does about him too) that one wonders if these two ever had conversations after they meet in the present day. The secondary characters have their own tales of love which doesn't speak too highly of it we have lost love (Henry's father and the character of Kimy), broken hearts (Clare's mother), obsessive love (Gomez) and unrequited love (Charisse and Ingrid). This whole book screams out that love that is not painful is not worth having. The writing at times is lovely and others just choppy. I think once we get past a certain time period (no spoilers) we are just waiting for the inevitable to happen. The flow isn't that great to start with either. I think some things could have been cut, but that's just me.The setting of the book moves from the 1960s to the year 2050 something. I can't recall right now. We have Clare and Henry mostly in Illinois though she is born and raised in Michigan with Henry of course doing pop by's here and there. The ending though was sad, but it moved me.

There was one scene in this book which affected me particularly deeply. I didn't lose a husband, I lost a child, but there is one scene in which I was reminded of a poignant moment in my own life. I was on a plane with my family a year after the death of my son. My four year old daughter was on the seat next to me sleeping. I had my left arm around her and was absently stroking her cheek. Without awareness, I must have been physically reminded by my daughter of my deceased son at that age, and it was as if I was holding him again. For just a few moments I experienced the fullness of being that I used to have, the emptiness was gone for a few moments, and I was able to cry in a very deep and healing way. I think that this book probably has an affect on anyone who has ever loved someone else very deeply. And it makes one crave that deep love also. You can't just love someone because you want to or ought to, it is a gift. My opinion of the book is that it is phenomenal. ",16,0.9461,0.063,0.803,0.134,0.556863354037267,POSITIVE,0.9999

But that's just a backdrop and this is not a piece of science fiction. The characters are cliched, the constant Clare-Henry interactions are annoying and you couldn't care less about them or their problems when their 'love' is so obviously half-baked. And you pretty much lose interest when they don't seem to have a life or purpose outside their relationship. But this is all in the first half.

The Morning After
Assuming the premise of the book is known.
From a purely emotional viewpoint


“Don't you think it's better to be extremely happy for a short while, even if you lose it, than to be just okay for your whole life?” 
I'm shattered and ecstatic at the same time. Have you ever felt that after reading a book? Like after you stop crying, you will still feel the sweetness of the good left? Well, it has happened now for me. The truth is I've been avoiding this book for quite some time now because I didn't want to put myself through the pain knew would be there, but then, I just figured I did want to try it. And I'm so, so glad.This was an AMAZINGLY beautiful love story, IMHO. Unusually written, through the different times, while Henry time travels in and out of Clare's life. It's strange that, when you think about it. I thought it would be weird, for a 33-year-old Henry who has already married Clare to be meeting her 6-year-old self. And it is unusual, but it is all so, so great. And we can see the love that connects them.If you're afraid of getting lost or confused... It is possible, but we mostly follow the story chronologically, Clare-onologically, I mean. Henry follows a different schedule. So, we see her grow up knowing Henry is in her life to stay. At first for her he is an angel, then a guardian, a friend, and eventually more. And it is not easy loving him. Because he always leaves where she cannot follow, and there's a lot of danger in appearing in another time, buck naked in front of who knows who, forced to defend yourself, and so she knows and worries and misses him. And then they finally meet in both their Presents and they are together. And they continue to love and hurt and they're together through everything.It's all one big puzzle. And it's great fitting together the pieces of time and the travel and Henry and Clare's life.I loved them both so, so much. And everything they suffered hurt, God so much. But the ending, God I know it couldn't have been different, and the foreshadowing was heavy, but I wanted a miracle. there I said it. And not getting it hurt all the more. Just to think, all the waiting left to be done. And the last, of Clare's POV?!? Geez. If I wasn't crying by then, I would've there.I did expect to see more of the years in between. To see what happened with her. (view spoiler)[Did she remarry, have kids, WHAT? What did she do but wait for him and love him? Was she truly fading, remembering, living that way? What about Alba? (hide spoiler)]All in all, as I said a great, complex, addictive, original love story and a great love, too. But see that quote up there. Too prophetic. And I did know. But I totally get why a lot of people love it. I do, too. Even as i wish for a different ending.
From a purely logical viewpoint
After the emotional turmoil passed(mostly) I started remembering this also occupied my mind during the read. As in: Dude, time travel?!? Paradoxes, two Henrys talking to each other and so on.And the question, what came first? You see Henry time traveled to little Clare when he was in his thirties after the wedding. So she met him and came to love him before they met in real time. And when they did, because she had already loved him they came to be together and she gave him the dates of the travels and told him what happens. So, did they have a choice. Their love is like a loop that has no beginning, because it is always in someone's past. Speaking of:the issue of changing the past, the future, whatever. With time, I came to like the way it was explained here. Whenever you time travel what happens is in someone's past. Say TT Henry meets little Henry and they talk. It is in Henry's past and he remembers it so TT Henry acts accordingly. Or, it is in someone's past so TT Henry can't change it. And if he goes to the future than the event will be in his past. Capisce? If not, blame me. I try to explain, and may do it muddily but it is clear when Henry explains it to his kid self.As to how he travels. Well, I liked how everything was discussed and interwoven here, theology, physics, biology, philosophy and in the end explained in a way I found sufficient.Are there things that bug me and perceived logic-holes? Yes. But that, compared to the amazingly written emotional aspect isn't that relevant to me. All I wanted was for things to make sense to me. And so they did, and I could completely focus on Clare and Henry.There are some quotes below, because I was too absorbed to pick some out myself while reading.One other thing The name of the book is fitting, IMO. Although the POV of Henry and Clare are constantly changing, the book follows her road(with brief time irregularities) and I sympathize with her for forever waiting for him and it takes a great woman to love a man that's not close to normal. I loved him, too, but it is always more difficult for the ones left behind. ",15,0.9995,0.068,0.741,0.19,0.5443192325473879,POSITIVE,0.9999
100,114079422,07/28/2010,2.0,"Reader vs Time Traveler’s Wife: The Case of the Time Travelling Romance Science Fiction NovelThe novel opens with Clare (20) meeting Henry (28). But the strange thing is…she’s known him since she was six! That’s because Henry has a genetic condition which has him floating through time, and his future self had met Clare’s childhood. The story progresses to show Clare first meeting Henry, her childhood, their marriage, and their struggles having children.I Liked:Audrey Niffenegger makes an unconventional (to me) use of the first person. Both protagonists—Clare and Henry—tell their story in first person present. It gives a sense of immediacy to their story, and a personal touch.Henry’s story, in particular, was very touching, very moving. At times, I greatly pitied him, time hopping back to his mother’s death, never able to stay with his wife in the present, having a poor relationship with his father, and trying to find a cure for his disability.I was vastly impressed at how well Niffenegger wove the timelines. Henry time jumps all over the place, yet to my eyes, Niffenegger kept her dates straight, knew exactly where she was going and what Henry and Clare did what and when.The ages of Henry and Clare at the beginning of each section were very helpful.I also liked how the audiobook employs two narrators: a man to read Henry’s portions and a woman to read Clare’s. This helps me keep them straight. Also, both voices were very enjoyable to listen to, and Clare’s narrator did a decent job of speaking for Henry.I Didn’t Like:The Case for Clare Being a Mary Sue:Point 1: Long, flowing, red hairPoint 2: Coming from a wealthy, privileged family where she has servants in the 1970’s & 1980’s (not like the 1870’s & 1880’s)Point 3: Growing up never having to work and getting to do art, while her fellow art students are starving or barely able to do artPoint 4: Wanting a baby and after six tries, finally having a childPoint 5: Angsting over a crime she didn’t exactly commit: “cheating” on Henry by sleeping with Gomez (no regret and shame for sleeping with her best friend, Charisse’s, boyfriend), when A) she wasn’t married or dating him at the time, B) Henry fooled around a lot more than she did and C) it wasn’t her fault to begin with (she was drunk).Point 6: Everyone loves her and wants to sleep with her (Henry, Gomez, multiple potential boyfriends both in high school and college).Point 7: Being an amazing artist, having her own art exhibit, and being oohed and aahed by everyone.The Case for Flat Secondary Characters:Point 1: Gomez, described mostly by his chain smoking addiction and the fact he’s an anarchist (I didn’t even know he was a lawyer until the end!).Point 2: Celia, black lesbian who has a new lover each week and ends all dialogue with “Sista”.Point 3: Ingrid, who is messed up because she loved Henry and is unable to move on from himPoint 4: Cherisse, who plays backseat to her boyfriend, GomezPoint 5: Mark, who is a potheadPoint 6: Alicia, who is a quirky cellistPoint 7: Richard, who is a grieving, alcoholic violinistPoint 8: Kimmy, who speaks in white-interpreted Korean stereotypesPoint 9: Edna/Nell, who speaks in white-interpreted Black stereotypes, ending most dialogue with something akin to “Chile”Point 10: Kendrick, who is the nerdy, single-minded scientist, having no ethical concerns, and will stop at nothing to find “The Solution”The Case for Unnecessary Details:Point 1: Play by play description of a pool gamePoint 2: Play by play description and instructions on how to play Gomez’s modified MonopolyPoint 3: A list of all 1970’s & 1980’s punk bandsPoint 4: The 9/11 Tower CrashPoint 5: Clare drawing her childPoint 6: Clare and Henry talking about how much sex they have and if that’s normalPoint 7: Every single sexual encounter Clare and Henry havePoint 8: Detailed descriptions of Clare creating “wings”The Case for Out of Character Moments:Point 1: Clare using the c-word to describe her anatomyPoint 2: Two teenaged Henry’s sleeping with each otherThe Case for a Lack of Chemistry/Sex-Based Romance:Point 1: The first time they meet, they end their date in Henry’s apartment, in his bedPoint 2: Clare and Henry can’t spend two days at Clare’s parents place without humpingPoint 3: Clare sneaks off to bed Henry before her wedding on the very wedding dayThe Case for Being Pretentious:Point 1: Flipping back and forth between time periodsPoint 2: References to music and theaterPoint 3: Passages in French and GermanPoint 4: Poetry readings during childbirthDialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:Heavy. F-bombs galore, at least one instance of the c-word, loads of sh**, he** & da**.A lot. Clare and Henry go at each other with little encouragement.Clare has five miscarriages. The results are nasty.Overall:In conclusion, this court finds The Time Traveler’s Wife to be guilty of pretentious “artsy” book syndrome. While the novel has an interesting concept and flirting with the idea of free will and predestination, it doesn’t take the concept far enough and instead flounders with a lack of chemistry between the protagonists and completely superfluous details. 2/5",15,0.9884,0.056,0.846,0.098,0.4792452071737785,POSITIVE,1.0

Awesome book in my opinion especially that I have a thing for time traveling. I love it the story is interesting even though it's confusing at first because the story is not chronological and the author would just arrange each story by any timeline (past, future, present).I also love the characters Henry (librarian, time traveler) and Clare (artist) and of course their daughter Alba (also time traveler). It's just sad though and I'm not expecting it that in the end the story became depressing.I also love the part wherein Henry saw Clare writing the date in one of her work and Henry says that I saw in the future that it has no date in it, so you should not write the date. And Clare wanted to somehow break the rules of what should happen and still write the date on it and say that, ""What is the big deal if I write the date or not?"" Henry kind of scares her that maybe something terrible happen like a war or something if they kind of change something even if it's a small thing. So when Henry goes in the future again he looks for the drawing and was surprise that it does not have a date on it and he asks Clare since he knows that in the past they decided to put a date on it, then what the heck happen and Clare says that she was kind of scared about the war thing so when he left she decided to chipped off the date. It just felt clever to me that somehow the past, present and future are interrelated in ways that you can't even change it, even the future. It's just whatever happens you can't change it anymore.And also the part wherein he time travels and he went to Ingrid's apartment and when he asks Ingrid the date and he knows that this is the day wherein Ingrid killed herself and he thought that maybe he can change that, but the inevitable happens and Ingrid killed herself in front of him.This is just a great book if you love time traveling and dejavu.",14,0.7147,0.066,0.858,0.076,0.4622395833333333,NEGATIVE,0.6902
105,38125088,11/19/2008,1.0,"Ok, first off, I didn't finish the book. I did get to page 164, and oddly enough, I had to force myself to put the book down. Why the one-star then? Because this book (what I read of it) was awful. As for forcing myself to put it down, I kept hoping it would improve, especially as the story began to veer away from Clare as a child, which I found boring. I found the the portion of the story where Henry meets Clare as a kid 1)completely ridiculous (really? a 6 yo is going to cooperate with a naked man in her backyard??) 2) gross. In any case, once the story started incorporating punk rock bands, I was intrigued. I know many reviewers were off-put by Niffenegger's use of ""hipster"" bands (I don't find them to be hipster at all, but whatever), but it didn't bother me. Sadly, the Violent Femmes and Smoking Popes could not save this book for me.I think time travel is a totally cool thing to think about, but it doesn't work in fiction for me...at least not when it's a ""genetic"" disorder. I prefer my time travel via a machine and physics. Not some gene deletion or whatever afflicts Henry. As a student of biology and science, it's TOO unbelievable...and just stupid. It's totally illogical. At least if physics were used...maybe they were and I missed it. I realize this is a love story and time travel was secondary, but I found its implausibility too annoying to ignore. The format of Henry: blah blah blah and Clare: wah wah wah was distracting. Clare was BORING. B-O-R-I-N-G. At page 164, I hadn't learned enough about Henry to fully form an opinion, other than how the EFF could he keep a job if he kept disappearing??Plus side: The sex and the swearing didn't bother me.

Structurally the piece is interesting, since it's non-linear and episodic, but overall I thought the book couldn't really hold it together. The jumps, while holding to the books overall concept (time travel dur) were at first engading, if not slightly gimmicky.I think by the end the characterization, initial concept, and just the heavy-handed fated-doomed-romance plot left me feeling sort of exhausted. I couldn't maintain sympathy for the characters, and I wasn't even sure I bought the romance aspect of it. If anything The Time Traveler's Wife is a kind of parable about co-dependent relationships and the time-traveling is a sort of stand in for abuse or drug addiction, reaffirming the hetero-norm, patient long-suffering wife-enabler role in conventional romance.

I continued reading this because I wanted to see how it would end up, and because I wanted to complete it for Tome Topple. And I found the ending to be... anticlimactic.So this review is mostly going to be things that I didn't like, which I'll put in a list format with spoiler sections. Also: triggers in this book for cheating relationships. 1. The romance. It may sound silly to say that I found something that revolves around time travel to be unbelievable, because of course time travel is unbelievable. But it was. It manages to combine the tropes of lifelong love and insta-love at the same time. (view spoiler)[ In different ways, both Henry and Clare are groomed to love each other, by each other, without there being any natural falling in love. Which I found almost creepy. Also, I know that when Henry is seeing Clare as a child and teenager that she will eventually be his wife, and her present self is his wife. But the romance between a 40 something man and a teenage girl was still just unnerving to me.  (hide spoiler)]2. I love time travel, but this book made it look ridiculous. Which I guess it kind of is... but still. Disappointing. There were too many times where Henry's time traveling (or something fishy) should have been really obvious to various characters, and yet they don't seem to realize anything is going on. 3. We're often spoiled for what's going to happen in each character's future because of the time traveling, which made me care a lot less when the event actually happened. (view spoiler)[ Henry's death? It had been spoken of so many times by the time that it actually happened that I just felt indifferent, and just wanted it to be over with. I'm the kind of person who doesn't enjoy a book as much if the surprises are taken away during the reading experience.  (hide spoiler)]4. Random unexplained bits of Henry's personality and behavior ((view spoiler)[ like him being chaotic and ruining people's lives, or enjoying violence too much  (hide spoiler)]). There were things that he would do or express when he was young that seemed to just suddenly go away when he was older, without any real explanation for the personality change.5. Gomez. I hate Gomez, and knew it from the moment he first showed up in the book. I don't think it's cute or protective when male characters are possessive of female characters. (view spoiler)[ Though I was disappointed in Clare for sleeping with Gomez twice (once when he was dating Charisse, and another time after they were married), I was completely disgusted by Gomez himself for cheating on his partner, not seeming to feel remorse for it, not telling her, and just sticking with her while being in live with her friend. It made me SO MAD. And Henry and Gomez are supposedly good friends? I don't get that. Gomez was waiting around for Henry to die so he could have a go at Clare. Good Lord.  (hide spoiler)]6. I know this is romance, but I hate erotic language SO MUCH. (view spoiler)[ I was less than 20 pages into the book and reading words like ""cock,"" and ridiculous similes about erections. I just couldn't deal with it.  (hide spoiler)] 7. Stereotyped language usage for characters of color. Enough said.8. Too much name dropping and description. Normally I would love descriptive writing, but for this book it was just distracting. There are CONSTANT references to street names and artists and French phrases that I don't know of, and that (in this book) I did not care to look up. 9. Privilege. As a newlywed myself (I got married last year), I understand getting accustomed to day to day life, figuring out who does what chores, etc. But for Henry and Clare, apparently ""neither of [them are] willing to vacuum so [they] hire a cleaning service."" OK, what?!? He's a librarian, she's an artist. Where are they getting the dough to hire a someone to clean their place? Is this because of Clare's privileged family background? Probably.10. Clare. (view spoiler)[ My intense dislike of Clare really got started when they were trying to conceive a child. I can understand how traumatizing a series of miscarriages must be, and I can understand wanting to have a child anyway despite the risk. But then there comes the conversation they have after her fourth miscarriage, when Henry suggests that they adopt a child. And Clare's response? ""But that would be fake. It would be pretending. I'm sick of pretending. We pretend all the time. I want to really do this."" This made me very, very angry. I am interested in adopting (and birthing) children of my own. I know people who were adopted and have adopted. These comments and this mindset actually made me sick, and it was at this point that I realized I couldn't really enjoy Clare as a character.

In other words, one of those annoying hipster Hornby-eque protags, except that he is chronologically displaced, he has a genetic quirk that makes his suddenly leap back or forth in time at times of great stress, or just in general for no real reason. It's also the story of Clare, impossibly beautiful and talented paper-making artist who meets Henry at various points in her life from the ages of 8 and 18 as he keeps travelling back in time to convince her that they are to marry. Finally, they meet in their own shared time line and marry.There are moments when it seems interesting - mostly when Henry is meeting his own younger selves and they talk about the meaning of it all, wither freewill & c. But once the love story takes over, it is like every terrible romantic movie ever made rolled into one. There's the awkward Xmas with the wealthy parents of the girl. I thought I was reading a novelisation of Meet The Parents when Clare's white bread family finds out Henry is half Jewish. There's the broken old father finding new hope in life thanks to his wonderful new daughter in law. The cool friends. They go to a Violent Femmes concert and dance and Clare confronts Henry's ex to jump-cuts of lyric scraps. Their struggle to have a child against all the odds. Clare's nightmares after losing her mother, after her miscarriages. Henry's nightmares of his penis falling off after he loses his feet in a terrible accident. Has Audrey Niffenegger never met a cliche she didn't love?This is one of those books that is so absorbed in giving the main characters complex personas and biogs that it forgets to give them souls. I couldn't care for or relate to a man who is supposed to have lived before marriage, in a flat that was a sofa, a bed and 4000 books, just like I used to. That's quite an achievement on the author's part and a mark of how little her characters came to life in a manner that made sense given all the attributes she attached to them. Her characters are so nondescript under all the minutiae that one can barely distinguish between Henry and Clare's first-person narratives, which keep alternating throughout the novel. Note to Niffenegger: If you can't pull off different narrative voices just write in in third-person omniscient next time, okay?Most of all, the story becomes creepier the more you think about it. How do we even know that Henry and Clare would ever have married if Henry hadn't brainwashed her into loving him throughout her childhood and adolescence? He makes Humbert Humbert seem like Mother Teresa once you accept the possibility that he has simply obsessed over a woman he once met, time-travelled to her past and manipulated her into becoming his wife. Go back and re-read this book with this scenario in mind. It makes incredible amounts of sense. A supremely unsavoury narrative of predation and mind-rape hidden in what people including the author seem to imagine is a love story. Better yet, don't even bother reading it the first time.To my extreme relief, my wife later told me that she didn't like the book at all, but wanted me to draw my own conclusions. She's probably considerably more of a sadist than I realised at first, but at least neither of us is a time-traveller.To sum up: Borges once said there is no need to write 500-page novels whose core idea can be summed up in a few minutes.

115,16167584,02/23/2008,4.0,"As a child, I pronounced myself a student of déjà vu, savoring those brisk, warm moments when reality, time, and intent seemed to briefly confound one another. I loved that feeling of having been somewhere I clearly wasn't, or longing to be something I clearly wouldn't be. If you know what I'm talking about, you will love this book.Despite all the things I could criticize of The Time Traveler's Wife, I frankly refuse. And though I must warn my more conservative friends of the open sexual content of the book, I willingly suspend such criticism in my own mind. Why the self-deception? Because never before have I discovered a tale that can so forcefully and completely evoke the magic of déjà vu as this book does.This is a tale that beckons from a corner of your psyche. It whispers, ""what might be?"" and ""what might have been?"" in all the right ways. It makes you simultaneously abhor the dreaded linearity of your own life yet sparks your daily walk with a dash of surreality that suffices. Do I effuse too much? Perhaps. But if you know what I'm talking about, you will love this book.Afraid to see how such a deftly nonlinear story can be retold in the relatively linear cinematic form, I admit I am nervous about the movie. So if you have seen the movie and asked yourself, ""what was that about?"" Promptly ignore everything you learned and take this drastic step: Read The Book! It will transport you, it may even make you read from start to finish in one sitting, wrapping your arms around your sleeping spouse when you finish at 2am to cherish that she is still there, linearly waiting for you to join her.The second read preserved the magic of the first, a rare thing for me. I paid more attention to technique, became more painfully aware of the uberpreppiness of the Goethe-quoting ex-punk at the center of the story, but forgave all, hungrily lapping up the moments I knew were coming but anticipated nonetheless, my own second-time omniscience giving me a tickling sense of time-slippage myself.The moral quandary presented by the book and debated by many reviewers is of little consideration. This is a work of fiction, spectacularly so. This dilemma: is it appropriate for a man who meets his wife in the future visit her past, pre-prubescent self, possibly stirring in her and him sexual desires that are likely to create confusing (and plot-hinging) interpersonal outcomes? There is no answer to the question because it isn't possible.Yet, oh, that we lived in a universe where we seriously needed to debate that question. Such a universe in which time slipping is a reality would be one I would gladly join.Again, if you know what I mean, you will love this book.NOTE: This is an update after my second read, August 2009; first read in 2006, the original brief review is below.An admittedly guilty pleasure, this book scores with me because it presents my favorite oxymoronic genre: the time travel romance. Just like the more traditional Somewhere in Time, this book crafts a love that yearns to connect beyond the boundaries of time, yet creates a thoroughly modern take on the mechanisms of time travel.

For I finally possess a real song. Certainly, I like that a first-time author pulled that first book magic, worked that very magic, where the book is both magical and successful. Good for Her. The story behind the story of this novel is rather a charming one. This is Niffenegger's debut novel. After several rejections, it was published and eventually became a runaway hit, in spite of an irritating cover, I might add. After being spurned, then tasting that fruit, she would go on to secure a five million dollar advance for her next book. Heartening, right?The movie sucked though, despite Rachael McAdams staring in it. Of this book though. Ah, of love that always leaves and the love that just won't stay. What I do love about this book is that I liked it even before I started traveling through time, before becoming a time traveler myself. Though I could never bring back the time.

In my honest opinion - the movie is better. It’s more romantic. It flows nicely. It’s beautiful.

Some of it was a little weird for me. On the other hand - this book was also beautifully written. In terms of the love story and time travel. Anyone who knows me knows I am in love with time travel which is why I love the movie so much. I think the way the time jumps were written were so well done and not at all as confusing as what I thought it would be. I did enjoy this. Don’t get me wrong.

Clare's very state of being is determined by Henry - because he told her so (and the Catholic Church lurks behind this). She has an idealised, romantic view of him and he is a controlling entity who knows her future but refuses to tell her about it. He is presented as unconditionally loving (is he, in fact, God?) but there's a clue in that term; unconditional means without conditions. Unconditionally controlling? The oxymorons are flying like confetti. Selfish pig, if you ask me!The author seems to be utterly confused by her own premises for time travel.

And I liked the concept of Time Travel part – like vicious cycle of forward backward and so on. So, I picked up The Time Traveler’s book. Henry – (first meeting in the book he was 36 and then 41 or 43 or 28 or.. :) ) He is so accustomed to be living on metaphysical trapeze where we as human tend to enjoy solid ground Clare – knows since the age of six and Henry was 36, whom she gonna date, married there was a cuteness when she believed Henry really a time traveler. Both the characters are wonderful, ""real"" people with strengths and flaws, generally lovers often believe themselves crossed by fate or by time but in this novel they have more reasons than most. The things which I like about this book -	The second part of the part was quite hooked, at times funny while Clare and henry were getting married and they were trying to hold him for the moment. How the time travel part could have been avoided during that time.-	Totally blown and swayed by the ending I am sure there will be many who have cried while reading Henry later. -	I liked the part when Henry tries to explain Clare even if I am not here don’t think I am some dimension or void which has been created and can’t be fulfilled. Although that was not something new but the way it was executed I found it different and fresh. -	 At times I so want to time travel, at least I will get to know whom I will get married in future :P-	Casual and continuous time loops, quantum mechanics, photos, speed of light, how it feels to be living outside of the time constraints when human are subject to live in time. The things which I didn’t like about this book -	Too much emphasis on the adolescence tail of Clare, all about what her domestic help cooks n all, favorite dishes-	Abortion episodes, it would have been better if there were more details about the DNA, genes replacement part, basically science. The teenage part were filled with 100 pages whereas the science part was tried to cover in-	On the science part, I feels this books lacks research.-	At times too dramatic -	600 pages were way too much for this type of story. I am sure hard editing would have easily chucked out 100-150 pages. The things which enlightens me –-	About book - The chronicles of Nawat Wuzeer Hyderabad a book made by human skin Though didn’t find any results on google.-	About the Chinese Poet Wu chen.The certainty about the future gives both of them a quasi-religious sense that their lives are already mapped out, and the time of their deaths already written.

The writing is implicitly exquisite, and the plot is absolutely unique.I bet everybody knows Henry DeTamble and Clare Abshire's love story and the miseries they share, since Henry clearly can't stay in one place in one time. However, despite all these praises, this book just wasn't enough for me.Why?(1)The plot was interesting, but still I was bored, that it took me seven days to finish it. And when I say seven days, that is absolutely slow for me, since I am a voracious reader.(2)There were some parts of the book that disturbed me. One example is when 35 year old Henry visited 13 year old Clare and noticed her 
""breasts and legs and hips, all newly minted.""
(3)The mention of cunt and cock, felt pornographic for me, this made me uncomfortable. It's not that I'm a prig, but the aforementioned words seemed inappropriate in this book, since Henry and Clare's love story was decent.(4)I also appreciate Audrey Niffenegger's desire to sound really smart, using: monoaminergic antagonist blah blah. That does sound smart, however, I caught one detail wrong. The book says that agranulocytosis is the destruction of the body's ability to make white blood cells. granular white blood cells - neutrophils, eosinophils and basophilsagranular white blood cells - lymphocytes and monocytes<-cytosis> - increased cell counttherefore: agranulocytosis is the increased count of agranular white blood cells, mainly lymphocytes and monocytes. thus it could also mean decreased count of granular white blood cells, BUT NOT ALL white blood cells.*If we're talking about the body's inability to make white blood cells, in general, she could have said aplastic anemia instead, where the body fails to make red and white blood cells.(5)Almost everybody knew of Henry's genetic disease but I would it a wonder that he wasn't made into a media freak show. Also, how was he able to keep his job, if he disappears in the middle of his shift and reappears in all his naked glory?(6)Lastly, I failed to sympathize with the characters, which I think is vital for me to appreciate the book.

135,223883439,10/15/2011,3.0,"Contrary to what the title of this book implies to any sensible reader, this book is not about River Song. Disappointing, I know.I ended up liking this book much more than I expected. To be perfectly honest, I did not want to like The Time Traveler’s Wife. It’s a popular book, a “pop lit” book that has appropriated something so dear to science fiction and turned it into a gimmick for a romance. I had resolved to read it so I would know what others are talking about, and be armed with reasons why I dislike it. But that didn’t happen.Instead, I found myself entranced by the way Audrey Niffenegger has ruthlessly pursued this idea of two lovers literally out of sync with each other. She is quick to establish consistent rules about Henry’s time travelling, and there is a singular pleasure to watching the timeline wrap around itself as we see an event Clare witnessed as a young girl from the eyes of the much older, temporally-displaced Henry. In short, Niffenegger takes what could have been a gimmick and, through an obvious effort and maybe even some talent, turns it into a great story.That’s not to say the time travel in this story is perfect. After all, the reason that Henry travels through time unwillingly is kind of silly—it’s genetic. As if there are certain alleles that somehow cause our bodies to opt out of the space-time continuum. On the surface it’s an intriguing premise, and Niffenegger at least tries to make it sound scientific. Nothing but Henry’s body travels with him, so he always arrives nude—as he remarks, it’s a good thing he doesn’t wear glasses. But how does this phenomenon know what is part of Henry’s body? If it’s anything with the time-travelling DNA, then that would leave behind his hair, not to mention all those lovely bacteria on and inside our bodies that keep us alive and healthy. Any way you slice it, Niffenegger’s explanations for Henry’s condition are implausible—but her attempts at plausibility are sincere enough that I’ll be generous and call this science fiction, not fantasy. It’s such a fine line!Once we grant Henry his miracle exception to hop through time, we can finely immerse ourselves in the story—or stories. We get to see both Henry and Clare’s perspectives of events, sometimes of the same events; sometimes we even see the perspective from two different Henrys when they meet up. This is particularly fascinating during the first part of the novel, when Henry recounts the first time he can remember time-travelling, and all the times his older self taught him survival tactics: pickpocketing, fighting, etc. (Randomly materializing in the nude is a dangerous hobby.) Niffenegger comes up with all of these interesting consequences of Henry’s singular ability, both for Henry and for the woman he is destined to love.Clare meets Henry when she is young (six, I think), but he is already in his forties. Henry won’t meet the contemporary Clare until he is 28 and she is 21, so for the first two decades of her life, Clare must content herself with Henry’s sporadic visits to a meadow near her parents’ luxurious home. At the very beginning of the story, Henry’s visits to Clare are a little creepy: naked middle-aged man shows up and begins spending quality time with a young girl. Niffenegger lampshades this concern during their first visit, but there is still something problematic about the way Clare essentially imprints upon Henry. It makes one wonder if either of them had any choice in the matter.If there is one deeper theme I’d take away from The Time Traveler’s Wife, it has to be the meditation upon free will: act like you have it, even if you (probably) don’t. Henry talks about how he is unable to change the past, how even when he tries, he feels constrained somehow. (I find the description and explanation rather unsatisfying, but again, credit to Niffenegger for establishing ground rules.) This means that if he sees his older self do something, he is bound to repeat that action when he becomes that person, no matter how hard he tries. If that is the case, it seems to me like Henry’s entire life—and by extension, everyone’s lives—are predestined. Niffenegger doesn’t explore this as explicitly as I would like, but it is fairly well-developed through the course of the plot itself.Henry and Clare’s relationship is in many ways like that of the Doctor and River Song. The older time traveller appears to a young girl and influences her in a big way; she falls in love with him. They continue to meet; he gets younger, and she gets older. They have adventures together out of order. Both The Time Traveler’s Wife and Doctor Who explore how confusing and interesting such a relationship would be, and neither shies away from the fact that it’s very messed up. Henry’s presence during Clare’s formative years essentially means she has little choice but to fall in love with him. Later, she finds the contemporary version of him, showing him her little diary with all the dates of his visits, and tells him they are destined to be together. Sometimes I lament our linear existence, but I have to say, I can see the benefits to having everyone experience events in the same order.The Time Traveler’s Wife is not quite the sappy romance I feared it would be. Henry and Clare’s relationship is, most of the time, genuinely touching. I suppose one could complain about the way Clare eternally pines for Henry, but I think Niffenegger makes it clear that, however the relationship came about in the first place, both of them love each other unconditionally. Still, if it weren’t for the time travelling, the story would be fairly ho-hum and conventional. It’s the unchronological nature of events that rescues this book—that, and occasionally brilliant moments of writing from Niffenegger. I particularly loved the mood she captures when Henry is meeting Clare’s family for the first time, Christmas 1991. The squabbling and bickering feels very real, even if the supporting characters (the oddly stereotypically-dictioned servants) do not.There is only one major thorn in this otherwise pleasant surprise: the ending. Specifically, the last two acts of the book. By this time the novelty of Henry’s time-travelling has worn off, and we are fast approaching the point where something has to give. Nevertheless, I was kind of expecting … I don’t know. Something more than what we get. Something deeper, more meaningful. I’m not going to spoil it, but essentially my problem is that there are no surprises in store for us: it does happen exactly the way Henry tells us it will happen. I wasn’t hoping for a last-minute reprieve, but I put the book down without any sense of being changed for it. And that, to me, is unsatisfying.So I don’t quite think The Time Traveler’s Wife deserves all its accolades, but maybe that’s just me. It’s a good book, one that I enjoyed, and one that I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend to certain people. What could easily have been a poorly-executed gimmick is actually the core of the book. Yet for all the big issues raised by time travel—like free will—this book remains a stubborn biography of two people rather than slipping loose to become something bigger. I was party to the experience of The Time Traveler’s Wife but not really part of the experience.

136,3032407480,12/01/2019,2.0,"This book disappointed and frustrated me. It made me very uncomfortable. Not the good kind of discomfort that makes you think about the world differently, but rather the bad kind when you feel your skin crawl at watching something unfold that feels deeply wrong.I do think the book was aptly named. The story is about Clare (the Time Traveler's Wife), and Clare's life orbits Henry (the Time Traveler). She is not given a name in the title, known only by her relationship to the man who defines her life. And that's a pretty good summary of the entire book. From her childhood where she is groomed by the man she knows she will marry one day - because in fact she already has according to the logic of the book- and throughout her adult life. I can recall only 2 things Clare seems to do for herself in the entire book, and both of those are still swamped with paragraphs of self-flagellation at what Henry might think.The book is also really long for how little plot there is. Scene after scene is described in excruciating detail, but many do little more than reinforce the creepy and problematic dynamic between the apparently romantic pairing. Despite its length there are so many elements that are raised and then forgotten about. Henry has moments of violent rage, described as almost dis-associative, where he beats people up (to death is hinted at, but not confirmed). A side character flags this, and for a few chapters it seems like it might actually be delved into. But then it's dropped. Swept away in a tide of Henry x Clare drama, where Henry shifts bad to being positioned as a tragic romantic hero.I'm well aware this is a beloved book to many, and it was for that reason that I persisted with it. Hoping to see in its conclusion something that would undo my cynicism. But ultimately I was disappointed. ",12,-0.9862,0.163,0.76,0.077,0.6407894736842107,NEGATIVE,1.0

I applaud the author for managing to jump around so much and keep the story together. Why didn't I like it? Henry always appears naked when he time travels because he cannot take anything into and out of time. This means that he appears naked in front of Clare as a child. He is also promiscuous and this is never really dealt with although it obviously bothers Clare. Henry just explains it away but his various partners appear at various interludes in his time travelling and it kind-of ruins the love story. I guess the author was trying to be realistic but it doesn't fit with the ""soul mate"" theme. Henry also commits violent crimes for reasons unknown but the suggestion is that he does it because he can. I ended up disliking him. The book is graphic and has a lot of sex scenes which again tramples on the theme as it's more about the physical relationship between Henry and Clare than their love. I didn't like the idea that Henry could be two versions of himself at the same time and some of the things that happen between the two versions are very weird.

For example, Henry can barely say ""I love you"" to another man, yet he can service himself sexually? The inconsistencies such as this take away. The constant time jumping doesn't always add up if you take all of the events out along a linear time and put them together, which was somewhat frustrating.

Even at the beginning, it took the author about a hundred and seventy pages to explain the rules of Henry's current time traveling so she let the whole beginning of the book coast on the expectation that it would be explained later.It was slightly funny at times so I gave it two Stars, but I am not a fan.

161,15353151,02/13/2008,5.0,"I have been meaning to write a review for this the last few days and every time I start I am either in the mood where I am writing everything good or I am in the mood where I am annoyed with the book. I had a love/hate relationship with this book. (there are some spoilers but I put a little alert before I get there) So so some good things to me:1. I loved the style of writing. The going back between Henry and Clare. The jumping around from dates. I thought it worked really well for this plot. 2. The relationship between Henry and Clare developing through the years captured me and was thrilled to see their lives and feelings. It was a beautiful, intense, tragic love story.3. Henry....I absolutely fell in love with this character. He really got to me. And I am sure I will remember him for a long time. 4. Some things people mentioned in other reviews that annoyed them -- the name dropping. I liked it. Because it wasn't name dropping to me but I think it is probably the authors interests thrown in to the character. And that is fine with me. I love that it was bands, poetry, art and such that was of the past. I read a book recently that really did feel like name dropping because it felt like they were trying to name everything cool and hip of today to make the characters seem cool. And in Time Traveler's Wife I felt like it was just developing the characters likes and dislikes.***Spoiler Alert****5. I thought the dreams of the babies and miscarriages were dark but captured feelings and the dreams so well. They were very intense and powerful. As an artist I could see the images in my head that Niffenegger painted with her words.6. I really liked how Niffenegger handled his death...the loss and feelings around the whole scene just were incredibly powerful. It didn't bother me that he died. I mean I was upset because as I said I really enjoyed his character but I feel it fit in the book really well. I did have another problem with the ending though that I will get to in a moment. Things I didn't like:1. I wasn't thrilled with the development of Clare's family. I felt they were 2 dimensional. 2. There were some scenes that I felt were just dropped in the story and not developed very well. 2. The book is called the Time Traveler's Wife but I feel like Clare isn't the focus of the book as much as Henry and although I love Henry -- I think maybe the book should be named the Time Traveler. It just didn't feel like Clare had a strong enough voice. I even felt at time like she was along for the ride because this was how her life was suppose to end up. Instead of really mentally hashing it out, even her feelings of when he disappeared were to me skimmed over. 3. I didn't like how it ended. I felt like we went with Clare from 6 to 37 and one day she is grieving and talking about how part of her has vanished and the next day she is 85. It felt like it just was chopped off for me. Like I missed something. I really felt that way so much I went and reread the last chapter three times to make sure there I wasn't missing something important. But it was the same each time. So I had a love hate relationship because I was so invested in them and then it felt like I had to go through grieving and didn't get the closure I wanted on their story. EDIT: Summer 2009 - I reread this again and now I am okay with the ending. It didn't leave me so upset. And I loved the book just as much as I did the first time. Henry is someone I want to know in real life. And so I have brought this up to 5 stars - I had given it 4 because of I was so upset with the ending the first time reading it. Now a year later - I can say it is a 5 star book for me. It is in my top 10 favorite books. ",9,0.9992,0.063,0.71,0.227,0.5134121061359866,POSITIVE,0.9995
162,3741312254,01/14/2021,4.0,"Right from the start, I felt that the book had to be read with care, it was not something to be rushed. I felt drawn in, as if I had my own on-location seat, watching the characters lives unfurl before me. I watched as Henry laid a latticework of trails, the interlocking foundation that built and held the story aloft. I felt Clare's pain as she waited, her frustration as henry left, and her anticipation in the times leading up to henry's arrivals. The story touches on more than just a love story. It shines a light on interpretation, mental health, body image and so much more. Henry's word held Clare captive, his disappearance truly sealed her fate, in turn, this would mould her persona, her approach to life. Once you experience something amazing nothing will ever compare. (And let's face it if a good looking, butt naked person (male or female) proved that they were from your future..... no one else would stand a chance!)  Clare is always waiting for henry to give her life meaning, however, Clare is the very essence, the reason for Henry's prolonged life. They gave each other something more spectacular then money, property and finary, they literally gave each other time! As a parent of one with one on the way, and as a male who has also suffered through a miscarriage I can wholeheartedly say that the storyline brought me to tears! The painstaking images were enough to give me nightmares. Losing a person you have never met but have loved unconditionally from the moment a strip told you of their existence is devastating. To think that they have ripped themselves away from you, leaving you for good with no way home is soul-destroying. When Henry decided that he needed to protect Clare from their carnal desires, I felt a comradeship, a solidarity to prevent her untimely demise. But as was the written fate, his actions were futile, he is unable to change the preordained, the foreseen, and Clare who is the master of her own body chooses to take a future Henry's advice in a last ditch attempt to create an art installation that would never be finished. Alba. Alba represents the hope that perseverance requires, the endless and unconditional love that is endowed upon those who hold our hearts. Alba is the best of Clare and Henry, she moves them forward into the next phase of their relationship. In the end, Clare is left with three things, her memories, Alba tales of meeting her dad, and the knowledge of one last encounter. The only problem I had while reading, was losing myself within the conversations and having to reread parts to work out who said what. This only happened a few times. I'm still torn between who is the captive and the captee(?), a discussion on what came first, the chicken or the egg, could be invoked leading towards an even deeper philosophical debate on the lineage of time or the very concept of time itself.I think the message I took away from reading this book, is that one should not worry about the past or the future, it has already happened or it will happen how it is supposed to. In the end, when the here and now has been fulfilled, all good things come to those who wait. I have laughed, panicked, sworn in anger, cried in devastation and enjoyed with happiness. It takes a skilled writer to invoke these emotions and making the reader find themselves relating to storylines, effectively and with ease, is an even harder job.

163,4006809,08/02/2007,4.0,"This book is a debut for Audrey Niffenegger. And being a first-timer herself, i think she made the complex timelines with ease. The Time Traveler's Wife is a love story concealed inside a suspense novel but is far from a science fiction exploration of the space-time continuum. The book is about the two characters - Henry DeTamble and Clare Abshire whose passionate love affair endures across a sea of time and captures themselves in an impossibly romantic trap. Henry is a time-traveller; a genetic mutation which causes him to spontaneously travel through time, disappearing from view, leaving behind his clothes and possessions, and arriving naked in another time and another place. While Clare is leaving a chronologically normal life, Henry isn't. After their first meeting (Clare was 6 and Henry would be 36) Clare will always wait for his arrival. She has known him all her life. He visits her numerous times during her childhood and adolescence, and inadvertently reveals that they will be married in the future. His last visit is on her 18th birthday in 1989, and will be separated for two years. Finally, they meet in 1991, a real time for both of them, Clare is 20 and Henry is 28. Henry does not know anything about Clare and Clare has to show Henry the diary she made as a testament of Henry's existence in Clare's past, which is still in Henry's future. Henry begins to experience the events in Clare's childhood and at the same time experiencing life with the adult Clare in the present. In the novel, the future cannot be changed, and many tragic events are foreshadowed in the past.When they soon get married, Clare and Henry have to struggle to survive and maintain their love, and at the same time fighting a complex disorder that constantly threatens their existence. They yearn for the domestic drudgery and the homely comforts of marriage without the constant fear of separation. He longs to be able to live only in the present and he and Clare desperately search for a medical treatment for the disorder but to no avail.Although the love in the story is very much appalling and intense, a part of it I find ultimately depressing: Henry's father never recovers and continues to mourn for years when his mother died, and Ingrid (Henry's ex-girlfriend) committed suicide after losing Henry to Clare. The love in the story has such a passion with no middle ground, no growth from the experience.But my most favorite part is the way Henry describes love through his letter to Clare. This is how it goes:Clare, I want to tell you, again, I love you. Our love has been the thread through a labyrinth, the net under the high-wire walker, the only real thing in this strange life of mine that I could ever trust. Tonight I feel that my love for you has more density in this world than I do: as though I could linger on after me and surround you, keep you, hold you.",9,0.9876,0.107,0.736,0.158,0.4815476190476191,NEGATIVE,0.9422
164,1995469,06/15/2007,2.0,"What to say? I guess I'd categorize this book as an ""enjoyable disappointment."" The premise is really interesting, and the story itself is ridiculously engrossing, but the flaws are so glaring that I wouldn't call this a ""good"" book. The writing isn't bad, it's just... there; it tells the story, and nothing else, and at times I found myself skimming. For such a long book, the characters are quite flat, and sometimes they did and said such unrealistic things that I laughed in disbelief. The supporting characters, in particular, are really just thin sketches, largely forgotten about until the next time they need to impact the storyline. In addition, the major themes are woefully underdeveloped, and are never explored enough to make any sort of impact or produce any, uh, ""deep"" thoughts. What could have been a nice exploration of free will is reduced to a few pretentious conversations between the main characters, and a couple of lines here and there (buried between hundreds and hundreds of pages). A distant, alcoholic father that has squandered his life is clearly supposed to be part of another underlying theme, though these interactions are never fleshed out completely; what the reader is left with is a feeling of being simultaneously being hit over the head with something (after the 364th mention of how the father's life was squandered) and still having it be underdeveloped (because we're just told something, and never really sufficiently shown it). The book is clearly getting at something... a lot of somethings, maybe, but it never quite gets to any of them; it gets close to some big issues, then seems to lose steam and double back towards one of its many unfortunate Nicholas Sparks-esque schlock moments (I admit that I am largely intolerant of hearing about how anyone is ""fated"" to be with someone else). Yet... I liked reading it. I freely admit that I cried quite a bit during the ending, which is almost unbearably sad. For all its flaws, I felt positive about the book after reading it; like I said, it's a really engrossing story. Apparently, it's about to be made into a movie, which should be interesting. All in all, I think most people would enjoy reading this book, though it doesn't quite live up to the ""Best book evAAAAAArrr!!!!"" hype it's received :)",9,0.995,0.051,0.778,0.171,0.4770117137764197,NEGATIVE,1.0

I love this audiobook. The story of Henry and Clare is a true love story. Not a true story but a defining love story. Through thick and thin from now to forever kinda love story. You see Henry is kinda different because he can time travel. Not like in the book The Time Machine. This is more or less time traveling within in his life time and not at his will. Henry seems to land in various places completely naked and not really with any knowledge of the place and time he lands in. What makes this story so wonderful is the fun of his new budding relationship with a little girl and soon-to-be wife Clare. What I love most about this book is how the author gives the reader the same situation in multiple views which makes it kinda magical. You get to see their relationship from Henry's confused state as an adult, Clare's view from her child's eye and her adult mind looking back as well as the people in their lives that get to share in this strange adventure. Henry and Clare are such a likable character. When I was listening to the audiobook I thought a few times the author had to be male to understand Henry's male perception so well. Nope she's not! She is just another awesome female writer. This audiobook was not like those sappy love stories at all. The Time Traveler's Wife one is very grown, very interesting, funny and had a bit of off the wall-ness to it. I know that is not a word but..As I am re-reading this review I see that my thoughts are all over the place. I can't help it! I just loved this book.Now let's talk about the narrator's. Like I have said before, narrators make good books great audiobooks. Thank you to the producers for putting two great narrators together. Fred and Phoebe became Henry and Clare. They were not readers at all but actors who studied and make an effort to do more than read the words on the page.There is nothing about this audiobook I would change. Nothing!

At first, I was taken in by the science fiction aspect of the book, but I couldn’t stop asking myself questions. If the time travel was more likely to occur during times of stress, why didn’t Henry time travel when he was in school? It seemed like an impossible secret to keep over a lifetime. I didn’t like, at all, that (view spoiler)[ Henry seemed to be attracted to Clare at the ages of eleven and thirteen. It made me uncomfortable to read it. Just when I was getting over that there was the business about the first kiss. A grown man aggressively kissing a fifteen year old is seriously wrong. I didn’t see Clare and Henry’s relationship as a beautiful love story. Another problem for me was that elements of the plot just didn’t jive. Clare and Henry commit assault and battery. For a good reason, mind you, but it was unrealistic to think that there were no repercussions at all for Clare’s attacker or for Clare. The gene explanation for Henry’s time travel was silly.  (hide spoiler)]The biggest problem that I had with this book was that Niffenegger just had too much to say about too many different topics. She wanted to talk about God, destiny, love, music, religion…. It felt like Niffenegger tried to put every opinion she ever had about everything under the sun in this one book.With so much bad to say, why do I give it four stars? The answer is simple-the writing. The mechanics of word choice and sentence structure is good. Also, the plot was interesting. Even when the book was a depressing mess, I wanted to know what was going to happen.There is a lot about this book to criticize that I haven’t even mentioned, but there is something special about it. Niffenegger hints at greatness and when she can't deliver it is really disappointing, but that doesn't mean the book is bad. I generally dislike the romance genre, but this book kept my interest from start to finish, so, ultimately, I would recommend to give it a try.",9,0.9007,0.147,0.683,0.171,0.6174665178571429,NEGATIVE,1.0

i won't ever leave you, even though you're always leaving me.
this has got to be one of the most imaginative, creative, original and sad books i have ever read. the idea of this book deserves a much higher rating than its actual execution, though, unfortunately, which is why it has averaged out on the lower side.let's start off with the positives. like i've already said, the premise of this book is innovative, and what attracted me in the first place. it is also fairly well written and very, very emotional. however, at times, the detailed writing was a bit overwhelming. i could imagine myself being the editor of this book and just throwing away pages. and most of it wasn't even detail that would enrich the book in any way, it was just going over every little aspect of daily life, in what almost felt like a desperate attempt to achieve a higher number of pages. (view spoiler)[as if this wasn't enough, i really could've done without the excruciating detail of the abortions. (hide spoiler)]then, there's a few issues with the plot. for example, if someone can explain to me in which way does it help the narrative that henry is forced to time-travel naked, i would appreciate it. because, if there is in fact no explanation for this, why is niffenegger wasting time and distracting from the plot with henry's constant need to find clothes?

Love a good love story but this was weird.So thankfully the time travelling was comprehensible. Still with the whole predestination and you cannot change the past thing, the romance felt incredibly forced? Like neither of them chose to be in this relationship, as at the start for each of them they both had knowledge of the future. So I didn't really buy it.This is a problem because the romance is the main focus of this 500+ page book. There are loads of side characters with super interesting side plots that are underdeveloped af. This is such a shame, as you can't care about something if it is given no screen time. So many things could have been used to explore and deepen the character development of Clare and Henry, but it just didn't. (Like Ben and the whole Gomez story, which was so random and underdeveloped)Also, the privilege of these characters is just astounding. Poor Clare, her art studio is too small for her work. Meanwhile she is 22 and OWNS A HOUSE AND HAS ACCESS TO A TRUST FUND. I can't. I'm not even going to discuss the racial stereotypes in the characters of Kimy and Nell. It's too cringe.After the first half of the book, the author delves into full melodrama and it becomes so sad for no reason other than give it a dramatic emotional ending.

179,106727516,06/12/2010,4.0,"A Love to Defy the Rules of Time(A Book Review of Audrey Niffenegger's The Time Traveler’s Wife)Right from the beginning of Audrey Niffeneger’s famed debut novel, The Time Traveler’s Wife, the reader is already thrown terrifically off-balanced. Here’s a scenario of a man meets woman that’s anything but, and a love story, while on the surface conquers the test of time, challenges its tenets as well.On the day that Henry DeTamble, a librarian, meets Clare Anne Abshire, an art student, in a Chicago library it seems she had already known him all his life, while he doesn’t even know who she is. As the reader gets to know bit by bit, Henry is afflicted with Chrono-Displacement Disorder, a genetic anomaly that makes him involuntarily displaced in time triggered mostly during moments of emotional stress. That’s how Clare had met him; by means of an older future version of Henry who traveled back in time to meet the child Clare where in her past they first fell in love, while in the present time of their meeting all of this is just waiting to unfold. Wait, am I talking sense? Well, talk about being off-balanced, for that’s just how I felt reading the first chapter of the book, yet as I continued on, shuffling through different timelines in the life of this couple, things begin to click in and become comprehensible, and I was left impressed by Niffenegger’s unusual love story and her atypical take on time traveling.I think this is one of those books that have something for everyone — it quite engages the reader on multiple levels. For the most part, some easily relate to the circumstances of Henry and Clare’s relationship; that though Henry is beset by a strange medical condition, the daily ordeals and simple joys they undergo as a couple, and in their eventual married life, remains grounded in the same experiences when two people are madly in love with each other. For sci-fi buffs, Niffenegger’s rendition of one of the genre’s most often used concept is refreshing, taking time traveling on its head and portraying it as something that’s uncontrollable, a threat to constancy and a blight.I fairly marveled at Niffenegger’s clever fusion of this sci-fi element into a heartfelt love story themes such as waiting, domesticity, relationship gender roles, fate and free will, as well as brushing on philosophical questions of meaning and purpose. By figuring out time traveling into the tale of Henry and Clare she also gives us a peek into that window of a wild fantasy some of us seem to share: what is it like to go into the past and even the childhood of our significant other? It gives more than an adequate meaning of what’s like to be a part of someone’s life.More than anything else, the novel’s quaint structure, through Niffenegger’s innovative space time continuum interplay, sure does give that sense of displacement to the reader that Henry must have felt as it hurls and jumps from certain events in the lives of her two major protagonists slogging through different chronologies. Yet for once didn’t I felt lost for the author excellently laid out the logic of her premise clearly in the beginning pages of the book (though frankly it was a slow start for me as I take it all in), locks her narrative, and once you get settled in the rest ambles by smoothly — at least for me. The effect is a truly moving novel that even when the execution falls short its raw imaginative and intellectual power carries the day.The only problem that I have with this book is that it’s too long and it could’ve do some good to the narrative if it was cut in some parts, especially in its middle section that kind of plateaued where some of the chapters served as fillers and doesn’t even bear a connection to and figure in whatsoever into what will eventually happen in the novel’s climax. I also noted that it was mostly on this section that some of its melodramatic stuff comes on in excess, with copiously inconsequential sex scenes and where the line of relationships of the novel’s key players goes overboard it made me roll my eyes as I think Niffenegger’s brewing a storm in a small tea cup, adding complication in the plot that in the first place it can do without.Despite occasionally verging on the histrionic, the characters are well-drawn, with complicated family history and close (sometimes too much for comfort — oh, there I’m at again) friendships. The dialogue is witty but not unnatural (I particularly like some of the parts from Clare’s perspective) which balances the suspension of disbelief the reader needs to accept its sci-fi premise._________________________Book Details: Book #32 for 2011Published by Harcourt, Inc.(Trade Paperback, 2004 Edition)536 pagesStarted: August 2, 2011Finished: August 11, 2011My Rating: ★★★★[See this review on my book blog

181,44450915,01/26/2009,5.0,"Original review: Time travel fiction that is actually well written. 2014 review update after an audiobook ""reread"": Typically the time travel novels I am most drawn to send a contemporary character back (or less often forward) in time to some interesting historical era where that character has to cope with differences in culture and lifestyle while trying to accomplish some kind of quest--even if it’s just to get back home--allowing me to effortlessly glean fascinating insights about a time gone by. The Time Traveler’s Wife, of course, is nothing like this and yet it is maybe my favorite book in the genre. Henry, a punk music loving librarian, and Clare, an artist who creates large sculptures of paper, are people I would love to read about in any story, and I enjoy almost as much the rich cast of well-drawn supporting characters, many of whom could probably star in their own books. It’s Henry who is jolted around in time, and it’s just as brutal as it sounds because he is abruptly jerked from wherever he is and dropped naked somewhere else in time, usually some time in his own past, though occasionally in his future. To survive these circumstances Henry has had to become good at running, picking locks, fighting, lying, and stealing. The plot examines the “what if” of being involuntarily shoved back and forth in time away from your present--including the paradoxes of meeting past and future versions of yourself--and combines that with the affecting story of two lovers who meet each other out of sequence, the normal chronology of a relationship upended. When Henry first sees Clare in his mid-twenties Clare has already known Henry since she was six because older Henrys have been inadvertently time traveling into the field behind her parent’s home and visiting with her almost all her life. Ever since I first read The Time Traveler’s Wife in 2003 it has been on my mental list of all-time best reads, a book I judge other novels by, and it has maintained a prominent place on my bookshelf. For this “reread” I listened to the audio version and was just as entranced by the story as I was in my initial encounter. Because it’s narrated by two talented readers, a Henry and a Clare who both really capture their characters, I was able to especially savor the language and writing style. Being audio also meant no skimming over details when there is some sadness at the end, adding a little not unwelcome poignancy to my pleasure.A sequel featuring Alba, Henry and Clare’s time traveling daughter, is set to come out sometime soon. Can’t wait--here’s hoping it’s just as wonderful. ",8,0.9892,0.047,0.828,0.126,0.4796451914098971,POSITIVE,0.9995
182,213261284,09/22/2011,1.0,"I gave this one star and I'm writing a review simply to remind my future self NOT to bother reading this book. I have a bad habit of forgetting that I read (or started to read) a book, especially bad books (maybe I block them from my memory?).I've heard so many rave reviews about this book (Oprah Book Club people) that I've been meaning to read it. I know I started to read it once, couldn't get past the first chapter or two, and gave up.I was recently looking for an audiobook to listen to during my commute, so I reasoned that if the book was read TO me, I might be able to finish it.No such luck. Seriously, if after 40 minutes I'm not remotely interested in the plot, and I'm having a stronger and stronger urge to drive my car off the road in order to escape the tedius drone of the storytelling...that's a bad sign. Maybe it's because I was already in the middle of ""Kindred"" (a GOOD time-travel book), but I just couldn't take this book. Time travel? As far as I could tell, the time travel in this book was a poor attempt to hide the fact that this was simply a romance novel. A child-grooming romance novel. Really? A middle-aged man appears naked in front of a child, over and over, and essentially ""raises"" her to become his future wife. CREEPY. I don't know, if you took the whole idea out of context (a middle aged man meeting a child and telling her that she'll be his wife when she grows up) it would totally not be OK. And do we really need him to be naked whenever he time travels? Plenty of other time travelers have managed it fully clothed...This just adds to the creep factor of this book, like it's just setting the tone that This Book Is About Sex. Not that there's anything wrong with that...when it's between people who meet each other at similar ages for the first time. Gah!My librarian agrees. She's never been able to make it through this book either. We agreed that Oprah Reading Club books tend to be the same sort of rubbish chick-lit...and we hypothesized that the reason why they get such good reviews is that many readers are the type that don't read a lot of books besides Oprah Book Club books? So they believe that this is what good literature IS? That's the only thing I can think of, because so far I have not read a single OBC book that I liked.Anyway, future Jamie, don't try re-reading this book. It is rubbish!

183,1252472902,04/11/2015,5.0,"Time. Precious time. Never enough but always too much. Running out, either too slow or too fast. Of course there is time for a cup of tea. We have five minutes. That is it. That is all. Or is it? What would time be like if it were not like it currently is? How would we measure life if time, as we know it, did not exist?This book reminded me of another I read a while back. I am pretty sure it was Kurt Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse-Five. If I am not mistaken, there comes a point in that novel when we are told that the past, the present and the future will always exist, and have always existed. The past will forever remain trapped in its present. It is right there, where it always, and as it always, has been.If only we could go back and forth, huh? I can see Henry’s face as the thought crosses my mind. I must have said it out loud for he is now shaking his head as he studies his book, freshly brewed coffee in hand, “be careful what you wish for"".Both a blessing and a curse, that is Henry’s life. And his story? It is a whole new spectrum of emotions that make our ribcage feel way too small at times. And Clare… she found her other half way before they met. And she believed, she believed till her very last breath.This book is a roller coaster. This book is life. Feels like being at a Christmas dinner with the whole family after years apart. Laughs, tears, awkward stories, embarrassing silences… This book is everything.I found myself losing track of time as I read this. Quite ironic, wouldn’t you say? Audrey Niffenegger takes us on this journey that does not apologize for its high ups and low downs. This book is not a paper tissue being given to you so that you can wipe away your tears. Instead, it is a strong hand squeezing yours as you cry your heart out. It is a reminder that you are not alone. You have yourself. And that self, that self you call yours, is made of all the people, all the moments, all the time. And it is breathtaking.I am truly in awe after this experience. Must get myself a copy in English. I have a feeling it will be interesting to reread.For now, if you will excuse me, I must find a way of fighting the insomnia. All this time has fed it and bathed it in water.

184,60756602,06/23/2009,3.0,"3.5 StarsI found the book to be well written, poignant and heart-warming. I sympathised with the main characters, Henry and Clare, and enjoyed the blossoming relationship between them. I liked the fact that the author used the present tense and first person narrative as it enabled me to connect with the characters straight away and to really get inside their heads. I don't think this would have been as easy if it was past tense or third person. However, for me there is hardly anything so fascinating and yet so utterly frustrating as the 'Time Travel' story and frustration can sometimes be the stronger emotion due to the vaguely spelled out theory of time travel, which often leads to events being confusing and contradictory. This is what I think happened in this book. I'm not particularly scientifically minded, but I am intrigued by the subject of time-travel and I know this book is a work fiction, but I always find time travel a difficult one as there's always the 'Time Travel paradox'. I found that the contradictions of time travel interfered with my total immersion in the book. As there are several Henry's traveling through time (and we know this by the fact that he sometimes visits himself and watches them time travel) then surely all these Henry's would be meeting with Clare and therefore she would be inundated with them!? I know that I should have put aside trying to analyse this element of the book, as time travel is only theory, but I couldn't and so it hindered my enjoyment of the book slightly.However, overall I did enjoy the story and found it to be sweet and the characters likable. I would recommend it, but be warned, put your time traveling theories aside and just go with the flow. If you enjoy a good love story then this is the book for you.",8,0.9852,0.057,0.803,0.14,0.4903594771241831,POSITIVE,0.9823

This book is one of those amazing books that make you feel everything, and above all, it makes you think. Oh I love when a book does that to me. It made me laugh, cry, angry, confused, sad, everything. It made me feel alive, gratefull and to reconsider everyday events.Henry was a great Character, on of my fave, he was so funny, and because the book shows him in pretty much every age, we get to see his changes, and his personality evolving.

Does Audrey imply that they were having sex?

186,1662739942,06/08/2016,5.0,"4.5/5Starting The Time Traveler´s Wife I really didn´t know what it was about, other than it had something to do with time travelling. So I was a bit surprised to learn how big of a part romance played in the story. It was a positive surprise however, especially as the love between Henry and Clare seemed so strong I feel like I´ve never read about anything similar to it. While reading this book I myself experienced love, love towards the main characters and love towards their love for each other. Clare and Henry are truly persons that I felt connected to. An artist and a librarian, what else could I wish for?The start is confusing, I must admit that. It took about a hundred pages until I properly understood what was happening and how it was happening. Though the realization, putting pieces together, feels very satisfying and in the end I think it´s good that not everything is given to the reader, you have to do some thinking. Concentration is vital when reading, since Henry jumps from time to time in every chapter and it´s easy get lost, confused about what is happening. All the little details about the genes that cause the time travelling and mentions of gene therapy gave The Time Traveler´s Wife some credibility it was otherwise missing. There are still a lot of things that don´t seem to make sense and are a little too unbelievable, but my advice is to just enjoy the story without thinking too much about the logic behind every action as the tale of Henry and Clare is compelling, heart-breaking and overall wonderful.

187,273645073,02/07/2012,2.0,"The Time Traveler’s Wife by Audrey Niffenegger is a love story about the time that stood still, and a romance to last the ages through. The Time Traveler’s Wife, will have you reminiscing about your first love – the head over heels desperation you first feel when falling in love, and wanting so desperately to hold onto that feeling every minute. In this book, that feeling is even more intense, since Claire never knows when Henry will disappear. Very well written, simple to understand, and no hidden meaning, this book is a simple love story at best, but so much more. With a slight undertone of sadness throughout, the farther you get into the book, the more you realize there is no way to end it well. I hate sad movies and books, but they are forgivable, when it’s a happy sad. When you know at the end of the story, no matter how bad it is, you would rather have lived just a small piece of this life, then to never have had it at all. I compare it to The Notebook, another great love story that makes you cry, but isn’t necessarily sad. This book was about a wonderful full life of love that any fool would be willing to risk, no matter the cost. This is the stuff great love stories are made of. It should be on the “to be considered a classic” list and I would highly recommend it or the movie, although the book was infinitely better.

188,9536394,11/25/2007,2.0,"So, I very much wanted to like this book. The premise seamed very available to becoming a compelling and interesting book. However, I feel that the author has gotten caught up in the fad of ""raw"" writing, and the idea that this is the pinnacle of all that one can do. This is what MFA programs seem to favor these days, and I guess what is the new fashion in writing. But this idea is often confused, and this author has mistaken vulgar for ""raw"" and ""real."" For example, Clarie refers to her genitals as ""my cunt"" a few times. This seems a term that most, if not all, women would avoid naming their genitals. What's more, often this book seemed smarmy and lecherous. The idea that a Claire and Henry have a healthy love affair, after he has been the focus of her youth and adolescences is at best uncomfortable. Again, I believe this is an attempt to make it more ""raw' and challenge conventions. But, for me, it seemed a cheap ploy which attempts to elicit a reaction from the reader, to make the reader uncomfortable, and not to actually suggest anything real. My two cents, for what they are worth.",8,0.8709,0.071,0.809,0.121,0.5027664335664336,NEGATIVE,0.9997

I have to say it took me a little while to get into the flow of this but once I'd settled into it I found it surprisingly easy to suspend reality and imagine a world in which a person could dart about in time turning up at (mostly) significant times in the lives of friends and family, both in the past and in the future. Indeed, the amount of thought and the detailed checking of timelines required to write such a book is in itself staggering. About half way through I found myself totally hooked and by the end I was absolutely sold on the fact that this is a brilliant work of fiction. At heart it's a love story pure and simple - so totally not my thing, but I loved it. The ending, often the achilles heel of many a good story, is superbly constructed, totally haunting.

190,3524067630,09/06/2020,1.0,"WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS STRONG LANGUAGE, GRAPHIC SEXUAL DISCUSSION AND DISCUSSION ON SOME VERY UNCOMFORTABLE SUBJECTS, IF THOSE THINGS OFFEND YOU DON’T READ THIS BOOK OR MY REVIEW FOR IT! “If cunnilingus was an Olympic event, I’d have a medal in it I’m sure.” I actually read this book... (sigh)What’s it about?Henry time travels. He unfortunately can’t really control it as much as he’d like to, it just happens. Now his wife is stuck waiting for him when that happens and a bunch of blah blah blah...Why it gets 1-star:Does this story even have a point other than being miscellaneous shit that happened to some people? Is all of this just the life and times of these characters but no solid plot? That’s all I got here and honestly it’s not interesting. It even has things in it I should like! Time travel- okay, apparently this is only interesting within a plot that’s good for other reasons. Crime- unfortunately it’s not done in a very compelling way. Romance- I talk more about the problem here later. Punk rock- well, when the characters aren’t interesting, them happening to like a certain type of music somehow doesn’t make me more interested. Character imagines herself as a giantess- that sadly ended after one sentence. Little girls playing with a ouija board- none of them got possessed. Yeah, this really should have interested me somewhere but it didn’t.These characters mostly annoyed me. Henry is a pretentious, pervy asshole with a very bland personality. Claire is just a bland character with nothing real interesting or exciting to her except for the fact that she’s married to this guy with an uncontrollable time travel power. Most of their friends seem like boring hipsters.This book in general is extremely boring. Nothing very exciting happens. We just go through boring scenes of things like Henry managing to use time travel to literally go fuck himself (I’m not kidding), hipsters playing a communist version of Monopoly (not as humorous as it sounds), dinner parties, Claire being sad that Henry’s gone, marriage problems, Henry’s dad drinking too much and more shit that I honestly just couldn’t care less about.There’s a few attempts at comic relief. They fail.This book is way too drawn out.The storytelling is poorly written and confusing. It doesn’t seem to follow any character’s timeline, it just tells the reader some stuff whenever the author wants to.This book often feels pretentious. Various examples include Henry speaking French (or maybe it’s Latin, fuck if I know or care) at random since it sounds cool (well, to him), a noticeable chunk of the book dedicated to classical music, acting like reading is somehow a fucking superpower (seriously I love reading, I even enjoy occasional references and such to other books within books but these people who do the whole “Not like other girls” thing over a fucking book annoy the shit out of me) and more.(Sigh...)The romance and sex weren’t very good here. The romance is uninteresting to me due to the characters being uninteresting. The sex is laughably poorly written. So in the few scenes it does get detailed it also gets cheesy, like when Henry says Claire gives him an erection that Henry claims is so tall that it could ride a roller coaster at an amusement park without a parent... I’m not joking, I swear! I mean, holy fuck, I thought 50 Shades of Grey was bad!The meant-to-be-emotional bits didn’t work for me. Like I’ve made pretty clear I didn’t give a shit about most of the book so I guess that includes when emotional stuff happened.So Henry is possibly a pedo. There’s some stuff where he ended up back in time to when Claire was a child, which I suppose could very well happen while time traveling. But then Henry starts pondering how beautiful she looks... while maybe a bit strange, since he knows how she looks as an adult I guess it would make sense that he might notice some stuff that leads to her adult beauty (example: the color of her hair) and it is the abuse, not the attraction that makes it wrong so I was fine with this. Then he starts getting jealous that she doesn’t find him attractive... now it’s creepy! It got super creepy when she’s 12 years old and he starts playing with her feet (which yeah, I know feet aren’t immediately sexual but it mentioned beforehand how he even seems to like sucking adult Claire’s toes so he obviously has a thing for this exact girl’s feet)... umm... EWW! And sure, Henry did wait until Claire was 18 before fucking her but at the same time with this stuff I couldn’t help but think “HENRY, SHE ISN’T EVEN IN HIGH SCHOOL YET, YOU PERVY CUNT!” and to make it worse, it’s depicted as cute. What the actual fuck?So unless I misinterpreted something the few times horror and metal music are mentioned it’s in a context hypocritically dismissing the art and fans of them as stupid. Horror is just like any other genre of storytelling. For metal, I say this as someone who listens to a wide variety of music (I’d include Melanie Martinez, Slayer, Kendrick Lamar, Granger Smith, Ice Nine Kills, Kansas, Sex Pistols, Dubliners and Frank Sinatra all in the same playlist), metal is one of the most complex genres of music, in fact I once knew a guy with an in-depth college education in music and he said this. Also when you look at the theatrics and multiple factors that fans of both metal and horror consider I would argue that horror fans and metalheads often have a higher standard in entertainment. I find it rather hypocritical too that a romance book about people who like punk rock would do this since most of the assclowns I’ve seen dismiss horror as stupid also consider romance to be “worthless smut” and most people I’ve seen dismiss metal as “just noise” also dismiss punk (unless you consider pop-punk like Green Day but are we really gonna do that... then again this book somehow put Pearl Jam in the same category as Dead Kenmedys so who the fuck knows what this book’s doing?)The “WEEE NEEED BAAAYYYYBEEEEE” trope is here and it sucked. First of all, this is one of my least favorite tropes right beside “it was all a dream”. Second, it’s done so terribly here, especially with the “life is worthless without breeding” bullshit and gender stereotype of women being goddamn psychotic over it (not going to say a female author is sexist towards women but poorly written stereotyping is poorly written stereotyping either way). I understand a couple having or trying to have a kid in a story but this is not the way to do it.So I noticed at least one plot hole. It mentions how Henry doesn’t watch TV because it causes him to drift away and end up time traveling... but another part of the book mentioned him watching movies on dates in the past. So did he accidentally time travel during a date? Are movie theaters a different experience for time travelers than a television set? Come to think of it, there’s actually quite a few plot holes not following the story’s own time travel rules so yeah...Teen characters are written terribly as usual. An example I found especially odd (and borderline creepy) that a 14-year-old in one scene still thought of adult characters as the “grown-ups” because seriously I have never heard someone over 11 use that term when referring to adults outside of entertainment (then again many books seem to be like a weird less humorous, switched around version of South Park where instead of little kids sounding like aggressive teens, teens sound like happy little kids).Overall:I wish I liked this book but I didn’t.The story feels like a nothing burger that’s 90% (and that’s being generous) filler where all the characters are boring and pretentious as nothing exciting happens. Add a side of cheesy sex scenes and the main character being a pedo which is somehow depicted as cute, you have a kinda shitty book. I have so many problems with this book and not a good thing to say.I like romance and I like sci-fi but hated this book I should have enjoyed. While I wouldn’t quite say it’s one of the 5 worst books I ever read, it is in my top 5 worst books I’ve read this year.I read this due to it being in a list I’m going through where Goodreads users chose books that everyone should read at least once... this is why I really question Goodreads’ taste sometimes.1/5",7,0.9703,0.147,0.69,0.163,0.5577272530141382,NEGATIVE,1.0

I then inadvertently stayed up another hour after that, trying to stop myself from rehashing all the things I didn't like about the Time Traveler and his wife.First and possibly most importantly this book is WAY TOO LONG. 531 pages in my paperback copy, with no plot aside from ""two people love each other and one of them jumps around in time, which makes things a bit tricky on occasion."" Most of these 531 pages consist of filler scenes that serve no purpose whatsoever. One well-drawn scene of Henry time-traveling and desperately seeking clothing/shelter would have covered it. Instead we see it what feels like a thousand times, with nothing changed except the incidental details. One scene involving the couple making coffee or eating foods I've never heard of would have been enough, but we are treated to an endless stream of such. And so on.Equally important: I did not care about these characters in the least. Not even enough to dislike them. We are told a great deal, often quite repetitively, about What They Are Like (though mostly about What Henry Is Like). We rarely ever see it for real. For example he supposedly abused alcohol, drugs, and women. Never do we actually see this, just hear about it, and often secondhand. We are told that Clare is an artist but really, she could have been anything. The fact of her artist-ness has very little impact on the story.For that matter, very little in this book has any impact on the story. So many pointless scenes -(view spoiler)[(Henry beating up the guy who nearly raped Clare, Clare sleeping with Gomez, the entirety of the element of Clare's mother's death, just to name a few) (hide spoiler)] - that end up going nowhere. Even worse, the pointless details! Restaurant orders, games of pool, bands Henry likes, a literal grocery list of 32 items as Henry unpacks after shopping. Descriptions of things that could easily have been cut in half. SO MANY DESCRIPTIONS OF DREAMS. Surely no one on Earth enjoys hearing about another person's dreams, even less so when they are bogging down the plot of the book we are reading...Oh, but, there is no plot! Henry and Clare love each other! We know this because they have sex with each other more than any other couple alive, and often in graphic detail! I did not buy their love for a minute. Aside from the endless and often cringey sex, we are given absolutely no reason to believe that these two had a love for the ages. I guess we are meant to accept that it was destiny, and let that be that. Or something. Lastly - finally - I love a dual POV, when I can tell the narrators apart. Here I could not. Sometimes I'd get to a sentence that made it clear Henry was speaking, and realize I'd thought all along it was Clare. Character development lacking = I do not care about them at all = I don't believe their love = this book was not for me.",7,0.9879,0.099,0.757,0.143,0.4925595238095239,NEGATIVE,1.0

Movie adaptation 3.5/5  “Don't you think it's better to be extremely happy for a short while, even if you lose it, than to be just okay for your whole life?”  I am sorry to be in the minority but this was surprisingly good and yet I have no idea why it was as good as I claim it to be.  It’s not the best time travel book that I have ever read but it was such a fun ride. Audrey Niffenegger in some parts did this book justice , I usually get intimidated by time travel books or movies because they are confusing for me and I usually spend so much time trying to piece together everything , she made it simple enough. It was disjointed but slowly with each page the pieces fall into place. The main premise of the book follows Henry (the time traveler) and Clare (the girlfriend/wife). Henry randomly disappears and reappears in different time periods of his life and he can’t control when it happens, so the concept of time traveling in the book is treated as disability and we follow him as he meets his wife at the age of 6 years old and all through her life. The cool thing or rather the bad thing is that when Henry disappears he literally leaves everything at that moment and goes back in time naked without identification, money or shit, so he has to pickpocket, steal to survive. I loved that whole setting of the book it was such an interesting take on time traveling, it showcased such a dark-side of time travel that if I was offered the ability to do that I would be like…The book is written in a different format and it worked for me personally and how she went on to diagnose time travel as a disease made the whole thing appear realistic. The love story was OK, many people go in expecting more science-fiction but end up getting a fluffy book and I get why it’s hated on but I tolerated it. The only problem with it was Clare (the wife) wasn’t as independent as she always depended on Henry (the time traveler) and it got so annoying. Also the side characters were just placed in the book to make the story move forward, I wish they were fleshed out and had depth.The problems I had with this book were equally as many… •	A 36 year old man appearing naked in front of 6 year old child   •	The stereo-type black maid   •	Gomez’s character   • Henry looking at a younger Clare sexually   •	Cardboard Side Characters  •	And the ending It was still a good book though and the themes of people suffering with disability, alcoholism, death, depression, suicide and many more were touched upon.

But I digress.(view spoiler)[Little girl has a secret friend who just happens to be a thirty-six year old man who appears at random, naked, in the woods behind her house. She idolizes him and falls in love with him, and every relationship she has after that is a shadow of her relationship with him, who becomes her quasi-boyfriend when she's sixteen and punches other boys for her. Then he disappears and she's just waiting for him to reappear again and bam, he does. He's younger than she's ever seen him, and a bit of an asshole but oh, sparks! Magic!, she changes him and they get engaged and married and then: tragedy.This book spoon-feeds you tragedy after tragedy. He can't control his travels! Oh, no! They love each other so much, but they're never sure how long they can be together! Abortions! Tragedy! He doesn't want to have children anymore because he's afraid one abortion will kill her! Oh no! He gets a vasectomy in secret! He disappears! He reappears! Pregnancy because she has sex with past him! Oh joy! But no, he's injured! He can't walk anymore!

211,2245193917,01/05/2018,2.0,"I am a sucker for romantic anything. Yes, I watch the Bachelor/Bachelorette, admire Nicholas Sparks, and cry each time I read A Walk to Remember, The Fault in Our Stars, and Eleanor & Park. Romance novels always manage to pull my heartstrings. There is nothing more beautiful to me than witnessing people grow in hardship and love together.Prior to the movie, I had no idea this book existed. This might be because I was only 12 and, um, busy reading the Twilight saga when it first came out. But now as an adult, I thought I could appreciate this novel on a personal level. I mean, the premise sounds interesting enough:  A man who time travels in sporadic intervals, and a woman who falls in love with him despite his genetic disorder.  Science fiction merges with romance? Yes please! But this book failed to impress me. It just wasn’t my cup of coffee. First of all, it wasn’t romantic enough, which is the last thing I expected to say.  Instead of crying or laughing, my reading experience consisted of lots of cringing.  The only part that moved me in these 500+ pages was the letter Henry wrote to Clare at the end. But everything else was lacklustre. Also, the characters were staler than leftover salad. There was no fancy quirk, humour, or feature about them. I know I will soon forget these characters as the months pass. They were just typical storybook characters on a page. I did not learn to love them as living, breathing beings that could exist outside of the book. This is in part due to the dialogue, which was so darn dull. The characters spoke to each other about the most mundane topics, many of which could be taken out without impacting the plot.  There was little the characters said that made me stop, think, and see life in a different way. My other issue with this book is the treatment and stereotyping of minority characters. The main characters talk about them as if they are the “other” that exists in their world, instead of just being regular humans in their surroundings. This book came out in 2009 for crying out loud, so I expected it to be slightly more progressive and socially aware. I know I am being super harsh and critical about this book, but it wasn’t all terrible.  I commend the author for being able to come up with such an interesting storyline.  The novel was also easy to follow, which is a difficult achievement considering there are multiple flashbacks throughout the book.I did not enjoy this book, but I will not say it was an utter disaster.

I thought the aspect of time-traveling in this book was amazing! It was so fascinating to see all the explainations the author came up with to describe how time travel worked. However, that's where it ends, my friends. Everything after that is just so obnoxious, you want to burn the book and I don't condone book burning! My God... it was just awful.Niffenegger has an okay writing style. At times it is so bland you just want to hang yourself.

It's human nature to want to feel that sort of pleasure and it can be quite beautiful if written correctly. However, every damn minute you see Clare slip her hands to Harry's nuts!

I liked the first chunk of the story because it felt fresh and new to me. Also, the parts when Clare was a child and Henry in his 40s was so creepy and weird that I was pulled in. Then the story dragged on and on. I felt like half of the book was filler with nothing happening. I'm not someone who needs a book filled with plot but this one didn't offer anything in the filler pages. It didn't go into character depth or anything that made me think. It went from scene to scene where Henry and Clare are either eating, having social events with friends and family, or having sex. All of it felt empty and meaningless because you could essentially cut the scene out and it wouldn't change anything in the book. The characters were so in love with each other but I never understood why. I was told by the author that they were but it was not actually shown. Sure they had scenes together where they discussed their love and did some romantic stuff but none of it had enough depth to convince me. Another problem I had with the book was the writing. I thought it was awful - truly, truly bad. The author wrote in these short and incredibly simplistic sentences that it felt like a 14 year old girl wrote them. I'd give some examples but I left it at the resort - I had no interest in returning that clunker home. Her sentences were something like this: Clare sat on the couch. Henry poured himself a drink. Gomez raised his eyebrow at Henry. Clare told Henry not to drink. That is essentially how she wrote the entire novel.

214,7897240,10/18/2007,4.0,"I originally read this about five years ago when it was a super popular best seller and absolutely loved it. I recall recommending it freely, only to be chagrined later on with the realization that the book is really not intended for the sensitive reader. With my first reading, Niffenegger managed to ""smoke and mirror"" her way around the book's frequent crude language and descriptive love scenes because Time Traveler's plot was so incredibly original.After attempting a discussion with a friend who very recently read it, I realized most of my memory of the book was too faded for a legitimate conversation. I picked up the enormous hardbound copy at the library and quickly found myself escaping in the tricky time traveling romance and doomed love story once again. It really is such a fantastic idea and when I finished, I found myself still scratching my head in wonder about how Niffenegger got the idea for this book in the first place, and feeling slightly overwhelmed by its desperate ending.The smoke and mirrors weren't as effective the second time around, however, as I felt more offended by the crude language used by both Clare and Henry. I'm not a prude who regards all language as inappropriate, and think sometimes the character's background or emotional outburst warrants the feeling such language manages to evoke. But it felt really unnecessary most of the time. Clare and Henry are both such smart characters, so capable of better verbs and adjectives. Additionally, neither seems particularly rash or impetuous - so their casual dropping of vulgar words only seemed...vulgar.If you care about those things, you probably won't enjoy this book.

224,1926628678,11/30/2017,3.0,"I read The Time Traveler’s Wife when I was young and it absolutely entranced me, so I was very excited to revisit it for /r/fantasy’s Time Travel bingo square.The Time Traveler’s Wife is at its core a love story between main characters Henry and Claire. But because Henry is a time traveler, Claire meets Henry when she is eight and he is forty, and Henry meets Claire when they are both in their twenties. The novel’s main strength is its incredible romantic core. The main characters’ love for each other is obvious – and almost painful in intensity.I also love how the book blends genres – it is a wonderful mesh of sci-fi and romance. Each are given equal weight and respect.Though others disagree, saying the time travel sections can make it confusing to keep track of where characters are in time, the structure of the book works well for me. Even when only a few paragraphs are spent in one time, I never felt lost or disembodied from the story. I was worried when I started listening to it, since I feel like audiobooks can amplify ambiguities or confusions in books (plus, you can’t refer back to the chapter header if you lose track of time). But I never felt lost.There is one major content issue which I’m not sure how to address, and which ultimately affected my score of this book. Claire’s family is very wealthy and employs a black cook. Henry’s downstairs neighbor and beloved babysitter is Korean. Both of them speak with heavy accents and play into racial stereotypes. I’m not sure if it was a result of the voice actors in the audiobook (which I otherwise enjoyed quite a bit) or how the dialogue was written, but their accents and mannerisms came across as cringe-worthy and insulting. The black cook is particularly disturbing to me – she is the family’s Mammy in pretty much every way. Claire’s family - all rich, white, and “proper”- treat her like a “treasured servant”. Gross.Although those disturbing parts of The Time Traveler’s Wife are very minor in terms of number of words, they stick out horrendously in an otherwise romantic and fascinating present-day sci-fi.",6,0.9708,0.081,0.776,0.143,0.5882010582010584,POSITIVE,0.9986
225,1954688327,07/25/2020,5.0,"4.5 or 5 StarsReview:I read this book for the first time during the worst period my life. Learn from my mistakes and heed my advice: Do NOT read this during the worst times of your life. Or do, if you want the full experience of really feeling the depression the characters feel. Seriously though, my own emotions just amplified the emotions in the book and vice versa, and it was an intense reading experience.This book is heavy. It's a love story, but it's not a light, heartwarming one. It starts out sweet and adorable and quirky, and then it slowly gets darker and heavier as you realize all the struggles Henry and Clare have to go through because of his time traveling. I know love stories usually have struggles, it's part of what separates them from romances, but this is A LOT of struggle. And a lot of feels. I think I actually shed some tears, which is a rare occurrence.But, at the same time, it's amazing. I've read it twice now, and both times I thought it was amazing.Premise: For one thing, it's such a unique, unusual, interesting premise. It's a love story, and it's time travel, but they're combined in such a different way than what you normally find. The description was so confusing to me when I first read it, but it made sense once I started the book.Time Travel: For me, this is the perfect version of time travel, the only version that I feel makes sense. One where you can't change anything because everything that's going to happen has already happened. If, in the future, you're going to travel to the past and do something, that thing has already been done in the past. Again, if it sounds confusing here, don't worry, it makes sense in the book. It's also such an interesting, thought-provoking idea to explore. Imagine what it would be like to live that way. To meet your past and future self. To know everything that's going to happen has already happened. To run into people who have memories with you that you don't have yet, because those memories are with your future self who traveled into their past, or vice versa. I also found it very amusing imagining what Henry's coworkers must have thought of him, constantly finding him naked in the stacks, thinking he had an exhibitionism fetish or something.Characters: Equally important to the amazingness of this book was the characters. These characters and their lives were so realistically messy. Clare was often judgmental and could be harsh, not to mention a pretty bad friend to Cherise. Henry could be cold, and apparently he was a jerk to all the other women he dated, though it's hard to know if he really was or not since we basically just have his reputation to go by, not actual events. I feel like his negative qualities and actions were more to do with his time travel though. He had to adapt to survive, so he did things like breaking and entering, pickpocketing, and other forms of thievery because he needed clothes and money when he found himself displaced in time. Well, he also used his time traveling to win the lottery and make money in stocks, so I guess he wasn't entirely altruistic, but that was he and Clare and their friends using that to their advantage, not just him. But both Henry and Clare had rough lives growing up, with family difficulties. As adults, they had other struggles, often relating to Henry's time travel disorder. If nothing else, I think they tried to be better parents than theirs were, and to be good to each other. Then there were all the other characters. To be honest, I'm not sure anyone in this book was particularly likeable, other than Kimy, Nell, and Alba. But, again, they were so well-written and believable, and that made them, and the whole story, interesting. And I do believe this was a case where any problematic elements were the characters, not the book or the author. The characters were just realistically flawed.Relationship: As for the relationship, it's such a core element of the story that everything in the book revolves around it, so everything in my review applies to it. It wasn't a romance with sexy angst and long, eloquent speeches no one would ever say in real life. But these two were right for each other, I believed their love, and their relationship was just as realistic and imperfect as they were.Plot: There wasn't really a plot? And I didn't care? No, that's not a fair way of putting it. Plenty of things happened. It's just that there was no end goal the characters were working toward. It was just Henry's and Clare's lives, their relationship, their struggles. But I never got bored or antsy the way I often do with meandering plots. Also, this story is told in a non-linear way, and while I'm normally not a fan of that, it was absolutely necessary here. The order in which this was told was the order that made sense.Writing: The writing itself was also just very good. Sometimes beautiful. Sometimes comical. It flowed so well and sucked me in.Audiobook: I listened to the audiobook the second time. I liked the narrator for Henry's POV, Fred Berman. He sounded natural and emotive, both in narration and dialogue. He changed his way of speaking to match the mood and vibe of each scene or line. He used different enough voices or accents for characters that I could usually tell who was speaking. Female voices sounded ok enough so as not to bother me. I didn't like the narrator for Clare's POV though, Phoebe Strole. She was alright doing the narration and dialogue for Clare, but when it came to men, especially Henry, it didn't sound natural. She would speak in a more stiff way, not with the right attitude or emotion, in my opinion. And her voices for male characters were basically just her very feminine voice, but a little stiffer. I would still recommend the audiobook though, if you enjoy or need audiobooks.Overall Thoughts: This book is just incredibly well-written. The way it pulls you in. How realistic and believable everything feels. This is one of those books where everything is so complex and believable that sometimes it's genuinely hard to believe anyone could have created all of this in their head, that it didn't actually happen. It's just a fantastic, emotional, creative, well-written, complex, thought-provoking book!*Content and Trigger Warnings* (some of these might be minor spoilers, but I've hidden the big spoilers): Miscarriages (some of which are graphic) and difficulty conceiving.

229,108313474,06/22/2010,1.0,"I put this book on hold in the library and for a year, I waited. Perhaps that was the downfall of my opinion of this book, because in that time I waited, my expectations grew for this novel. The praise surrounding it was deafening not to mention the fact that the movie was one of the movies I had wanted to see that year. I finally got my hands on this book and when I began reading it, my heart sank with every page. The writing was meh, I don't understand why there's so much praise for Niffenegger's writing skills since I've read young adult books with better writing, heck fanfiction with better writing. The characters of Clare and Henry were highly dislikeable. I'm not a cold-hearted person; I root for my characters, I scream profanities at the antagonists yet I did neither for this book. The beginning was awkward (the dinner scene with Clare dumping shitloads of plot on an oblivious Henry) and the development of Clare and Henry's relationship could have been improved (too...much...sex). Furthermore, Henry's encounters with a youthful Clare were just plain weird. I just don't see how Clare could have fallen in love with Henry who was literally 30 years older than her at the time. What five years old sees a naked man appear in their backyard and just accepts it the way Clare does? The aforementioned annoyances were bearable; the side characters however, were not. It seems that the author thought that as long as she had Clare and Henry be somewhat three dimensional (and she was even lacking on that), the other characters could get a free ride. It was painful to read the descriptions of the other characters, especially the minorities, who were beyond stereotypical (vivacious, larger-than-life black cook and a loving korean landlord with an accent). The love square of Clare-Henry-Gomez-Charisse was annoying and useless. Gomez has sex and then marries Charisse all the while in love with Clare. Charisse knows Gomez loves Clare and stays with Gomez regardless and even has kids with this lowlife. And Clare, sweet, Bella-like Clare, kisses Gomez even though she knew that was her best friend's husband right there. That's real friendship. Oh and the only male gay character in the novel has AIDS. Yep, defying stereotypes one at time.The sex in this book also surprised me. I'm all for romance and sex when appropriate but it got to a point where Clare and Henry would be having an introspective conversation and Clare would reach for Henry's dick randomly or Henry would be groping Clare's boobs. Perhaps Niffenegger wanted to portray them more ""realistically"" but it was hard to take these characters seriously with them fucking every few pages. It was almost as if they weren't emotionally attached but rather just physically attracted.The book got a tad better in the second half, but that was only because the characters were slightly more mature and were put into situations that squeezed every drop of sympathy from the reader. Unfortunately, I was not attached whatsoever to these characters by that time and thus, the ending had little effect on me.Overall, I highly disliked the book. The premise was good but otherwise, the writing was sloppy and the characters irritated me to no end.",6,0.9249,0.08,0.815,0.106,0.5419770408163267,NEGATIVE,1.0
230,1037270558,08/26/2014,1.0,"I don’t often hate books, but this has to be one of the worst I’ve ever read. Right off the bat, we get probably the grossest thing about it: the extreme age difference. Thanks to the time travel, Henry and Clare spend lots of time together when he is in his thirties and she’s a child and a teenager. Their whole early relationship stinks of child grooming. They perv on each other during pretty much all of Clare’s teenage years, and wait for the earliest possible opportunity to have sex on Clare's 18th birthday. While Henry is 41. The whole thing is generally icky. During this time, Henry also says that Clare’s “not like other girls” as if it’s a compliment, which should have been a clue for her to run far, far away. As the book progresses, it becomes increasingly clear that none of the characters are even remotely likeable. Henry is brooding and mean, and Clare has zero personality beyond being in love with Henry, constantly thinking about Henry, mooning over Henry, whining about Henry's time-travel disappearances when he can’t control them, wondering when Henry will show up and give her pathetic empty life some purpose…you get the idea. She’s one of those characters who thinks she’s mature and worldly, but she never stops being a child.What’s more, racial stereotypes are everywhere. Clare’s obnoxiously rich family (read: they dress for dinner) employs black servants, who come into the dining room for Christmas dinner as a special treat. Henry’s surrogate mother Kimmy speaks in a horrific “ambiguously Asian” accent. Also homophobia. Henry viciously beats a guy for calling him gay, and this comes after Henry’s two 15-year-old selves make out with each other — but no homo. The whole first half of the book is kind of a foregone conclusion: after several hundred pages of contrived conflict, Henry and Clare finally marry, but the contrived conflict doesn’t stop as they try to have a child and face infertility issues. That whole storyline is stale and boring, and brings out yet more of the characters’ annoying traits. At one point, Henry suggests adoption (which is really the only logical solution to their problem). Clare refuses, saying that adoption is “fake” and “pretending.” Henry, however, is no better: he blames Clare for her persistence in trying to have a child. He literally says that she’s “torturing” him, and feels like she’s ruined sex for him now. Grow up, both of you.As for the writing itself, it’s mostly nothing special, punctuated with a few truly awful lines such as “I’m not quite Auschwitz-thin” and “it is so thin and transparent you could see through it.” “She is pale under her makeup” is also tossed around more than once.Finally, Niffenegger really needs to stop with the pointless name dropping of artists/musicians/philosophers/random constructivists who have no relevance to the story and serve no purpose other than to make herself sound smart.

231,1010015989,07/29/2014,4.0,"Although this did take me a while to read, I was revisiting a previous love. The one thing that always stood out for me was how Niffenegger makes the non-linear narrative work so effortlessly. Normally I would frown upon reading a book that doesn’t flow in chronological order or, in this case, one that switches between time and narrators in such a short space of text. But, once you get used to this and how it is a defining part of the story, it is difficult not to embrace it and enjoy the lack of predictability.I love the whole concept of someone who can time travel. One of my favourite films is ‘Back to the Future’ but this is in no way similar. Forget the Delorian and a mad scientist, when Henry experiences intense emotion he finds himself transporting to another place, unfortunately ending up butt naked at his new destination. The near-misses he experiences with the law and the confusion he causes with his work colleagues at the library were particularly intriguing, especially the incident with the Cage…The relationship between Clare and Henry is endearing. Clare is the backbone to the relationship, the steady rock that progresses through time whilst Henry’s own memories are being jiggled around. As Clare is growing up, you can’t help but wonder how she and Henry will wind up married, especially as it feels as if she is waiting for the next appearance of Henry. Henry’s protectiveness towards Clare is sweet and as the novel reaches its climax, you know he is doing everything in his power to make sure she is strong right towards the end.What I really enjoyed was how Clare and Henry shared his unique disorder with those around them, from the doctor to their close friends. I was always sceptical about how soon they seemed convinced Henry was telling the truth but then, with his strange behaviour and inexplicable ageing between encounters, I guess it was the only explanation that could really make sense to them. As I was reading this novel, I did wonder whether it would work if Niffenegger included some sections from those closest to Henry, such as Alba, Gomez or Ingrid. It certinaly would add another dimension to the story but I figure it would mean the novel would lose its charm.If you have seen the film adaptation of this novel, I would still recommend you reading ‘The Time Traveler’s Wife’. It is so different to other books out there and has so many plot elements that it will keep you guessing as much as Henry is with where he will next end up!",6,0.9829,0.067,0.807,0.126,0.5434104332360146,NEGATIVE,0.7963
232,1430558435,11/01/2015,4.0,"I've just read some very harsh reviews of this book here on Goodreads. The clash with my own immediate impression, which was overwhelmingly good, has left me a little queasy. The criticisms are totally on point: the marginalisation of people of colour and anyone below the prescribed tax-bracket, the cataloguing of fancy food, obscure authors and punk bands by the dozen in a misdirected attempt to lend weight and depth to the characters, the belly-flop of the second half, which was both interminable and meekly fatalistic. Also, the fact that Henry pitched up butt-naked and middle-aged to scribble all over Clare's childhood blank pages ('for men to write on', of course) would piss me off more if she had ever taken the time to resist, to struggle, to try to reclaim her own destiny. But she never did. No conflict, wrote one reviewer: if any conflict arises, it's quickly put to bed and never heard from again. From alcoholism and recovery to Henry's angsty, shitty, sexist younger self, Niffenegger likes to play with ugly character traits, but is much too quick to bury them.I'm grateful to these reviewers for spilling the guts of this book so I could paw through them. I was troubled by many of these aspects, but overall my experience was great. Part of it is the sci-fi nerd within, who adored this take on time-travel. I also thoroughly enjoyed all the sex, because I love sex, and Clare and Henry's intimacy (emotional and physical) pleased me, perhaps because this is my first taste of genre romance in years. Plus, I've never seen the movie, and I didn't know the book was sickeningly popular or featured in Oprah's book club, although in retrospect it seems inevitable. I confess I gain substantial personal satisfaction from reading books about nesting, eating, cuddling, just being together in a comfortable space, being alive together. I cannot expect other readers to share the hibernatory pleasure I took in those passages, however, and I don't want to read another, similar novel again any time soon. On another level, this book made me hyper-aware of the fragility of time, and how quickly it passes, and how contingent and tyrannical it can be. I've seen Niffenegger shot down half a hundred times by now, but ultimately, I took great pleasure in consuming her work. Lay it down to one-third naive middle-class wish-fulfilment, one-third glorious sci-fi and one-third writing and a plot that captured my mind and my heart.

233,2010585850,05/25/2017,1.0,":::::::::THIS REVIEW IS HIDDEN; IF YOU ARE EASILY OFFENDED, DO NOT READ THIS REVIEW:::::::::First, I have tried reading this book twice. Each time I could not finish. The first time I read it, I barely got through 50 pages and threw it down in disgust and confusion and the second time, I read just past 250 pages [give or take - it took me forever to read it as well] when I threw it down in disgust and confusion. Second, I HATED this book. Actually, I am not sure that hate is a strong enough word. Not only was it confusing and convoluted but it was so creepy and hit almost everyone of my ICK factors over and over. Third, Henry is a creepy creeper who creeps around, essentially seducing his wife [and giving her clues as to their future] at different stages of her life [even AFTER his multiple promises to NOT do that very thing] which as time is SUPER CREEPY AND GROSS. And truly, if I was a parent and found out about this man creeping on my 10 year old daughter, I do not care what his story was, I would be in jail for killing him, or maiming him in a way that it would have been difficult for him to recover. Fourth, to quote a dear friend of mine [Joy Walsh], ""I will say that I don't often dismiss books because I don't like the characters. Usually I just focus on some other element and realize characters are like people, and I like some and dislike some. However, I genuinely dislike both of them, and I don't care about them, their ""romance"" [and that is stretching that a WHOLE lot], or science fiction time travel. That doesn't leave me much...""^^ I too genuinely did not like either character; you read what I didn't like about Henry and Claire was just whiny and annoying and I just wanted to be done with her. There wasn't any romance here; this [to me] was compulsive, pervy obsession that just got weirder and weirder. Add some pretty vulgar sex scenes and sexuality and the very idea of romance flies out of the window. Fifth, the book was SO. FREAKING. LONG. Way too long. WAY. WAY. WAY. too long. Like 250 - 300 pages to long. This book is truly horrible. I know that so many people love and adore this book, and while they are entitled to that opinion and love, I will say I will never understand why. I will never recommend it to anyone ever.

234,922448068,04/27/2014,2.0,"I would often assert that my critical reviews are objective -- I will dock a book stars for poor pacing, internal contradictions, flaws in character psychology, mundane writing, and so forth. My criticism of this book, I freely admit, is subjective. But here it is, with the hopes that it will help someone decide whether it is a good pick for them:I feel like Niffenegger focuses on strangely unappealing aspects of her characters' lives. It's not that I need the book to be utterly, impractically romantic and joyful. I could deal with some angst or anger, or even some dry science as these characters sort out their complicated premise. But, to illustrate my point by taking the it to the extreme -- you don't really want Jane Austen to tell you about Mr. Darcy going to the bathroom, right? You don't need to account for everything Holden Caulfield eats for lunch. Presumably you don't regret the lack of any passages about Pip's auto erotic habits during adolescence in Great Expectations. I would say Niffenegger lacks that inner editor suggesting that she eliminate some of her material about the rather base thoughts and actions of her characters. Either she's making them unlikable without meaning to by making them so aggressively common and NOT romantic... or else she set out to write a story with a male lead who isn't much of a romantic hero, yet she cloaked it (and the publishers compounded the problem) as a romantic tale, which ends up leaving an increasingly bitter taste in your mouth every time Henry is a disappointment. Henry is extraordinary only because he travels in time. I can't be the only reader who wishes that there were something a little more extraordinary about his character, imagination, or heart.

235,1047277960,09/06/2014,5.0,"I don't intentionally seek out romance type novels, but I seem to have read a few that cross over into my reading comfort zone just recently. 'Outlander' and 'The Night Circus' being the two most recent, then this one.This book is the story of Clair and Henry. Claire is a normal woman, but Henry is am involuntary time traveler. He begins to travel back from the future and visits Clair frequently, starting when she is only 6. This leads up to the unusual situation that when they first meet in 'real time', Claire has known Henry for most of her life, but he has never met her in his current timeline. From there it's a time travelling romance that jumps between the two POV's of Claire and Henry and various points in time. Each chapter is headed with their current ages of Claire and Henry in that section of the story, so that helps immensely in the comprehension. (For this reason, I do not think I would have been able to follow this is I had listened to the audio version.) It's also worth noting that Niffenegger breaks one of the unwritten rules of time travel novels. Henry goes back in time and meets himself. In fact, it's an important part of the plot in several places. Henry travels goes back in time to help himself out of some scrapes.This is a great book and I really enjoyed the story and how characters and the time travel all meshed together. This would be a 4 star book, but I'm going to give it 5 as I can appreciate the amount of work the author must have put into bringing the numerous flashbacks and foreshadowing references together. It's a very complex book and well worth reading. ",6,0.9915,0.0,0.866,0.134,0.4035632183908046,POSITIVE,0.9992
236,1966445098,04/11/2017,4.0,"Each moment that I wait feels like a year, an eternity. Each moment is as slow and transparent as glass. Through each moment I can see infinite moments lined up, waiting. Why has he gone where I cannot follow?There are many poetic passages sprinkled throughout this novel, making it worth exploring (that is, if you can suspend a basic belief and take up the idea of time traveling...no easy feat). It's also set in Chicago, and has wonderful descriptions of the mood and atmosphere of the city at its best, even some compelling descriptions of winter there.However, this is not a novel grounded. The idea of time travel is difficult enough to swallow whole, but then the author makes readers suspend reality even more by letting the character of Henry (the time traveler) double up in certain passages. For this reader, that was simply a step too far.There's also the very Lolita-like meetings between the young Clare and middle aged Henry, which have a slightly creep feeling to them, although Henry is very virtuous and Clare overly eager to explore their adult relationship. Still, ick. And, it makes a weird contrast to what was going on in Henry's real life as he was knocking heads and taking no prisoners in a full-on bout of alpha male gone punk.

Many of histime-traveling experiences are linked to Clare - a woman that he meetsat various times and places in her life, and falls in love with.Primarily a love story, the book focuses on the difficulties caused inHenry and Clare's relationship by his frequent disappearances, and thedangers faced by Henry (inherent in showing up at a random location,vulnerable, disoriented and naked). There is also the awkwardnesscaused by the fact that Henry often meets Clare when she is a childand he is an adult. The disjunction of the two meeting at differentpoints in time, from different perspectives on life and theirrelationship is handled very well.I liked how the time-travelling was placed in context of a newailment, shared by others, and a focus of research, but I wish thatmore page time had been given to such a disorder's larger impact onsociety. The book almost gives a sense of tunnel vision - Clare is sosolely focused on Henry that the world recedes. this makes senseespecially considering (SPOILERS) that after Henry's death, she spendsthe entire rest of her life waiting for him, with the knowledge thatshe will see him for one last moment. The book tries to position thisas a romantic and beautiful thing, but I couldn't see it as anythingelse but a tragic waste of life. ",6,0.7383,0.076,0.818,0.106,0.4972222222222221,NEGATIVE,0.948

Impossible but true, because Henry finds himself periodically displaced in time, pulled to moments of emotional gravity from his life, past and future. His disappearances are spontaneous, his experiences amusing, unpredictable, and devastating. It has been interesting to read the vast range of reviews for this book on Amazon. If you go in expecting a sweet love story, or a classic time-travel novel, you will be greatly disappointed. But, if you start without preconceptions, it is a remarkable achievement. I almost believe this is a book which speaks differently to each reader, based upon their own experiences. I approached this book with some hesitation, found it a bit difficult in the beginning, but became rapidly involved, and almost compelled to keep going. I shan’t express my personal reaction, except to say I can certainly see why the publisher awarded the author their highest ever advance.I did, however, feel the rather brutal scene toward the end was unnecessary and it negatively colored my view of the book.

My problems with the book are mostly technical. These are things that snap me back into reality, jolt me out of the story.1. Run on sentences: If there are two or more instances of ""and"" in a sentence, it might be time to break it up into more sentences. If 70% of the sentences in your book are like that, it might be time to go back to school. It wasn't so bad coming from Clare's six-year-old voice because kids tend to talk like that, and it's okay sometimes when used to make the reader feel like things are moving fast, but everywhere else it's annoying.2. Commas: Too many. Some sentences had so many commas in strange places I couldn't even be sure what the author was trying to say. And semicolons. I've never seen so many semicolons in one book before. Sometimes it's okay to just start a new sentence.3. Unforgivable: One unforgivable use of ""would of."" As in, ""I would of done that."" If you have to say it that way, use ""would've.""

I suppose that the way to get a sci-fi book to succeed is to not market it as a sci-fi book. This book is 100% a time travel novel, and it's done quite cleverly. The time traveler in question has a genetic mutation that makes him spontaneously time travel, so he lands in various times and places quite naked. He often runs into himself, but he also meets his wife when he's an adult and she's a child. While she has known him all her life, he only knows her during his adulthood. It wasn't difficult to figure out where the book was going and when the roller coaster was going to plunge downhill. However, the process of reading the novel was quite satisfying.

Part 1 also does what the book promises. It’s romantic and has relationship complications due to Henry time traveling without a choice. The time traveling is explained but not well. However it is easy to follow compared to other time traveling books/ movies. Probably the biggest issue I had was the stereotype that this book had toward every minority character, but I do remember that this book was written in the early 2000’s and society wasn’t as progressive as a whole at that time. Part one deserves a solid 4 STARS.  Part 2 kept the flaws that Part 1 had (stereotypes and not well explained time travel) and removed other things that made Part 1 so enjoyable. The tone in part 2 is way different, it is depressing and makes life itself feels like misery. The book is also not well written and feels like it’s allow over the place (kinda like my reviews 🙂).

277,68767722,08/24/2009,1.0,"Was anyone else bothered by the borderline-pedophilic nature of Claire and Henry's relationship? Am I just a prude?[Update, now that I've finished the book:] ***WARNING: SPOILERS***I was really wanting to like the book, because of the hype, but first the fact that adult Henry visits 6-year-old Claire bothered me, as I already mentioned, because it just seemed creepy. Especially when she turns 12 and wants to marry him.Then she's a teenager, and tries to get him to ""get physical"" with her. And he's twice her age. He agrees to go with her to a party, when she's 16 and he's 32. She's wearing a very short skirt, and he notices this, enough to point it out in his narration. The two of them going on a ""date"" was not OK with me. Their having sex when she's 18 and he's 42 was really not OK with me. Yes, I know ""she wanted it"" (even though her body language showed maybe she didn't), but she's a teenager, and he's an adult. And the whole he's-been-stalking-her-since-she-was-six thing.But, besides that, I found Claire and adult Henry to be very selfish. I grew to highly dislike Claire, I did not sympathize with her at all. She was a spoiled little rich girl and couldn't see much past her own experiences (I was livid when she told the doctor he would have a little girl, named Nadia: Claire might be used to having someone tell her what's going to happen in her life, but the doctor was trying to process the birth of his first child -- and the stuff Henry was telling him -- and she just tells him this other info? She had no business telling him that).The book was depressing not because of the time-traveling, oh-they-can't-be-together thing. Adult Henry came into Claire's life and told her what her life would be. She never dated anyone else (yes, she went on a date or two, but she was not dating. She was passing the time until she met Henry; she never gave any of those guys a chance), so how did she know she wanted to be with Henry? Because he told her so?Then, when she meets present-time Henry, he dates Claire because she tells him to. He's in a relationship with someone else, and can't even be bothered to call her and break up before he has Claire spend the night. And Claire doesn't even LIKE present-time Henry! She thinks he's self-centered and immature -- she says so the night of the concert, when Old Henry shows up.Both of these people are conned into this relationship. Adult/Old Henry made it happen, taking choice, free will, away from Claire and from himself. That, to me, was selfish and depressing.Because of how I feel about motherhood and children's rights, I also had a huge problem with Claire's reasons for wanting a child. And refusing to adopt. But I know I have hang-ups with that, so I won't say more.I was also bothered by the fact that pretty much every time Claire, a Catholic girl who believes in God (even though she was supposed to have stopped believing at one point? Henry told us, but I never saw it), refers to having sex with her husband, the love of her life, her soul mate, her ultimate one-and-only (since she never gave anyone else a try) as ""fucking."" Henry says ""making love,"" but Claire says ""fucking."" Also, after she gives birth to Alba -- after her body produces the miracle of life -- she says ""my cunt hurts."" Really? It's not your vagina? It's your cunt? Your daughter just came through there. Can you show your body a little more respect, please? It just did something amazing for you.I liked the way the story was narrated by Claire and Henry. But I was not caught up in the story. If I had been reading the paper book, instead of listening to the audio book, I probably would not have finished reading it (even though I hate quitting a book.

278,1519284610,01/21/2016,4.0,"Ugh, how can I start this review? Well, this is my second time to finish The Time Traveler's Wife, and still I almost cried. It’s heart-breaking and wrenching but the thing is, it will leave you the idea of FOREVER. 
Yes, there’s a FOREVER.
 The Time Traveler’s Wife is a debut novel of Audrey Niffenegger which is a sci-fi romance. It is about a man named Henry, who is for some scientific reason can time travel (apparently everyone would know that based on the title). The story begins when Henry met Clare at the age of six while he is thirty-six. Henry can be at different times without him wanting it and it seems like this surreal “sickness” or whatever someone would consider it is the cause of everything. As Clare and Henry ride their journey of love, time traveling will halt them to live a normal life. I’d be more subjective with this review.At first I was so confused with the time setting. But as I read on, I learned how to cope up with it. And it is as if, I was also time traveling. :)I like how the story was written because it is in two POVs, it’s Clare’s and Henry’s. Knowing what their thinking made me understand the story better. Plus, I was able to relate in what they’re feeling. When it comes to the setting(s), oh well it’s very peculiar. I mean, since Henry can time travel, you’d see him in different places. But what I like the most is of course the meadow, where it all began. I can picture in my mind how everything happened romantically in the meadow. Every time they’re in that place, I smiled because they’re so sweet! :) There’s no need to state who my fave characters are. It's very obvious But who I like the most is Alba. Her attitude is astounding and to have a child like her would definitely be perfect. (Oh but I hope not a time traveler because though it’d be amazing, it’d be really difficult) LOL XDI know I’ve said that it’s heart-breaking but at the same time, this kind of love story can be a proof that no matter what happens, if someone really loves you he’d be willing to sacrifice everything. While reading this novel, I was thinking if what if I could time travel? That would be really cool and I have the ability to forewarn my loved ones with what is about to happen but of course there’d be consequences. What is really noteworthy for me is the fact that Clare loved Henry despite of the hindrance to live a normal life. And the latter chapters? The ENDING? Ohmigod, I sobbed. T'was really a beautiful catastrophe.I was imagining if this would happen in real life? I don’t know if this would chaos or peace. I JUST DON’T KNOW. I also like how the story had been attached to science and philosophy. Opposite really attracts, because I’ve seen in this story how well the science and religion blended peacefully. 
The impossibility has become a possibility.
I also like the cover of the book because it really says a lot. It's cute and at the same time, it's very meaningful. :) Oh, I know this would be unnecessary but it's lack of some ""remarkable lines"". Some unforgettable quotes that I would be tempted to post on my blogs or something. If that makes sense. XDBut still, it's 4.5 stars for me! No wonder this had become a movie and I wanna watch it (yep I haven't watched it). XP I recommend this book to those who love the idea of great love and time-traveling. ;) ",5,0.9995,0.044,0.689,0.267,0.6034970238095237,POSITIVE,0.908
279,1030670000,08/19/2014,5.0,"Every once in a while, not very often, you come across a book that surprises you, that leaves you with goosebumps after having read the last page, maybe even makes you shed some tears. When that happens, it’s party time. When that happens with a book you would have never chosen yourself but was adviced to you by a friend and you kind of started reading it, thinking “we”ll see…”, it’s double party time. “The time traveler’s wife” is this kind of book. Stunningly beautiful, beyond words.The book tells the rather unusual love story between Henry and Clare. Okay, a love story. What’s so unusual about that, given the dozens of love stories cluttering the shelves in the bookstores worldwide? What makes it interesting is the fact that Henry is a time traveler. Due to some special coding in his genes, he lives not only in the present, but pops up in the past, or the future for that matter, leaving nothing but a pile of clothes on the floor wherever he vanished and arriving butt naked at his destination. No one knows when it will happen, what time he’s coming from or what decade he’s travelling to. It is specifically this time traveling aspect that made me have doubts about the book. As a facts- and number loving economist/realist with an enormous lack of fantasy, I don’t like stories about things that are not possible. I just don’t. I can’t be bothered reading about ghosts, vampires, any kind of star trek/ star wars phenomena, let alone science fiction or fantasy things with dwarfs and trolls and more of the kind. You can serve me any story you want, but at least it has to be possible. I have to be able to imagine it happening…in real life. So when I started reading this book and was confronted with a Henry who was both 28 and 36 at the same time; a Henry who meets his wife Clare at age 36, only to marry her at age 30, I honestly thought I wouldn’t even last 50 pages in the book.I was wrong. The time traveler’s wife turns out to be a story that grasps you from the beginning to the end. The unconditional love between Clare and Henry is the red thread in the story; their numerous attempts to lead an as normal life as possible, while dealing with Henry’s condition, as well as all the emotions going with it, make the book the great book it is. The time traveling leads to funny situations (how can one explain to appear butt naked at work, how can Henry explain to 6-year old Clare that he is her husband in the future), sad situations (Henry knowing things that will happen in the future but being unable to tell his beloved ones) as well as peculiar situations. But whatever happens, the love between Clare and Henry stands. What I liked a lot about the book is both the Chicago background Audrey Niffenegger weaves within her story (living in Chicago, she includes many famous and less famous places of the city in the book) which makes it more “true” and “realistic” to me (hey, I ran along lake Michigan just last year, like Henry does in the book), but especially the eye for detail and the fact that the story holds. I mean: with all the time traveling and hopping backwards and forwards in time, it would be very easy to have holes in the story, or storylines that either aren’t developed or are plain opposite as to what was written before. Even though this book is 593 pages long, if you drew a time line and wrote every event on it, the story would come together perfectly. Respect for that.A book to read and read again. As I suspect that with every read, the pieces of the puzzle will fall more and more into place.",5,0.998,0.046,0.799,0.155,0.5835662525879917,POSITIVE,0.708
280,84570543,01/11/2010,5.0,"ONE OF MY ALL-TIME FAVOURITE BOOKS!!!I was talking to a friend about this book recently, and while explaining it to her, I was essentially writing a review, so I figured I’d post it.It’s the story of Henry and Clare and their incredible love story against all odds. Henry has a condition which makes him ‘jump’ back and forth in time. He has a life in real time, but he just leaves it – sometimes for a couple of hours, sometimes for a couple of days – before reappearing and picking up where he left off. He never knows when it’s going to happen, or where he’s going to end up when he travels, but it’s always within a relatively close timeframe, and he usually sees the same people. So he sees himself as a child, and he sees a lot of Clare, from her childhood, right through to her young adulthood. The timeframe in the story jumps around all over the place as we follow Henry’s travels, but the story essentially starts when Henry meets Clare for the first time. Clare already knows him, as the older Henry has been visiting her all throughout her childhood. So she’s ecstatic to see him, even though he has no clue who she is.  “This astoundingly beautiful amber-haired tall slim girl turns around and looks at me as though I am her personal Jesus. My stomach lurches. Obviously she knows me, and I don't know her. Lord only knows what I've said, done, or promised to this luminous creature … The girl sort of breathes ""Henry!"" in this very evocative way that convinces me that at some point in time we have a really amazing thing together. This makes it worse that I don't know anything about her, not even her name. I say ""Have we met?"" and Isabelle gives me a look that says You asshole. But the girl says, ""I'm Clare Abshire. I knew you when I was a little girl,"" and invites me out to dinner. I accept, stunned.…I realize that a massive winning lottery ticket chunk of my future has somehow found me here in the present, and I start to laugh. I cross the lobby, and as I run down the stairs to the street I see Clare running across Washington Square, jumping and whooping, and I am near tears and I don’t know why.” What follows is the story of their life together. Henry falling in love with her (Clare is already there), and them trying to make a life together while dealing with Henry’s ‘condition’ and searching desperately for a cure. “Don't you think it's better to be extremely happy for a short while, even if you lose it, than to be just okay for your whole life?”Told in dual POV, this is an absolutely beautiful love story. Henry and Clare are both fantastic characters and they love each other deeply. And even though their situation is somewhat based in fantasy, their reactions, and the way they try to cope with it is very realistic. “I won't ever leave you, even though you're always leaving me.”In addition to their lives in real time, we also get to see Henry’s visits to Clare as a child, and they are absolutely gorgeous! Knowing who she will grow up to become, and what she will mean to him, their relationship is so special, and I loved watching it all unfold. Beautifully written with epic highs and devastating lows, it’s an emotional ride, but an absolutely amazing story. “I love you, always.

282,142470945,01/21/2011,4.0,"Henry was twenty-eight years when he first met the twenty-year-old Clare. Clare, however, had met a thirty-six-year-old Henry when she was six, and they were married when Clare was twenty-three and Henry thirty-one. It’s quite confusing and utterly unbelievable, but not in Audrey Niffeneger’s ground-breaking debut novel, The Time Traveler’s Wife.An unconventional love story, this is perhaps one of the most twisted romances (in a good way) that I have read. The idea about time travel in literature existed ages ago, but this novel turned out to be surprisingly original. I have been a fan of works classified under sci-fi so I liked the main driving force and framework—the genetic Chrono-Displacement disorder—but considering the author’s exceptional prowess, I must say that even those who are not fans of the said genre will like this.I think the “magic” that the author has is that she can make everyone in her pages teem with life, be it a main or just a supporting character who appeared just once. You’ll never see flat characters here—no clichéd interpretation of any kind. For instance, the main characters: Henry DeTamble doesn’t have a very likable personality, as induced by his frequent comings and goings. He’s not able to establish deep relationship with people who he doesn’t meet often during his time hegiras. He is interpreted as simply a human with a disorder, with foibles and shortcomings, but is in himself a hero without being a “Prince Charming” stereotype of today. While Clare Abshire often compares herself to The Odyssey’s Penelope as she waits for Henry, she isn’t one to be counted as a woman who *just* waits. No, she doesn’t act as a damsel in distress—she has her own way of fending for herself and fighting for what she feels.Niffenegger managed to make the story flow smoothly, not letting her audience get lost inspite of the confusing nature of her chosen theme. Every scene charges along at a gallop. Her prose is not florid, but shows enough imagery so the reader can picture out the scenes vividly. Her tone is almost journalistic.She used alternating first person points of view, so the readers are given access to feelings and thoughts of both the main characters, establishing an instant rapport. That, in my opinion, is one of the most important characteristics of a good novel: its ability to draw in those that are reading it.Over all, I say this is an excellent work. I almost can’t believe that it is Niffeneger’s first novel. The foreshadowing, the course of events…it’s all laid out properly. She is able to discuss time, love, loss, patience, destiny, free will, and a lot of other philosophical issues without making the whole thing soporific. A spellbinding tale of two star-crossed lovers, this 500-page book is certainly worth reading.",5,0.997,0.049,0.777,0.174,0.5444444444444445,POSITIVE,0.7881
283,36059532,10/23/2008,5.0,"I LOVED this book. I have seen it on suggested reading lists for years and never really picked it up.Wow, was I impressed. This novel was a really good complex love story. Henry first meets Clare (is future wife) when he is middle aged and she is a grade schooler. At first he is her secret and she finds makes a place for him where she keeps clothes and food-since he time-travels nude. He has been able to time-travel since he was 5 and he has been able to go back and see his own mother when she was pregnant with him and how his parents interacted with him when he was a baby. He can travel to the future and he seems to bounce around time with no real rhyme or reason.When he meets Clare she accepts him as what he is in the way only a child truly can. Eventually she comes to fall in love with him. He is able to discern when he will show up based on information he leaves with Clare or with younger versions of himself.The book has humor-Henry is a librarian and he often disappears at work leaving a pile of clothes in the stacks. He also often appears completely nude in the library. His co-workers and boss seem to think he has a sexual fetish involving being nude in the library and he does not dissuade them the truth being indeed stranger than fiction.There are a few people who know-his father, his neighbor, Clare's best friends husband, an AIDs patient who helps him get drugs to help with his condition.Henry's condition is often caused by stress and so his huge complex and involved wedding is of course an incident waiting to happen. In many ways Henry kind of floats for much of his teens and early 20's-he disappears without rhyme or reason causing problems with him and potential girl friends. He kind of has a cavalier attitude about his life-breaking and entering when he appears nude, fighting vicously when he has stumbled into a violent situation. He is 29 when he first meets Clare and she is 20. Now she has known him from his future visits to her when she is a child, but when she finds at the age of 20 when he is 29 he has no clue who she is. There is also a doctor that eventually helps them.It is interesting how the novel unfolds-Henry and Clare truly love each other in a way I only dream of loving and being loved-not like a fairy tale but in a real sweaty, messy life kind of way. Yet the challenges they face are so unique. In some cases his older self has shared info with Clare that she is not to share with his younger self until a set time. He knows when he dies and how he dies and will not discuss it with Clare. They have rules between them that make the relationship work and it is so interesting how it plays out.Truly a unique book and a heart-rending love story.

284,3656965,07/27/2007,5.0,"I had heard mixed reviews of The Time Traveller’s Wife since its publication in 2004. I didn’t know much about it, except that people seemed to love it or hate it. I can certainly see where these sentiments come from. I read the blurb when ordering books online and was instantly intrigued. So I bought it and have lapped it up over the last week, which is pretty fast considering the amount of uni work I’ve been doing. If I had to describe the novel in terms of genre – well, I’d be pretty stuck for a while, but I think I’d call it a postmodern realist bildungsroman. Most of which is a contradiction in terms, but this book doesn’t work like most books.I’ve found in my reading that throughout the latter half of the twentieth century and into the twenty-first authors have been playing with narrative structure into extremes. Sometimes this works, but sometimes it seems overwhelming. I feel that in The Time Traveller’s Wife it works immensely well, mainly because the strange narrative is intrinsic to the plot. Speaking of, let me tell you a little about it, in case you don’t know.The time traveller of the title is Henry DeTamble, a man with a condition which becomes known as chromo-displacement. His genes are kinda messed up basically, and every so often (usually when stressed) he gets thrown into the past or the future. Perhaps this premise seems very sci-fi, but I’m not a big fan of sci-fi literature, and this hooked me. I think the reason that it’s so easy to buy into is that whenever Henry moves from one time to another, he does so completely naked: anything that is not part of his body is left behind. One of the places he travels to frequently is a clearing in a meadow. This meadow lies behind the childhood home of Clare Abshire: Henry’s wife.Clare first meets Henry when she is six and he is thirty-six, and they get married when she is twenty-two and he is thirty. We see the way the couple muddle through life, with Clare enduring long absences from Henry, one partner constantly with more knowledge of what has been or is to come than the other. Their experiences are heart-warming, funny, sexy and sad.The novel left me with a feeling of both hope and despair, which I think plays off the themes of togetherness and loss, which run throughout the novel. I think, overall, if you enjoy a good love story, and aren’t put off by something different, narrative-wise, then you should give this a try. It really is a love it or hate it kind of book, but don’t let that put you off: you might fall on the ‘love it’ side!",5,0.9899,0.057,0.811,0.133,0.4886408730158731,POSITIVE,0.8661
285,4003521367,05/15/2021,1.0,"The premise of this novel was incredibly interesting. The first part was a solid story, but the latter half rapidly slipped into a melodramatic tearjerker, which was an unexpected, and unpleasant, tonal shift. The romance was bland and undeveloped; the author constantly impresses upon the audience that the two characters are sooo in love, but we don't get to hear much about why; all we learn is that they're in love because Audrey Niffenegger said so. Others have compared this to a Nicholas Sparks novel, which I have to assume is an apt comparison (I've never finished any of his books, and only attempted one).What I can comment on is the name-dropping. I absolutely loathe when an author makes references to other, better works of art or music or theatre or writing, because it just reminds me of how much more enjoyable it would be for me to focus on that (subjectively or objectively) better thing instead of wasting my time with whatever this is. The characters are constantly mentioning classical music composers, entomologists, poetry, various languages, architecture, library sciences, the US-UK punk scene, various historical painters, and the like, all of which make an appearance at inopportune times, contributing nothing to the story or characterisation. A list of things you know exist is not a substitute for a personality! Okay, this character is a punk badass because he liked the Violent Femmes in 1991... or an artistic savant because he knows who László Moholy-Nagy was... or a cultured genius because he gives us a play-by-play of an entire game of pool... I was so bored. And the author's desperate exposition didn't cover up the fact that the entire book was bad science—if you're going to write a story founded on real scientific research, do the research; otherwise, don't try to explain something that you clearly don't understand or even care about!Then, of course, there's the racism and ethnic stereotyping, which others have articulated more thoroughly. In short, Clare's family employs several black servants, including a cook named Nell who is a perfect example of the ""Mammy"" stereotype (during one scene she refers to Clare as ""Miz Abshire""). Another character, Charisse, is Filipina, and described by the white characters as ""childlike."" Yet another woman, Mrs. Kim, speaks cringeworthy broken English and is referred to as ""Kimmy"" by Henry.",5,0.9648,0.097,0.762,0.142,0.5168518518518519,NEGATIVE,1.0
286,34814468,10/08/2008,4.0,"I always meant to read The Time Traveler's Wife by Audrey Niffenegger, and I'm quite glad I finally got round to it. It'd be a quite ordinary love story, really, if it weren't for the fact that the lovers meet when he is thirty-six and she is six, and marry when he is thirty and she is twenty-two. If you take the idea of Henry's genetic clock resetting and thereby pulling him into different times too seriously, then this book will probably just seem absurd. As will, probably, the stuff about the time paradox and free will vs. determinism and so on. It's not particularly heavy on the necessary science or philosophy to make this, say, a believable science fiction book.If you lay that aside and concentrate on the emotional part of the book, it's quite lovely. The idea of living your life all out of order sounds interesting, and scary, and sometimes very hurtful -- and this book gets it right. There's humour, mostly brought by the fact that whenever Henry relocates in time, he ends up stark naked, wherever he ends up. But there's also a lot of pain -- the anxiety about him disappearing during their wedding, the attempts to have a baby, the anxiety about him not being at the hospital... the fact that he dies long before she does, and then she waits for him as an old woman. Parts of it are very real, emotionally, despite the unbelievable premise.Sometimes, technically, the transitions are a little awkward. I think it's a very ambitious kind of book to write, though, and it's hard to say how it could be better done. I did feel that sometimes I couldn't quite tell who was speaking when, and I did have to refer to the section headings a lot, but once I'd been reading solidly for a while I slipped into it quite well. It takes a little getting used to, then it stops being jarring.I loved the fact that when I opened the look to start reading, one of my favourite poems was there next to the beginning of the text, Love After Love, by Derek Walcott.

First, the good… This author has a very engaging writing style. I had no problem keeping up with the many changes of time, place, character, etc. She managed to keep all of these convoluted threads from getting tangled up, and somehow it all made sense. The story was compelling, and kept me interested. Now, the not-so-good (major spoilers ahead)(view spoiler)[•	I could have done without the scene where the young Henry and the older time-traveling Henry get caught in flagrante delicto by his father. How weird is that? To get caught having sex with YOURSELF! Was this really necessary? It added NOTHING to the story whatsoever.•	What the hell happened to the young Clare with that football player? Is this what thwarted teenage boys do? They TORTURE girls that say “no”, to the point of burning their breasts with cigarettes and beating them with belts? Every boy I knew in high school had a perpetual case of blue balls, and none of them resorted to this kind of behavior. I could have at least believed a date-rape situation, but this? And once again, this was not necessary to the storyline at all.•	Clare had sex with the older Henry while lying in bed next to the younger Henry. Thank God, at least the younger one was asleep. Just too strange, and more than a little off-putting.•	Henry dies, and there I am bawling my eyes out. (I told you there would be major spoilers here!) Then Clare is reading a letter that Henry had left for her, professing his undying love for her, and telling her that they will see each other again someday. I am in an emotional vortex, and the author RIPS me out of it in the very next chapter (4 pages into it) by writing that Clare has sex with Gonzo (her best friend’s husband) on the kitchen table. REALLY!  (hide spoiler)]However, I will say that the author took a complicated story, and told it very well.",5,0.9453,0.059,0.85,0.091,0.4375000000000001,NEGATIVE,0.9989
288,1081054396,10/15/2014,5.0,"Loving a book or not usually depends on my mood while reading it. But in this case i think i would've loved this book at any moment.Dramatic life and love of Henry and Clare, this could've been just like any romance but for the bit of fantasy, magic in it. I really loved this book and it touchef my heart in a particular way.The story starts with 6 year old Clare meeting 36 year old Henry for the first time, only 31 year old Henry is already married to 23 year old Clare. How can that be possible. Henry is a time traveler, as incredible as it can be, Clare believes him and spends all her childhood waiting for his unvoluntary visits.I really liked how we followed Clare as she grew up, meeting Henry and collecting details about their lives. Until she finally finds him in real time..I especially liked how the story was told from two points of view, Clare and Henry. Sometimes the same events is told by both of them in different periods and it really makes a difference. That was really interesting!!I liked it how small details kept popping up until the very end, to draw the biggest picture, the complete picture of their lives and love.As incredible as it might be, the story didn't bother me. I loved the idea of time travelling and i kept wondering what would've happened if that first time Henry met Clare he just hide away from her, and all those meeting during her childhood didn't happen? Would the future have changed for them? Would Clare have chosen a different path? Or would still marry him but love him less??It was amazing how i felt involved in the story, dreading the end, crying at the pain they felt..And after finishing it, all that remained was all the "" What if?"" i kept thinking of..I can see why many people didn't enjoy it, but i really loved it, it felt like an open window, a world of possibilities and magic.

He knows her name, he says he loves her, he gets her to steal some food and clothes for him, he says he will see her again, he tells her to keep their meetings a secret.(view spoiler)[Over the following years he does indeed turn up again, always naked, and she again steals food and clothes for him. On her sixteenth birthday they have sex.When she is twenty she goes into the library where he works and sees him. He appears to have no idea who she is and is reluctant to get involved with the grown up, rather lovely woman she has become.They do become involved and eventually marry and have a child. Now he is there most of the time, with sudden disappearances, instead of not there most of the time with sudden appearances. Sometimes he has accidents while he is away and one eventually proves fatal. Before he dies he tells Clare that he will be back, so she waits for him until she is a grey-haired old lady. (hide spoiler)]That is the story from Clare's point of view, although it is not told in that order. Henry is a time traveller, so for him the chronology is different. I suppose the author is to be admired for making a paedophile who grooms a six-year-old girl as sympathetic as she does, but I would really rather she hadn't. Henry completely takes over Clare's life from age six, leaving her with almost no personality or life unless defined by him.The book is also long-winded, over-sentimental and not all that well written. It is more irritating than romantic and heart-breaking. That will teach me not to read over-hyped bestsellers, maybe.",5,-0.6922,0.064,0.895,0.04,0.4276515151515152,NEGATIVE,1.0
290,395863844,08/19/2012,5.0,"24/07 - I thought this book was wonderful, 4.5 stars really. I loved the time travelling aspect - going back and meeting himself or having an older version call him for help in the middle of the night - most time travelling literature makes this impossible due to the paradox of meeting yourself being likely to cause the universe to disintegrate (or so Doc says), so it was nice to have a new take on the subject. It made me sad the amount of times he got beaten up but I realised that the story would be completely different (maybe not even a story at all) if he arrived clothed. No more beatings, he wouldn't need his future or past self, or anyone else nearly as much because he would still be able to steal any food he needed, but he would be doing it clothed and so wouldn't be nearly as conspicuous. There are two reasons why the book doesn't quite get five stars from me - first I didn't like the swearing or some of the words Niffenegger used to describe the sex scenes (after reading some Amazon reviews I have realised I'm not the only one who thinks this). Second, I wish Niffenegger could have come up with a miracle to save Henry, I think that would have been not only a happier ending but a better ending as well. I loved the idea that Alba (not a fan of the name, I always think of Albatrosses when I read it) would become not only a musical prodigy, but a time travelling prodigy too - being able to go when she wants to and finding it ""interesting, if not a bit inconvenient"" instead of painful and ultimately deadly.

292,97585251,04/08/2010,4.0,"Great story that had me from the first word- much better than the movie, btw. It's a bit of a love story with a sci fi twist, and smartly done. The ending is so piercing that it stays with you for quite some time after you read the last word.As I am a huge lover of ""timeline/time travel"" stories (I'm a Star Trek fan from way back!), I have seen my share of this plot in books, movies and tv. Because of this I am a bit jaded. It bugs me when I read or see one that clearly is not plausible. (Not that I think Time travel is plausible, but I at least like it to come close to making me believe it is possible!) This story I have to hold up as one of the best. The sequencing of the time traveling fits even though the author hops around a good bit. Even better the time traveling schtick becomes a character in it's own right!The assumption for the lead character's time traveling is interesting to say the least and I think a new one for me. No ""time machine"" here. Henry, the lead, has a disease that displaces him in time. He shows up naked, and in true ""Quantum Leap"" fashion, not sure exactly where he has turned up in his own lifetime time line.These displacements, are often centered around his once and future wife Clare. The first time she meets him, he is 36 and she 6. When he first meets her he is 28, she's 20, and she has known him for 13 years! Fun isn't it?There are many other touching moments and some not so fun. But I don't want to give anything more away. Just get it, you'll love it!

293,1656864,06/04/2007,2.0,"You know, the further I read along in this, the less I liked it. It was not that I hated it; the prose was solid, the scenario mostly thought through neatly, some of the humourous moments were quite good. In fact, there were one or two very powerful moments--the description of Clare's miscarriages made me cringe.But I could never see Henry and Clare as real people, though; in part because we were told about some aspects of their personality rather than shown them--Henry is selfish, we are told. Why--Clare is dutiful and loving and beautiful and a wonderful artist--why? and in part because their intelligence and conversation seems at times forced, false. There were one or two lines of dialogue which, while not overly implausible, made me blink at the page and think 'Do people really speak like that?'The set-up of the book, while clever, also worked against it the further I progressed. The end of Henry and Clare's story was predictable--and clearly signposted--from very early on. There's this continuous sense of fatedness about the book, inevitability, a lack of free will almost; since I don't think Niffenegger ever gets deep enough into her characters to see how this affects them, I think it makes what are supposed to be the climactic events rather leaden and flat.I think this is probably another example of how my tastes tend towards the opposite of most people's--everyone else I know who has read it has loved it unreservedly.

294,265810747,01/21/2012,3.0,"Henry DeTamble is a librarian who works at the Newberry Library in Chicago. He suffers from Chrono-Impairment which means he’s a time traveler who jumps around a lot from one time to another. Sometimes he gets lost in time and doesn’t know where he is at. Time travel is something he can’t control. He never knows when it’s going to happen but certain symptoms like exhaustion or stress can trigger an episode. It’s hard for Henry to live a normal life and his relationship with his wife, Clare, is sometimes strained because he is always disappearing so he has learned to appreciate the here and now whenever he is in the present because their time together is so sporadic.I don’t take an interest in science fiction normally but a few years ago I watched a television show called The Journeyman in which the main character time traveled and it peaked my curiosity enough to want to read this book (not to mention that several GR friends have read it). This book starts out slow and can be difficult to follow sometimes because Henry moves through time so much it’s hard to keep track but I think the love story of Henry and Clare is what made me continue reading it. Their relationship was constantly being tested due to his absence and it made them realize that they would rather have the time they did than nothing at all. I admire their devotion to one another despite their complicated relationship. I give this book three stars.",5,0.8346,0.085,0.812,0.103,0.46296992481203,NEGATIVE,0.5828

Therefore, I couldn't help but have high expectations and for it to be one of my favourite reads. Instead, I found it too long and I felt that I didn't love the characters as much as I should have.Henry has a rare Chrono-Displacement Disorder which causes him to time travel unexpectedly to another part of his life while his genetic clock resets too. He ends up meeting Clare when she's 6 while he is 36, and they eventually get married when she's 23 and he's 31. This is the story of their life together, told from both perspectives as they try to lead a normal life whilst dealing with Henry's sudden disappearances.I found it hard to keep up with the story due to the constant jumping around of timelines - I guess it was to mimic how the characters might have felt with the uncertainty around how long Henry would be staying in a particular timeline for.I also didn't completely buy into Henry and Clare's relationship (as much as I tried to!). It didn't help that I had read My Dark Vanessa by Kate Elizabeth Russell prior to this so it felt a bit uncomfortable to read about a relationship between two people who had met when Clare was 6 and Henry was 30 years older than her.

The science is absurd, and causality really loses any meaning, and Clare annoys me, but still I love it.***July 17, 2014Ten years further on I don't find Henry quite as adorable, although I do appreciate his efforts to be the man Clare has long adored. The science remains ridiculous. This time I'm much more struck by the sadness of the book: Clare's miserable family, the grief of repeated miscarriages, Henry's horrific death (and how the hell do they manage to deal with that, I wonder?). This reading I noticed how much of Henry's story we're only ever told, and what a remove that leaves the reader at. But Henry, knowing the end is approaching, teaches Clare how to cook. That brief sequence is so real, and so moving.For all my bits I balk at, I enjoyed reading it. It's hard to imagine a One True Love filling up a girl's heart, and then a wife's, and then a widow's. Not these days. Nonetheless, Niffenegger convinced me that it was true for Clare, and I can imagine her waiting for him until the end of her days, never cutting the hair he loved.Library copy",5,0.2929,0.167,0.662,0.171,0.6163194444444445,POSITIVE,0.9819
