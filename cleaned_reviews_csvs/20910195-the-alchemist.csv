0,4515369,08/13/2007,2.0,"I really disliked this book. I dislike it in the way that I dislike a great deal of modern self help books. Their basic message is that if you want something to happen, you need to want it as hard as you can, without caring about anything else, not allowing yourself to doubt it, or let criticisms will get in the way then it will happen.I disagree with this notion, not only because it is false, but because it is bad.Just because we desire something, does not make it good. This idea of 'following your heart' is often wrong. Who are we to be the arbiters of truth? Why should our hearts be sources of information that go beyond logic, doubt and reasoning? Haven't we all desired things that have turned out to not be in our best interest, or to be harmful to others? Andrew Jackson was a man known to have a lot of integrity. He was always 'true' to himself and followed his heart. Andrew Jackson is the man who initiated the 'Trail of Tears'. Moving Native Americans from their homes and into reservations. Next, this idea of not letting ourselves doubt or consider doubts. This is a terrible and dishonest way to live. If we don't consider doubts, and entertain them often, then we are deliberately blinding ourselves. Deliberately making ourselves ignorant. If someone doesn't give serious consideration to the idea that they may be wrong. Give serious thought to why they believe what they do, and that perhaps those who doubt them may be correct, then they are behaving in a dangerous and dishonest way.Not giving heed to the concerns doubts and criticisms of others is something I believe is a major fault in modern society. Often, people fail to recognize the needs of the group and the community. We place so much emphasis on the needs and rights of the individual. This causes people to focus so much on themselves to the detriment of others around them. At times, it can be beneficial to go against the group, but one should first give serious consideration to the groups concerns.According to Ideas like the Alchemist, groups like, the Westboro Baptist Church,(godhatesfags.com) should be seen as American heroes. These are people who take a totally irrational stance, and stick to it as hard as they can in complete defiance to the views of everyone around them.",2992,-0.983,0.172,0.72,0.108,0.5058080808080808,NEGATIVE,1.0
1,1160657766,01/08/2015,1.0,"A good parable--like ""The Prodigal Son""--should comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable. The problem with this little book is that it does precisely the opposite.Coelho's message--and, boy, is this a book with a message--is that each of us has his own Personal Legend, and that if we recognize that legend and pursue it sincerely, everything in the Universe (which is after all made up--wind, stone, trees--of the same stuff we are) will conspire to help us achieve it. Corollaries: 1) people who don't recognize their legends are never happy, 2) people who fail to realize their legends are afraid, and 3) people who refuse to pursue their legends, even when they know what they are, are both unhappy and afraid. (I admit I've left out a nuance or two here and there, but not many. There aren't more than three or four nuances in the book.)I fear that the result of taking such a message seriously will be to make the successful even more self-satisfied, the narcissistic more self-absorbed, and the affluent more self-congratulatory. At the same time, those who are unfortunate will blame themselves for their bad fortune, those who lack self-esteem will lose what little they have, and the poor will see--no, not God, as the beatitude says, but--the poor will see they have only themselves to blame.Perhaps I am being too harsh. I can see how a few individual young persons, hemmed in by parental expectations and seeking their own paths, may find enough hope and courage here to help them venture forth. But I am convinced the damage done by books like this--like The Secret, The Celestine Prophecy, and anything ever written by the late Dr. Wayne Dyer (or, for that matter, anything he may ever choose to channel from beyond the grave)--is far greater than the little good they may achieve.If you like parables, don't read this book. Go read a book of Hasidic tales collected by Martin Buber, a book of Sufi stories collected by Idries Shah, or a book of parables and sayings by Anthony de Mello instead.Or then again, you could just try Jesus. Jesus is always good.",1256,-0.6726,0.132,0.747,0.121,0.6112403100775194,NEGATIVE,0.9981
2,4968096,08/22/2007,2.0,"I feel like everyone LOVES this book, but I was kind of underwhelmed. I know that translation affects the quality of writing, but I could not get into this writing style. At all. I felt like it was totally affected and contrived. He was going for this ""fable/parable"" style, but it seemed to fail miserably. The parable-like quality was totally contrived, and I thought the ""moral"" was pretty stupid. Moral: everything you want and need is close to home. Take chances. Follow your ""personal legacy.""Then....there was a supernatural element which was just plain dumb. Granted, I am not religious. I think god-fearing people get more out of this bc they can take that leap of faith, excuse the phrase. If this was supposed to be a story of magic, I may have been into it. But it was supposed to be a simple story of knowing yourself. And I think, philosophically speaking, when you truly know yourself that is when you truly realize your destiny. Why do you need supernatural forces to convey that message? This was about realizing your destiny, or ""personal legacy."" It could have been done without the hocus pocus, and, yes, the cheese. In short, the book attempted to be deep and failed. ""Speaking with the wind and the sun"" and ""being a shepherd"" and getting over ""personal hardship"" all as part of a transparent ""higher plan"" (read: personal legacy) doesn't make a plot deep. A character simply called ""boy"" and short sentences doesn't make a story a fable. Learning from your flocks and from nature doesn't make a character inexplicably wise. I really got nothing out of this book.It is short though. The book came very highly recommended. Read it to judge the hype for yourself. After all, a whole nation, including Bill Clinton (who I'm into), thought it was a touching account that personally changed them. Then again, this is the same country who thought The Celestine Prophesy was worthwhile. Gag.",1799,0.8856,0.086,0.784,0.129,0.4695440476190478,NEGATIVE,1.0
3,30571376,08/19/2008,5.0,"""when you really want something, the whole universe conspires in helping you to achieve it""This book has crossed the boundaries of books, and has taken a life of its own, creating a movement all around the globe.Santiago's journey and spiritual quest, the people he meets, the dreams he has, the omens he encounters, and the nature he speaks to, are all things that we can relate to..things that we've either forgotten about or simply dismissed as childhood fantasies. It is all about finding your Personal Legend and pursuing your dream regardless of any hurdles, and about being spiritually connected to the universe, which is part of us, and part of God. we are all one.Reading this book always sets me back on the right path towards achieving the dreams I have put on hold. We always try to do what everyone expects of us like pursuing a career that you hate just because that is what everyone does. Recognizing my personal legend, being able to talk to the trees, sky, ants, the core of the earth, the air particles, and to my heart, feeling a deeper spiritual connection with everything/everyone that is around me, feeling God inside me, and not being afraid of failing or facing challenges are just some of the few things this book has given me.It is maktub that Coelho writes this book, shares it with the world, and affect so many lives. This masterwork is a legend and a precious treasure.",815,0.9485,0.034,0.842,0.124,0.4422268907563025,POSITIVE,0.9998
4,6595270,09/22/2007,1.0,"Utter drivel. The book was badly written, righteous, condescending, preachy, and worst of all, the ending was morally questionable. All the fables and stories are stolen from elsewhere, religious ideas and spirituality are badly mixed, and everything is so obvious.The book harps on about tapping into the Soul of the World, the Language of the World, about your one true path and other nonsense. The basic idea is that if you really want something and ""listen to your heart"", the whole universe will help you achieve it if you only look for omens. A questionable idea in a world where people no longer want to work hard and achieve independently.It reads like a really bad self-help book written for 8 year old children and disguised as a symbolic parable. I read a lot of books and I can safely say this is the worst book I have ever read. It's only saving grace was that it was mercifully short.",1326,-0.9517,0.187,0.718,0.094,0.5916666666666667,NEGATIVE,1.0
5,481789725,12/20/2012,1.0,"The problem with this book is not just that it's bad, which it certainly is, but that there are so many people out there who want to corner you at parties and tell you how it's totally changed their lives. In a way you might as well read it just so you can see how feeble-minded they must be to get any kind of philosophical nourishment out of this inexhaustible stream of clich√©s. The profound lessons you'll learn from this book amount to nothing more than several variations on the theme of ""only the very ugly is truly beautiful, only the very stupid are really intelligent, only black is white, only up is down"" etc etc.The writing is too simple to be really bad, but it's the content that gets you. By the end of the book you'll want to track down the philosopher's stone yourself and carefully beat Coelho to death with it.",1051,-0.1391,0.128,0.731,0.141,0.6592923280423281,NEGATIVE,1.0

7,23924224,06/07/2008,1.0,"***spoilers and bitterness ahead--be forewarned**I'm not sure that I can capture my utter disdain for this book in words, but I'll give it a shot. I read this book about three years ago and just had to re-read it for book club. It was a steaming pile of crap then and, guess what?, it's a steaming pile of crap now. The main reason I hate this book: it's trite inspirational literature dressed up as an adventure quest. You go into it thinking that it's going to be about a boy's quest for treasure. If you read the back, there are words like ""Pyramids,"" ""Gypsy,"" ""alchemist."" Turns out, this is just The Purpose Driven Life dressed up with a little fable. It's Hallmark Hall of Fame territory set in an exotic locale. Which pisses me off to no end as I normally try to dodge that sort of thing, but here it is masquerading as the type of book I normally like. It's cliche, didactic, and poorly written. Just as with Aesop's Fables, there's a moral to the story. And Coelho keeps backing up and running over it just to make sure that we get it (and he capitalizes important key words necessary to understanding it, lest we overlook their significance). If there's one thing Paulo Coelho can do, it's flog a dead horse. Essentially, boy thinks he's happy in life. He's a shepherd who gets to travel the world, has all of his needs met, and owns a book which he can always trade for another book when he goes to market. What more can a boy need? Boy is then told by a mysterious stranger that he's not happy at all. Why not? He has failed to recognize his Personal Legend. Everyone has a Personal Legend, which is life's plan for you. However, most of us give up on our Personal Legend in childhood. If you are fortunate enough to hang onto and pursue your Personal Legend, then The Soul of the World will help you obtain it. All of nature conspires to bring you luck and good fortune so that you can fulfill your destiny, whether it's to be a shepherd on a quest for treasure at the pyramids, a butcher, a baker, a candlestick maker, or, one would assume, a prostitute, drug dealer, or porn star. Hey, we're all fate's bitch in The Alchemist. But I digress. Boy seeks out his Personal Legend and finds it's a long, hard road to obtaining what you want in life. But with faith, perseverance, and just a little goshdarnit good luck, the boy learns to speak the Language of the World and tap into The Soul of the World and fulfills his Personal Legend. And what does he learn? That what he sought was back home, the place he started from. Oh, silly boy. So, in summation, here is what you should learn from The Alchemist:1) Dream. And, while you're at it, dream BIG2) Follow your bliss3) Don't be surprised if you find obstacles in your way, but you will overcome4) It's good to travel and encounter people from other cultures5) What we most often seek is right in front of us, but sometimes we have to leave home to realize itTo all of these important life lessons, I can only say, ""Well, no shit, Sherlock."" If Coelho knew anything about alchemy, he would have been able to transform this crap into gold. Alas, it's still crap.

8,614138889,05/13/2013,5.0,"It's the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting.The Alchemist ~~ Paulo CoelhoI preface my review by saying I am amazed how wildly passionate people are in their feelings toward this novel ~~ regardless of whether they love or hate The Alchemist. I‚Äôm one of those people who love it. But, I understand why people are so passionate in their dislike of this work. Paul Coelho looks to inspire passion in people with The Alchemist. And he succeeds in doing so ~~ especially in those who are so passionate in their dislike of this book.The Alchemist is a novel that combines an atmosphere of medieval mysticism with the voice of the desert -- dreams, symbols, signs, and adventure follow Santiago and the reader like echoes of ancient wise voices. With this symbolic novel Coelho states that we should not avoid our destinies, and urges people to follow their dreams, because to find our ""Personal Myth"" and our mission on Earth is the way to find God, meaning happiness, fulfillment, and the ultimate purpose of creation.The novel tells the tale of Santiago, a boy who has a dream and the courage to follow it. After listening to ""the signs"" the boy ventures in his personal, journey of exploration and self-discovery, searching for a hidden treasure located near the pyramids in Egypt. In his journey, Santiago sees the greatness of the world, and meets all kinds of exciting people like kings and alchemists. However, by the end of the novel, he discovers that ""treasure lies where your heart belongs"", and that the treasure was the journey itself, the discoveries he made, and the wisdom he acquired.As the alchemist himself says when he appears to Santiago in the form of an old king ""when you really want something to happen, the whole universe conspires so that your wish comes true"". This is the core of the novel's theme. Isn't it true that all of us want to believe the old king when he says that the greatest lie in the world is that at some point we lose the ability to control our lives, and become the pawns of fate. Coelho also suggests that those who do not have the courage to follow their ‚ÄúPersonal Myth"", are doomed to a life of emptiness, misery, and unfulfillment. Fear, fear of failure seems to be the greatest obstacle to happiness. The old crystal-seller tragically confesses: ‚ÄúI am afraid that great disappointment awaits me, and so I prefer to dream"". This is where Coelho really captures the drama of man, who sacrifices fulfillment to conformity, who knows he can achieve greatness but denies doing so, and ends up living an empty shell of a life. The Alchemist is a novel that will not appeal to everybody. Not everyone will identify with Santiago. We all have dreams, and are praying for somebody to tell us they can come true. The novel skillfully combines words of wisdom, philosophy, and simplicity of meaning and language, and this is what makes it so enchanting.",475,0.9949,0.06,0.754,0.186,0.537037037037037,POSITIVE,0.9963

Santiago's journey teaches us about the essential wisdom of listening to our hearts, of recognizing opportunity and learning to read the omens strewn along life's path, and, most importantly, to follow our dreams.ÿ™ÿßÿ±€åÿÆ ŸÜÿÆÿ≥ÿ™€åŸÜ ÿÆŸàÿßŸÜÿ¥: ÿØÿ± ŸÖÿßŸá ⁄òŸàÿ¶ŸÜ ÿ≥ÿßŸÑ 1996ŸÖ€åŸÑÿßÿØ€åÿπŸÜŸàÿßŸÜ: ⁄©€åŸÖ€åÿß⁄Øÿ±ÿõ ŸÜŸà€åÿ≥ŸÜÿØŸá: Ÿæÿßÿ¶ŸàŸÑŸà ⁄©Ÿàÿ¶€åŸÑŸàÿõ ŸÖÿ™ÿ±ÿ¨ŸÖ: ÿ≠ÿ≥€åŸÜ ŸÜÿπ€åŸÖ€åÿõ ÿ™Ÿáÿ±ÿßŸÜÿå ŸÜÿ¥ÿ± ÿ±Ÿàÿß€åÿ™ÿå 1374ÿõ ⁄ÜÿßŸæ ÿØ€å⁄Øÿ± ÿ™Ÿáÿ±ÿßŸÜÿå ÿ´ÿßŸÑÿ´ÿå 1377ÿõ ÿØÿ± 283ÿµÿõ ÿ¥ÿßÿ®⁄© 9646404465ÿõ ⁄ÜÿßŸæ ÿ¥ÿ¥ŸÖ 1379ÿõ ŸáŸÅÿ™ŸÖ 1380ÿõ Ÿáÿ¥ÿ™ŸÖ 1381ÿõ ŸÜŸáŸÖ 1386ÿõ ÿ¥ÿßÿ®⁄© 9789646404465ÿõ ŸÖŸàÿ∂Ÿàÿπ ÿØÿßÿ≥ÿ™ÿßŸÜŸáÿß€å ŸÜŸà€åÿ≥ŸÜÿØ⁄ØÿßŸÜ ÿ®ÿ±ÿ≤€åŸÑ - ÿ≥ÿØŸá €å 20ŸÖÿ™ÿ±ÿ¨ŸÖŸá Ÿáÿß€å ÿØ€å⁄Øÿ± ÿßÿ≤ ÿÆÿßŸÜŸÖŸáÿß Ÿà ÿ¢ŸÇÿß€åÿßŸÜ ¬´ÿ¢ÿ±ÿ¥ ÿ≠ÿ¨ÿßÿ≤€å¬ªÿõ ¬´ÿØŸÑ ÿ¢ÿ±ÿß ŸÇŸáÿ±ŸÖÿßŸÜ¬ªÿõ ¬´ŸÖ€åÿ™ÿ±ÿß ŸÖ€åÿ±ÿ¥⁄©ÿßÿ±¬ªÿõ ¬´ÿ≥Ÿàÿ≥ŸÜ ÿßÿ±ÿØ⁄©ÿßŸÜ€å¬ªÿõ ¬´ŸÖÿ±ÿ™ÿ∂€å ÿ≥ÿπ€åÿØ€å¬ªÿõ ¬´ÿß€åŸÑ€åÿß ÿ≠ÿ±€åÿ±€å¬ªÿõ ¬´ŸÜÿØÿß ŸÜŸà€åÿØŸÜ€åÿß¬ªÿõ ¬´Ÿáÿ±ŸÖ€åŸÜŸá ÿ¥ÿ®ÿßŸÜ€å¬ªÿõ ¬´ÿ®Ÿáÿ±ÿßŸÖ ÿ¨ÿπŸÅÿ±€å¬ªÿõ ¬´ŸÖÿ±€åŸÖ ÿßŸÖ€åÿ±€å¬ªÿõ ¬´ŸÅÿ±ÿ≤ÿßŸÜŸá ŸÅÿ±ÿ≤ÿßÿØ¬ªÿõ ¬´ŸÖ€åŸÜÿß ÿ≠€åÿØÿ±€å¬ª Ÿà ¬´ÿπÿßÿ∑ŸÅŸá ÿ≤€åŸÜŸÑ€å¬ªÿõ ¬´ÿßÿ≥ŸÖÿßÿπ€åŸÑ ÿ∫ŸÅŸàÿ±€å ÿ´ÿßŸÜ€å¬ª Ÿà ¬´ÿ±ÿ∂ÿß ÿßÿ®Ÿàÿπÿ∑ÿß¬ªÿõ ¬´ŸÅÿ±€åÿ®ÿß ÿ±€åÿßÿ∂€å ŸÖÿ∏ŸÑŸàŸÖ€å¬ªÿõ ¬´⁄Ø€åÿ≥Ÿà Ÿæÿßÿ±ÿ≥ÿß€å¬ªÿõ ¬´ÿ¥Ÿáÿ±ÿ≤ÿßÿØ ŸÅÿ™Ÿàÿ≠€å¬ªÿõ ¬´ÿπŸÑ€å ŸÜÿßÿØÿ±€å¬ªÿõ ¬´ŸÖÿß⁄©ÿßŸÜ ⁄©€åÿßŸÜ¬ªÿõ Ÿà ¬´ŸÜÿßŸá€åÿØ ÿß€åÿ±ÿßŸÜ ŸÜ⁄òÿßÿØ¬ªÿõ Ÿà ...ÿõÿØÿ± Ÿáÿ≤ÿßÿ± Ÿà €å⁄©ÿ¥ÿ® ÿØÿßÿ≥ÿ™ÿßŸÜ€å Ÿáÿ≥ÿ™ÿå ⁄©Ÿá ŸÖÿ±ÿØ€å ÿØÿ± ¬´ÿ®ÿ∫ÿØÿßÿØ¬ªÿå ŸáŸÖÿßŸÜ ÿÆŸàÿßÿ®€å ÿ±ÿß ŸÖ€åÿ®€åŸÜÿØÿå ⁄©Ÿá ÿØÿ± ÿØÿßÿ≥ÿ™ÿßŸÜ ¬´⁄©Ÿàÿ¶€åŸÑŸà¬ªÿå ⁄ÜŸàŸæÿßŸÜ ¬´ÿßÿ≥ŸæÿßŸÜ€åÿß€å€å¬ª ÿØ€åÿØŸá ÿßÿ≥ÿ™ÿõ ÿØÿ± ¬´ŸÖÿ´ŸÜŸà€å ŸÖÿπŸÜŸà€å ŸÖŸàŸÑÿßŸÜÿß¬ª ŸÜ€åÿ≤ÿå ŸáŸÖ€åŸÜ ÿØÿßÿ≥ÿ™ÿßŸÜ ÿ®ÿß Ÿàÿß⁄òŸá Ÿáÿß€å ÿ¥ÿπÿ± ÿ¢ŸÖÿØŸá ÿßÿ≥ÿ™ÿõ Ÿáÿ¥ÿØÿßÿ± ÿß⁄Øÿ± ÿØÿßÿ≥ÿ™ÿßŸÜ ÿ±ÿß ŸÜÿÆŸàÿßŸÜÿØŸá ÿß€åÿØ Ÿà ŸÖ€åÿÆŸàÿßŸá€åÿØ ÿÆŸàÿØ ÿß€åŸÜ ⁄©ÿ™ÿßÿ® ÿ±ÿß ŸÜ€åÿ≤ ÿ®ÿÆŸàÿßŸÜ€åÿØÿå ÿ™ŸÜŸáÿß Ÿæÿßÿ±⁄Øÿ±ÿßŸÅ Ÿæÿß€åÿßŸÜ€å ŸÜ⁄Øÿßÿ±Ÿá ÿßŸÖ ÿ±ÿß ÿ®ÿÆŸàÿßŸÜ€åÿØÿå ⁄©Ÿá ÿ®Ÿá ŸÖŸàÿ∂Ÿàÿπ ÿß€åŸÜ ÿØÿßÿ≥ÿ™ÿßŸÜ ÿ±ÿ®ÿ∑€å ŸÜÿØÿßÿ±ÿØÿõ ÿßŸÖÿß ÿØÿßÿ≥ÿ™ÿßŸÜ ÿß€åŸÜ ⁄©ÿ™ÿßÿ®: ⁄ÜŸàŸæÿßŸÜ€å ¬´ÿßÿ≥ŸæÿßŸÜ€åÿß€å€å¬ªÿå ÿ®Ÿá ŸÜÿßŸÖ ¬´ÿ≥ÿßŸÜÿ™€åÿß⁄ØŸà¬ªÿå ÿØÿ± ÿ±ÿ§€åÿß€å ÿÆŸàÿØÿå ŸÖÿ≠ŸÑ ⁄ØŸÜÿ¨€å ŸÖÿØŸÅŸàŸÜ ÿØÿ± ÿ≠ŸàÿßŸÑ€å ¬´ÿßŸáÿ±ÿßŸÖ ŸÖÿµÿ±¬ª ÿ±ÿßÿå ÿ®Ÿá ÿÆŸàÿßÿ® ŸÖ€å‚Äåÿ®€åŸÜÿØÿõ Ÿà ÿ®Ÿá ŸÇÿµÿØ ÿ¢ŸÜ ÿ±ÿ§€åÿßÿå ⁄©Ÿá ÿ¢ŸÜÿ±ÿß ÿßŸÅÿ≥ÿßŸÜŸá €å ÿ¥ÿÆÿµ€å ÿÆŸàÿØ ŸÖ€å‚ÄåÿÆŸàÿßŸÜÿØÿå ŸÖŸàÿ∑ŸÜÿ¥ ÿ±ÿß ÿØÿ± ¬´ÿ¢ŸÜÿØŸÑÿ≥¬ªÿå ÿ±Ÿáÿßÿå Ÿà ÿ±Ÿáÿ≥Ÿæÿßÿ± ¬´ÿ¥ŸÖÿßŸÑ ÿ¢ŸÅÿ±€åŸÇÿß¬ª ŸÖ€å‚Äåÿ¥ŸàÿØÿõ ÿØÿ± ÿ¢ŸÜ ÿ≥ŸÅÿ± Ÿæÿ±ÿÆÿ∑ÿ±ÿå ÿ®ÿß ŸÖÿ±ÿØ€å ⁄©Ÿá ÿÆŸàÿØ ÿ±ÿß ¬´ŸÖŸÑ⁄© ÿµÿØŸÇ¬ªÿå ŸæÿßÿØÿ¥ÿßŸá ¬´ÿ≥ÿßŸÑŸÖ¬ª ŸÖ€å‚ÄåÿØÿßŸÜÿØÿå Ÿà ÿ®ÿß €å⁄© ¬´⁄©€åŸÖ€åÿß⁄Øÿ±¬ª ÿ¢ÿ¥ŸÜÿßÿå Ÿà ÿ®Ÿá ¬´ŸÅÿßÿ∑ŸÖŸá¬ª ÿØÿÆÿ™ÿ± ¬´ÿµÿ≠ÿ±ÿß¬ªÿå ÿØŸÑ ŸÖ€å‚Äåÿ®ŸÜÿØÿØÿõ ŸáŸÖ⁄ØÿßŸÜ ¬´ÿ≥ÿßŸÜÿ™€åÿß⁄ØŸà¬ª ÿ±ÿßÿå ÿØÿ± ŸÖÿ≥€åÿ± ÿ¨ÿ≥ÿ™ÿ¨Ÿà€åÿ¥ €åÿßÿ±€åÿå Ÿà ÿßŸà ÿ±ÿß ÿ®Ÿá ÿßÿØÿßŸÖŸá €å ÿ±ÿßŸáÿå ÿ™ÿ¥Ÿà€åŸÇ ŸÖ€å‚Äå⁄©ŸÜŸÜÿØÿõ ÿØÿ± Ÿæÿß€åÿßŸÜÿå ¬´ÿ≥ÿßŸÜÿ™€åÿß⁄ØŸà¬ª Ÿæÿ≥ ÿßÿ≤ ÿ≥ÿßŸÑŸáÿß ÿ≥ŸÅÿ± ÿ∑ÿßŸÇÿ™ ŸÅÿ±ÿ≥ÿßÿå ⁄ØŸÜÿ¨ ÿ±ÿß ŸÜŸá ÿØÿ± ŸÅÿ±ÿ≥ŸÜ⁄ØŸáÿß ÿØŸàÿ±ÿ™ÿ±ÿå ÿ®ŸÑ⁄©Ÿá ÿØÿ± ŸáŸÖÿßŸÜ ÿ¢ÿ∫ŸÑ ⁄ØŸàÿ≥ŸÅŸÜÿØÿßŸÜ ÿÆŸà€åÿ¥ÿå ÿØÿ± ÿ≥ÿ±ÿ≤ŸÖ€åŸÜ ÿÆŸà€åÿ¥ ŸÖ€å‚Äå€åÿßÿ®ÿØÿõ ⁄ØŸÜÿ¨€å ÿ®ÿ≤ÿ±⁄Øÿ™ÿ± ⁄©Ÿá ÿ¢ŸÜÿ±ÿß ÿ™ŸÜŸáÿß ŸÖ€å‚Äåÿ™ŸàÿßŸÜ ÿØÿ± ÿØÿ±ŸàŸÜ ÿÆŸà€åÿ¥ ÿ¨ÿ≥ÿ™ŸÜŸÇŸÑ ÿßÿ≤ ¬´ÿßÿ≥⁄©ÿßÿ± Ÿàÿß€åŸÑÿØ¬ª: (ÿ¨Ÿà€åÿ®ÿßÿ± €åÿß ÿØÿ±€åÿß⁄ÜŸá Ÿæÿ±ÿ≥€åÿØ: ŸÖ⁄Øÿ± ¬´ŸÜÿ±⁄Øÿ≥¬ª ÿ≤€åÿ®ÿß ÿ®ŸàÿØÿü ⁄ØŸÑŸáÿß €åÿß Ÿæÿ±€åŸáÿß ÿ¥⁄ØŸÅÿ™ ÿ≤ÿØŸá Ÿæÿ±ÿ≥€åÿØŸÜÿØ: ⁄ÜŸá ⁄©ÿ≥€å ÿ®Ÿáÿ™ÿ± ÿßÿ≤ ÿ™Ÿà ÿß€åŸÜ ÿ±ÿß ŸÖ€åÿØÿßŸÜÿØÿü ÿßŸà Ÿáÿ± ÿ±Ÿàÿ≤ ÿØÿ± ÿ≥ÿßÿ≠ŸÑ ÿ™Ÿà ŸÖ€åŸÜÿ¥ÿ≥ÿ™ÿå Ÿà ÿ®Ÿá ÿ±Ÿà€å ÿ™Ÿà ÿÆŸÖ ŸÖ€åÿ¥ÿØÿõ ÿ¨Ÿà€åÿ®ÿßÿ± €åÿß ÿØÿ±€åÿß⁄ÜŸá ŸÑÿ≠ÿ∏Ÿá ÿß€å ÿ≥ÿß⁄©ÿ™ ŸÖÿßŸÜÿØÿå Ÿà ÿ≥Ÿæÿ≥ ⁄ØŸÅÿ™ ŸÖŸÜ ÿ®ÿ±ÿß€å ¬´ŸÜÿ±⁄Øÿ≥¬ª ⁄Øÿ±€åŸá ŸÖ€å⁄©ŸÜŸÖÿå ÿßŸÖÿß Ÿáÿ±⁄Øÿ≤ ŸÖÿ™Ÿàÿ¨Ÿá ÿ≤€åÿ®ÿßÿ¶€å ÿßŸà ŸÜÿ¥ÿØŸá ÿ®ŸàÿØŸÖÿå ŸÖŸÜ ÿ®ÿ±ÿß€å ¬´ŸÜÿ±⁄Øÿ≥¬ª ⁄Øÿ±€åŸá ŸÖ€å⁄©ŸÜŸÖÿå ÿ≤€åÿ±ÿß Ÿáÿ± ÿ®ÿßÿ± ⁄©Ÿá ÿ®Ÿá ÿ±Ÿà€å ŸÖŸÜ ÿÆŸÖ ŸÖ€åÿ¥ÿØÿå ŸÖ€åÿ™ŸàÿßŸÜÿ≥ÿ™ŸÖ ÿØÿ± ⁄òÿ±ŸÅÿß€å ⁄Üÿ¥ŸÖÿßŸÜÿ¥ÿå ÿ®ÿßÿ≤ÿ™ÿßÿ® ÿ≤€åÿ®ÿß€å€å ÿÆŸà€åÿ¥ ÿ±ÿßÿå ÿ®ÿ®€åŸÜŸÖ)ÿõÿ™ÿßÿ±€åÿÆ ÿ®ŸáŸÜ⁄ØÿßŸÖ ÿ±ÿ≥ÿßŸÜ€å 22/05/1399Ÿáÿ¨ÿ±€å ÿÆŸàÿ±ÿ¥€åÿØ€åÿõ 05/05/1400Ÿáÿ¨ÿ±€å ÿÆŸàÿ±ÿ¥€åÿØ€åÿõ ÿß. ÿ¥ÿ±ÿ®€åÿßŸÜ€å",410,0.9552,0.0,0.959,0.041,0.7571428571428571,POSITIVE,0.9999
10,1742156688,08/29/2016,3.0,"This is either a beautifully written and fable-like illustration of simple and universal truths or a load of crap.I have a bad feeling it‚Äôs the later, but then I consider that there could also be a third option.I read once that Sting, when he wrote the classic Police song Every Breath You Take, mixed up a series of banal clich√©s about love and loss and just put them all together, and so this cool tune has some satire about it. Similarly, the Credence Clearwater Revival song Looking Out My Backdoor, a clunky but loveable country western tune, was actually begun as a facetious parody of slide guitar yokel lyricism. I also think of the comedy / performance art of Andy Kaufman and the constant, uncomfortable tension about what he was doing and why. Was it really so bad it was funny? If it was so obviously corny and insincere, was that not funny? Or was it? Was he really wrestling women and then getting beaten up by Jerry Lawler? That was a joke right?So ...Was Paulo Coelho‚Äôs 1988 fantasy / magical realism parable of truths found in nature and subtle messages from God told straight or was there a wink and a nod told with some fun?Now ‚Ä¶ think about it for a second. The whole ‚Äúlost gold‚Äù theme and the discussions with the alchemist about a supposed elixir of life and ‚Äúfollow your heart‚Äù rhetoric. Was Coelho telling this straight or pulling our leg?I have to say that I doubt it, but I did laugh a few times and the over the top syrupy delivery made me wonder, and maybe I liked it better considering this twinkle of a third possibility.I will say that this could go either way. I can absolutely see where someone could find hidden treasure and deeply meaningful messages in the short novel. And I can see someone rolling their eyes and sticking their finger down their throat in a gag gesture.I‚Äôll cast a Cheshire cat smirk and like for another reason.",359,0.9883,0.079,0.743,0.178,0.4319131161236424,NEGATIVE,0.9552

12,23918036,06/07/2008,5.0,"There are too many things one can learn from ‚ÄúThe Alchemist‚Äù. Its all about following your dream and about taking the risk of following your dreams, which is actually so difficult to do and there are very few people in this world who actually do, I mean risk it all, just to follow your heart and your dream. Beauty is, the author is so right in saying that when u decide to follow your dreams the entire universe conspires in your favour which he called as the ‚Äúbeginners luck‚Äù and we all have been witness to this beginners luck at one or other point in our lives. Also, he talks about a stage in our journey towards realizing our dreams, where everything just goes haywire and there is everything working against us and it almost takes us to the brink of abandoning everything and just getting back to what was so familiar and comfortable (i.e. our usual daily life which we get used to) this is actually the time when we are being tested for one last time and it means also that we are really close to our objective. The example given was really great and yes nothing new but we forget simple things in our life like ""the darkest hour of the night is just before the dawn"". It is actually true that so many of us just leave the struggle when it gets really tough and the chips are really low, whereas actually we were so close to the objective, if only we would have had a little more patience we would have been there. In one of the episodes he talks about death, yes the fact we always forget, the only reality about our life, it is a constant which is not going to change rest everything is uncertain. There are a lot of us who either think that it happens to others and then there are others, who are so busy running after the materials that they don‚Äôt have time to think about anything, leave alone death. Yes, and those who do think about death, mostly fear it, some fear death because of the physical pain attached to it (such people actually fear the pain rather than the death, I am one of them) and there are some who think they do not want to die because its not time yet for them to go. Ironically but true, this decision about timings has thankfully not been left to us. So, how do we get over the fear of death or make it our friend, a companion? And not waste our beautiful life worrying about dying all the time. One of the possible solutions lies in this book, it reads ""if i have to fight, it will be just as good a day to die as any other"". Yes very much right, one would never know when he or she wakes up in the morning that if it was the last day of his or her life and in fact, that day would not be any different from all the other days already spent. So, why not take everyday as the last day of our lives and live it up. Frankly speaking i really know what i am talking about, because I am in a profession which involves a lot of risk and death doesn‚Äôt have to look for reasons, it can just spring up from any bush in form of a small little piece of metal called a bullet coming out of the darkness of the night or just a deafening sound from under a culvert that I cross everyday. Here, everyday can be the last day of my life, every meal can be my last, every call to my wife can be the last time I would hear her sweet and loving voice and the kids‚Ä¶ Anyways, so what I personally follow is, everyday when I wake up or every time when I move out on an operation, I say to myself ""what a beautiful day to die"" and there on, I just do what I have to and what I have been taught in all these years in the army and go through all the motions and concentrate on the job at hand rather than worrying about my death and I am really at peace with the fear of death. Another beautiful thought which I came across about death was in the novel by the author called ""Confessions of a pilgrim"". I derived from it that death can be visualized as a beautiful person who is always sitting besides us, so close to us that it travels with us wherever we go and it also accompanies us to our bed. Its a beautiful companion, a faithful companion, the only one who will never be unfaithful to us, rest all the companions are just lesser mortals and have been unfaithful at one point or other. Death always stays with us and actually speaking that‚Äôs the only companion who would accompany us all through our lives right from the moment we acquired some shape in our mother‚Äôs womb to the moment when we would get the vision of that white light and that feeling of lightness when we would finally leave this body also sometimes expressed as ""VASTRA"" (clothes) in the Indian mythology. As per the Indian mythology, the soul never dies, it is indestructible, it only changes a body just like we change clothes. Our soul is a part of God and it goes back to him. We can find the mention of the mighty soul of ours around the last portion of 'The Alchemist' where the shepherd realizes that ultimately it his own soul which is the ‚Äúhand that wrote all‚Äù and his own soul was the part of soul of God. I firmly believe that there is no fiction involved in this story of the shepherd, but this is a true expression of mysteries and realities of our life, which we never pause to discover. There is message that this book wants to convey to us!!! I have never been into writing anything ever in my life, yes not even a personal dairy, but since the time I actually started writing which was just a month back, I realized that if we just write our thoughts as they occur, the resultant has a touch of mystery, because what we wrote with all our heart and soul, sometimes tends to surprise us. We tend to learn from what we ourselves wrote. We never realized that we had so much inside us and we don‚Äôt know from where, it all came. ‚ÄúThe hand that wrote all‚Äù, yes I think its our soul that speaks out, the soul we never recognized, the one we never knew, the one which is part of soul of God‚Ä¶. ‚Ä¶All religions have over all the years have preached a man ‚ÄúKnow thyself, you will find God‚Äù, ‚Äúlook within yourself u will find all the answers‚Äù, these words are so common but how many of us actually are ready to pause and give it a try. It may sound crazy, may be the book has a effect that may appear really crazy but I am sure there are some people who would identify with me. May be when Paulo Coelho wrote this book his soul was revealing itself and that‚Äôs why some of us can identify with it because our souls are the part of same soul of God, just like his is. May be these lines of his novel were written by the ‚ÄúHand that wrote all‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù",314,-0.9932,0.126,0.774,0.101,0.4723943860372431,POSITIVE,0.9665

14,31225710,08/26/2008,2.0,"Timing is everything. If I'd read 'The Alchemist' four years ago, I'm sure I would have loved it. It deals in big, bold pronouncements of 'follow your dreams' et cetera et cetera, and it certainly makes you think about your own life and the pursuit of your own ""Personal Legend"" if you will. But maybe I'm older and more cynical now, or maybe it's not cynicism so much as just seeing a reality that isn't so mystical and black and white as Paulo Coelho's, but in any event, I just wasn't buying what 'The Alchemist' was selling.It's a good, quick read, I'll give it that. I enjoyed myself, and I definitely thought a little bit about my own life in the process, which I appreciate from my literature. And while I was more or less with it for a while, I just couldn't stay on board with an ending that left me saying, ""that's it? Really?"" 
Be forewarned, there will be spoilers after this point
. The whole book Santiago is in pursuit of his ""Personal Legend"", which he is told is a great treasure found in the pyramids of Egypt. Along the way he befriends many people and makes a great sum of money, while also meeting a beautiful young woman who agrees to more or less be his life-partner, Romeo and Juliet-style (which is stupid in and of itself, but more on that later). It is at this point that he determines he has achieved a greater treasure than any he had ever dreamed of, and would go no further. Beautiful. Cue the music and themes of recognizing treasure in all its forms. Santiago has a wonderful, fulfilling life laid out before him, and would most likely die a happy man by the side of his lovely wife and adoring children, all while living comfortably as village counselor of a beautiful desert oasis. Sounds pretty nice, no?Well, that's where the book lost it's footing. Santiago is urged, coerced even, into continuing to follow his ""Personal Legend"", leaving behind his ""love"" (who, it should be mentioned is a ""woman of the desert"" and so is completely fine being abandoned by her ""love"" and will simply wait and wait and wait for him, whether he ever returns or not) traversing the desert and (bizarrely) evading a hostile army along the way by turning himself into the wind (it makes about as much sense as it sounds). In the end though, Coelho reveals to us that Santiago does, indeed, reach his ""Personal Legend"" in a two and a half page epilogue, where it is shoddily revealed that Santiago's long-sought after treasure is...treasure. Literally. Buried treasure. A box in the sand filled with gold coins and diamonds and jewelry and crowns, and all the other cliche treasure images you can think up. What the hell?So what message are we supposed to take from this book then? Money is the most important thing in the world? Women are objects meant to be seen and valued for their beauty, there to serve you and wait around forever while you go on wild goose chases across continents in search of money? Obviously I'm being facetious, and Coelho intended to say that one should follow their dreams no matter what, even if it transcends a nice, content life, so long as you are in pursuit of a life that would be even greater than you can ever imagine, sacrificing what is good now for what can be great later. But he did so in an extremely simplistic way, and the revelation of the Santiago's treasure being literally treasure was a major disappointment.The thing was, despite his simplicity, the book had a nice message going for a while. If Fatima was Santiago's treasure, that I could have gotten behind, even if it shows a good deal of contempt for the role of women in relationships (beauty being the most important factor in deciding on a mate, as Santiago is struck by her beauty and immediately professes his love; Fatima more or less acquiesces immediately and pledges herself to Santiago no matter what, even if he must travel the desert forever in selfish pursuit of his own dreams, with no regard for her), because that is something intangible that is meaningful and fulfilling, regardless of financial standing. But then Coelho basically goes on to say that that is just a roadblock in the way of real achievement, and that one should selfishly pursue their own dreams with no regard for those closest to them.How a book can go on and on talking about seeing the everyday symbols and omens in life and taking heed of them, presumably leaving metaphors for life all along the way, and then have what was presumably the biggest metaphor of them all, Santiago's treasure, turn out not to be a metaphor at all, but just money? To me, that summed up everything. I suppose Coelho realizes this, as he begins the book with a brief fable about Narcissus falling into the river because he loved staring at his reflection, and the river's disappointment in this, as the river loved gazing into Narcissus's eyes and seeing the reflection of itself. This is a horrible little story implying that everyone is obsessed only with themselves, a sad, empty little thought that Coelho spends 167 pages endorsing wholeheartedly, under the guise of following your dreams.I understand that other people love this book and find it inspiring, and I think I would have felt the same way years ago, when I was just out of college and it appeared I had my whole life ahead of me and a lifetime to live it. I'm older now, and I've found someone who I consider to be a real treasure, and while I still have dreams, I'm not willing to sacrifice the happiness that this life brings me every day in a single-minded pursuit of something that I want for selfish reasons (fame, fortune, etc.). If I was Santiago, I would have never left Fatima in the first place if she truly made me happy, as Santiago claimed she did. Perhaps that makes me a coward in Coelho's eyes, not unlike the Crystal merchant from the story. But it'd also make me not the sad Englishman, whose single-minded pursuit of his ""personal legend"" had cost him all his money, friends, and family and left him alone in an oasis burning lead in a tent in the vain hopes it will turn to gold.I guess what I'm trying to say in this long-winded review, is that this book is all about being selfish and doing what you think will make you happy, regardless of everything else. I can see why that appeals to people, especially those who want to show the doubters and find their own treasure beneath a sycamore tree, but it's sad, in a way. We live in a culture where everyone wants selfish things like fame or money or power, just to satisfy some gaping hole in their own souls, ignoring the real problems that lead to these compulsions in the first place. To me, this book feeds and even encourages that misplaced ideal, and that's a shame.",259,0.9994,0.084,0.727,0.189,0.5945548394796515,NEGATIVE,0.9978

16,977162523,06/25/2014,1.0,"Homework for ""Introductory Course For Irony Disposal And Sarcasm Removal (ICFIDASR)"", lesson one, re-submission number 47.I once read a book that inspired me to change my whole attitude towards reading. It was a medicine of universal, cosmic impact. Before, I had thought that books existed to enrich me, giving me knowledge, pleasure and understanding. After reading the introductory pages of this ""enchanting novel"" however, I learned that more wisdom can be gained from the companionship of sheep than from books, as stated by the wise young protagonist, a shepherd who uses books for a pillow and sheep for dialogue partners (it is a one-way road, with the sheep as teachers, for the sheep don't learn anything from him). In simple, unsophisticated prose, which seems to be carefully following the rubric of a Grade 6 descriptive writing assignment, I read:""The only things that concerned the sheep were food and water. As long as the boy knew how to find the best pastures in Andalusia, they would be his friends. Yes, their days were all the same, with the seemingly endless hours between sunrise and dusk; and they had never read a book in their young lives, and didn't understand when the boy told them about the sights of the cities. They were content with just food and water, and, in exchange, they generously gave of their wool, their company, and - once in a while - their meat.""Learning to take everything literally is part of my course, so I try not to see a metaphor in the fact that the boy learns more from sheep than from books. But I do have a question or two:If the sheep are only his""friends"" as long as he brings them food, do they really count as friends? Are they not just following their needs?Is it not quite self-evident that they have not read any books in their young lives - they are sheep after all, and won't read in their old age either, I assume?Do they really ""generously offer their wool, their company, and -ONCE IN A WHILE - their meat? At least as far as the meat is concerned, I am sure they offer it once, and not again, and not by free choice, and generously?As this book is to be taken seriously, I beg to accept my apology if my questions sound like sarcasm. That is not my intention. I am really just asking ""all universe to conspire to help me achieve my goal"" (another piece of wisdom the book offers) - of understanding how anyone can take this seriously! I just wonder how all universe deals with opposing wishes, which must occasionally occur, even in a small place like our earth. If I for example wish to have my neighbour's garden chair, and my neighbour wishes to keep it, who does ""all universe"" side with, and how does it conspire to help me get it, and at the same time to help my neighbour to keep it?Things that happen once can never happen again, I also learn. Before I can even ask why, I get another piece of information: Things that happen twice will always happen again. How does that go together? If things have happened once (which is a prerequisite for happening twice in my world) they won't happen again?!? Whatever is meant, things can NEVER happen twice, that is sure. I can't travel to Italy twice. If I do it anyway (which is not possible) I will definitively do it again. That is nice!When I do travel to Italy (once, or three times), my life and my path will always provide me with enough omens. That is interesting, and I do not know why I all of a sudden associate this with the sheepish followers in Life Of Brian, who found omens in sandals.Call me literal-minded, but I do have some issues with the idea of omen provision. Can I order them online nowadays? What do they cost? To close my reflection on learning more from sheep than books, I have to say: In some cases, that is very true! What a bitter medicine!As with all medicines, there are some side effects, and it is very important to read the warning before you take this drug:Please do not read this book if you are in danger of thinking too rationally. When you read this Grade 6 essay, be careful to check if you show behaviours that you would define as out of character, as they might be symptoms of acute drivel reading allergy. Symptoms include: anger, frustration, ridicule, frowning, nausea, meaningless giggling, dreams about book burning, urge to throw the book in the bin or out the window. Symptoms may vary, but in all cases, it is recommended to suspend reading until the brain is reset in adequate sheep mode again. If symptoms do not diminish after enjoying a couple of good, real books, please see your librarian for memory removal surgery or therapy.",206,0.9348,0.057,0.849,0.094,0.509431746031746,NEGATIVE,0.9927

Also, the author's prologues are always exceptional in stealing my thoughts and time:‚ÄúWho better than you to know that?‚Äù the goddesses said in wonder. ‚ÄúAfter all, it was by your banks that he knelt each day to contemplate himself!‚ÄùThe lake was silent for some time. Finally, it said:‚ÄúI weep for Narcissus, but I never noticed that Narcissus was beautiful. I weep because, each time he knelt beside my banks, I could see, in the depths of his eyes, my own beauty reflected.‚ÄùGreek mythology combined with wit guarantees my interest secured in the palm of your hand.The Alchemist follows a young Andalusian shepherd in his journey to Egypt, after having a recurring dream of finding treasure there. No one knows what the treasure is, or if Santiago will be able to surmount the obstacles along the way. But what starts out as a journey to find worldly goods turns into a discovery of the treasure found within.My love for this book is a quiet kind of love. The writing changed something inside me that I don‚Äôt have words for yet. So I‚Äôll let Paulo Coelho's quotes speak instead:‚ÄúYou came so that you could learn about your dreams,‚Äù said the old woman. ‚ÄúAnd dreams are the language of God. When he speaks in our language, I can interpret what he has said. But if he speaks in the language of the soul, it is only you who can understand.‚ÄùI was instantly won over when dreams were mentioned in here.‚ÄúPeople say strange things, the boy thought. Sometimes it‚Äôs better to be with the sheep, who don‚Äôt say anything. And better still to be alone with one‚Äôs books. They tell their incredible stories at the time when you want to hear them.‚ÄùI found this to be so fascinating that I ended up reciting it back to my mother.‚ÄúThe boy knew what he was about to describe, though: the mysterious chain that links one thing to another, the same chain that had caused him to become a shepherd, that had caused his recurring dream, that had brought him to a city near Africa, to find a king, and to be robbed in order to meet a crystal merchant, and . . .The closer one gets to realizing his Personal Legend, the more that Personal Legend becomes his true reason for being, thought the boy.‚Äù‚ÄúThe closer he got to the realization of his dream, the more difficult things became. It seemed as if what the old king had called ‚Äúbeginner‚Äôs luck‚Äù were no longer functioning. In his pursuit of the dream, he was being constantly subjected to tests of his persistence and courage. So he could not be hasty, nor impatient. If he pushed forward impulsively, he would fail to see the signs and omens left by God along his path.‚Äù‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be impatient,‚Äù he repeated to himself. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like the camel driver said: ‚ÄòEat when it‚Äôs time to eat. And move along when it‚Äôs time to move along.‚Äô‚Äù‚ÄúIf good things are coming, they will be a pleasant surprise,‚Äù said the seer. ‚ÄúIf bad things are, and you know in advance, you will suffer greatly before they even occur.‚ÄùThis kind of reminded me that quote from Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them:‚ÄúMy philosophy is that worrying means you suffer twice.‚Äù‚ÄúWhen people consult me, it‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm reading the future; I am guessing at the future. The future belongs to God, and it is only he who reveals it, under extraordinary circumstances. How do I guess at the future? Based on the omens of the present. The secret is here in the present. If you pay attention to the present, you can improve upon it. And, if you improve on the present, what comes later will also be better. Forget about the future, and live each day according to the teachings, confident that God loves his children. Each day, in itself, brings with it an eternity.‚Äù‚ÄúEvery search begins with beginner‚Äôs luck. And every search ends with the victor‚Äôs being severely tested.‚Äù

One last thing I want to point out is that I wasn't expecting this book to be so philosophical...and I wasn't anticipating to like it so much for that. I'm truly excited to see what I'll think of my next Coelho book.*That ending.... I genuinely laughed out loud when Santiago realized where his treasure was buried. And I kind of applaud the author for interweaving the intricate details of this tale in such a seamless way.I also listened to this songwhile reading thanks to the latest and most beautiful episode of This Is Us. (The ‚ÄúAnd I will remember you‚Äù from the song has me on the edge of tears every time.)3.5/5 stars

35,129633077,11/07/2010,1.0,"A spanish shepherd boy santiago has these recurring dreams about a treasure hidden at the foot of the egyptian pyramids. He leaves Spain to find it and journeys to the markets of Tangiers and across the Egyptian desert, guided along the way by a camel driver, an alchemist and other spiritual guides. and he discovers a far greater treasure (greater than any earthly gold): wisdom, self knowledge and enlightenment. Though the Alchemist is not about Santiago at all. It's an inspirational fable; it's about our own self discovery; it's about awakening your passions; it's about following your heart; embracing life as a journey and finding the courage to chase your dreams. It felt more like a really hackneyed self-help book to me. I don't know if it makes great literature. What is great literature? ",94,0.9876,0.0,0.76,0.24,0.5101190476190476,NEGATIVE,0.858
36,1517684069,04/20/2017,4.0,"4.5 starsThis is like a motivational speech tucked into the confines of a fiction story. Santiago‚Äôs inner turmoil is so painfully reflected in my own life and my conflict with doing what I want versus what i‚Äôm comfortable doing. This book really pushed my boundaries and, although set in a place and lifestyle I‚Äôve never experienced, I heavily related to. It's inspiring and haunting all in one breath. It's lighthearted, but also thought-provoking. The setting begins in the fields of Spain but eventually switches to Santiago‚Äôs journey through Africa, so I found the scenery and conflict arising from their locations very fascinating. I rarely read classics set outside the US or England, which I should pursue more of, and this was very enjoyable with Islamic supporting characters. I grew frustrating in the middle of this book, because it seemed almost assaulting in its message. The dialogue is very transparent and this book says exactly what it means with little to no metaphor or embellishment, which I originally thought was tacky. The more I read, however, the more I realized how interesting of a tactic it is. This reads almost like The Little Prince or a children‚Äôs book where the moral is delivered to you in a wrapped package with a bow. It delivers its message up-front, but it gives the reader enough space to determine how he or she wants to absorb that message. It's brilliant.Santiago is a fascinating main character that I think anyone could relate to. This book is truly ageless because it‚Äôs about following your heart and your life‚Äôs destiny, and although this book does dabble in discussions about religion and how God plays into that role, it‚Äôs very subjective in its interpretation. Islam and Catholicism are both depicted in this story, but even as an atheist, I was able to recognize the intention that Coelho was putting forth: overcoming the obstacles that are barriers to your personal calling. (honestly, this entire book is so quotable.)Now that i‚Äôve effectively turned into a philosophy professor, I‚Äôll stop. But I did really enjoy this story. If you‚Äôre not a fan of literalness (is that a word?) in classics, then I would pass on this one, but its imagery and setting is so neat that I would nudge anybody else to grab it from a used bookstore. If anything, it‚Äôs under 200 pages, so just go for it.",92,0.9853,0.068,0.799,0.133,0.5135897435897436,POSITIVE,0.9973

‚ÄúWhen we love, we always strive to become better than we are. When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better too.‚Äù

~ Rating- 1 star ~Content/ Trigger Warning-  Poverty, Sexism, Desert  The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho is an extremely hyped up book. I picked it up in the hopes of finding an interesting read that I could gain something from, but I hadn‚Äôt expected to be so thoroughly disappointed. The Alchemist isn‚Äôt a terrible book, rather I am the wrong kind of reader for this book. The message of The Alchemist is to essentially find the true meaning of life and follow your heart all the time. While I agree with it to a certain extent, I didn‚Äôt like the way it was portrayed in the book. It made not following a ‚Äòpersonal legend ‚Äô a bad thing and people who don‚Äôt abandon their fairly happy life in pursuit for a greater goal a bad thing, which I disagree with. Apparently if you don‚Äôt leave your life to search for a ‚Äòpersonal legend‚Äô then you are either unhappy, afraid, or both. That makes no sense. It is not a bad thing to keep living your life the way it is, in fact it is an admirable thing to find happiness in what you already have. There were some sentences in The Alchemist that were quite cliche, like-
‚ÄúThere is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure.‚Äù
Yes that is true, but it is never the only factor that is responsible. Sometimes people may not have enough resources to achieve their dreams, or sometimes they may not have the ability. Sometimes people can‚Äôt abandon their life only for the sake of a dream that might not be achieved. I‚Äôm not saying that we should never make an effort to pursue our dreams, but we should also be practical and plan it properly. The fear of failure is more of a mental aspect, but overcoming it does not guarantee that your dreams will be fulfilled.The main character in The Alchemist is a shepherd, Santiago, who is earning enough income, has a passion for reading. He has plans of getting engaged to someone and is content in his life. When he is offered the opportunity to pursue something, (which by the way, he doesn't even know what at this point) he jumps right at it for absolutely no reason. The character doesn‚Äôt think it through properly. Someone tells him to go in search of some hidden treasure and pursue his ‚Äòpersonal legend‚Äô and he listens. It is so impractical, irrational, and something that wouldn't exactly work out in real life. If everyone abandoned their life and went to a desert to pursue a ‚Äòpersonal legend‚Äô, the world would collapse, and there would be no one to ensure it functioned.What bothered me a lot more than this though, was the fact that the male characters are the only ones who are allowed to pursue a ‚Äòpersonal legend‚Äô. The female characters in this book are expected to wait around at home, while the male characters leave everything behind. We have sentences these-*Mild Spoiler alert*
‚ÄúThe desert takes our men from us, and they don't always return. We know that, and we are used to it. Those who don't return... they become part of the Soul of the World. Some do come back. And then the other women are happy because they believe that their men may one day return, as well. I used to look at those women and envy them their happiness. Now, I too will be one of the women who wait."" And, ""The boy fell to his knees and wept. He thanked God for making him believe in his Personal Legend, and for leading him to meet a king, a merchant, an Englishman, and an alchemist. And above all for his having met a woman of the desert who had told him that love would never keep a man from his Personal Legend.""
Now I get it, this book was written years ago. I also get the fact that this is Santiago‚Äôs story, and I don't expect anyone else to tag along with him on his personal legend. But that still doesn‚Äôt make me want to ignore this, as it was just upsetting and something I hadn‚Äôt expected in a book hyped so much. In short, The Alchemist was a thorough disappointment. I like the general message of the book, but I wish it was discussed in more depth and I wish the other side (and more practical side) wasn‚Äôt completely ignored and tagged as ‚Äòbad‚Äô.Before people argue that this is fiction and I should not take it so seriously, I picked this up expecting a life-changing read, so I suppose I can complain if it didn‚Äôt meet the mark. If you are debating whether you should read this, my advice is to read through the quotes. If you find them inspiring, I‚Äôd recommend reading the book!Audiobook Comments The narration was alright. Nothing extraordinary, but not bad either. It would be good for beginners I‚Äôd recommend it. Audiobook Rating- 3/5 stars.

‚ÄúEveryone seems to have a clear idea of how other people should lead their lives, but none about his or her own.‚Äù

For a book that said a lot of things, it wound up saying nothing at all.Also, just as an aside, the phrase ""Personal Legend"" is mentioned 56 times in this relatively short book. Yes, I counted.

‚ÄúThere is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure.‚Äù

I am starting this review by pointing out that this is my dad‚Äôs favorite book, one of my close friends favorite book and also one of the doctors I like in the university‚Äôs favorite book. I always had a feeling that it is just not the right book for me. I got curious though (If you know me well, you know how much of a curious person I am) and had to read it to see what all of the fuss is about. I had more reasons to like this book than not to. Unfortunately, my expectations were in place because for the most part I did not like this book.The writing is simple, I expected it to be a bit more complicated and harder to understand which was one of the reasons that made me evade the book for a long time. I was surprised by the fact that it was very available, very easy to digest. That being said, the book is read like a parable and has a focus on philosophical themes so it is certainly not for everyone. It had one of my pet peeves when it comes to writing which is just repeating the same quote over and over until just seeing it becomes annoying and a turn off for me. I can accept a quote repeated twice or thrice but don‚Äôt shove it in my face every couple of pages because it will make me cringe! 

‚ÄúAnd, when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.‚Äù

The above quote is one of the quotes that are recycled throughout the book and it sounds optimistic. A second reason why I didn‚Äôt think I would enjoy this book is because it has the law of attraction theme. I read ‚ÄúThe Secret‚Äù earlier this year and I hated it. I don‚Äôt think that wanting things just make it happen. I don‚Äôt agree or disagree with the law. I fell somewhere in the middle. I believe that things happen for a reason and when we want something to happen, we should work for it to happen. That does not necessarily mean that it will though.I did not relate to the characters and that mainly explains my rating. I saw reviews of people who liked the book and most of them said that it made them feel a certain magic. I read books that made me feel that and I really loved them. If I did feel the same thing that people felt, then I would have certainly loved it but I felt nothing because I did not care about the characters at all. I liked how the author introduced the characters in a very simple way with minimal use of names too. What I did not like was the depiction of Arab characters as simplistic two dimensional creatures. I did not like the instant romance because it did not make sense, add to that the time jump that there was there and it would make it even more unrealistic. 

‚ÄúThe secret of life, though, is to fall seven times and to get up eight times.‚Äù

One additional thing that I did not like was the ‚ÄúMaktub‚Äù principle from Islam that was discussed through the story. This is a very complicated thing that Muslims take a long time to understand and some of us never do. The author oversimplified it to fit the philosophy that he was writing. I am going to tell you about another thing that we have which is the Trust principle. If we want something very much, we work hard for it and then trust God to give us the best outcome. Sometimes that can be the thing that we want and sometimes it is not and we realize that after a while when we look at things retrogradely.Summary: Unfortunately, I had many criticisms for the book and did not end up being a fan. I can see why other readers would like it (My friend told me he didn‚Äôt like it first time but he loved it the second which I find fascinating!). I just did not enjoy the whole philosophical theme it was discussing and the oversimplifying of facts that it did.

By the end of the novel I am skimming most passages.The characters are flat (I didn't really ""feel"" them, what they were going through, and there was no character development), and the storyline resembled that of a children's folktale (I like folktales).Overall, it was a worthwhile read given that it only took a couple hours, presented some interesting ideas (albeit, without illustrating any of them satisfactorily), and removed me to the Spanish countryside/Arabian desert for a bit (I am a sucker for folktales, and if this book is nothing else, it would make a lovely illustrated children's book).""I think this sums up in a few words what the book is about. Simple. Feel Good. Motivational. Folktale. It also brings many of the baggage of those themes with that. Certainly it at times does appear to be able to reach deep within people like Corie whom said in her review:""If you are looking for a nice meaty book filled with twists, turns and life-like characters - this is NOT your book. Wait until you are more in a more introspective mood. Coelho's prose is simplistic and at times childish. And the read is easy - I finished in around an hour and a half I suppose. But the meanings left scattered throughout the chapters are intense and authentic. Omens and signs - all around us, the universe directing us and helping us, wanting us to succeed. All we have to do is be aware - to listen. ""and Micha does add a good point against it:""Let me only point to the fact that there is now an ‚ÄúIllustrated Alchemist‚Äù version of the book. If ones personally philosophy can be illustrated as a comic book then perhaps it is a tad bit on the simple side. ""Despite all this I would have to disagree with April's comments in Eleanor's review:""This book is intended for people with passion and drive. Its not just a novel - for entertainment reading. The story is simple - exactly! thats the beauty of the book - its simplicity. But with that simplicity is a complex philosophy that you obviously don't get because you took the story literally.""The book I would say caters to people with depression and lack of drive more than it inspires. Deep down, I felt I was reading for entertainment and that's why it came off as complex to me because deep down the protagonist is a Mary Sue and that's why it caters to me because like a Mary Sue done well, it tries to connect the reader who is apathetic or hopeless or depressed and tries to show them that maybe there is something out there just worth grasping for and yet I get a feeling that people who do grasp for the message in the Alchemist will find that the book isn't deep at all and certainly many of the other reviews properly represent that.That's why I rated it as amazing. It's just one of those books that no one can really tell someone how bad it is until the reader actually finds out for himself and I doubt those who have read many books will find it astounding it all but not everyone reads a tons of books and for what it's worth, I think a book that can attach itself and inspire someone to read further deserves no less a rating than amazing.The Alchemist is simply that kind of book that manages to do so by being short enough, shallow enough, deep enough and hyped enough to cater to a generation of casual readers.",59,0.9795,0.037,0.866,0.097,0.4688805346700083,NEGATIVE,0.9978

I really wanted to get to work on time today and the frickin‚Äô car broke down. Which universe are we talking about then? In all fairness to Paulo Coelho though, The Alchemist is narrated in the style of a fable, and fables are not meant to be taken literally. The entire book, if I understand correctly, is a metaphor for self-actualization or fulfillment of one‚Äôs ultimate goal in life. It all seems very Woodstock to me. I have read online articles about this book praising it for the life lessons it (allegedly) contains. I have to admit that I have gained no insight at all from reading this book. I tried reading between the lines but all I saw were blank spaces. This book reminds me a little bit of Life of Pi, though ""Pi"" is much more appealing.Wait a minute, I am beginning to sound like I am disparaging this (allegedly) profound little best selling book. I actually quite enjoyed reading it, taken at face value without trying to decipher the meaning of life, the universe and everything it is a fairly entertaining book. I was not bored at any point, but I did chuckle a few times at how ludicrous I find the philosophical discussions to be. The trouble with the fable format is that I could not believe any of it anymore than I can believe a wolf can blow houses down (unless it is some kind of cyborg wolf). The characters in this novel do not behave in the way real people do. For example, the protagonist Santiago declares his love for the desert girl Fatima on their first meeting and she does not bat an eyelid. She even agrees to wait for him for however long he takes to complete his life mission to achieve his Personal Legend. Surely even love at first sight is more subtle than this. The numerous sage passages are mostly nonsensical to me. For example 
‚ÄúEverything that happens once can never happen again. But everything that happens twice will surely happen a third time.‚Äù
 This defies logic. If things cannot happen more than once, the second and subsequent happenings will surely not be on the menu! Am I reading this too literally again? Gimme some of that weed man!  The audiobook I read is beautifully narrated by Jeremy Irons who sounds almost exactly like Neil Gaiman here (if you have listened to Neil Gaiman narrating a book you will know what I mean). A huge improvement on his reading of  Lolita  which I think is a little over the top and rendered that book harder to follow.So, my Goodreads friends, is this a good read?

I‚Äôve heard enough about Paulo Coelho‚Äôs bestselling novel The Alchemist for so long that I finally decided to see what it was about for myself, and, perhaps predictably for a novel that unironically sells itself as being about ‚Äúfollowing your dreams‚Äù, it was full of craptacular pseudo-spiritual New Age bullshit. As a novel, it‚Äôs super-boring. Santiago bumbles along an uninspired journey, selling sheep, selling glassware, meeting some unremarkable people and, of course, finding his ‚Äútreasure‚Äù. Nothing about it grabbed me. Worse still was Coelho‚Äôs horrible writing style which mimics religious parables that were always boring as fuck to read those few times I attempted to read the Bible as a kid. What makes it worse is the lofty prose believes its imparting valuable wisdom to the reader: ‚ÄúWhen someone makes a decision, he is really diving into a strong current that will carry him to places he had never dreamed of when he first made the decision.‚Äù (p.68)And‚ÄúThere is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure.‚Äù (p.143) Both of which are true but so banal and obvious to note as to be worthless. Other statements are just plain dumb: ‚ÄúPeople need not fear the unknown if they are capable of achieving what they need and want.‚Äù (p.77) So if they‚Äôre incapable of achieving what they need and want, they should legitimately be afraid? How reassuring! Also:‚ÄúMost people see the world as a threatening place, and, because they do, the world turns out, indeed, to be a threatening place.‚Äù (p.132) Which follows a scene where Santiago and the alchemist are caught in a conflict between warring desert tribes! If they saw thousands of armed men fighting, would it still not have been a threatening place if they had thought it wasn‚Äôt?? Alongside these patronising and idiotic platitudes, the novel pushes patronising and idiotic ideas like magical thinking - believe that good things will happen and they will - while using labels like Personal Legend (your identity/goals) and Soul of the World (???). I understand that a lot of this story is symbolic but Coelho really has nothing new to say. It‚Äôs the journey not the destination, love not money, etc. Really, that‚Äôs all you‚Äôve got - this is what impresses so many readers?

63,1217382428,03/03/2015,3.0,"The book tells the story of Santiago, a Spanish shepherd who has a recurring dream about finding a treasure near the Pyramids of Egypt.Advised by a gypsy woman to seek the treasure, Santiago sells his sheep and takes off. Along the way Santiago meets several people who have a profound effect on his life. The first, who calls himself 'the King of Salem', advises the boy to pursue his 'personal legend' (deepest desire). The King tells Santiago that when a person undertakes such a quest the universe conspires to assist him/her. The King's philosophy reminded me of the 2006 book 'The Secret' by Rhonda Byrne, which suggests that when a person really wants something the universe gives it to them - an idea that's hard (for me) to believe in either book. In any case, Santiago pursues his dream, but it's not easy or straightforward. He travels to Africa to start his journey across the desert to Egypt and is promptly robbed of all his money. Santiago finds work with a crystal merchant, where he does a superb job, but he realizes the merchant didn't fulfill his own personal legend - and the shepherd sets off for Egypt once more. Santiago joins a caravan to cross the desert, where he eventually meets an alchemist who imbues the boy with his own philosophy of life and encourages Santiago to continue his journey. During all this Santiago falls in love with a girl, has several run-ins with tribal chiefs, and gets robbed a couple more times. In some ways the story brought to mind a fairy tale with supernatural elements since Santiago has conversations with the wind and sun - who assist him in a time of trouble. There are some spiritual elements in the story and a lot of talk about love being the most important thing in the world - a theme which also occurs in other Coelho books. Santiago is never diverted from his quest and eventually discovers his treasure and presumably lives happily ever after. This book didn't really resonate with me as I don't seem to share Coelho's philosophy but I think the right audience would find this a very uplifting story.

In Paulo Coelho's The Alchemist, a boy named Santiago is drawn to the Pyramids in Egypt by a recurring dream that tells him that he will find a buried treasure there. At its heart, this is an adventure story, but it is also a fable. It's very simply but elegantly written, and I was enjoying it more than I expected until the last quarter of the book. I'm an atheist, but I don't mind reading things that reference religion. This book, however, and especially in the last quarter, becomes deeply and nauseatingly religious, mentioning God on every other page and telling numerous religious stories. The Alchemist became a lost cause for me when Coelho made this incredibly ignorant statement on page 131: ...his heart began to tell him things that came from the Soul of the World. It said that all people who are happy have God within them. In addition to such blatantly false statements, the story also falls apart in the last quarter, obsessively mentioning the bizarre concepts of the ""Personal Legend"", a quest that every person and thing in the universe seems to be on to fulfill its destiny (even chemical elements like lead are on this quest, because apparently they have souls and are alive?), and the ""Soul of the World"". Coelho also appears to be incredibly naive. One of his central tenets in this book could be paraphrased as: ""if you are trying to fulfill a dream, the whole world conspires in your favour to make it happen."" Seriously? Does Coelho know how many people in the history of the world tried to achieve their dreams and failed? Probably billions. He gives the impression with such statements that he lived most of his life under a rock, sheltered from the reality of the world. Nicely written, but repetitive, misguided, and ultimately ignorant, The Alchemist succeeds only in that it has revealed me as the true alchemist, as I will be transmuting my copy into a few dollars of cash when I trade it in at my local used book store. 1.5 stars",52,0.9937,0.06,0.779,0.16,0.4989989177489178,NEGATIVE,0.9998

(It mostly ignored John, though, whose Gospel account is too different from the others to reconcile into the mix.) If an adult were to read any part of this mishmash, he would notice right away how juvenile is the manner in which the stories are recounted.

This is a difficult book for me to evaluate. For every one sensible proverb or statement the author makes, which are usually quotations directly from the Bible, there are ten or more that are either blatantly untrue or just nonsensical.

When you are loved, you can do anything in creation. When you are loved, there's no need at all to understand what's happening, because everything happens within you.‚Äù This doesn't even make any sense.‚ÄúEveryone on earth has a treasure that awaits him.‚Äù No, only those who have had their sins forgiven through Jesus will go to Heaven.‚ÄúGod only rarely reveals the future. When he does so, it is for one reason: it's a future that was written so as to be altered.‚Äù No. If God reveals the future, as He has done in the Bible, it is for our instruction so we can prepare ourselves. It cannot be altered.‚ÄúTo realize one's destiny is a person's only obligation.‚Äù No, there are plenty of obligations on us, they are summed up in the Bible which is God's instructions for daily life.‚ÄúIt is said that all people who are happy have God within them.‚Äù No, there will be people in this life who are happy without God.""When we love, we always strive to become better than we are.

Excuse me, but I don't believe in fate, I believe in some accidents that make us meet certain people or some situations that can bring us another perspectives, but in the end I believe that if you don't work hard enough for your dream, it won't happen. It's not written in the stars and the universe won't conspire for you to get it. You should do all that is in your power to get it and above all, you should trust your capacity and abilities.  But  fate playing a major role in this book isn't what made me give it one star. Nope. I would have gotten over it if the plot was interesting, but around the half mark I got so bored I thought I would never finish this book. I wasn't invested in the character at all, I didn't care if he got to find the treasure or not, I didn't care at all. Plus, I couldn't relate at all to him, he seemed very naive and quite dense at times. Like, he trusts people instantly with his money and then they steal from him,  shocking  . So, yes, not my cup of tea. If you liked this book, that's great! I just didn't reasonated with it, at all.",49,0.9646,0.087,0.765,0.148,0.5952380952380952,NEGATIVE,1.0

Santiago‚Äôs parents had wanted him to be a priest; however, while studying in school he realized that this was not what he wanted.

 Gold Gavel for Worst Book Read in 2014 

 Disappointing and Offensive Tripe - 1 Star 
I have a disclaimer and I am going to get it out of the way right now. I am a Christian and my beliefs are generally in line with those you might consider evangelical. That said, I wasn't crying foul over the DiVinci Code nor do I avoid books that involve wizards or magic. I don't believe that Harry Potter was written by Satan and I do not hold book burning parties for those books which ""offend the moral sensitivities"". I have read many books that do no share my view on Christianity. Authors often take liberty with Biblical accounts or add elements to scriptures that are not there. It doesn't bother me. I know what I believe. I am not easily offended. I have read books that tried to be offensive, books that offended many others and books that people say should have offended me, yet I was not offended.I know what does bother me and it was on full display in this novel. The Alchemist purports to tell the story in the vein of a ""Christian"" Parable. The main character professes to be a Christian, professes a belief in Jesus. The problem is that the author does not present Christianity but rather a form of Mysticism and Religious Plurality. In essence, God is not a being or entity but rather everywhere and everything, including in nature, Jesus, Allah and Buddha.Before you jump down my throat, I don't have a problem with the author writing of his belief system. I have a problem with the author cloaking his belief system within the guise of my own. I found it to be offensive and disingenuous. He has taken the framework of Christianity and subtly introduced elements of his own worldview.In reality, this a generic ""spiritual"" parable and holds itself out as something else. It get one star for the offence of personation of Christianity.Outside of this, the story was rather dull and unimaginative. The only clever elements were at the very end. Honestly, this story could have been told in about 150 less pages. I do not understand what people have found to be so charming and compelling about this less than average tale. If you are looking for a heartwarming and uplifting parable, look somewhere else.",36,0.837,0.08,0.815,0.105,0.4891293891293891,NEGATIVE,1.0

What's accumulated wisdom and experience for, if not to cause us to live differently (often with very different goals, aspirations, and fundamental beliefs) than we did when we were younger?I also couldn't buy the notion that your ""Personal Legend"" is made manifest to you in no uncertain terms when you are a child and you should never deviate from it. I dreamed of doing a hundred different things at various times during my childhood. More than one of those aspirations (psychiatrist, teacher, stay-at-home mom, sociologist) at one time or another during my youth seemed, without question, like the path I should follow. As I get dangerously close to middle age, I'm finding that I'm really happy as a horticulturist and constantly learning and doing new things within that field. I feel no regret at not having pursued those other paths.Also, I was left with the impression that the ""Personal Legend"" of the main female character in the story was to send kisses on the wind and wait for the safe return of her man. I thought the book made an important point: that true love shouldn't keep you from fulfilling those aspirations that are truly important to you. But that should, obviously, be true for both partners. I'll give the author the benefit of the doubt and assume that he didn't focus much on Fatima's goals and dreams because that's not whose story he was telling. I'm hoping that, though she takes time out of her day to think of her love and pray for his safe return, she's spending more of her time pursuing dreams of her own.",37,0.9942,0.044,0.778,0.178,0.4876629935720845,NEGATIVE,0.9999

 The above picture (of the first English edition of the book) condenses, remarkably well, what this book is about. A shepherd boy (from Spain, Andalucia) and his sheep (inside center triangle);he has to travel to Africa to meet beloved Fatima in a oasis (right side)... and fight (sword on left side) in several ways to get his dreamt treasure.He'll have to pass many [initiatic?] tests,..facing the Nature elements (while crossing desert) and his own psychological limitations and fears. With the help of some other characters (the King of Salem-Melchizedek-, the old gypsy woman and, especially, the Alchemist) he'll manage to realize his dream.PreambleBefore reading this beautiful book I had the chance to watch some interviews Paulo Coelho gave. Ahead are some of the aspects I found pertinent to the interpretation of the present novel. (1) The author acknowledged the importance of Symbolism in the making of the text (how many times have I read ""You've got to follow the signs""...in the Alchemist?); it goes back to a 1492 Catholic secret sect called Regnus Agnus Mundi.(2) Coelho made a very important distinction between having a dream and living the dream; this book, obviously, is about both.(3) When asked about his own death, how he would like to be recalled, the writer's first answer was that ""he fought the good fight and kept his faith""; then spoke of cremation and this epitaph: ""he died while he was still alive"". Coelho stressed the importance of ""following"" one's own dreams.(4) Coelho said there are writers who attained to the level of: writing the ""world language"": Hemingway,Blake,Borges and Malba Tahan,as examples. In fact, ultimately, everybody can ""dive"" into the Soul of the World (Jung's Collective Unconscious).Preface to the bookCoelho explained that before writing this book he spent 11 years studying Alchemy. Yes, the issues of transforming metals into gold. That was back in the 1970's. The writer wanted badly to fabricate the Elixir of Life, that was the most seductive part of the enterprise he got into.Experts refused to receive him. It got him to nullity. In 1973 he was desperate. He tried (regrettably,he reckons) using his theatre pupils in magic...with the Emerald Tablets. No way. It followed 6 years of skepticism.THEN in 1981 he met RAM and his master....and got back into Alchemy studies; the master taught him some lessons....in a language directed to the heart, not to the reason.The Story1. Spain, AndaluciaSantiago is questioned: why are you a shepherd, since you can read...?... he says he'd been in the seminar till 16 years of age; he studied Latin, Spanish and Theology...but told father that he didn't want to become a priest. Santiago wanted to travel ...so he became a shepherd.One day a strange character shows up to Santiago; ""I am the King of Salem"": give me 1/10 of your flock and I will tell you how to get to your treasure.Santiago met the old gypsy woman: you come here because of dreams. Dreams are the language of God. Santiago had a recurrent dream; about a treasure...when a child was about to tell him the exact location of the treasure he woke up. Gypsy woman says wants 1/10 of the treasure.Again the King of Salem. He tells Santiago:""you got to follow the signs"". And gives two stones to the shepherd; Urim and Turim, the black and white stones, for divination purposes. Santiago must fulfill his personal Legend, because what he wished to do was born in the universal Soul.2. AfricaThe shephard finds Africa strange.He gets robbed of all the money he took with him. So he has to work for the Crystals Merchant. A man whose business is 30 years old, ...but fears to accomplish his dream; he only dreams. Santiago wants to realize his. He knows he'll have to cross the desert to reach to the pyramids: the treasure is there. Meanwhile he helps the business prosper for the Merchant. Santiago has learned Arabic. On Tangiers Santiago recalled the image of Knight Santiago Matamouros (Moors slayer), riding his white horse.2.1 On the way towards Al Fayoum OasisIt's been 11 months, Santiago spent in Africa. Now, he's heading to the Oasis. He meets an Englishman who studied this topic: a world common language. But the Englishman is mainly concerned with the search for the Philosophical Stone; he wants to meet a man: The Alchemist; a 200-years-old master who visited Europe, but now lives in the Oasis.The boy befriends a camels conductor who lived in El Cairum; due to an earth quake he quit the agricultural work.The englishman speaks about the famous Alchemists: Ceber,Fulcanelli,Elias and Helvetius. He tells the shephard boy: fear to fail prevented me from trying the great work, now I am starting what I should have started 10 years ago.

 2.2 Oasis of 50,000 Tamaras trees and 300 wellsThe Alchemist saw the caravan approaching. Santiago meets with Fatima.She is his treasure,now. Fatima says that the Alchemist knows about the world secrets and talks with the desert djins. Santiago ponders about love without possession while watching the desert hawks. Then he has a vision: an Army approaching the Oasis to attack it.Santiago is telling the leaders of the Oasis about his vision. -Who dared to read the flight of the hawks?... and old man recalls [Bible's] Joseph interpretations of dreams when in Egypt.... -we all know that whoever believes in dreams than he/she knows how to interpret them.In fact, the Oasis was attacked by 500 men; 499 got shot, one hanged. The shepherd gets rewarded with 50 golden coins and he's invited as Oasis counsellor. But Santiago must follow his dream. So he leaves Oasis with the Alchemist.2.3 Ride to the Pyramids with the AlchemistOne Army makes them prisoners. The Alchemist says Santiago knows how to transform himself into Wind. The boy is scared, terrified. The Alchemist warns him: you are going to die, I know how to transform myself into Wind.It's the darkest hour for the boy. He starts praying: he wants to get back to Fatima and find his other treasure. He's got to ""dive"" into the desert; he'll talk to the desert for help; he'll try talking to the Levante Wind...or the Sun...though they don't know about love. But he manages to enrage the wind and a great sand storm covers the place where they're at. The Army gets convinced about the Shepherd's powers. He concludes he can perform miracles....because he believed his personal Legend. It's the Alchemist farewell: it's a 3-hours ride till the pyramids, now you go alone.2.4 The PyramidsSantiago is crying; he doesn't know where his treasure is. But at the spot where the tears had fallen upon, there's a scarab right there...(follow the signs!); Santiago starts digging...for all night. Robbers show up, spank him...and he confesses he was looking for a treasure; but found none. One of the thieves tells Santiago: you won't die, you're going to live and learn that a man cannot be stupid; right on the spot where you stand I, too, had a recurrent dream...I should go to the plains of Spain, search for a church in ruins, where shepherds used to sleep with the sheep,...a sycamore tree growing up inside the church...had I excavated where the root was, I would have found a hidden treasure.But I'm not stupid.Thieves left,the boy knew the pyramids were smiling at him.3. Back in Spain , Andalucia plains.Yes, by the sycamore tree Santiago digs...and finds the treasure: golden coins...and precious stones. He adds to them Urim and Turim. He's got to hand 1/10 of this to the gypsy woman. He feels the kiss of the Wind...he must rush to Fatima, waiting for him in the Oasis.A Boy turning into a Man; one who relies on his heart.Rituals of Becoming.Four stars and a half.-What about the Englishman? ..he was left in the Oasis trying to produce gold out of plumbum,...via Alchemy. But there's no telling of his success...or failure. ",36,0.972,0.072,0.833,0.095,0.3821141709695927,POSITIVE,0.6432

104,3883485177,03/10/2021,5.0," I really REALLY love this! Instead of talking about THE book, I'm gonna talk about what I felt while reading the book.And I'm not sure if it's because it‚Äôs almost that time of the month and I'm just an emotional mess or that this book is just what I need for my current state. This book talks about a young shepherd boy who goes on a journey and quest for treasure to realize his 'Personal Legend', a dream in a quest for fulfilment. And from there, you can see how he's been through obstacles and hurdles but as he goes, he learned to overcome his fear, he learned to never lose hope and listened to what his heart desire. I also think it's because this book took place in the Middle East (when he travelled) so some of the values from the people the boy met hit close to home, as a Muslim myself. It makes me think again of the things I should always be grateful more for and strive like I always intended. 

""I saw that everything really was written there for me and that the doors had always been closed before because I hadn't realized that I was the one person in the world with the authority to open them"" 

And that gives me a little strength; to even start my proposal today (*‚Ä¢ÃÄ·¥ó‚Ä¢ÃÅ*)Ÿà ÃëÃë (yay).

""There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure"" 

This book also talked about fear being a bigger obstacle than the obstacle itself and it's exactly what I'm feeling the most now. All my life, I had expectations set upon me. To fail is scary and the fact that I rarely experiencing it is what made it scarier to experience it again.But what this book told me?
""Why do we have to listen to our hearts?

Because, wherever your heart is, that is where you'll find your treasure

 ""Why should I listen to my heart?""

Because you will never be able to keep quiet. Even if you pretend not to have heard what it tells you, it will always be there inside you, repeating to you what you're thinking about life and about the world 
And I know I needed this because what my heart wants right now is to feel capable again and just do things as I always do. 

""Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself. And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams,...""

I cried when I read this book and I still cried while writing this. Damn it, it's flooding in here. I think it's the hormone. I was truly on a verge of breaking down (life's just hard don't you think?). But I also started to feel better. Whenever I'm feeling like giving up or in need of comfort, I know I can find this book again. I believe I'm gonna regret writing this publicly while being an emotional mess but at least some part of me is lighter now! and I‚Äôll pursue my own

But before I found one, the Soul of the World orchestrated the natural flow of things so that I should come across a copy of this book, and my diaphanous frustration compelled me to buy and read this work I've avoided until today. I have this particular belief that books I see in most houses that I've been to, if not all, are overrated. To me, The Alchemist was no exception. I read it under 3 or 4 hours which is probably because of the simplicity both in the story and in the prose, both were straightforward and linear. But it was nothing like Hemingway's style. It is retrospective but please, do not even imagine comparing this work to Siddhartha(4 Stars), (as some people do). Siddhartha is the work you read to experience a trance-like retrospective examination of life, in comparison, the only thing that made its mark in The Alchemist was the fantasy part, which I have to admit I see as a considerable digression for a ruminative retrospective novel. It does talk about love as the universal language of the world, that all of us are one but I had this feeling that The Alchemist barely scratched the surface of this reservoir of ruminative philosophy which led to an occasional overtly pretentious and over-reaching feel. Coelho's telling us that the happiness we seek is within us, as evinced by how this novel started and ended, what I can't curiously reconcile however is the fact that it was someone else's dream that completed his journey, as if negating the very message it seeks to impart.

It shows that what we dream can become out destiny. In this book we are met with a shepherd boy named Santiago as he dreams of travelling the world, specifically to the pyramids, in search of a desired treasure. From these dreams he decides to travel and this takes home to the exotic markets of North Africa and the Egyptian desert. Along his journey he is faced with many decisions and also encounters a plethora of people along his quest for the treasure. He meets people who inspire him to realise his destiny, he meets people where by he learns the language of the world and the soul of the world, and Santiago himself helps others realise their destiny as well.This book reveled in the fact that just reaching your dreams and destiny is not easy... there will be failure. But this book emphasises the need to keep pushing on until you reach it.This book was very spiritual and mentions religion, in specific in reference to God. It speaks of Omens and how these can help guide the way to destiny. This is a great book if you want to explore spirituality and how this can help you find your destiny. A negative to this book is that it won't appeal to everyone- its very spiritual and religious and some readers (like myself) are non-religious and non-spiritual and take a more 'realist' and sometimes 'cynical' (with me anyway) approach in achieving goals. However, it was interesting to learn of a character who envisions the world through spirituality and religion. In a wider context, this book may be applied to everyone as the message conceived is to just follow and believe in your heart in order to reach your goals. It's the realisation of what you want to achieve.Another negative that has been noted in previous reviews is that this book is sexist. However, I am not too sure whether the author has done this purposely so as to reflect the time period, or cultural practices where this book is placed. I also wonder if the author intentionally introduces females in short bursts and doesn't give them much of a narrative, as he doesn't want to wonder away from the main plot line, which is to focus on the realisation, adventure, and mental turmoil of Santiago.Overall I can understand how this book is favoured by many. It is about listening to your heart and following your dreams, and to not be afraid of failure.",29,0.9838,0.038,0.842,0.12,0.4524603174603175,NEGATIVE,0.9049

I have tried to like it, but it constantly kept going on my nerves. I suppose you either love or hate Coelho and in my case the answer is obvious. I may try another one of his works just to be sure we can't be friends, but it's not gonna happen anytime soon. Yeah, I don't like this story. One of my best friends did, and since we have similar taste in books, I thought I would too. I was spectacularly disappointed. This book isn't even good for children because it gives you the wrong impression of life. Too many times I was outrages by some of our narrator's opinions. A teenage boy Santiago follows his 'Personal Legend' in travelling from Spain to the Pyramids in Egypt searching for hidden treasure. Along the way, he learns 'the Language of the World' and the 'Soul of the World'. This is the story about a boy who abandons everything so he could fulfil his destiny or whatever. The book is basically about how everyone have only one true path.It certainly makes you think about your life and choices, but the whole story is packed up as a fairy tale which only added to it looking even more unbelievable. It's wrapped up in so many unrealistic thoughts and selfish tone, nonetheless the message it sends is quite disturbing. What if you can't pursue your Personal Legend because you have to take care of your family, for example? The way this idea was presented, it seems like you're a coward because that's just ""an obstacle"" and you're not persistent enough. The writing style is plain and fast-paced, but I don't think it allowed characters to grow. Everyone remained two dimensional. They're patronising and pretentious, with horribly boring monologues of ""wisdom"". I also wasn't invested in the protagonist at all. Yes, he's travelling around the world, seeing cool stuff while trying to follow his Personal Legend, but I just couldn't give a damn what happens to him.It seems the main message is that as long as you stay true to your heart and seek out your Personal Legend the universe will help you fulfil it. This way of thinking can only disappoint you immensely and help you live like a parasite. There is no cosmic energy that will make sure things turn out the way you want. This notion is not only false, but unacceptable. Just because we want something, it doesn't mean it's right. The book attempted to be deep and better version of ""Little Prince"" but failed significantly. This looks like a self-help book and honestly, I hate them. If everyone simply went off on a spiritual journeys and gave up their responsibilities, we would live in pure anarchy. I'm not saying people shouldn't chase their happiness, I'm just contemplating that people should seek it with regards towards others around them. I admit it's a nice idea that wherever you go, your true love will wait for you, but it just doesn't work in real life. If it's true love, I guess it means that he or she will ALWAYS be by your side. Not WAITING for you, but LIVING WITH you, right? This is a story about self discovery, awakening your passions, following your heart and finding the courage to chase your dreams. Those are all fine goals but honestly, I don't need some pretentious author telling me how to live my life with questionable magic and alchemy. The main character accepts new ideals, learns new things, but he abandons everything in search for his gold. He travels to beautiful places, meets interesting people, and falls in love, but none of that matters because he wants the gold. All that search had cost him all his money, friends and family and left him alone in an oasis. I truly believe that any success isn't worth a dime if you have NO ONE to share it with.

122,1139884414,12/24/2014,2.0,"I always liked reading, but only after joining Goodreads in December last year did books become a lifelong love that I can't go a day without. I still consider myself a beginner in reading literature, but my sensibilities and tastes have changed greatly over these eight months as I've spent more time than ever before reading books (and book reviews), and consequently I've been reevaluating (re-rating) books from the past quite often. I stumbled upon this book in my Read shelf before and it brought back some memories pleasant to recall.If I read this Internationally Bestselling Phenomenon (as on the cover) now I would only rate it two stars at most - but when I read this in March 2012 on a flight back from Vietnam, it meant quite a lot to me. Nowadays I can laugh jovially at the person I was back then, but the 'I' who was reading the novel seems to be on a different plane of consideration - the fact that I cherished this novel at the time seems to me like a drawer which connects my current self with that 20-year old reading on that plane, in a single instant, through the book. There's the life we lead, and the many lives we lead inside the pages, but I'm glad that this year I feel like my life as a reader has finally begun.It is the same in life; the heart changes, and it is our worst sorrow; but we know it only through reading, through our imagination: in reality its alteration, like that of certain natural phenomena, is so gradual that, even if we are able to distinguish, successively, each of its different states, we are still spared the actual sensation of change. - Swann's Way (In Search of Lost Time #1), Marcel ProustAugust 30, 2015",27,0.9875,0.041,0.81,0.149,0.4919913419913419,POSITIVE,0.6284

It is a little parenthesis in eternity.‚Äù     I was surprised to see so many negative reviews of this book here. When I scrolled through the ratings of The Alchemist, I found a parade of one and two stars one after another with an occasional four or five stars in between. Obviously so many negative reviews embeds a negative image of the book in question in a person's mind who might want to give it a try. And I was also one of those people who had fallen victim to these negative reviews. But I dived for it nonetheless since two of my friends had been strongly recommending it to me for a very long time now. But still, I didn't carry much expectation from it. How pleasing it is when something surprisingly turns out to be so good when you haven't really been expecting anything out of it. I found myself so terribly hooked that I couldn't put a stop to it. Sure, it wasn't a thick book or anything. In fact, it was only about 200 pages long. But I was so deeply engrossed in it that I was finished with it in about an hour only. I respect everyone's personal views about anything and even though so many people didn't enjoy a book I loved so much, it's completely okay. It was a different read for me altogether. I don't think so I have indulged in this type of book before. I love entering new genres and being versatile with my reads and I try a lot to explore new worlds within theses books. And this is exactly what I felt while reading The Alchemist. The Alchemist is a spiritual and meaningful book. One might even complain that it has too many preachings at times, too many spiritual talks. But as I said, I loved the novelty of this whole theme. It was something entirely new and fascinatingIt's not a gripping, thrilling and exciting book, if that's what you are looking for. That is perhaps why most people didn't enjoy it. The story starts with a young boy named Santiago who sets off on a long journey to find a treasure. But what the story is about, is not the treasure or Santiago himself. It is about the journey. It is about what happens in that journey. What all Santiago learns in those long rides and stormy deserts. The treasure was simply the end point.    ‚ÄúWhen we love, we always strive to become better than we are. When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better too.‚Äù      ‚ÄúThe secret of life, though, is to fall seven times and to get up eight times.‚Äù   Santiago is a simple but youthful and adventurous shepherd who whenever sleeps in the old ruined church he has taken shelter to, gets troubled by the same dream of a child asking him to seek out a treasure. After consulting a Gypsy woman who asks him to go to Egypt, his adventure begins. Somewhere along the way, he meets an Englishman who calls himself The Alchemist and asks him to teach him the art of the Alchemy. After learning many things from the Englishman, Santiago sets off again on his journey. He finds himself listening to the desert, conversing with the wind and sun and discovering The Soul Of The World. Through this beautiful journey, we see Santiago find his mind, soul, heart and finally the treasure.I think so what beautiful about this book is that despite being so simple, it is very deep and has so much meaning and thought with it. It's all those quotes which carry such wisdom, weight and beauty that make this book feel exhilarating. Paula Coelho was so majestic with his writing. Rather than the plot line, it was the words so beautifully weaved that stole the limelight.   ‚ÄúTell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself. And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams, because every second of the search is a second's encounter with God and with eternity.‚Äù      ‚ÄúIf you start by promising what you don't even have yet, you'll lose your desire to work towards getting it.‚Äù   And the ending of the book was one of the most perfect endings. The climax was a surprise to me and it made the book so much more wonderful. I repeat, it's not a book one would choose for a thrilling and heart stopping ride. But I still believe, everyone should have tried this book once, because it has so much to give and teach. And after realising that, one can truly see The Alchemist for the beautiful book it actually is.   ",27,0.9951,0.077,0.783,0.14,0.5441545018289206,POSITIVE,0.9806
126,2716656247,02/15/2019,4.0,"A few years back, the book everyone was talking about was this one. I saw it everywhere; online, in bookstores, in peoples' hands, and everyone was saying what a fantastic book it was. It was recommended to me by several people, and I was both loaned a copy (that I - gasp - still have) and gifted a copy, but for whatever reason I never got around to reading it. I always believed that someday I would, but meanwhile my reading life went on, and very busily so, with many other books. So when one of the gals in my book club chose it for this month's read I was actually pretty jazzed. I had two copies to read already!¬† I only had to find one of them.Perhaps the reason I'd previously put off reading it was that I had heard it was allegorical, and a bit mystical, and about a shepherd boy (who, by the way, is not really a boy at all actually, but a man.) I had heard that it was enlightening, inspiring and philosophical. I like all those things, but I usually read fiction for pleasure and nonfiction for research, and allegory for nothing. But I was ready at last to read the book everybody had been talking about and that has sold millions upon millions of copies.Here's the thing with a book that all the world loves; your expectations of it are extremely high. Stunningly high, at least for me. I was ready to be wowed, undone, amazed. And while I enjoyed it, I finished the book a bit underwhelmed and kind of sad. I wish now I had heard nothing about it.

I wanted to have my own discoveries, and when you read a borrowed book with underlines already inside, you don‚Äôt get them. And I do believe this is the kind of book where you need to have them.I am fully of the persuasion that there are life lessons to be learned, but not all life lessons are learned the same way. My preferred learning style (I know this now) is to hear a lecture or read an essay rather than read a work of allegorical fiction. And I absolutely need to make my own highlights.What this book's phenomenal success tells me more than anything is that people are hungry to know their purpose in life. I find that wonderfully refreshing because it quietly speaks that at our core, we know we are more than former primordial ooze. I believe we were made in the image of God, so we absolutely do have a purpose, and our souls are restless until we discover it.

""There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure."" And we should not fear because ""when you really want something, the universe conspires in your favor.""

I listened to the audio version, read by Jeremy Irons and loved it. I could follow the story with the text provided with the video. Jeremy Irons did a great job indeed.The moral of the story:- Nobody can fully accomplish a dream without determination, discipline and hard work. Anything less, will negatively effect the outcome - or success . - Success also have to include emotional growth, which translate into emotional intelligence. - Know yourself to understand your level of success. - To be a real man, there are lessons you need to learn. It is not a book for young girls. - Purify your life - leave everything behind that arrest your progress.It is a preachy experience, but for any young person reading it, there are subtle messages hidden in it. For instance, you do not need drugs to succeed in life. Expand your world, travel and learn from other cultures. Consider the message in all religions. The less you do to broaden your horizons, perspective, the smaller your dreams will be and poorer your quality of life - or something like that. Take responsibility for your own decisions. Toughen up.This kind of book can mean a lot for young people who are overwhelmed by the dark side of life they are bombarded with. The message is simple, but positive. Take over your own destiny, Make your own choices.Nothing new. Nothing new. Nothing new. Not a new message at all. It was after all taught by children's literature through the ages. This book used all the elements in those ancient stories and translated it into a modern version for young adults.And they all lived happily ever after.

143,79653981,12/02/2009,1.0,"There are two ways to judge The Alchemist: as a work of literature and as a moral fable. Unfortunately, and despite its inexplicable popularity, it scores horribly on both counts.I won't bore you with the plot details, but in a nutshell: Santiago the Spanish shepherd boy leaves his known life behind to search for his ""Personal Legend"" in the deserts of North Africa. En route he encounters various characters, such as the titular Alchemist, who help him on his way. That is, if a rambling series of cliches masquerading as philosophical wisdom can be considered helpful. As a work of literature, it's trite, redundant and dramatically weak. Instead of a protagonist who must grow, change, learn or overcome obstacles to achieve a goal, we have one who knows, or is given, the answer to every dilemma as soon as it's posed, and who is led by the nose directly to his target by ""the Universe"". No dramatic tension is allowed to linger for more than half a page before being forcibly resolved. The Alchemist has been compared to The Little Prince. But whereas the latter's simplicity is charming, the former's is merely childish. In Saint-Exup√©ry's incomparably superior novella the lessons are hard-earned. In The Alchemist, they are spoon-fed to the characters and to the reader in the manner of a church sermon, using mystical psychobabble terms like ""The Soul of the World"", ""Master Work"", and of course ""Personal Legend"". This patronizingly religious aspect of The Alchemist illustrates its even more comprehensive failure, that as a moral fable. The Little Prince draws its broadly-sketched caricatures with charm and empathy: we're supposed to learn from the king, the lamplighter and so on, but we're not supposed to despise them. The Alchemist, however, can barely contain its disdain for those who don't drop everything to follow their so-called Personal Legend. For example, there's this insidious passage:The old man pointed to a baker standing in his shop window at one corner of the plaza. ‚ÄúWhen he was a child, that man wanted to travel, too. But he decided first to buy his bakery and put some money aside. When he‚Äôs an old man, he‚Äôs going to spend a month in Africa. He never realized that people are capable, at any time in their lives, of doing what they dream of.‚Äù ‚ÄúHe should have decided to become a shepherd,‚Äù the boy said. ‚ÄúWell, he thought about that,‚Äù the old man said. ‚ÄúBut bakers are more important people than shepherds. Bakers have homes, while shepherds sleep out in the open. Parents would rather see their children marry bakers than shepherds.‚Äù ‚ÄúIn the long run, what people think about shepherds and bakers becomes more important for them than their own Personal Legends.‚ÄùGet it? A hardworking man who puts bread on people's plates and supports his own family with dignity, is worthy of nothing but pity and disdain because he didn't follow a childhood dream. And then there's this brazen claim:""Everyone believes the world's greatest lie..."" says the mysterious old man.""What is the world's greatest lie?"" the little boy asks.The old man replies, ""It's this: that at a certain point in our lives, we lose control of what's happening to us, and our lives become controlled by fate. That's the world's greatest lie.""Coelho ignores the fact that this pursuit of ""Personal Legend"" is a plaything of the privileged few. How does a 14 year old boy living hand-to-mouth in an Indonesian sweatshop follow his dream? How does he even articulate one? In what way can a rape survivor in a Darfur refugee camp follow her ""Personal Legend""? The lives of most of humanity are to a great degree controlled by fate. They consist mostly of a struggle to survive. The real universe doesn't conspire to help people achieve their legend. Rather, it throws insurmountable obstacles across their paths. The core of all storytelling is people trying to overcome such obstacles. Yet Coelho is telling every downtrodden person in the world that their plight is due to their own spiritual failure, and that to see the world as it is, without the rose-tinted spectacles of empty truisms, is ""the world's greatest lie"". The Alchemist sneers at those whose priorities are hardscrabble rather than mystical. It's the well-known condescension of the religious absolutist to the unbeliever: I'm right, and you're unworthy. There is much to criticize, also, in The Alchemist's blatant sexism, where men are supposed to drop everything in search of their dreams, while abandoned women are supposed to feel privileged to pine for such men. And if you're expecting the treasure that the shepherd boy eventually finds to be metaphorical, prepare for disappointment. Turns out, it was all about money. In the end, The Alchemist is morally deficient nearly to the point of outright evil. Stripped of the mystical mumbo jumbo, The Alchemist is almost Objectivist in the selfishness of its absolute commandment: follow your own personal destiny, whatever it is, whatever the cost to you or to others. Although, in a way, it's actually more slavish than selfish. At least in Ayn Rand's world, you master your destiny. In Coelho's, your destiny masters you.

144,242807402,12/03/2011,1.0,"Before I even get into my philosophical issues with this book, let me discuss its technical aspects.It was written (or at least translated into English) as a simple parable or fairy tale. The writing is very simple and plain. While this may work for shorter tales, this simple writing greatly hamstrung the narrative in my mind. I do not think it allowed for any characters to be fleshed out and developed. To me, all the characters the protagonist encounters remained one dimensional. I also didn't get invested into the protagonist at all. Sure, he is traveling around and seeing interesting things while trying to follow his personal legend, but given the simple writing and randomness of the personal legend construct I just couldn't give a damn what happened to him.The much bigger problem I had with this book was the message it was trying to convey. It struck me that the message was that as long as you stayed true to your heart and heeded its message (seeking out your personal legend) the universe would turn out in the best way possible for you.I found this mindset quite disturbing. It suggests that when something terrible happens to a person, it is because the universe is just trying to nudge them in a different direction. I‚Äôm sure all the people who are victims of war, among other horrors, feel a lot better about themselves now.I guess what it comes down to is that the book seems to endorse a way of thinking that just doesn't reflect the world we live in. There is no cosmic safety net that will make sure things turn out OK for you in the end. There isn't even a surefire way to determine what your ‚Äúheart‚Äù (which is actually some part of your brain since the heart is just a muscle that pumps blood) desires or what your personal legend is. So while you might think you are following your heart you are actually screwing up and all the bad things that come out of your decisions are really the universe trying to correct you. It is victim blaming at its worst and ignores the structural and external forces that a person has to contend with.All in all a very wishy washy, unhelpful (if not dangerous) belief tucked away in a very plain, unengaging story.

Overall, the impression it left on me was a positive one, even if I cringe as some lines as I remember them today, I still kind of like it.

172,3807989693,02/14/2021,3.0,"Paulo Coehlo's meditation and fable on following your dream was a pretty decent and average read. Coelho's simplistic yet splendid writing style makes this book easy to flow through; yet profound enough to contemplate the hidden meanings embedded throughout. I enjoyed that this was not merely a tale about a person finding himself, but rather, how far a person is willing to pursue his dream. The approach towards omens and how one might read/disregard them is something everyone has gone through in their lives; enough to make us readers relate to real-life omens encounters. As a Muslim myself, I appreciated how Coelho was conscious of the Islamic faith. For example, one of the seers who predict the future said ""when people consult me, it's not that I'm reading the future; I am guessing the future. The future belongs to God, and it is only he who reveals it, under extraordinary circumstances."" With that phrase being so accurately profound, you might have noticed the word ""future"" used repetitively in a single phrase. Although that is a single phrase, I personally felt that Coehlo was very repetitive in many of his terms. He almost uses the terms ""soul of the world"" and ""personal legend"" five times per page and it feels like, okay we get it can you move on...? Furthermore, I thought that the fantastical and magical elements didn't much improve upon the storyline. You take away the magical elements, and the story will still be the same. Not sure if the book has enough depth for it to be a modern classic, but please correct me if I'm wrong. Yes, I related to the underlying themes of beliving and achieving your dreams, although I don't feel like the book added anything new for topics of conversation. Overall, I found this to be a pretty average reading experience, although I would recommend it to everyone since not only it‚Äôs short and easy to read, but I believe Coehlo did in fact provide some of the most beautiful lines I have ever read.",23,0.9935,0.034,0.798,0.168,0.5358890020654725,POSITIVE,0.5931
173,1894457982,01/27/2017,1.0,"Okay, so I know this is a highly loved and praised book. So obviously I had high expectations (which is justified by the before mentioned high praise) and I was understanding why for the first half, you know? It felt like a spiritual journey, and I was enjoying the deeper messages hidden between the very simple plot of a shepherd wanting more from his life. I definitely saw the comparisons to the Little Prince in these parts, but I don't think I can ever forgive this book of its treatment of women. I'm so tired of them being secondary to everything. I think I sometimes forget that so much of the world sees them as secondary, but I get reminded by it and it's like I get flashbacks to every single experience I've had feeling secondary, or others have told me about, and I just can't. I'm so tired. And I know this book isn't about that. I just realized I don't really give a damn reading about how I can better my life and shape the way I see life from a man who thinks a woman's fulfillment is finding a husband/boy to love, and that's it.So this is day after he meets Fatima. The DAY after. They have one conversation the day before she leaves, and she says exactly 33 words and 4 sentences along with ""Fatima"" as her introduction. I counted.""I came to tell you just one thing,"" the boy said. ""I want you to be my wife. I love you.""First of all, what the fuck? Second of all, who? third of all, why?Imagine if you meet a dude and the day after he comes up to you and is like I love you and I want you to marry me ??? did i mention he had ""known"" her for one day? one? day?also her entire characterization was like confusing all over the place because she mentions like""I have forgotten about my past, about my traditions, and the way in which men of the desert expect women to behave.""but then later she's like""I'm a desert woman, and I'm proud of that. I want my husband to wander as free as the wind that shapes the dunes.""so...the thing that makes her want to be a dutiful wife and desert woman...is meeting this white spanish boy who tells her that he knows the Language and Soul of the world is love...?""Some do come back. And then the other women are happy because they believe that their men may one day return, as well.""I just. Okay. this is all so fucked up to me because it's like, the man can go and seek his Great Purpose or whatever but the wife must be dutiful and always be waiting, and she's also like, you don't HAVE to come back, but i'll be here, waiting with the others anyway. but why? why can't she go with him??? why is she giving her whole life to him when he is not even required to come back? why is he not required to come back?That she waiting for him, a woman awaiting a courageous man in search of his treasure. From that day on, the desert would represent only one thing to her: the hope for his return.Why...can't she be courageous too? why can't she seek her own treasure? ""You'll remember that she never asked you to stay, because a woman of the desert knows that she must await her man.""why must a woman of the desert, like, not explore the desert? is she somehow tied to her home and like if she leaves it, she suddenly bursts into flames? surely a woman of the desert would go in the desert too?""I have already found my treasure. I have a camel...I also have Fatima. She is a treasure greater than anything else I have won.""1) can we stop comparing women to objects that can be won? 2) why is fatima his posession? he acts like she is a home he can come back to, unmoving and unchanging in her devotion to him. he could go to the fucking pyramids and she would never get to see any of it but its OK bc her husband MIGHT come back at some point or another. i know this is entirely such a nitpicky thing. but this resonates with me SO much, being a woman of color (like fatima) and especially coming from a really traditional family where i am reminded like every single day that my life will basically amount to nothing if i am not married. my mother got married at age 16 (i know) and my dad was 26 (i know) and he said he didn't want her to work, so she never did, always stayed at home. he wanted to go to other countries, so she had to say yes. he was the one making money. he went to kuwait, UAE, saudi arabia, china, etc. for 10 years.the year i turned 10, he finally decided to bring my mother and i to america with him, and off we went. the ten years my mother had to stay dutiful and wait for him because it was her job as a wife. she wanted to go to all these countries, too, but he said no and that she needed to take care of me and so we stayed. god, i don't know. i just. am so tired. of always being secondary. of being told my goals and things i want to seek mean nothing if my husband says no. my mom wants me to structure myself around my future husband. and i just wanna say, like, fuck that. i will not stay home. i do not blame my mother for doing so, because it was what was expected, but i can be courageous too. and i will be.p.s. i know im rambling a lot and it shows in the grammar and everything. but i am like seething with rage at the way things were and also a bit of weariness bc i am tired of the weight of my culture a lot of the times",20,0.9987,0.052,0.79,0.158,0.4473928056070914,NEGATIVE,0.9442

Someone said 'The mark of a good book is it changes every time you read it' and this is one of those books that worked for me like that. The first time I read it, while still in school, I dismissed it as a kiddish fable. But with the second and third time my views changed. Maybe that it helped that I was in a different phase of life than my earlier attempts.The book maybe kinda slow and evenly paced. But the philosophical theme that 'the universe conspires to help us achieve things we want' is well written and shines through. Yes it may get a bit preachy. Yes you may not agree with the message. But it still is a good book. Final thought: philosophical with preachy undertones.

Tell me about it, because I just experienced it when I started reading Coelho's masterpiece!One of the most perfect parts of the book is the introduction written by Paulo Coelho about his masterpiece: The AlchemistThe second best part is about the Greek mythology of Narcissus. The myth states the Narcissus, who was known for his beauty, used to stay by the lake where he saw his own reflection in the water and fell in love with it, not realizing it was merely an image. Unable to leave the beauty of his reflection, Narcissus lost his will to live. He stared at his reflection until he died. Narcissus is the origin of the term narcissism, a fixation with oneself and one's physical appearance.Then comes the story manner. I was overwhelmed by the very beginnings, how a short, to the point advises that didn't give me the impression of a self-development type book, helped me to rise up and get boosted for a fabulous future and sticking to dreams and life goals, or as he preferred to call it ""Personal Legend"". The story is a page turner, simple, to the point and in a very easy language that suits all reader levels and ages.Last but not least comes the story timeline with some art illustrating how I saw the characters and events throughout my read.1- Santiago meets the Gypsy2- Santiago meets the Old King3- Santiago meets the Crystal Merchant4- Santiago meets the Englishman5- Santiago meets Fatima6- The Alchemist7- Santiago reaches the Pyramids8- Santiago reaches the Pyramids and The Falcons GameThe reason I removed the 5th star, is because of the story ending. (view spoiler)[I was expecting the real treasure to be in the journey itself, not to be a treasure of gold coins and money. Not to mention that by the end of the story the pattern of the story turned to be based on magic and fantasy, which I didn't fancy. Furthermore, the scenery of the talk with the heavens, sun, and wind was vague and childish, however the conclusion was quite nice and exactly as I was expecting it should be.

I didn't like the scenes including Fatima, I felt it way too hazy  (hide spoiler)]Some quotes of interest:‚ÄúThe lake was silent for some time. Finally, it said:""I weep for Narcissus, but I never noticed that Narcissus was beautiful.

187,402567537,08/28/2012,4.0,"A story of a young boy searching for his personal destiney, what more could sound more interesting? I actually began reading the graphic novel version of the Alchemist before I bought a regular copy of it from my College's textbook store and I finished it in two days. I couldn't help but imagine myself in the main character's place since you're being brought through this amazing world across Spain, Africa, and even Egypt.The story begins with Santiago, a young shephard boy from the Andalusian mountains in Spain who is seeking adventure and by traveling with sheep to herd he's somewhat accomplished this. He can read and write after going to school to be a priest but chose to be a shephard instead. He nearly settles down meeting the daughter of a shop owner- let me quickly say that she is definitely attractive after seeing her in the graphic novel- but then has a dream of the pyramids of Egypt where a treasure is supposedly located. Santiago goes to a gypsy woman who wants one tenth of whatever he finds and he also meets a wise old king named Melchizedek who sells Santiago's sheep so he can pursue his ""Personal Legend"" and goes on a spiritual journey while heading through North Africa.Santiago learns to understand omens and speak with people that have accomplished their dreams despite there being language barriers. Along his way Santiago learns lessons after being robbed in Tangier, working in a glass shop for a year under the shopkeeper, travels with the Englishman on a caravan across a desert, falls in love with an Arabian woman named Fatima at an oasis, and learns to understand the world through a 200 year old man called ""the Alchemist"" who is also sought after by the Englishman in order to learn how to turn lead into gold. It is in the desert portion of the book where Santiago learns about Alchemy and that the Alchemist is in possession of the Elixir of Life and the Philosopher's Stone (two VERY important items in the science). It is at the end of the journey that Santiago learns what his destiny is and he returns to Fatima after it is over.It is a great book. Very spiritual, very classic storytelling, and very mysterious.

188,107264255,06/15/2010,1.0,"This book was heavy on message and light on story. Description is spare - not in the satisfying immersive way of, say, Hemingway, but in a way that leaves much to be desired, especially since the messages that dominate the text are arbitrarily enforced and often contradictory. The characters, especially the boy, are not endearing, and act capriciously. (The narrator applauds this randomness as faith or omens.) Still, some omens are relevant and others, apparently, are not. The story offers no foundation as to why this is so.The women in the story are not well-presented. Since this book is written in the language of parable (characters, e.g., are unnamed), it would be unfair to say the women are objectified. However, I can say that the women are presented as little more than pretty faces who simply wait for their men to return from whatever adventure they seek. Fatima's 'mission,' e.g., results in a man who leaves her for a lengthy period of time in pursuit of little more than gold coins. Lucky her that she has it so easy since the protagonists' mission requires much more muscle and willpower to attain than her own; her mission is simply to wait around the well until some guy walks into her life.Worst of all is the payoff, which is very small; for being so righteous in its intent, the actual result of his adventure is underwhelming. The fact that his treasure is material is disappointing after all that the protagonist had been through, and made the message (whatever that was) seem irrelevant. The book is presented in reality with some aberrations, and then makes a weird turn for the surreal near the end, and then ends up somewhere very normal, which all results in a lack of believability. The message is disappointing in that it would only sincerely be adopted by ultra-focused and potentially mentally ill people who care not for the affairs and feelings of others in pursuit of their own potentially petty 'personal legacies.'",18,0.907,0.087,0.801,0.112,0.6762092731829573,NEGATIVE,1.0

If I hear the phrase, ""personal legend"" or ""soul of the world,"" one more time, I think I'm seriously going to barf.The Alchemist is basically a load of self-entitled tripe packaged in the form of a romantically written fable. It includes a bizarre blend of Zen meditation type talk, pseudo-mystical blathering about omens, and Osteen-style self-helpiness. It's a one-star book, upgraded in this case to two stars for the sheer artistry of Jeremy Irons' wonderful audio narration, which made it 
almost
 a pleasure to listen to despite how incredibly irritating the story is. The maxim that you aren't really living unless you're out chasing some half-baked dream is one of those things that makes me shoot pointy little lasers of rage out of my eyes. Since that seems to be pretty much the moral of this story, I'm sure you can imagine I'm not a big fan. Let me explain why.Let's face facts. There are 7 billion people in the world. A lot of those people don't have fundamental things like enough to eat, clean water, physical safety, shelter from the elements. A lot more don't have fundamental freedoms or control over their bodies and lives. A hell of a lot of people, if you asked them their dream, would say it's to have those things. To be able to reliably feed and clothe themselves and their families. To be free from oppression. A bunch more would wish for a whole, healthy body. So if you're lucky enough to live in a relatively free country, to have luxuries like a comfortable life and enough financial security that you're not afraid of going homeless or hungry or both, and if you're fortunate enough to be sitting here in decent health, reading this on a computer in your leisure time and drinking a latte, I want you to SHUT THE FUCK UP about fucking personal legends, get your ass to your boring but reliable job, collect your goddamn paycheck, and BE FUCKING GRATEFUL FOR ALL THE EXTRAORDINARY BOUNTY YOU ALREADY HAVE IN YOUR LIFE. Ohhhh, despite all this, you're not feeling fulfilled? Amazon has an entire personal massage section to help you with that.And another thing. There are a lot of jobs out there that need to be done in order for you to live that bountiful life, that are probably no one's personal legend. You want the toilets to flush, and the trash to be picked up, and your electricity to run reliably, right? Go watch a few seasons of Dirty Jobs on your HDTV and then ask yourself what would happen if all THOSE people hared off to pursue their personal legends, a la ""Eat Pray Love?"" Your bountiful life, the one millions would be happy to trade you for if you're not satisfied with it, wouldn't be possible. Sooooo, yeah. All this trottery about how your current life isn't good enough and you should dump your responsibilities and travel the world to chase your own personal vision quest doesn't sit too well with me. Talk about your first-world problems. I thought the best lesson of the whole book was how the boy got to the pyramids, only to meet a man who had dreamed of going to Spain. How's that for irony? There's the only really valid moral of the story in my opinion. That pursuing your dream might help you realize you were already living it.Let's not even get into how annoying all the religiosity was and how there are no meaningful female characters anywhere in it. I could write paragraphs more on those issues, but I've vented enough for one day on how much I loathe this book.

I've heard many things about this book and so I picked it up in paper copy (and abandoned my trusty kindle for the first time since October) only to be completely disappointed. It attempts to be some fable/moral tale with biblical and greek/roman references, but falls totally and completely on its face. I have not actually read The Secret, but I flipped through a copy once and was equally repulsed. It is certainly sad to think that this cheesy, overdone, dramatic crap is what sells as powerful literature. To illustrate, I will deal with the Capitalized Important Phrases of the book:Personal Legend: Every person has a Personal Legend that they must follow. If you set your heart on your Personal Legend and see it to completion, nothing can stop you. There will be trials along the way, but the world will conspire to help you reach your goals. Can you see why I feel like vomiting?Soul of the World: ""Love is the force that transforms and improves the Soul of the World."" This is also related to the Soul of God. When we strive for our Personal Legend we are, in fact, reaching towards and communicating with the Soul of the World. Really? We all have some sort of special meaning and we are in touch with a higher power when we reach for it? Really? (please do read this in Seth Myer's voice, only he can be so completely satirical in his tone). Really? Large quantities of the population are eating this shit up...no wonder I don't usually like the average person.Language of the World: Love. Yep, you got it. Through love we can communicate with anything. Santiago (the boy) first learns about the language from his sheep ""there was a language in the world that everyone understood...the language of enthusiasm, of things accomplished with love and purpose, and as part of a search for something believed in and desired."" Sometimes this language expresses itself through body language and physical touch/communication; other times the language is simply through eye contact. Ultimately though the World speaks to itself with love. CHEESY!Alchemist: Someone who understands the Language of the World and can communicate (through the Soul of the World) with all (inanimate objects, forces of nature, you name it they can communicate) and transform the essence of things simply through desire. Yep, this is the most boring fantasy novel ever written.One phrase that Coelho missed is the Circle of Life (he could have borrowed some of Elton John's refrain): he discusses the desert's role in creating the game for the falcon, ""'To nourish the falcon. And the falcon then nourishes man. And, eventually, man will nourish your sands, where the game will once again flourish. That's how the world goes.'""

And the women are naively self righteous, sacrificial and pious beyond words.I'm just saying if you want to center your book around a particular religion/ society, at least do your home work.In the end this book was just a 3 page story stretched into a novel by adding a lot of feel-good quotes and prolonged by a faux-deep writing style.

It reminded me of nothing so much as the ""Voyages of Sinbad"" cycle from A Thousand and One Nights, with protagonist Santiago's stubbornness and resourcefulness the only constant in a swirl of constantly-changing fortunes. Santiago himself was a great character, and the prose is solid and swift. I came very close to liking this book.But the other characters Santiago encounters are not whole people - they don't function within their own contexts, instead coming to life when Santiago encounters them, either to pose him a sidequest or drop some esoteric guidance that steers him to the next chapter, like NPCs in a video game, and fade to background scenery when he's not around. Santiago's attitude toward them reflects their un-real-ness, as far as he's concerned; he forms no lasting friendships on his journey, and when he reflects on the people from his past, his mood is ""idle curiosity"" and, sometimes, a gently sympathetic contempt for their passive attitude toward life's opportunities.On balance, the book is a parable pretending to be a novel, a vehicle for delivering a milksop, pan-religious prosperity gospel - and that is a dangerous sermon, no matter what metaphysics the preacher proclaims.",17,0.9452,0.083,0.757,0.16,0.4951754385964913,NEGATIVE,0.9956

I liked it very much the first time I read it back in 2010, so why not go through it again now when my Spanish is better? Well, because my husband and I read it together during the first weeks we spent in what used to be his grandmother's house down in Mexico. I was still shy about using Spanish easily so I read aloud and he would help me pronounce and also understand any words I wasn't sure about.I read while he was cooking (he should be an Iron Chef!) and in the evenings after long hours getting the garden back on the road to being an actual garden again. We were both caught up in the story and would spend hours discussing it. The whole experience was a nice way for us to reconnect after the six months we had to spend apart before I could make the trip to join him in our little blue house. So the memory of this book is all tangled up with those early Mexico days, and I would feel funny reading it by myself, silently, with no one right here handy to talk it over with.

But when I was sick one day, wrapped up in bed, I started to read the novel. I loved it and read half of the book before I fell asleep. I don‚Äôt know why it took me a few weeks to get back to it again, but then I picked it up and consumed it until I finished it.What I loved most about this book was the amount of wisdom every page held. I felt like whenever I turned the page, I was learning a different life lesson. There are so many quotes that I highlighted which will be carried with me for a long while in the future (I hope). If you want to read something which will help motivate you to achieve your goals, help yourself believe in who you are again and to remind you about the beauty of humanity and how we are all, in essence, just people. It made me think about how simple everything really is, and how humans overcomplicate things. It made me think about how some things are complicated, and that‚Äôs just the way it is. All in all, this was a very thought-provoking book.The novels pace is slow and steady. It never lags to me and gets boring, but it isn‚Äôt a fast paced read and that‚Äôs because it leans more on the philosophical and deep side of things than anything else. I liked the steady pace and it matched all the lessons the main character is learning throughout the novel.This is a very character driven read. There isn‚Äôt really much action because it just doesn‚Äôt fall under that genre. So be prepared for that if you‚Äôre going to be going into this one. When it comes to the main character, I did like him. I never felt a deep connection with the character himself. Mostly because the tale is told in third person and we don‚Äôt really get to know much of his interests and hobbies outside of the ‚Äòquest‚Äô or ‚Äòjourney‚Äô he has been given to undertake. But as the novel goes on, you get to steadily connect to the journey he is going through. And in making a connection to that, you get to feel a bit for him within that context. So I never felt too close to the character, but more so everything that was happening to him.[image error]I hope that makes sense.I felt like this was a perfect translation of the novel. In fact, I don‚Äôt know why I assumed English was the first language that this novel was written in. It was only when writing this review and researching for the book details I include at the top of the review, did I notice that this was actually a translated work. So if translated works usually scare you off because of worrying about something being lost in translation, you don‚Äôt have to fear that here.I loved the writing style. The imagery and the descriptions of everything was beautiful. I felt like I was in the desert right along with the main character. I liked the descriptions and depictions of all the various characters he came across.When discussing this novel with a friend, I learned that where she came from this novel was looked down on as ‚Äòcheap philosophy‚Äô. And even though I would strongly disagree, I can see where she is coming from. I guess from a different perspective, the wisdom and life lessons I felt like I was learning could be labeled so. However, I more so see it as an accessible, and understandable philosophy. Whenever I read philosophy, it always seems so over-complicated and I have to spend a lot of time thinking and decoding to find the true meaning. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with that, but it‚Äôs also nice to have something a bit easier to read and understand as well.

While there were other characters that played a somewhat important role, this book felt very lonely and I just didn‚Äôt like that. (That‚Äôs the reason why I hadn‚Äôt read this earlier; I only decided to pick this up now because of my family‚Äôs book club.) Anyway, this book just wasn‚Äôt something I enjoy reading, and the nice writing just wasn‚Äôt enough to make me enjoy it. There were definitely some beautiful things to learn from this book and I get why it‚Äôs so popular, but it just wasn‚Äôt interesting to me. I mean, even if there‚Äôs only a single main character who doesn‚Äôt have many friends or whatever, there are definitely still ways to make a book interesting other than adding more characters?? There was just no excitement in this book. The main character‚Äôs money got stolen and so he literally felt sad for all of one paragraph and then decided to find a job. Like, that‚Äôs it?? I get that that‚Äôs a solid idea but not something I‚Äôd want to read about. (Basically, this all comes back to preference.)It was kind of nice when he met Fatima but her character was so underdeveloped that it was kind of funny. She literally was only on page for 10 pages, which just doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. 
‚á¢The Writing
As I said, the writing in this book was pretty gorgeous, and I‚Äôm sure that some of the prose was lost in translation which makes it all the more impressive. Also, every few pages I‚Äôd highlight a quote or make a note of it which definitely isn‚Äôt something I do that often for the average book! Honestly, the writing was this book‚Äôs saviour because every time I felt bored I‚Äôd read a pretty line and keep reading üò≠üò≠
‚ÄúNo matter what he does, every person on earth plays a central role in the history of the world. And normally he doesn't know it.‚Äù
Anyway, if you like ~somewhat~ flowery prose, you‚Äôd probably like this book more than I did. Oh! The one issue with the writing that I had was the lack of names. I don‚Äôt know if it was to make the book more mysterious or alluring but it was just super annoying that almost everyone was called something along the line of ‚Äúthe boy‚Äù or ‚Äúthe englishman‚Äù or ‚Äúthe woman‚Äù.
‚ÄúAnd you ought to read more about the world,‚Äù answered the Englishman. ‚ÄúBooks are like caravans in that respect.‚Äù

218,16627951,02/28/2008,3.0,"I have mixed feelings about this one. Throughout my reading i kept trying to read between the lines, kept trying to analyze the many obstacles in my life that keep me from perusing my ""Personal Legend"" with the guidelines worked into the plot of the story, kept trying to understand what the ""Soul of the world"" and ""Universal Language"" would translate into in reality, kept waiting for a revelation. But i couldn't escape the fact that Santiago's desert world seemed too contrived, it can not be compared to actual reality. Maybe the reason i did not enjoy the book as much is that i was reading it, so closely, looking for a revelation that i forgot to enjoy the story as a simple fable. The Alchemist has a lot of wisdom to offer but it was so easy to ignore it in my initial reading because all the hype about the book changing lives and motivating people, got so deep into my head that somehow i expected a literary miracle, and i think alot of people will miss its simple message due to this fact as well. Reflecting on the story a day later i started to discover its true message.I believe wholeheartedly the importance of the message Coelho is trying to convey which i interpreted as - discover what it is in your life that brings you true purpose and pursue it against all odds, the journey to it will bring great wisdom, but be conscious of the world around you it gives signs, good and bad, ahead of time that we often overlook. Also, never settle for what seems like the next best thing, strive to purse your goals to completion, even in the face of failure. I guess my overall disappointment is that the execution of the message is not terribly convincing. Coelho creates this ideal world where there is a cast of mysterious characters, who just happen to have insight into the future and can assure Santiago that the treasures of his life, not only exist, but can be found and precisely where and how to find it. I'm sure achieving your personal legend is more than possible, even when there is major trouble, when you already know the outcome. Who wouldn't trade an arm, a leg, an eye, and some toes for that certainty? In my reality, there are no mysterious soothsayers that appear out of the blue, and give details to the direct location or path to pursue towards happiness. In addition I'm plagued with responsibilities harder to abandon than just a bunch of dumb sheep that can depend on anyone for their survival. I guess what I'm trying to say is that if Santiago had discovered the path on his own, the story would have had a more significant impact on me.I did fall in love with the many parables woven into the story, especially the one about the spoon of oil which reveals the secret of happiness. I like the overall optimistic message of the book; that our dreams and hearts desires can lead us back to where we started, but had no idea was significant or that finding happiness through wisdom is really as simple as following your heart. I also love the idea of interpreting the language of omens. Its strange, i actually discovered a personal omen from a single word in the book that triggered a forgotten memory, and in my state of skepticism it was so unexpected it freaked me out for hours and gave me peace of mind all at the same time. Don't ask. Anyway my conclusion is that i guess everyone has to draw their own wisdom from the book, there are plenty of things to love about the story, read it and enjoy it. Then dig deeper for the other stuff. Don't expect so much from the proclamation on the cover that it will ""change the lives of the reader forever,"" but be open minded, it just might change the way you think about your goals. PS: If nothing else, read the interviews and insights included in the plus edition, Coelho speaks so beautifully, i wish this book was as inspiring as his interview answers.

219,10503445,12/16/2007,5.0,"I really loved this book! I need to go back and re-read it very soon, so that I can mark all of the nuggets of wisdom that stood out to me.The book wasn't really outwardly religious, but reading it as a religious person, I still felt that so much of the wisdom contained in the book was right on. You just have to substitute ""the Universe"" with God, and the universal language with the Spirit perhaps. Read it like a parable...there is much to be gleaned from this book.Some of the things I learned (or re-learned) from off the top of my head:Live in the present, but strive to understand how the present is helping you to follow your dreams (or personal legend, as it were). When you are on the right path, all of your experiences will somehow come together and help you achieve your goals. I have to say I have definitely found this to be true in my life, so this did resonate with me. I don't know that I agree that we only have ONE personal legend: I think it applies to any goal we may have that happens to be right for us. Not all of our goals/hopes/dreams will be realized...perhaps because it really wasn't God's plan for us, or maybe because we didn't do what it took to realize that dream.Do not settle. If, in working towards your goal, you come to a moment where you are stopped, or where things seem like they're okay...that life wouldn't be so horrible if you just decided to stay in that situation...don't! Look at the experience as a stepping stone toward your goal, but don't stop pursuing it. (Santiago feeling like maybe he should just stay and work in the crystal shop, or marry Fatima in the desert.) This in particular really resonated with me because of the situation my husband and I are in. It is a stepping stone along the way in his career. In many ways it would be easy to give up right now and just stay where we are. It would be a good enough life. But, his (and by default, mine) full happiness really hasn't been achieved...at least not career-wise. Therefore we need to keep pressing forward--still learning from the experiences we're currently having--toward the end goal.Finally, many of the reviews I read about this book struggled with the actions of Fatima. That it didn't seem right that, just because she is a woman, her personal legend should be to wait for Santiago's return and blow kisses to him as he pursued his own dreams.I didn't feel this way. I honestly related with her, because some of my dreams are on hold right now while I wait for Joel to achieve his goals. And that has become my main goal: to help him. And I am totally okay with that. I will have a chance later to pursue some of those things that are on hold. Meanwhile, I am doing other things...pursuing some of my less important dreams, maybe. Also, I feel that raising my children is my ultimate personal legend, and of course I am on that path now, and that certainly isn't on hold.Anyway...wonderful book. One that makes you really think and learn. I absolutely enjoyed it.",15,0.9974,0.024,0.819,0.157,0.4279878618113912,POSITIVE,0.9995
220,118928365,08/27/2010,4.0,"I liked this one ‚Äì a lot. After a fairly slow start, it steadily gained momentum. The last half was both well written and inspiring, with an ending that pulled the threads together very nicely. Some of my questions were answered, and thoughts reinforced, by author‚Äôs comments in an interview that followed the text.Before reading the book, I had noted the extreme range of opinions expressed in the reviews. Many loved this book, and from its message some found a new sense of focus and purpose in their own lives. Some hated it, either because they found the storyline trite and/or preachy, or because they felt it advocated for abandoning personal responsibility.I found it inspiring, and I fervently believe that you can achieve your dreams ‚Äì at least some of them. But I would advise readers to hedge their bets, rather than take the entire message as true for everyday life. Here is one quote from the book that I would spin in a slightly different way:""And, when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it."" (The author‚Äôs belief in the truth of this message, also described as ‚Äúbeginner‚Äôs luck‚Äù in the story, is made clear in the postscript interview.)I will illustrate my view with a hypothetical private conversation. A student, asking for my advice, says that he/she has read the book and wants to follow its message in his/her own life. My response would be something like this:‚ÄúLet‚Äôs suppose (and I suspect) that the universe is random with respect to the wishes of an individual. What is clearly not random is your ability to identify an opportunity as it comes into your view ‚Äì a chance to move closer to your goal. If you have a clear mission (‚ÄòPersonal Legend‚Äô in the story), you will be alert for those opportunities. If you make good use of them, the universe will be ‚Äòhelping‚Äô you because you helped yourself. In this respect, the message of the book is both admirable and true. The difference is that you don‚Äôt sit back and wait for the universe to do the job for you. You put your energy into the positive, and you move past the negative.‚ÄùAnother way of saying this is, ‚ÄúGod helps those who help themselves‚Äù. To me, that is what happened to the boy in the story. If the story had been written in the way I described, it wouldn‚Äôt have sold very many books. And that (to me) is how the author helped himself.

Apparently, she does not know me, cause I have zero recollection of her ever telling me to read it. The story is a simple fable about a shephard pursing his dream and listening to his heart. It starts in the south of Spain, with the shephard day dreaming about marrying a girl from a local village, and progresses to the shephard meeting an ancient king, and deciding to pursue a treasure in the Egyptian pyramids. Readers follow the shephard from Spain to Morocco, and from Morocco through the desert in a caravan and to an oasis, where he meets the alchemist.  I've decided, after a day of reading a Gossip Girl blog recommended to me by Nicole, that I'm going to steal their method of awarding random points to each book, with a final total at the end of each review. Each point will be totally arbitrary really, but it'll be better than me saying it's an awesome book - go pick up a copy, or don't waste your time. So .. here it goes ... ** The book is broken up into a shorter part one, and a longer part two. However, there are frequent breaks in the text, allowing it an easy book to read on the bus, as there are frequent stopping places. - Plus 3 ** The book is a bit too philosophical for my tastes. And can be boring in parts where it's all philosophical mumbo jumbo, thus making me tired, and likely to fall asleep on the bus, which leads to awkwardness - Minus 2 ** When I was in high school I read Siddhartha by Herman Hesse (but only after finding out that River Phoenix is named after the river in the book). This book reminded me entirely too much of Siddhartha and despite that I've just finished re-reading the entire Harry Potter series, and frequently re-read a certain romance novel involving lucky charms cereal, I don't really like re-reading books I've already read. - Minus 4 ** Much of the book takes place in the desert, and involves riding camels. - Plus 7 ** My sister read it in the 8th grade. It reads like a book for an 8th grader. - Minus 3 ** While the first part of the book takes place in Tarifa and Tangier (two places I plan to visit), I didn't really walk away feeling like it was necessary to read the book prior to going. It's not like there are any famous landmarks mentioned in the text that I simply must see now. - Minus 2 ** It has a happy ending. - Plus 3 ** Despite the happy ending, I was left feeling moderately unsatisfied, and needed more. - Minus 3 ** The ending is rushed. All of this getting there stuff, but when he does, its two pages to fulfullment. I don't buy it. - Minus 4 ** It's less than 200 pages, which makes it a quick read. - Plus 4 ** While there is a lot of philosophical stuff, the point of the story to listen and to follow your heart is a good underlying message. - Plus 5 ** They only mention the name of the main character on page one. Which is a tad cheesy. - Minus 2 ** Despite it being a quick read, despite being overly philosophical in places, and despite feeling like it was at an 8th grade reading level, it was still a book to make you think. Of course, the conversation with friends about the book will really improve with some alcohol or other mind altering substance. - Plus 3 Final tally --- Plus 5",13,0.9948,0.047,0.843,0.11,0.4567664092664094,POSITIVE,0.9286
243,2270024108,01/27/2018,2.0,"When my uncle recommended this book to me, he compared it to my   favorite TV show of all time  .What show is it? Well, my dear readers, that show is  Avatar: The Last Airbender . I watched this show obsessively when it first came out, and I could go on for hours and hours (and I have, with some friends that love it equally as much as I do) about the absolute perfection of this cartoon. From its worldbuilding, lore, character development, music, etc, A:TLA is a masterpiece that will probably never be topped.So when my uncle claimed that I would love the Alchemist because of how similar it was to A:TLA, it was probably the worst mistake he could make. And I'll admit, that mistake might be one of the main reasons why I disliked this book so much. Everyone knows that hype and exaggerated comparisons are a book's worst enemy.And I mean, I guess it was? I  guess¬†  it was comparable, in the most basic sense. In the  Alchemist , the MC goes on a journey to find a treasure he learned of in a dream. Along the way he meets new people who guide him, learns new lessons, opens up spiritually, and learns ""The Language of the World"".But aside from the main points that the story revolves around a boy going on an adventure, there isn't much else to this book. Aside from learning things on his own and travelling, nothing really happens. There weren't any points where the boy had to go through hardships to grow as a character. No points where his morals and beliefs were challenged so harshly that he had to make any difficult choices. And  nothing  so difficult where I felt any sympathy or connection to him. I honestly don't even remember the kids name,  if it was even given to us in the first place¬† . To me, this seemed more like a children's bedtime story than an actual book. Adding in the fact that a lot of the scenes in the book were played out in more of a ""snapshot type"" fashion with only snippets of time given to us, it was really hard for me to find any connection to the boy or the story. It jumped around a lot, and I often had to think back to remember details about whatever place the boy was in at that time. I think the worst part of this story was how  convenient  everything was. We've got this boy who is entirely at peace with his life as a shepherd who roams the lands and meets people. Then he has a dream of treasure in Egypt, and he decides to abandon everything to find it. He coincidently runs into a ""king"" who gives him a ton of advice on how to succeed in his journey. Then he gets himself over to Africa, which is only a two hour boat ride from his home in Spain.  Then  after he's robbed (which is like the only bad thing that happens to him) he easily finds a job working for¬† a crystal merchant, where he quickly turns business around and they both profit immensely from it. Then when he's in the desert it's really easy for him to learn the ""Language of the World"", whereas many others older and wiser than him have struggled for years to grasp it.... you get my idea. Everything just works out for this boy in the end with barely any conflict, and I just can't stand when that happens. What's the point of success in life without going through hardships? How can you experience satisfaction without struggling and fighting for what you want?  How can this boy, who's name we don't even know, win everything in the end when he was already perfectly fucking satisfied with his life before this journey?????  I JUST CAN'T DO IT WITH THIS BOOK.All-in-all, I'm giving this book 2/5 stars. The concept was nice, and I'm sure if there had been more growth, character development,¬† plot, and STRUGGLE I would've enjoyed the story more. But in reality, I'm still sitting here wondering why so many people  and celebrities, whom the author bragged about in his forward  claim how fantastic this book is. If you'll excuse me, I'll be watching  Avatar  again to wash this incomperable mess out of my mind.",13,0.9952,0.066,0.793,0.141,0.5746126519431602,NEGATIVE,0.9999
244,2430679816,07/31/2018,4.0,"I avoided The Alchemist my entire life. Practically everyone I knew in high school read it and being a non-conformist by nature, that meant that I definitely wasn't going to. Lately though the book had been on my mind for some reason. By coincidence perhaps, my coworker was waxing poetic about it a few days later, so I decided, it's time. Synchronicity anyone?I understand why other people don't like The Alchemist. If I had read this when I was younger I don't think I would have enjoyed it to the degree that I do now. However, I suspect that since over the past couple years I have basically been metamorphosing into a hippie (I blame my name for this destiny) I have a newfound appreciation for these types of philosophical truisms. I realize truisms have a bad reputation. Even the word truism itself has a negative connotation. However, I think there is something to be said about needing to hear simple truths at certain moments in your life. They can motivate you to keep moving forward even when you are second-guessing everything. I am at such a time in my life, a crossroads where I have a decision to make. What I know in my heart to be the ""right"" decision will put me vastly out of my comfort zone, but allow me to pursue what Coelho refers to as my Personal Legend. Would it be easier and more financially stable to stay where I am now, in the hamster wheel? Yes. But unless I summon the courage to face my fears, I might be stuck in that wheel forever. I am happy to even have the luxury of making such a decision.I realize that all of this is incredibly melodramatic and vague. I guess what I'm saying is that I read The Alchemist at the best possible moment, when it was most relevant for me personally. This probably won't be the case for the majority of readers. And that being said, it likely won't resonate with them to the extent that it did for me. Throughout the book there is frequent talk of ""omens."" I'm not sure if you believe in such things, but I do. When I was at lunch yesterday I saw a green beetle buzzing around me, and it finally came to rest right next to my hand. Usually beetles freak me out, but I felt oddly at peace with this encounter. Last night when I was reading the last few pages imagine my surprise when I saw the illustration of a beetle and the mention of its profundity. I almost dropped the f*****g book.

It was simple enough, which is fine, but it was just a lot of nonsense talk that could have been expressed much faster in just as ""profound"" a way.A Spanish Shepard boy travels to find a great treasure, and along the way meets people that help him on his way, and teach him.

‚ÄúPeople say strange things, the boy thought. Sometimes it‚Äôs better to be with the sheep, who don‚Äôt say anything. And better still to be alone with one‚Äôs books.‚Äù
This is an inspirational kind of novel about finding yourself. It was a nice, enjoyable story, but I thought it was too whimsical and philosophical. I don't mind some metaphorical messages hidden in the background of a story, but I like driven plots. The Alchemist was all about the message, and the plot took the backseat.It had so many parts that were like this:
‚ÄúThe secret of life, though, is to fall seven times and to get up eight times.‚Äù
The story follows a shepherd boy who spends his days tending his flock of sheep. However, the boy is discontent, and when one day he goes to a gypsy woman to ask her about a recurring dream he's been having, she tells him to go to the pyramids of Egypt where he will find a treasure. From then on the boy sets out to complete his own ""personal legend.""I liked the beginning better than the ending. When I was first introduced to the characters I thought they were funny, I liked the boy's curious thoughts, and was intrigued by the philosophy of life. However, by the end it felt too much like a ""messagey"" book. With the author repeating the boy's desire to find happiness and complete his destiny every few pages, it got a little tedious.
‚ÄúThe simple things are also the most extraordinary things, and only the wise can see them.‚Äù

247,32457817,09/09/2008,4.0,"I enjoyed ""The Alchemist"" although, for me, it was not as brilliant-amazing as the general popularity and adoration made it out to be (apparently, it is the most-translated book in the world--aside from The Bible, I assume!). Perhaps it's because I'm already very familiar with most of the concepts presented in terms of following-one's-bliss and the Soul of the World and all that. A graduate degree focused on Religious Studies, as well as my own intensive reading on philosophy and spirituality a few years ago, made none of this a surprise, or a revelation. Even so, it was nice to hear some of the messages again and probably if I had encountered this at the beginning of my explorations into the subject, it would have been more meaningful.As for Coelho's style, I am not sure if it was the English translation missing something of the original flavor, but I found it lackluster. At first, I was a bit annoyed with the simplicity and repetition, but then I began to imagine it as a fable being told to a group in a cozy, intimate setting--like a campfire; old men and women nodding their heads at the lived-wisdom, young people gazing wide-eyed as new concepts are revealed. It is a story that could be shared with many ages and perhaps some of the appeal lies in the simplicty.

After my second read of The Alchemist, I can safely say I moved from the second to the third group noted above. And this surprised me, as I read this for the first time barely a year ago.The story follows Santiago, a shepherd boy from Andalusia in pursuit of his 'Personal Legend', who decides to travel through Spain to the Pyramids in Egypt, where he believes he will find a hidden treasure. Throughout the book, Santiago has encounters with various figures who contribute to his spiritual journey. At the surface, The Alchemist is simple. Indeed, its writing to me is reminiscent of The Little Prince (one of my all-time favourites), and that is a children's book. This might come off as bland, but I find it fitting. Apart from this element, however, the book is quite preachy. Coelho infuses philosophy and religion in his storytelling and in doing so, reveals his personal understanding of the universe, God, and the essence of humankind, the latter being the pursuit of a Personal Legend. As regards to all this, I'd say that Coelho's perception of religion is unrestrictive, but there is, of course, a red thread, namely one that acknowledges the unity of, well, the entire universe and God. Santiago's journey illuminates 'the Language of the World', the 'Soul of the World', and the 'Soul of God', the latter aligning with Santiago's own soul. Recurrent quotes and rudimentary ideas in The Alchemist are the following: ‚ÄúAnd, when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.‚Äù ‚ÄúAll things are one.‚Äù ‚ÄúPeople are capable, at any time in their lives, of doing what they dream of.‚ÄùThat was The Alchemist in a nutshell. A really small nutshell.If all this is already making you cringe, well, that's a pity. Anyway, I personally love all of the above and I find Coelho did a great job. But I do have issues with this book nonetheless, and these really took shape when I reread it. If I would have to name my main, overarching critique point, it concerns the 'exclusivity' of the journey that Coelho lays down for Santiago. With this, I mean to say that I find it a little too black and white. First, in terms of 'self-help book language', there seems to be a very clear picture of failure and success: if you don't follow your Personal Legend all the way through (that last aspect is quite important), there's simply no success. You just end up dying a sad, little person. Second, every person has a Personal Legend, but for some reason, women are... excluded/not that important/minor/second-place? In fact, Santiago's love interest Fatima, a 'woman of the desert', urges Santiago to follow his Personal Legend and promises to wait until he returns, because that's simply what women do. Yikes.It is for these main two reasons that many other people have rated The Alchemist much lower than I do here (but who knows how I'll view this book in the future) and I do feel like I should clarify. I would like to point out the miscellaneous nature of the book. What is it? Is it a fantasy? Is it magical realism? Is it philosophy? Is it self-help? Is it some type of meta-religious work? Is it a little of everything named here? I would say that ratings for The Alchemist are quite dependent on an individual's perception of the genre of the book. If I would have to answer the question, I have to admit I at least cannot view it as a self-help book. To me, that would be equal to calling Siddhartha a self-help book. (Side note: if you love The Alchemist, I highly recommend Siddhartha.)On a final note, I still find The Alchemist a beautiful, inspirational little book and though it may be a bit outdated and shortsighted in some ways, and though Santiago is a man and women are portrayed as mere attributes, it goes without saying that lessons can definitely be learned from this book by everyone.",12,0.9975,0.027,0.841,0.133,0.410942328042328,POSITIVE,0.9161
261,27743950,07/19/2008,4.0,"I have a couple of friends who think this book is the worst thing they‚Äôve ever read. Of course, these same friends are also notoriously high-minded about a lot of things, over which we frequenly butt heads, but mostly I think they are missing the point with this one. It‚Äôs not meant to be high literature. It‚Äôs not even meant to be all that well-written (in the classical sense of the phrase). Capital-L Literature is meant to elevate, and to a certain extent, it‚Äôs elitist. This, on the other hand, is a story very intentionally written not for the elite, but for the masses. It‚Äôs a fable, and fables are meant to be spread and enjoyed by as many people as possible. And yes, their ‚Äòmessages‚Äô are rather simplistic, but that‚Äôs sort of the entire point of a fable. And I‚Äôm not ashamed to admit that it kicked me in the butt a little. The Alchemist has a simple premise: a young Spanish shepherd sells all of his sheep at the urging of a mysterious man who calls himself a King, in order to follow his Dream. Santiago‚Äôs nominal Dream is a bit mysterious, but supposedly will end with him finding treasure at the end of his journey, which an actual sleepytime dream has told him will end at the pyramids of Giza. So Santiago sets off and has lots of adventures along the way, meeting fellow travelers, including an Englishman who is traveling to a famous oasis to study alchemy with a master Alchemist. As Santiago travels, he learns that the philosophy of alchemy is the same one as advised to him by that mysterious King fellow back in Spain. Stuff happens from there. If that all sounds a bit bonkers to you, well, yes, you‚Äôd be right. But first, again: fable. And second, in context, it all makes sense. Like all good fables, the story is tinged with magical realism and not a little allegory, as Santiago‚Äôs Dream is a stand-in for all of our less tangible ones. This does get a little squiffy in parts, because Santiago meets people along the way who have more concrete dreams than he does, but overall I think it works. Mostly, this story is just a vehicle to get across Coelho‚Äôs philosophy, namely that if there is something you want to do or be, you have to actually attempt to be or do that thing. Accepting excuses, putting things off for later, or worse, refusing to do them at all out of fear that either the dream or you will disappoint ‚Äî all of these things shouldn‚Äôt matter. What should matter is what Santiago refers to as your Personal Legend (it‚Äôs phrases like these that make me question how much better things probably sound in the original Portuguese). I‚Äôve read a couple of reviews that suggested what Coelho was saying was that if you just want something enough the Universe will give it to you and you won‚Äôt have to work for it. I think that‚Äôs sort of a malicious reading of the text. Again: fable. Things are going to be simplistic. Reading a fable is like reading the Bible. You have to be able to draw your own conclusions from what it presents to you. And I think it‚Äôs pretty clear that what Coelho was saying was that if you want to achieve your dream, you have to take action in order to do so. There‚Äôs a bit of spiritual mumbo-jumbo that you can probably take or leave about when you are actively pursuing your dream, how the whole universe conspires to help you, but that‚Äôs pretty much a standard thing for religions to say. (God helps those who helps themselves, anyone?) The real core of the message is the taking action part and pushing past the fear and uncertainty to reach for what you want. Despite any packaging flaws, I think at its core, the message of The Alchemist is a good one, and most readers will be able to overcome the ‚Äòsimplistic‚Äô format to get what Coelho was trying to say. And besides, it was a fast read and I was entertained. If nothing else, it was a good modern day fable/fairytale.",12,0.998,0.041,0.797,0.162,0.4601659451659453,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Or perhaps I'm just too dumb that ‚ÄòI missed the point of the book (but how can someone miss the point when the book is THAT redundant) and that I'm not analyzing it correctly‚Äô‚Äîwhatever that means. Well, anything goes.The writing is simple and in-your-face straightforward (it's a translation I know, but if it diverts from Coelho's actual style then it would have been redone especially since it's a bestseller). Santiago is a one-dimensional character and is flat as a fucking pancake. Fatima, the only female character to be given attention, is just a prop with no desires, interests, personality or whatsoever. She doesn't even fucking have her own Personal Legend besides meeting her beau, if that is one. But what does it matter as long as she, a ‚Äòwoman of the desert,‚Äô had insta-love with Santiago because that's what women are for in this story, right? A token?Also, I think I've heard all of these messages the book says before. Hmm, familiar? Oh yeah, during all the feel-good homilies I attended throughout my 13 years of Catholic education that proved nothing but them being utter drivel and as one reviewer says it, ‚Äòsugarcoated placebos‚Äô.How happy it is to live in a world where one has the utmost privilege to chase his dreams because the realization of his Personal Legend is etched in his fate, as conspired by the universe. Sure, if the world and its systems were fair and just to begin with. No wonder why celebrities raved on the ‚Äòphilosophy‚Äô of and behind this novel, for it is simply ""the spiritualization of the American capitalist ideology.""Bottom line: Alchemist is a superficially deep self-help attempt brimming with pretentious, trite, and reductive pronouncements.

The Alchemist is a story of a shepherd boy named Santiago who sets off on a journey in hopes of achieving what he feels is his destiny. Along this journey he meets several people that help him on his way and others that hinder him. Several times he is faced with having to choose between stopping in his tracks or continuing to his final destination. Santiago's struggle was very relatable because we've all been there. At some point in life, we think we know what we are destined for and are faced with the decision of fighting for our dreams or settling for what is comfortable. Throughout Santiago's journey, you find yourself rooting for him to not give up but also understanding his reasoning for wanting to stop. 
‚ÄúThere is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure.‚Äù
Santiago's story is inspiring and written in such a beautiful way! It reads like a fairy tale and that only helped to make it even more intriguing. Not only will I revisit this book again before this year is over, but I am positive that I will read it many times to come!

He thought of quiting and running away but his heart didn't let him do that.This book also has philosophical and religious thoughts and they really lit the fire in heart. It focuses on fear that we all have in our mind: The fear of failure. The only thing that stops us from chasing our dreams and trying to discover ourselves, our destiny. ""I'm going to become bitter and distrustful of people because one person betrayed me. I'm going to hate those who have found their treasure because I never found mine. And I'm going to hold on to what little I have, because I'm too insignificant to conquer the world."" Human nature, right? Yes, that is a stereotypical thinking; a thought that has already come to my mind, a thought that might have even already struck in your head as well. But this book tells, why not focus on what we have? Or why don't we pay attention to what our heart says? Listen to your heart and you will find your way. The way to your achievement of dreams, the way to destiny, the way to learn the language of love. Now here it is going to get a bit longer due to the quotes I am about to mention from the book.# When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you achieve it.# Every search begins with beginners luck.

266,6289468,09/16/2007,5.0,"This book came to me from my ""spiritual soulmate"" Peter, whom I was madly in love with all through the summer of '04. I sat in the coffee shop where he worked one lazy Sunday afternoon, in an overstuffed chair with sunlight filtering in through those awesome gothic windows and drank each word of this book into my soul. If you are looking for a nice meaty book filled with twists, turns and life-like characters - this is NOT your book. Wait until you are more in a more introspective mood. Coelho's prose is simplistic and at times childish. And the read is easy - I finished in around an hour and a half I suppose. But the meanings left scattered throughout the chapters are intense and authentic. Omens and signs - all around us, the universe directing us and helping us, wanting us to succeed. All we have to do is be aware - to listen. I have a leather bound journal filled with nothing but quotes, sayings, important sentences scrapped from here or there. In it, there are a couple wise words from my friend Peter because he was a deep, old soul. But overwhelmingly some of my favorite gems in that little book come from Coelho's Alchemist. He is a master at speaking to the soul. Here are two of my favorites:""One is loved because one is loved. No reason is needed for loving.""

Irons‚Äôs performance was mesmerizing and engaging, but at the end I felt as if I had missed something. I think that is the fault of Coelho‚Äôs writing, though, not the narrator‚Äôs performance. I would rate the audio performance 5 stars. ",11,0.9892,0.062,0.768,0.171,0.5439655172413791,POSITIVE,0.7921
290,2019621155,01/09/2020,3.0,"*Backlist Blast 2020 (1988)*This is the first book I read my for 2020 backlist project. I had The Alchemist on my shelf for quite some time so I was looking forward to reading it. My brother also recommended this book to me for anyone who feels lost in life. 	The Alchemist follows a young shepherd boy named Santiago who has a lust to travel the world and search for treasure. He finally gets the chance to fulfil this dream and the reader follows his quest. Santigaos journey takes the reader through is highs and lows, ups and downs seeking out treasure. The Alchemist is much more then just an adventure book. Santiagos journey is about following your heart and not giving up on your dreams. 	So I am not a big classic reader and this book defiantly qualifies as a classic. I really enjoyed the beginning of this book. Learning about Santiago and the set up for the story was great. As the book went on I found it preachy and this book could very much be classified as self help. Overall I can understand the meaning behind the story and can appreciate it. The writing style was very magical and like a fairytale which really added to this epic journey of following ones dreams.",11,0.9773,0.027,0.823,0.15,0.3987037037037037,POSITIVE,0.8954

‚ÄúThe secret of happiness is to see all the marvels of the world, and never to forget the drops of oil on the spoon.‚Äù
(The drops of oil being our challenges and duties and tasks in our life ‚Äì the hardships.)I always begin my reviews with a quote from the book itself, with a few lines that caught my attention, made me grin or defined the story the best. This time I just picked one sentence which I liked, because the rest of the novel fell very, very short.There was nothing that I could have liked, and I‚Äôm having troubles trying to figure out why this book had become so popular. It was just a simple tale filled with as many obscure sentences as possible, trying to give the simple story a more meaningful background, but it was just weird.This was my very first Paulo Coelho book and I‚Äôm thinking that this might have been the very last as well. This style is just not for me.Maybe ten or twenty years later, who knows.",12,0.9458,0.011,0.842,0.147,0.4644360902255639,NEGATIVE,1.0

I read it few times in English and few more times in Telugu, The Alchemist is translated into Telugu with the name Parusavedi.Reading this novel is an exiting journey that overflows with optimism; it is the kind of novel that tells you that everything is possible as long as you really want it to happen. That may sound somewhat like a common belief and an over-simplified version of new-age philosophy, belief and mysticism, but as Coelho states one doesn‚Äôt have to search for deep meanings and big things in life. Sometimes, simple things are the most valuable and only people who are wise enough, can appreciate them.I strongly recommend this book for the people who likes to know the philosophy of life and who likes to read philosophy with ancient fiction based story.",11,0.987,0.0,0.792,0.208,0.4810238095238094,POSITIVE,0.9996

You could say that it appeals to the big and pompous part of me that is probably naive and foolish, because sometimes I want to believe that I can turn stones into gold, and can command the Universe to do my bidding. As a teenager I am sure I would have loved it (Hey, I also believed Dr Seuss when he said my success was 98 and 3/4 % guaranteed). As a woman in her thirties (when I read it) I still enjoyed it for the storytelling and the call to follow our dreams (sometimes we all need a little nudging). It *is* quite simplistic, but it's told from the perspective of a simple shepherd boy with stars in his eyes who sets off to follow his dreams, explore more of the world and find his place in it. The writing was easy to follow and engaging. ",11,0.9517,0.019,0.845,0.136,0.5732804232804233,POSITIVE,0.9998

It was elaborate, when it had no need to be, it was painstakingly boring because 'The Boy' believed whatever anyone told him, and finally, I couldn't help but think that the entire journey he went through was meaningless. A waste of his time to go on that journey searching for something, and a waste of my time for reading it. I honestly don't see how this book contributes to the grand scheme of things, but, again, maybe that's just the cynic in me.",11,-0.9571,0.24,0.691,0.069,0.7125,NEGATIVE,1.0
