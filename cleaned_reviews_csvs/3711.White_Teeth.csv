0,3739701,07/29/2007,3.0,"As many other reviewers have commented, I wanted to like this book more than I did. It approached greatness in many ways---the clever and often hilarious dialogue, the quirky characters, the creative family histories, the rich and convincing place descriptions, and so on. Despite the strengths of each of these parts, as a whole the book fell far short of greatness. It took me until the final pages to figure out what was missing for me: I did not genuinely care about most of the characters. I did not feel sympathy for them, or root for them, or have my own ideas of how I hoped things would turn out. This is likely due to the many, many story lines at play in the novel (story lines that span a hundred years in some cases). But it still felt unacceptable to me that the book begins with one of the most intimate moments a person can experience (though it is treated with humor) and closes with an equally major event in the life of that same character, yet we hardly KNOW this character. He is a central presence on page one and the final page, but he is lost in between. While I laughed at Joyce Chalfen, Alsana, Abdul-Mickey, Magid, Hortense, and a dozen more amusing and creative characters, I felt no emotional connection to them at all. The biggest disappointment perhaps was the disappearance of Clara's voice from the pages. They remained, though entertaining, very flat to me. The only character I sincerely rooted for and felt drawn to was Irie Jones. Her story alone, though it does not emerge until the second half of the book, made the novel worth reading to me.I was intrigued enough by Zadie Smith's writing to give her other works a try, but I closed the book last night with a definite sense of a letdown.

1,192705975,07/31/2011,5.0,"“...the wicked lie, that the past is always tense and the future, perfect.” ― Zadie Smith, White TeethI planned on writing my full review of this book a couple days after I read it in October of 2014. I was afraid, however, if I wrote it immediately it would be too sappy, too indulgent, too full of praise. I would probably just go on and on and you all might think I was in love or something. So, like I am want, I put the review off -- meaning to get to it -- and here I am finally writing about the book almost two years after I first read it. I don't know if the delay points more towards my sometimes best laid plans falling and failing, or my anal need to complete the circle and check things off lists.Seriously, the book was fantastic. I loved it. It was a big, hairy, kinky, ambitious first novel and Zadie Smith pulled it off. I'm not sure why I'm reading so many novels (McTeague) concerned with dentistry and teeth lately. A bit weird. Anyway, enough!I'm glad I waited, however, because Zadie Smith seems to posses for England that same fresh breath that Lin-Manuel Miranda exhibits with his musical Hamilton. Sometimes, a place is best described by immigrants to that place. Sometimes, the change that happens to a city or nation because of immigrants is hard to measure in the first couple years. Just look at London now. London has elected its first Muslim mayor. This has more to do with some of the huge demographic changes than with a super-multiculturalism in London, but it still isn't nothing. I remember reading a short article in the Guardian a while back that pointed out that in regards to Muslim, Hindu, and Sikh, “the three groups share many areas in common, but the Punjabi Sikhs in Southall and southeast London, the Gujarati Hindus in northwest London, and the Bengali Muslims in Tower Hamlets stand out most of all.” (The Guardian). I loved realizing the London of Pepys, Dickens and Shakespeare was now a completely different place. It was a place where the colonized were becoming the colonizers. It was a giant geography of Karma, and not in a bad way. We often never fully grasp the bad and the good and the unintended of our decisions and policies. I'm pretty damn sure Queen Victoria and those who advised her and followed her -- NEVER saw this coming as they began the British Raj. I love how 'White Teeth' swirls and dances and dervishes with ideas of race, identity, and religious antagonism. The book is a fiction, of course, but the competition between ethnicities, even while the white majority loses their shit is not fiction. Even though 'White Teeth' debuted as the 21st century was dawning, it painted a fictionalized but very real novel about the struggles America, England, and Europe are going through right now. Think of Europe and America's reaction to Muslim refugees, the hostility of the right to Barack Obama citizenship and race, the fear that drives the radical right agendas from Hungary to Norway as Western Europe and Western Civilization loses (gradually) their majority lock on political and demographic power. When the mayor of London and the President of the United States of America wouldn't have been allowed to eat in the same high-brow London and New York clubs as presidents and mayors did 60-years-ago, it is kinda amazing to see how far we've come. However, it is also humbling when you read blogs, comments, and hell, just watch Trump on Fox News. There is a certain shaded infinity of how far we still need to go.Anyway, back to 'White Teeth'. The brilliance of this book is Zadie Smith addresses all of this with humor, beauty and narrative magic. She avoids the twin traps of triviality and preachiness. She spins a fascinating yarn that entertains while pushing the reader to grapple with the realities that were faced by Archie Jones and Samad Iqbal in 1945, and the realities we faced when Obama was elected, and the problems we all currently face. Fundamentally, I believe, things become a lot simpler when we can view people as individuals. Viewing Zadie Smith as an individual it is easy to see her brilliance, her potential, and her ability from her first book to play with the big boys of English fiction. The future is already here and Zadie Smith is just waiting for history and the rest of us to catch up.",155,0.994,0.072,0.801,0.127,0.4762155983240322,POSITIVE,0.9979
2,509770609,01/18/2013,3.0,"There are parts of this book fully deserving of unadulterated love and veneration, worthy of 4 stars in the least. The fact that the real Indian, Jamaican and Bangladeshi diaspora are reproduced here and not the imagined Indian, Jamaican and Bangladeshi diaspora of white writers too reluctant to put in the requisite amount of research for getting the most inconsequential tidbits right has much to do with it. In addition, Zadie Smith succeeds in keenly evoking their history, language, cultural ethos, the stench of their festering old wounds inflicted by an undo-able past, and their bizarre hypocrisies making the leap across land and oceanic borders into alien territory, exempted from being dissected by the scalpel of 'western reason' in the name of minority rights. There's the undeniable truth of centuries of conditioned servility, hatred of the power which established the ground rules of the abusive relationship called colonialism, and the unfathomable responsibility of bearing the burden of yesterday. 
""[] they can't help but reenaact the dash they once made from one land to another, from one faith to another, from one brown mother country in to the pale, freckled arms of an imperial sovereign.""
There's the Bengaliness of the family to be religiously guarded against the sallies of Western liberalism; imminent dilution of the much treasured Bengali DNA in the gene pool staved off at all costs. And there's war to be waged on foreign territory - for another inch of land, another notch up on the dignity scale, for yet another step of the socioeconomic ladder. Whenever stung by the prick of casual racism, whenever thwarted, they will go back to their institutionalized tendencies of seeing things in black and white and studiously avoiding mentions of a gray area; they won't think twice before disregarding their favorite Gandhiji's famed 'An eye for an eye will make the whole world blind.' They will seek out the greener pastures of first world optimism but resist synthesis, tugging at the roots of old grudges again and again so that the present and the now can be drawn and quartered on the altar of history.""And then you begin to give up the very idea of belonging. Suddenly this thing, this belonging, it seems like some long, dirty lie...and I begin to believe that birthplaces are accidents, that everything is an accident.""But then there are the 'just-roll-with-it' parts which deserve no more than 2 stars - the cocksure and smug tone in which the narrator recounts this multi-generational saga of families caught in the chaos of modern day materialism vs heritage, the unrealistic, often two-dimensional characterization and the zany Britcom feel to the episodes which warrants a suspension of disbelief and gives rise to the nagging suspicion that this was written with the idea of a film or tv series adaptation in mind. As much as Smith's light-hearted, tongue-in-cheek, clever mockery of roots and righteous reliance on said roots for existential validation is absolutely legitimate and spot-on, it is awfully disingenuous to think roots can and should be so easily discarded. Assimilation requires time and the immigration conundrum will never be felt as acutely by second generation immigrants (like Smith herself) as by their progenitors. This is where I prefer Jhumpa Lahiri's narrative voice (her later works) over Smith's - no inflection of moral and intellectual superiority, no pronouncing of judgement on flawed choices but a restrained attempt at humanizing all characters. Since the 4-star and 2-star ratings are equally bona fide in my eyes, a 3-star it is. More so because I can't remember the last time a woman writer of contemporary literary fiction made me laugh so hard.",131,-0.7328,0.102,0.811,0.087,0.4065927750410509,POSITIVE,0.6356
3,9091290,11/14/2007,1.0,"This book started bad for me and just got worse. I found the characters to be boring and two-dimensional. Actually, even worse, the author tried to build up the characters in most cases (though doing a poor job, I'd say), but then later reduced their roles to caricatures. So even those I was inclined to like wound up irritating me every time they opened their mouths.Further, Smith's style is all over the place. At times I found it indulgent and pretentious, others fawningly resembling other authors, and the style would sometimes change abruptly from one paragraph to the next.I find what what often at least partially redeems books like this is an interesting plot. Not so in White Teeth! There's no real story arc to hold the book together. The plot kind of twisted along for a while and I couldn't really tell where it was going. Then it ends in this bizarre attempt to draw all of the characters and threads together which totally fails as a climax. I would have been more irritated about this particular point but I was so happy I was done with the book, I was inclined to forgive it more than was deserved.I truly don't understand what all the hype was over this book. There is lots I can forgive especially in a first novel, but there wasn't nearly enough here to convince me that Smith is a great writer who just needs some time to come into her own. There were a few interesting ideas and notions, but they were isolated and swamped by a thousand other boring ones, not to mention cliches, unclever witticisms, and tired plot devices.I could go on, but I rather forget I ever read this!

5,2602144888,11/22/2018,3.0,"The last time I read a book with this much narrative confidence, power and authority was back in January when I tackled Midnight’s Children. It's rare that a book comes with a voice this strong. Like Rushdie’s novel, Smith creates a present that is pervaded by the past. Her characters are very aware of their ancestry, and they really struggle to reconcile with it in the modern world. Are they Indians? Are they British? Are they black or white? Or are they a little bit of everything? Because of their duality, they struggle to find themselves in the modern metropolis. They don’t quite know who they should be, so they cling to and project ideas they are far removed from. And it’s all a little tragic, to see such confusion. 
“...They cannot escape their history any more than you yourself can lose your shadow.” 
Every character Smith has conjured up here could be someone you’d encounter in real life; they are all very real people and they are faced with some very real problems. However, the issue I had with the novel is that we simply do not stay with them for long enough for them to develop. We glimpse them, nothing more. I’d even hesitate to actually call this a novel; it’s more like four loosely related novellas slapped together with a very small amount of glue to bind them. It’s close on collapsing. As such, this doesn’t have a plot per say. It’s more like four separate character studies. And it does work to an extent; it captures a large part of the contemporary space, but as a novel it feels fragmented with little to no cohesion. Some sections were better than others, with characters who were more flawed and interesting to read about. To make this a little clearer, I feel like I need to write four seperate reviews in order to talk about his book properly and rate each section differently. I’m not going to do that, but I hope you get my point; it’s quite a difficult book to talk about because it doesn’t feel like a normal book. Smith followed a similar model in NW but that came together as it captured the city is what trying so hard to evoke whereas this feels very much apart. I can see why many other users on here have chosen not to rate it. 
It's a very powerful debut, but I did not enjoy all of it. A mixed bag for me.

7,185791212,07/17/2011,4.0,"I'm about a decade late to Zadie Smith's White Teeth, one of those books friends recommended or I picked up at the library then put back and moved on to a different title. My reticence to read the novel revolved around the plethora of book-clubby texts that could best be classified as “somewhat patronizing novels about other cultures featuring triumph in the face of great poverty and hardship.” I hate these books. But White Teeth turns out be an example of where those novels fail and a sun-surface hot writer can embrace the complexity inherent in both the smaller and larger narratives of multiple generations. Zadie Smith's talent and enthusiasm are tangible; she writes like she's bouncing up and down in her seat. White Teeth is as much about inertia as free will. Samad and Archie, brought together by their bad luck and questionable soldiering circumstances, spend much of their time in a decrepit English pub. Archie marries a Jamaican woman he meets on a stairway at a stranger's New Year's Day party. Samad's wife, Alsana, and Archie's wife, Clara, form a careful friendship. The friends' children are first-generation English carrying histories and expectations; Samad and Alsana's twin boys and Archie and Clara's daughter inhabit the no man's land between tradition and the present that, really, is everyone's land. Questions of loyalty, tradition, and identity emerge in the flash of conflict and creaking, inevitable societal evolution. As Alsana notes, circumstances emerge in which people are involved, to use her word, without intention but without question. When the two families encounter the white, affluent Chalfens, the cheeriest, most cluelessly evil parents I may have ever encountered in literature, twin brothers reunite (or at least occupy the same country), and the book's last hundred pages race to a thriller-esque ending that, while not tying every loose end, left me feeling as if I had read a singular, satisfying novel. Smith doesn't rely on easy, obvious immigration issues to drive White Teeth; she goes much deeper into characters' minds and families without preaching.I hope I'm not making White Teeth sound pious. In fact, I would argue Smith wrote the novel in part as a reaction to the piety that obscures truthful narrative. She builds each character from the ground up and knows when to move from one to the next. I'm also not sure if I understood every metaphorical nuance; I'm not English, Bengali, Muslim, or a Jehovah's Witness, all elements intrinsic to the storyline, so I most likely missed symbolic elements. While I don't want to minimize the immigrant experience, white readers, I believe, feel some of the same vertigo as the characters when navigating a landscape with different cultural touchstones, e.g. signs in Polish and Korean up and down Chicago's Milwaukee Avenue. Zadie Smith doesn't praise or criticize these landscapes. She focuses on the fear and hope inherent in characters' reactions to the stimuli. The players can't control the landscape as much as accept and respond to it. This is a sprawling, well-structured novel. White Teeth is a near-masterwork, the best book I've ever read about different cultures' slow, tectonic plate-like creep past, toward, and into each other.",79,0.9253,0.084,0.796,0.12,0.3805798368298368,NEGATIVE,0.9838
8,2711450794,03/23/2019,4.0,"Zadie Smith's prose style here is notably different from her later books. It's like she read all Martin Amis' early novels and to a large extent replicated his distinctive rhythms into her prose. So too is the emphasis on comedy much heavier here than in later books. She's making more effort to charm - which, I suppose, is only natural for a young unpublished author. White Teeth is full of fabulous insight into the immigrant's experience of England. Zadie Smith has her finger on cultural pulses like few other writers. You always want to hear what she has to say about everyday cultural life. And especially she provides insights into the germs of terrorism. I loved her rendition of Jamaican speech patterns. She's fantastic at evoking the inventive vitality of improvisations of the English language. At times it can be a novel that revels in its own silliness. As if Zadie gets carried away with her own youthful zest. And the ending is a bit of a damp squid. She orchestrates all her characters to gather in the same room at the end of the novel, all bursting with their conflicting imperatives and somehow manages to create a denouement that is both a bit daft and highly unsatisfactory.

9,676669040,07/24/2013,5.0,"There need to be more books like this in the world. Little bit cocky, little bit sharp, written within my lifetime by someone with little to no representation in the halls of esteemed literature by means of race and gender and what have you and does not give a flying fuck about it. The setting may be the well worn island of merry old 20th century England for the most part, but the reality is that of the 21st. Smorgasbord where white men get as proper a representation in the wider plain of reality as demonstrated by their worldy demographic percentages, rather than the plague of pretense sludging its way out of the past and into modern day entertainment maintaining against all odds that women are objects and people of color haven't been invented yet? Yes please.I've noticed a common tone of grimaces and smirks at the college days of dorm room philosophizing, BYOB's galore in the booze and bong and Bourdieu, and I have to say, why? Shell out thousands for tuition, break your back and brain on everything so that you may make a living and never live it for the rest of your days, so that we may scoff at and scorn the few moments youthful selves stretched out their mind out of their own true volition? For if that's your habitus, you're not going to like this book at all. There's no college here, mind you, nor the slightest hint of academic satire beyond the teachers and the parents and the volcanic smoldering that is the thousands of fags smoked in every courtyard of a colonial workhouse turned school. Rather, there's that periodic expounding on the smaller things in view of the bigger and vice versa, the sociopolitical/cultural/religious -isms galore in tidbits between plot and character and the standard rest, enough that I've just gone back to shove that four star up to a dazzling five because fuck it, I'd have to read ten of the classics to get the amount of true and glorious angry pointing out the lies and filth and prejudice of our world, our times. You say Middlemarch, I say been there, loved that, but these days of mine are played to the tune of ""It's a Small Cosmopolitan World After All"", and ivory towers just aren't going to cut it any more, no matter how well intentioned or lucky in hotfooting it out of hell. Heard of the Bechdel Test? Try the variant for people of color, or perhaps the Mako Mori Test. True, the book didn't pass the Russo Test, but there's a reason why I'm on the lookout for more Zadie titles to grace my shelves.Now, since one side of my family has been in area of the later named United States since the 1600's, while the other is claimed to have been wandering around since the 1500's by an especially fervent Great Aunt, my sense of being an immigrant is nigh nonexistent. Thus, I'm not going to do anything inane like compare this work to the likes of Lahiri and Kogawa and other variations in the theme and said that the way the subject was handled felt more or less real to me. However, if you couldn't tell by my rant above, Zadie seized on the true and utter consequences of the people perceived as other migrating to and living in the country of the ""self"" perceivers and got angry about it. The result is an admittedly hilarious and corkscrew escapade across a multivarious cast of at least four generations, but the righteous fury is there, enough that I'm amazed I haven't come across one of those reviews decrying it for being ""too political"" or whatever the term is for authors mixing their Entertainment with Truth. Regarding said reviews, I have seen ones dismissing the characters as unsympathetic caricatures, bemoaning the conclusion, wielding hedge clippers at the plot, what have you. To that I say...ehh. It's been a while since my baseline lay along those particular lines, and seeing how this reading turned out niggling doubts and annoyance free, I'd say I'm the better for it.",70,0.9961,0.068,0.788,0.144,0.4467549923195084,NEGATIVE,0.59

So let me just bullet-point out my main takeaways here and hope they convey even half of my enthusiasm for Zadie Smith's undeniable talent:- The characters are so rich, each has a believable and well-rounded life that comes through on the page.- The problems they face are relatable: they were born, they grew older, the world changed around them.- Don't get me started on her beautifully fluid writing style!This is a long-ish book and yet there is never a lull in the energy. The flowing currents shift and transmute based on the scene's needs but it is always buoyant, a merry dance that settles comfortably somewhere between the gorgeous prose of Realism and the whimsical wonkiness of Postmodernism. She is playful with language, but shows enough restraint that her way of writing serves as a tool to display character rather than stealing the show for its own sake.The world can get lonely. The world can get strange. But it's populated with real people who seldom conform to expectations, and there is comfort in that.5 stars. Stunning.

11,685143693,08/03/2013,1.0,"The Short: The only thing this book hates more than its characters is you, the reader.The long form presentation: Lets boil down the premise and get it out of the way. This book is about nature vs nurture. Don't worry about that theme too much, because this book hates its theme. It can't be bothered to come to a logical or even an irrational conclusion about that theme. It hates its theme nearly as much as it hates you, the reader. Didn't I just say that? Am I being redundant? Right, there is too much, let me sum up. Basic Storytelling annoyances: It would have been nice if the author could have picked less than 10 main characters to focus on. Or, would have stopped introducing characters long before the second to last chapter. (Tangential annoyance: This late group of card-board cut out characters is created to mock pretentious college student types (oh, the inadvertent irony), but is a complete regurgitation of Monty Python's ""what have the Romans ever done for us?"" scene from Life of Brian. Just a general Boo out to that.)Or, if the characters were anything but stereotypical one dimensional shadow puppets with two modes: Shouty and Really Shouty.The Narrator attempts to convince the reader (the hated reader) that racial stereotypes shouting at each other is funny. The Narrator will put a ""Funny Here Marker"" in her dialogue to underline what is supposed to be funny. The FHM is easy to spot; it is a F-bomb if its really funny or an ""assing"" or ""bastard"" if it is (supposedly) mildly amusing. Truth be told, in the 70000 or so pages, I may have accidentally chuckled at some bits, but it is really too painful to remember now.Intermediate storytelling annoyances: Don't continue a scene when the Point of View Character has left that scene. Abrupt use of flashback and flash-forward highlights the thin, uncertain texture of your narrative. Never be afraid to use one word, whereas three will annoy your readers (the hated readers). Plot, generally nice to have. Drama is not shouty, mean people being mean and shouty to each other. Exposition. Dear Cthulhu! the Narrator is an exposition machine. Please stop the expositioning. Being told the the backstory of every random character who pops in to be belittled and mocked is both unwanted and unwise. Advanced Annoyances: Stop being redundant. Redundancy, stop. The redundant things, they are being, they must stop. Everything is said at least three times in the book. Three times. Some things are said six or more times. Thrip x20. Very. If the Narrator says Very something, it will be said at least twice. It is infuriating. And it is not just words. Whole scenes are redundant and are put in just to drive the reader (the hated reader - ok you get it, I'll stop) insane.Extreme Annoyances: A third of the way into this book, just when the barrage of unfunny sitcom scenarios has numbed the reader into submission, the Narrator starts throwing in little clues, hints, that the Narrator knows exactly what it is doing. And She is not just mocking the poor characters, but you, the reader. Little bits about ""Corkscrew dialogue"" and ""redundant writing"" shows up. What is Corkscrew dialogue? Google doesn't know. The only thing I can think of is this - this book is corkscrew dialogue. It goes around and around, seemingly going deep beneath the surface, but not really moving at all. And the cork - that sucker broke off. No wine for you.Shaking that paranoia off, I continue. At the end of the day, this 'story' is just a bunch of shallow characters shouting religious catchphrases at each other.

I seriously almost didn't make it through this read, and it is only in the looking back that I see just how brilliant it is. Smith starts with two characters, then links character after character to them. It all starts with two men lost in WWI, having no real role in it, and discover it has ended without their knowledge. They capture a war architect after the war and invent stories in some attempt to claim true manhood. There is so much story in between. Two twin brothers, one who is sent back to the Middle East in hopes of retaining the Muslim ways. The other fully engaged in all things secular. Smith does a lot of meandering, but in the end, what do a fundamentalist Muslim, a Jehovah's Witness, and ardent animal rights activists have in common? Sounds like a joke, but as it turns out, quite a lot.A few things this book had me thinking about.-How science and religion have become polarized.-How different one generation is from the next, and how this impacts both.-Many things are not at all what we expect.-What defines manhood.-How black and white thinking is so dangerous.-How one action leads to unforeseen others, and all of life seems connected.My only real problem with this read was the length of the meandering narratives.",59,0.8378,0.052,0.859,0.088,0.4022727272727273,POSITIVE,0.9488

15,4005463214,05/19/2021,1.0,"The Year of Women--in which I'm devoting 2021 to reading female authors only--continues with my introduction to Zadie Smith and her debut novel White Teeth. Published in 2000, this is an acclaimed book I wanted to love and understand most of, in the way I'd love a badge for David Foster Wallace or Salman Rushdie. No book is for everyone, though. By the 10% mark, I had started skimming. By 20%, I surrendered. Smith's talent in language arts is evident opening this book up to any page and blindly pointing at any paragraph. What's absent is story, as well as a character who wanted something and had obstacles put in her way. White Teeth is a novel I felt I could skip five pages without missing anything other than writing. Smith is as active as Simone Biles cartwheeling all over each and every page: inventive writing, colorful writing, bold writing, witty writing, triple axle writing. I was delighted initially, then reached a point where I wanted all that leaping around to stop and the story to start. I've enjoyed novels where the author pointed her writing out, reminded the reader they were reading a novel, but always because there was a compelling story. Smith writes about one character, and then another character, and then and then and then ... Wondering how this might've happened, I only had to research how old Smith was when she wrote this book. Case closed.Zadie Smith was born in the working class suburb of Willesden in northwest London in 1975. Her mother emigrated to the U.K. from Jamaica in 1969 and married an Englishman thirty years her senior. Smith, who changed her name from Sadie to ""Zadie"" at fourteen, was fond of tap dancing and jazz singing but deemed writing to be a more attainable career path. She graduated from King's College, Cambridge with a degree in English, several short stories published in the college literary collection and a novel, White Teeth, which she was offered a six-figure advance on when she was 21. Its critical and commercial success made Smith an international literary sensation. She lives in Kilburn, London with her husband and two children.

Along the way themes such as race relations, religious extremism, immigration, and even the ethics of genetic engineering are explored, all with an intoxicating energy and a sparkling sense of humour.The aspect of the book I admired most was its focus on family. Both the Iqbal and Jones clans are dysfunctional in their own way - obstacles such as marital infidelity and fundamentalism serve to threaten the family unit. Continents may divide them, conflicting ideologies might drive them apart but there is a familial bond that will never break and an unconditional love for one another that will always exist (even though they may be slow to admit this at times).The story is dizzying in scope and though are numerous plot threads to tie up, it all comes together in an immensely satisfying finale.

Granted I did take a 17 day vacation and set this one aside during that break, but this was a huge struggle for me to get through.This is a character study, with religious themes and historical references. Two men, who find themselves alone during the war become best friends-- Archibald Jones and Samad Iqbal. Generational in nature and how certain events shaped their lives in the most odd way. Different cultures are introduced, characters from Jamaica, Bengal and those passionate about leaflets and witnesses. I enjoyed the generational nature of how these families crossed paths and how each decision led to the most ridiculous set of events.The writing was amazing, at time the book was hilarious, sarcastic and poignant. The research Smith must have done to find out about all these different cultures and religions and political events during the 1970s-1990s was spot on. Why was this such a slog for me? I cannot pinpoint it except to say too long, too many paragraphs and pages of philosophical meandering. While there were small sections of plot, it felt like nothing happened. The ending felt rushed and slightly disappointed. I could put this down for weeks and never want to pick it back up again. Each time I did pick it up, I enjoyed it more than I thought. This is a hard one to rate, therefore I'm going with a 2 as GR calls that ""It was ok"".

19,584547314,04/08/2013,4.0,"Phew, I was exhausted after finishing this book.Faith, race, gender, history, and culture in three North London families are turned upside down, questioned, dissected and turned into a tragic comedy by Zadie Smith.Samad Iqbal and his wife Alsana, the original Benghali immigrants, who often sort their differences out in some feisty backyard wrestling matches while their two twin sons, Magid and Millat, the second generation immigrants, run haywire in their confusion about being British as their mom wish them to be, and being Muslim as their father demands them to be. Millat ends up smoking pot, turning punk, test-driving all women he comes in contact with, admiring the Bruce Willis kind of action heroes and joining a militant Muslim group called KEVIN. Magid becomes an eccentric well-mannered nerdy scientist who wants to be a lawyer, after his dad abducted him and send him back to the old country to become accustomed with the old traditions and religion. But Magid ends up coming back an atheist and more British than the Brits themselves. Both sons become something Samad never wanted them to be.Archie Jones, the only 'real Brit' in the situation, is the beginning and ending of the narrative - the last man standing in any situation. He married the toothless Clara, an immigré from Jamaica. Her grandmother, Hortense, is a staunch Jahova's Witness who stuck to her believes through thick and thin. Clara is much younger than Archie. Their union produces Irie - an agnostic seeker of love and peace. An intelligent young lady who never loses her sense of balance. Archie and Samat come a very long way and became the best of friends since the second World War. Their two different versions of Samat's great great Grandfather, Mangal Pande's history, keep them in debate ever since they became friends. Samat says to Archie in one of their many discussions of the matter in O'Connolls: ""Of course I see your point of view, Achie, I do. But my point is, and has always been, from the very first time we discussed the subject; my point is that this is not the full story. And yes, I realize that we have several times thoroughly investigated the matter, but the fact remains: full stories are as rare as honesty, precious as diamonds. If you are lucky enough to uncover one, a full story will sit in your brain like lead. They are difficult. They are long-winded. They are epic. They are like the stories God tells: full of impossibly particular information. You don't find them in the dictionary.""This is what the book is all about. The full, long-winded, difficult, epic around the particular information(history) of three families, their cultures, religions and all the issues of modern life in the western world of London.The third family, with the agnostic Jewish scientist prof. Marcus Chalfen with his wife, Joyce and their brilliant sons living out their Chalfenism, get the time bomb ticking for the final scene when he releases his research on genetic manipulation on a mouse which he plans to patent, copyright and bar code! The FutureMouse© would ultimately portray and repeat the legend of Samat's great-great grandfather, Mangal Pande which began"" in the spring of 1857 in a factory in Dum-Dum a new kind of bullet went into production. Designed to be used in English guns by Indian soldiers, like most bullets at the time, they had casing that must be bitten in order to fit the barrel. There seemed nothing exceptional about them, until it was discovered by some canny factory worker that they were covered in a grease - a grease made from the fat of pigs, monstrous to Muslims, and the fat of cows, sacred to Hindus. It was an innocent mistake - as far as anything is innocent on stolen land - an infamous British blunder.........Under the specious pretext of new weaponry, the English were intending to destroy their caste, their honour, their standing in the eyes of God and men - everything, in short, that made life worth living.....""The launch of FutureMouse© guarantees a surprising ending to a tragicomedy, very well told and very well presented by Zadie Smith. There are no lose ends left behind.It is, in fact, a book I would love to read again!

24,1108631697,11/17/2014,4.0,"If you have been (or your parent has been) an immigrant, White Teeth will probably speak to you. My father was the first member of his family born in Canada. He desperately felt the need to fit in, to be Canadian. As a result, when his parents spoke in Danish at home, he always answered them in English. In later life, he could understand Danish, but not speak it, a situation which was sometimes frustrating when dealing with relatives who only spoke Danish. My grandfather came to Canada first, alone, and started out working in the lumber camps of Northern Alberta. He was a religious man and was mortified when he learned that the first English words that he acquired were cuss words. My grandmother is my hero—she came by boat to Quebec and then boarded a train to come to Western Canada. She spoke no English and no French, had 3 small children, a bag of apples, and no money. And yet they all made it to Athabasca to meet Grandpa.Now, you may think that Danish immigrants would have felt a warm welcome in Canada in the late 1920s/early 1930s. Still, they didn’t fit in because they didn’t yet speak English and they had some different customs. Also, the Danes and the Ukrainians settled in the same area and there was some kind of weird rivalry between the two ethnic groups. Several generations later, and both groups of immigrants fit into Canada like they have always been here. It’s hardest for the first two generations.So I could identify in a small way with the situation in White Teeth where people trace their heritage back to Jamaica and Bangladesh and are trying to fit into an overwhelmingly Anglo-Saxon society. 
But it makes an immigrant laugh to hear the fears of the nationalist, scared of infection, penetration, miscegenation, when this is small fry, peanuts compared to what the immigrant fears—dissolution, disappearance.
When your culture is very different from the new country (like Samad and Alsana’s Islamic life), you dread your children acclimatizing to their new surroundings—the religion that you cherish has potential to be lost (Magid) or changed until its unrecognizable (Millat). Contrast that with ever-so-Anglo-Saxon Archie, who ends up with a black daughter. Irie will always be considered foreign, even though she has just as many English ancestors as many Caucasian English, and she really feels her foreign-ness despite being born in North London. Hence her romantic notions of “the homeland” of Jamaica. It’s amusing to watch Archie—unworthy recipient of white male privilege—seemingly unaware of all the ramifications of racial and class politics that swirl around him. Samad is the intellectual of the two and his intelligence is rarely recognized, while stolid, thick Archie wanders through life seemingly without impediment. Samad is torn between wanting the pleasurable things of life and being a devout Muslim. He literally tears his twin sons apart, sending Magid back to Bangladesh to become a “good boy” and leaving Millat in London, taking on the bad-boy half of the equation (and in many ways, living out some of his father’s desires).There are lots of good things and many shrewd observations in WT, but to my way of thinking there were too many ideas being bandied about. It seemed to try to tackle everything: colonization, migration, class, race, prejudice, history, genetics—all intertwined, but maybe a bite that is just a little too big to chew. No wonder the book is over 400 pages.Two weeks ago, I went to our university’s distinguished lecturer series to hear the author, Zadie Smith, speak.

But Smith is much closer to real life, and her stories are so much easier to read, with humor too, so that you can guess who has my preference.

A past tense, future perfect kind of night.
The first half of this novel was everything I wanted in a book this month. These compelling love stories of couples from different racial and socio-economic backgrounds was beguiling. Plus, the age factor. What reader wouldn't take the chance to peek into the soul of a couple with many years between them, right?Clara, her energy and humor laced with patois, lured me. And Archie, what is it about the man that makes a reader so curious? I was willing to follow as the layers of his life were peeled apart. Yet, as the structure took twists and turns, it became a bit much for my distracted thoughts to follow. These are stories within stories, subplots within plots. Layers of time that move backwards, forwards, sideways.

Her fluid prose, the way she builds her characters – ordinary people who have extraordinary inner lives – the wry and sometimes deliciously dark humor that swirls through the story.There is no plot per se in “White Teeth”: just the story of how Archie did not kill himself, the story of how Samad had a middle-age crisis, how Irie tries to figure herself out, and how Millat and Magid grew up to be so different from each other, despite being twins.War threw Archie and Samad together, and a friendship developed over the kind of experiences that no one else can truly grasp. When the two men returned to England, they each married women that they care for but do not understand, and had children that seem to them like they came from an entirely different planet. Smith explores their lives, how they are all tangled in each other’s existence. Their lives are intricately bound together, the net of human connection strongly illustrated by who comes and goes in their lives, and Smith does a wonderful job showing the different perceptions first generation immigrants will have on their cultural identity vs the way their second generation children will see it.Reading this book hot on the heels of Evaristo’s “Girl, Woman, Other” (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...), it’s hard not to find many things in common between both works.

It's a refreshing change of pace from my usual sullen and deeply cynical reading repertoire.And besides, when the hell do you ever get to read about characters who are people of color with actual internal, middle-class dilemmas that aren't wrought in cheesy sentimentality and a guilty liberal consciousness of ""getting in touch with your roots to find your true self"" (I'm looking at you, Jhumpa Lahiri)?

And of course, there's always that little delight to factor in that I take in recommending my romance novels to Kinga in return. :)So what's that got to do with this book? Nothing, really. Except to illustrate how I lack the refined palate to appreciate these novels that she continues to shove so lovingly into my hands.However, a few thoughts on this novel. Try as I might I failed to really care about most of the characters. That alone tends to doom a novel. Then there's the terrible smugness of the narrator, and by extension, the author. World! I am writing a great novel. The level of detail was simply too much. Every character it seems was drawn (and drawn out) in overdone detail pretty much making the novel twice as long as it could/should have been. Despite all the literary awards that White Teeth has won, I'm not a fan. So, please excuse me as I once again ensconce myself in the bawdy bedroom antics and classist machinations of the ton until my next literary endeavour arrives in my inbox from Kinga.",24,0.9917,0.087,0.702,0.211,0.3729910714285714,NEGATIVE,0.9982
34,2351263604,04/16/2018,5.0,"“Clean white teeth are not always wise, now are they?”This is one impressive novel, easily one of the smartest novels I’ve ever read. I was bowled over by Zadie Smith’s perceptiveness. She writes incredibly authentic prose involving a huge range of characters, subjects, time periods and viewpoints. Indecisive Archie, guilt-ridden Samad, angry Alsana, reckless Millat, careful Magid, long-suffering Irie … there are so many characters and they are all so specific, so real, so unique in what they obsess over, how they react, even the way they swear. She covers multiple generations, races, countries and harrowing situations, as if she’d lived as and through them herself.There are so many themes, you could just sort of take your pick and read into this what you want. Religion? check. Multiculturalism? check. Family? check. Dentistry? check. Genetic engineering? check. The Godfather? Check. The list is endless. There were parts I didn’t like so much: the beginning had a snarky tone, and the end felt overloaded with new characters and plotlines. But the majority of the book was mesmerizing: sharp, funny and insightful. “Don’t you see, Abba? whispered Millat. That’s it. That’s the long, long history of us and them. That’s how it was.”",24,0.8691,0.063,0.828,0.108,0.6301308539944904,POSITIVE,0.9998

36,1509880171,01/14/2016,5.0,"Tangled intimacy on an expansive scale. Cultural dissection and exploration.Involved. At least that was the right word, Alsana reflected, as she liftes her foot off the pedal, and let the wheel spin a few times alone before coming to a squeaky halt. Sometimes, here in England, especially at bus-stops and on the daytime soaps, you heard people say “We’re involved with each other,” as if this were a most wonderful state to be in, as if one chose it and enjoyed it. Alsana never thought of it that way. Involved happened over a long period of time, pulling you in like quicksand. Involved is what befell the moon-faced Alsana Begum and the handsome Samad Miah one week after they’d been pushed into a Delhi breakfast room together and informed they were to marry. Involved was the result when Clara Bowden met Archie Jones at the bottom of some stairs. Involved swallowed up a girl called Ambrosia and a boy called Charlie (yes, Clara had told her that sorry tale) the second they kissed in the larder of a guest house. Involved is neither good, nor bad. It is just a consequence of living, a consequence of occupation and immigration, of empires and expansion, of living in each other’s pockets… one becomes involved and it is a long trek back to being uninvolved. Involvement in one way or another is what this entire book is about: individuals' self involvement, intimate involvement, social involvement, cultural involvement, etc. Broad themes are approached on personal levels. Smith uses her characters' relationships to discuss the issues of religious and cultural differences, ideological conflict, racism, nationalism, class-ism, and sexuality, all in an English prism. Smith's writing is generally entrancing, quick, and sharp. Her style is not romantic, it is unvarnished and blunt, but it also can ramble delightfully on down the chasm of a character's mind - I recognize this type of chaotic, off-the-rails thought process as something I myself am prone to, especially in times of stress, and for this reason I have a special appreciation for these often dark leaps and tangled asides. Smith's dialogue is often word fencing between characters, but it's not passionless clever wit, quite the opposite, the reader gets a great sense of the emotion imbued in each of the character's words. Our characters are numerous, but predominantly the reader is following the lives of two families of mixed cultural and national backgrounds and all are unique and yet products of their histories alike. Often I found myself despising some of the individual's decisions or turns, but understanding them, much like if they were members of your own family. My only complaint comes from the times in the book where things are being brought together, buttoned-up as it were, these parts seemed forced, as if Smith is attempting to be too clever at the expense of the story. Not every individual story-line has to come together in a tidy bow, and neither does a title have to be a theme craftily/forcibly sprinkled/shoved in a dozen different literary orifices (slight pet peeve). These slight annoyances are forgivable in light of the beautifully written remaining 99%. Other themes include: aborted/failed life ending (whether that be homicide or suicide), genetic engineering, fry-ups, loveless(?) marriages, coin flipping, and Niece-of-Shame!

37,3177223362,03/02/2020,4.0,"Well, given all the hub-bub and the misogynistic criticisms and the swells of plaudits and the what-have-you, I can't say I came to Zadie Smith's landmark novel, White Teeth free of experience. I mean, I honestly had no idea what the hell it was about, but I sure knew a lot of people felt a lot of things about it. James Wood's infamous, if not myopic, review wherein he coined a new syllogism ""hysterical realism"" in which he parodies the likes of Pynchon, Smith, DFW, etc. setup some kind of expectation within me—that this would be a zany, paranoid fever-dream full of erudition and weird quasi-realism, etc. That's not at all what it is. Any probably all the better for it.Instead, it's a pretty traditional familial saga about diaspora, post-colonialism, race, religion, time, the expectations we have of our children, tradition, science, extremism, fate, chance, and more. If I had to do that thing where you liken a thing to another thing that invariably isn't really an accurate comparison at all, but it works well enough that people kind of get it, I would say Zadie Smith's novel is actually more like Franzen's The Corrections but better, because there's more to it than White People Problems.Because my expectations were in a totally different spot, it took me a few days of reading to really get bearings, because I kept looking for the odd turn, the peculiarity so buzzed about through Wood's analysis. But I then settled in, realizing that this wasn't going to be a quirky, weird trip, but a really engagingly told story of a family in the UK, living the diaspora in all its myriad variations from East to West.Smith writes with precision, with light touches, and with humor. The book, hardly a pot-boiler is a real page turner as its chorus of voices builds to a crescendoing closing few pages where stakes have been set for 400 pages, and now, everyone's all in one room, and it's going to explode, but you just don't know how.As soon as I realized my per-conceived notions about the book were misappropriated, I feared that the book would wear thin. It never did for me, and I really, deeply loved the characters and how their weird story of post-colonial life in England spun out. I'll be eager to read Smith's other books.

This was disappointing. Luckily I was a huge fan of Zadie’s writing itself, and so I’m not ruling out trying her other books... which means @ab_reads has not disowned me.In reality, this should have worked for me. I enjoy stories that span decades, that follow multiple people and families.

39,2401949159,07/15/2019,4.0,"This book starts with an attempted suicide on New Year’s Day, 1975, and the remnants of an End of the World party, where Archie meets his future wife, Clara, as both try to leave the past behind. It goes on to describe a long-lasting friendship between Archie Jones, a white Englishman, and Samad Iqbal, a Bengali, who met during their service in the British Army in WWII. While the war does not take center stage, it forms the basis of the friendship and establishes the foundation for the rest of the story. Archie and Samad end up living near each other in a working-class neighborhood of North London. The story branches out to their wives, Clara and Alsana, and their children, Archie’s daughter, Irie, and Samad’s twins Millat and Magid. It engages in many flashbacks to their families’ histories in Jamaica, Europe, and Asia. It takes a dramatic turn when two of the (by then) teenage children start spending time with the Chalfen family, intellectuals that speak of themselves in the third person and engage in scientific rationalist thought. This book touches on a variety of serious themes, such as identity, immigration, race, ethnicity, social class, genetic engineering, faith, friendship, and fate, but are handled in a way that reads like a “slice of life” in an ever-diverse world. Smith’s style is a bit frenetic, with a good dose of cynical humor. The characters are well-developed and realistic, and the flashbacks to the past provide insight into their motivations. Smith is adept at describing differences in intergenerational and marital perspectives that lead to disagreements. She writes believable dialogue using authentic-sounding dialects. She goes down a few “rabbit holes” that had me wondering where it was all heading, but she brings it together superbly in the end. Smith comments on what it means to be part of today’s modern society where globalization is the norm and people of many diverse backgrounds interact regularly. It also touches on traditions of the past and the desire not to lose cultural identity. It explores attempts at controlling the future and reveals them to be, largely, an exercise in futility. Some of the wildly disparate elements of this story include: a scientific project to genetically engineer a mouse, animal rights activists reacting to the mouse, the Jehovah’s Witness religion of Clara’s mother and ex-boyfriend, and a fundamentalist Muslim religion, Keepers of the Eternal and Victorious Islam Nation, adopted by Millat (“KEVIN?...We are aware that we have an acronym problem”).

42,609074069,05/06/2013,5.0,"Listicles are where it's at these days and I want to adapt my writing for today's short attention-span crowd. So with that in mind, here are ten and a half quick things you need to know about Zadie Smith. Maybe I'll score a job will Buzzfeed, where I'll compile such delightful articles as ""twelve facts about bunions"" and ""seven beloved corporate mascots that have appeared in pornography"" that we can all chortle at over our coffee. 1. Her dialog is incredible, just incredible. It's like she wanders around London and zooms in on the details of everyone's dialect, vocabulary and vocal tics and sets out in her writing to recreate them almost exactly, only adding in the bits that would make those conversations sound cooler. Which would be maddening if her judgment w/r/t coolness wasn't so damn accurate.2. See also her prose style. Smith comes out of the DFW school where her prose isn't the most gorgeous you'll read but is an utter triumph of the imagination. Her juxtapositions of words and death-defying metaphors and goddamn her way of picking exactly the verb to describe not just exactly the action but exactly what's beneath the action as well... phew. Good shit.3. Her characters are admittedly just a little hit-or-miss, but they hit a lot more often than they miss. it's hard not to like a sarcastic lesbian feminist intellectual known as ""niece-of-shame"" who flaunts those exact shameful qualities. Neena has multiple certifications in badassery.4. She makes no secret of her ambition whatsofuckingever. Remember how every Philip Roth book became a Philip Roth Book About America toward the end of his career? Zadie Smith's sort of like that about Britain, except her first book was a Zadie Smith Book About America. And she released it at twenty-four. At that same age, Roth's fiction was in full personal mode: recounting a lost romance, piecing together his Jewish identity, reminiscing about old friends. Political for sure, but not on-the-sleeve political like Zadie Smith. Whose writing is also, if her essays are anything to go by, highly personal.4a. Unlike Roth, however, Zadie Smith is actually interested in women as complex human beings. See also: 3. 5. Can you think of any writers who got hit with Promising Young Writer Syndrome faster? The Autograph Man gets trashed around here, NW was derided as a disappointment by no less of an authority than that person in line behind me at the library who saw I had a copy of this guy, and On Beauty wrecks my rule entirely, but you have to wonder - flame-out or hype cycle? I'm almost through with NW right now and it's not White Teeth-good, but the third big chunk that's told entirely in vignettes is a sparkling good novella about Britain.6. Can we please stop saying ""hysterical realism"" like the holy temple of realism has been desecrated, especially w/r/t Smith and DFW? Something tells me Smith's style was exactly the shot in the arm realism needed. Maybe I've been too brainwashed by the postmodern ideology to think any other way and need my whole way of seeing things redone by a lifetime of Raymond Carver and Tobias Wolff, but none of those same six arguments against maximalism (""the characters are thin,"" as though character studies are our only options for novels. ""The prose is too difficult,"" as though we can't be expected to exert ourselves every so often) hold any water as far as this bucket's concerned.7. The ground this novel covers is astounding. You thought One Hundred Years of Solitude was a bursting-at-the-seams family saga? You ain't seen nothing yet. doot, doot. bu bu bu baby. We go from an attempted suicide to a media circus in under five hundred pages. You know you want to find out how we got from point a) to point b). 7a. No, that wasn't a spoiler, not really. Note how I didn't say what caused the media circus. 8. Sometimes they're onto something when they dump a bunch of awards on a novel. Don't you forget, mindlessly rejected prizewinning fiction is just as foolish as mindlessly reading prizewinning fiction. The operative word is ""mindlessly,"" not ""prizewinning."" And hey, thanks to the miraculous power of subpoints, that's technically TEN THINGS!Wait, one of them was only tangentially related to Zadie Smith? Okay.9. Her essays are sharp.Bang! Ten!

46,1203341473,02/17/2015,4.0,"Wood pooh-poohed this text, inaptly, as it turns out, as hysterical realism. Am not sure if Wood was interested in the bad gender politics of that particular generic designation, but the gross amalgamation of this text with Pynchon, Rushdie, Delillo, DFW does not make much sense. (It’s most similar to Delillo, I think, of the usual suspects listed therein.) Master figure is of course the odontic, which is most plainly significant to the extent that a character might be “from somewhere. She has roots” (23). Most of the major characters are subject to ‘root canals’ during the story, wherein their own genetic/ontic (as opposed to dental/odontic) roots are traced out. The ‘roots’ are typically nationality (Jamaica, Bangladesh, England are the most important) and religion (Jehovah’s Witness, Islam, Judaism). As it happens, teeth gnash. They are destroyed through the nocturnal bruxism. Root canals are necessary because the teeth are dicked up. Needless to say, the British empire dicked everything up—though the point of the text is equally that the Empire caused the gnashing, which is also a commingling, a bringing together. This in itself can’t be all bad—after all, the couples here are multinational: English prat marries Jamaican beauty, for instance. Hard to argue against miscegenated childrens, in my not all humble opinion. The novel’s great friendship is English prat and traditional Moslem (“very religious, lacking nothing except the faith” (53)), who are brought together in fighting fascism (a great story there (71-102)). There’s other gnashings: generational discord, religious tactics (fundamentalist vel non), gender politics. On that last, we have a bizarre little bit (that earned a gross! in my marginalia): But to be serious for a moment: as you know, I am a man whose profession it is to look deep inside of “Woman,” and, like a psychiatrist, mark her with a full bill of health or otherwise. And I feel sure, my friend (to extend a metaphor), that you have explored your lady-wife-to-be in such a manner, both spiritually and mentally, and found her not lacking in any particular. (43-44)The speaker here is not a dentist, as one might otherwise expect from the thematic, but is rather a gynecologist. Does the thematic still work? Is drilling down into the tooth during a root canal similar to psychiatry? Is it like looking deep inside a woman’s cavernous birthing canal? Can one go spelunking in the vagina for spiritual/mental thingies? Did I fuck up all my marriages by not looking for those thingies while exploring? Traditional Moslem wife has a rejoinder to all that, however: I was married to Samad Iqbal the same evening of the very day I met him. Yes, I didn’t know him from Adam. But I liked him well enough. We met in the breakfast room on a steaming Delhi day and he fanned me with The Times. I thought he had a good face, a sweet voice, and his backside was high and well formed for man of his age. Very good. Now, every time I learn something more about him, I like him less. (66)Husband’s traditionalism is well understood as resisting all that is solid melting into air: “I don’t wish to be a modern man! I wish to live as I was always meant to! I wish to return to the East!” (121). (Rejoinder: who “can pull the West out of ‘em once it’s in?” (id.)) The issue here is that “the sins of the Eastern father shall be visited upon the Western sons” (135), which is a primary component of the narrative here; “immigrants have always been particularly prone to repetition” (id.), first as tragedy, second as farce, I suppose. The reiteration initiates not with original sin, but with “original trauma” (136)—“they can’t help but reenact the dash they once made from one land to another, from one faith to another, from one brown mother country into the pale, freckled arms of an imperial sovereign” (id.). Our traditionalist objects that “people call it assimilation when it is nothing but corruption” (159). (“it is still hard to admit,” however, “that there is no one more English than the Indian, no one more Indian than the English” (272).)The obligatory Hegelian commentary: “We are split people. For myself, half of me wishes to sit quietly with my legs crossed, letting things that are beyond my control wash over me. But the other half wants to fight the holy war” (150). The obligatory Baudrillardian commentary: “A few found themselves seventeen years later at the British Empire Exhibition of 1924, dressed up as Jamaicans in the Jamaica exhibit, acting out a horrible simulacrum of their previous existence—tine drums, coral necklaces—for they were English now, more English than the English by virtue of their disappointments” (255). The traditionalist would seek to control the offspring, who may not want to be traditionalists, loyal to mother country—but rather might want to become, say, fundamentalists, or secular progressives, or socialists, or loyal imperialists, or whatever. Dude laments that his kids “strayed so far from the life I had intended for them” (336). No dead hand control, yo. It is an important text for multinational households. There is a balance to be drawn between assimilation and ‘roots.’ I for one am annoyed by pure tradition, but am a proponent of history. Perhaps the former tells me what I should be, whereas the latter tells me what I am; the former, an idealism, recommends fascism, but not so much the latter, which is a bit more historical materialist. That said, our traditionalist contends that “tradition was culture, and culture led to roots, and these were good, these were untainted principles” (161). Dude doesn't like that assimilation to the empire leads to “your children are unrecognizable, you belong nowhere” (336), but that strikes me as basic to the postmodern condition at the imperial center and therefore par for the course, a progressive development overall. (What kind of weird sense of proto-fascist entitlement must one possess if one can demand belonging somewhere? Is it not an odd, dangerous demand? Traditionalists want to “live on solid ground, underneath safe skies” (176), which invokes basic fascist ideology: cf. Griffin’s  Modernism and Fascism.)Anyway, plenty of other interesting things; it is a pregnant writing. Some Marxist content in characters of liberated niece of traditional Moslems as well as in scientist-socialist Jewish couple. (Also, omniscient narrator’s voice: “If religion is the opiate of the people, tradition is an even more sinister analgesic, simply because it rarely appears more sinister” (161).) Tradition infects the kids, who are led to believe that they “stood schizophrenic, one foot in Bengal and one in Willsden” (183). Kids are “two of Zeno’s headfuck arrows” (384), wherein Zeno’s objective is to “establish multiplicity, the Many, as an illusion” and then “prove reality a seamless, flowing whole” (id.), basically parmenidean aletheia and Anaximander’s apeiron. Narrative in second half turns toward scientist-socialists who work on genetic projects: “’You eliminate the random, you rule the world,’ said Marcus simply. ‘Why stick to octogenes? One could program every step in the development of an organism: reproduction, food habits, life expectancy’” (283). This program generates quite a bit of resistance by the conclusion, wrapped up with “the patenting of living organisms” (395), which I initially misread as the “parenting of living organisms”—and of course the genetic engineering of a perfectly controlled organism by scientist is exactly what all of the fuss has been with traditionalist’s failure in canalizing his sons into traditionalism. The commentary is plain, but not tendentious. The parallelism between the parenting and patenting plots is overall very well done.That said, genetically engineered creature is also a nifty little thing from Anglo-American philosophy, Quine’s ‘gavagai’—which might be a rabbit, as ostensibly identified by the illiterate tribespersons, but also, conceivably, might be a collection of undetached rabbit parts, or one of many rabbit temporal phases, depending on how tribesperson conceives the signified internally to go with the signifier that we translate facilely as mere ‘rabbit.’ Here, the parallel is substantial: Because, if it can be argued that the animal under experimentation is owned by any group of people, i.e., it is not a cat but effectively an invention with catlike qualities, then that very cleverly and very dangerously short-circuits the work of animal rights groups and leads to a pretty fucking scary vision of the future. (395) Thereafter, “surely the mouse in this case is a symbol” (401). I fell in love with author, however, when she described how this (somewhat ‘extremist’) animal rights group began as student radicals, idealist, passionate, “but political infighting, back-stabbing, and endless factionalizing soon disillusioned them as far as the fate of Homo erectus was concerned” (396), and the charismatic qualities of the leaders attracted “political drifters” (id.). This is of course alleging that this type of misanthropic animal rights activism is the progressive wing of lumpenized antisocial nihilism. Author has good comedic timing (e.g., fundamentalist book-burner who advises “you don’t have to read shit to know that it’s blasphemous” (194), or the great bit that reveals how the fundamentalist is always already structured by its antithesis, channeling Goodfellas: “As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a Muslim” (369)). She also possesses a committed perspective, an enviable cosmopolitanism, and is about as charming as an author can be.Recommended for readers who are independent, even of gravity, persons whose bodies are keeping dark secrets from them, and those who, simply put, fuck their sisters.",16,0.9966,0.085,0.796,0.119,0.4351168182628854,NEGATIVE,0.9997

I found myself drifting while reading and I didn’t care enough to go back and reread what I had technically read but not absorbed; in fact, that was most of the book. I don’t think there’s much more to say, other than skip this one. ",16,0.9287,0.036,0.835,0.128,0.4903846153846153,NEGATIVE,1.0
48,2244658060,01/05/2018,4.0,"A multi-generational, multi-ethnic story of two (three, if you count the Chalferns who come in later) families in England during the last quarter of the 20th century. I have to admit I laughed a lot and looked forward to being entertained each time I sat down with this giant tome, for each morsel was interesting, and I wasn’t disappointed.Archie (English) & Samad (Bengali) are two war-time buddies who marry women a whole generation younger than them. Archie’s wife Clara is Jamaican and their daughter is Irie who hates her kinky hair and wishes to straighten it at any cost. Samad’s wife Alsana is Bengali and their identical twins are Majid and Millat. Yet this particular egg split differently, for Magid is the intellectual and Millat the emotional one. And the entire premise of the novel splits along the divide between intellect and faith, and the characters align themselves in either side of this schism. To widen the crevasse, Samad, trying to keep one of his marital indiscretions secret, packs Majid off to be educated in Bangladesh and keeps Millat at home, only to see the former emerge a pukka sahib and the latter wind up a religious radical. Enter the Chalferns: Jewish, liberal, academic and open minded, a family that adopts Millat and Irie to teach them proper English values after the two teenagers are busted for marijuana possession in school. The plot thickens and deepens as Jehovah’s Witnesses, Islamic radicals, and animal activists are thrown into the mix, along with the fact that Mr. Chalfern, with the help of Majid, is into the genetic engineering of mice, a concept that the religious Samad and Millat are fundamentally opposed to. Without giving more of the plot away, I will say that the allegiances and shift and sway, as this group of motley souls look for identity and purpose in their lives. A series of secondary conflicts arise throughout the book: black vs. white, husband vs. wife, parent vs. child, immigrant vs. native-born, war-time vs. post war generation.No one is spared by Smith’s satirical omniscient narrator: Muslims, Hindus, Jews, Jehovah’s Witnesses, black and whites. The narrator also conceals vital information that is revealed later for more dramatic impact—sometimes 400 pages later, when one has forgotten the incident in this incident-packed story. I was reminded of Salman Rushdie, who has also taken an unsparing approach to laying bare the ills, prejudices and traumas of visible minorities in England. Smith has not faced the consequences that Rushdie faced, but she skirts some thin ice especially in parodying those ethnic and religious groups that take offence easier than others. Smith however, shows masterful control of the disparate story strands by bringing all the characters and the various interest groups into one place for a much anticipated finale on New Year’s Eve 1992. If I have to level one criticism at this novel, it is that the much expected “explosive ending” didn’t quiet happen.Notwithstanding this last grouse, I highly recommend this book, a truly phenomenal debut effort.",14,0.9629,0.038,0.876,0.086,0.3625020202020201,POSITIVE,0.9085
49,1168105943,01/14/2015,3.0,"Zadie Smith has been hugely celebrated for this book and others, and WHITE TEETH is the first I have read by her. It is a multi-generational/multi-ethnic/multi-themed tome of a book, and though two months or so have passed since I finished it, I am still not quite certain how I feel about it.One one hand, Smith is brilliant at sketching out characters. They are larger-than-life, and yet incredible human. The whole novel is permeated with a sense of heightened reality, that everything could be true, but is taken just a step too far.The book tells the story of Brit Archie and his Bengali friend, Samad, and later of their children. The story is set in London, a place so alive and varied, it is practically a character in itself, and was a perfect choice by Smith. I liked the part of the book which focused on Archie and Samad, who are very memorable, particularly the latter, in that they are almost caricatures of themselves or the roles they are meant to fill.The story lost me a bit after about two-thirds, when it veered into so many directions, and focused on the second generation. I didn't much care about any of the characters, at this point, and the story was too all-over-the-place, like lots of loose and electric wires which are never satisfactorily untangled.Despite these gripes, it is a worthwhile read in that it brings up issues that are relevant today still. Smith does not shy away from uglier, controversial topics and throws up questions regarding race, identity, purpose, religion, which most people probably consider at some point or another in their lives. I think I would have preferred this book to have been two volumes, and I might have read only the first one about Archie and Samad.Nonetheless, I can see myself keeping an eye on this author and what else she has on offer.Find more reviews and bookish fun at http://www.princessandpen.com",29,0.9784,0.058,0.808,0.134,0.5031261841606669,NEGATIVE,0.6804

Zadie Smith is a talented author who has so many bright ideas and I feel like I have to read this book over and over again because it is so dense that you have to read it more than once to really appreciate it. Don't get me wrong, this book is not about muslims, it is about cultural diversity in UK in the 20th century from 1907 to 1992. This is the story of two immigrants' families from Bangladesh and Jamaica who try to integrate the english society but it is also the story of a young generation of immigrants who lost their identity completely... This book is very well written, and Zadie Smith has succeeded in describing all the contradictions that we can observe in a muslim society, I totally recognized some members of my family in this book, it was really brilliant !

51,427131525,10/03/2012,4.0,"I first read White Teeth in 2012. I reread it for a reading group discussion in July, 2019. This is what I had to say after the first reading:If literary fiction could always, or at least more often, be as good as this...well, I guess I would be an even more voracious reader than I am. I decided to read White Teeth before I jumped into NW because I read somewhere that both books are set in the same neighborhood of Northwest London. I have not felt as satisfied as I did while reading White Teeth in quite a while--well except for two weeks earlier when I read Telegraph Avenue.In fact the two books have some parallels. Both throw together families of varying backgrounds who are joined together by a friendship between two men. Both are grounded in a neighborhood and poke around into what makes people the way they are.I have only been to London once when I was a teen, but I could see, even smell, the setting of this book. I think watching movies helps, but the descriptions put me there, in the streets, in the apartments, restaurants, bars, and schools.Working class Archie Jones and Bangladeshi Samad Iqbal have been friends since fighting together in World War II, when one saved the other's life. Samad lost the use of one hand and Archie has a piece of metal forever in his thigh. Archie's second wife Clara is the daughter of a Jamaican immigrant who is a devout Jehovah's Witness. Samad's wife came to him via an arranged marriage in the Deshi community. Each man in his own way is bewildered by his offspring as well as by his wife, not to mention the pace of life in the last decade of the century and the millennium. Smith uses multiple viewpoints and various bits of history which she calls ""root canals"" to build the intertwining strands of three families. The children of Archie and Samad get tangled up with a middle class English family, the Chalfens: progressive, liberal, educated idiots with their beliefs in science, psychology and enlightened parenting. They all have white teeth. The each want love, a better life, a belief in something beyond themselves. That sounds serious but they ricochet off each other in the most comic ways. White Teeth is a comedy show and a reality show resting on a keen awareness and observance of the multicultural lives we now lead.Though Zadie Smith takes her time developing the stories of these characters, she begins right off with a sense of tension, maintaining it at a disturbing steadily intensifying rate until the final explosion. Really, I had no idea where she was taking me but went willingly only to have it brought home to me that these root canals are reproduced in every generation.""But first the endgames. Because it seems no matter what you think of them, they must be played, even if, like the independence of India or Jamaica, like the signing of peace treaties or the docking of passenger boats, the end is simply the beginning of an even longer story."" As you can see, I was impressed on that first reading. It turns out I remembered it well but rereading was worth the time spent.  1) I got just as much enjoyment but I understood the ending much better. I was able to see how she accomplished a perfect knitting together and tying up of the multiple threads the story contains. 2) For the other reading group members who struggled with it, some not even finishing it, all of whom pretty thoroughly disliked it, I could sympathize. It is not a novel for everyone though it has all of humanity in it: colonizers, colonized, immigrants, mixed cultures and religions, the privileged, the underprivileged, the old and the young. Perhaps Zadie Smith, like many novelists, tried to put everything in her head into her debut. Still, it got the attention of the literary world and she is having a great career.

52,1840353689,12/15/2016,,"I heard the name Zadie Smith while in my literature graduate program and bookmarked it for when I had far less required reading and more time for introspection. White Teeth was purchased for publication as an unfinished draft while Smith was still in graduate school at Cambridge University. On top of that, comparisons are being tossed around like Dickens, Rushdie, and Irving... suffice to say, I was skeptical and apprehensive about sitting down with the next Great Expectations. And with 400+ pages in front of me, I continued to place the interlocking stories of Archie Jones and Samad Iqbal on the back-burner.Despite Archie and Samad being the central father figures in the beginning of the novel, the narrative soon transitions to focus on Samad's twin sons, Magid and Millat, as well as Archie's similarly-aged daughter Irie. Magid and Millat exist exclusively as foils of one another and as a gesture toward the theme of nature v. nurture... and by extension, genetic cloning as an extension of biological twinning. Magid is sent by father Samad to his ancestral home of Bangladesh when he is 10-years-old; in contrast, Millat remains in London and slowly becomes radicalized into a fundamentalist organization called K.E.V.I.N. (Keepers of the Eternal and Victorious Islamic Nation). Irie, on the other hand, struggles with her identity as half-Jamaican, half-English as her life interweaves with the Iqbal twins.Altogether, this sweeping narrative employed methods of interconnectivity most similar to my reading experience of Cloud Atlas. Similar, too, was my reaction to both of the narratives: I enjoyed the active intertextuality, but I found few elements far too precious or as other critics have described, hyper-realism. I did want an exploration of the postcolonial identities of Asian, Africa, and Caribbean persons dwelling in Northwest London. In many ways, however, the pieces fit too neatly, which I found slightly antithetical to the genre of postcolonialism. Interlocking stories coalesce to the point of... well, not quite absurdity, but certainly improbability. With a similar epic structure, a novel like Yaa Gyasi's Homegoing does include moments that do not mesh with the overall narrative, instead of every instance being significant and at times, heavy-handed. I won't go further in my critique in order to avoid plot-related spoilers. As a quick note, I was taken aback with how much NSFW content was present. (view spoiler)[I do not mind the occasional sex scene but the focus on masturbation dominated some of Samad's narration. (hide spoiler)]All in all, similar content to the Riz MC song Englistan, but not as catchy.

53,1651523180,05/28/2016,4.0,"Thoroughly engaging from start to finish, though the first 50 or so pages were simply stunning (I think the author mentions in a recent essay that she herself finds them overwritten, but I was immediately smitten). That White Teeth was pulled off by a 24 year old is amazing, as it would be a feather in anyone's cap. The novel is perhaps not as audacious (past page 50) sentence-by-sentence as something I'd normally go for (Delillo, Pynchon etc.), but it is a bravura performance nonetheless. Yet the critic James Woods needn't have worried about Zadie Smith, for there is precious little sociological ""hysteria"" in this realism, as the author's verbal dexterity is always deployed in the service of the revelation of character. The way I saw it, the novel is somewhat indebted to Dickens the way Rohinton Mistry's A Fine Balance is indebted to George Eliot, as a spring-board to the revivification of (rather than a bland copying of) an older tradition. I also caught echoes of Martin Amis's locutions, and surely that is not a bad thing. But in the end Smith creates her own style and her own fictional universe out of these influences, as well as one of the most hilarious adjectives I have read in recent memory, ""Chalfenism"", named for an absurdly believable family of over-confident rationalists, and one of the most fully realised set-pieces in an already great book.",13,0.9915,0.018,0.802,0.18,0.5902222222222222,POSITIVE,0.9999

57,1915542703,02/16/2017,4.0,"White Teeth by Zadie Smith tells the story of the turbulent interaction of three dysfunctional families living in England: an Englishman, his Jamaican wife, and their daughter; a couple from Bengal and their twin boys; and an English couple, Joyce and Marcus Chalfen, and their children. Archie Jones and Samad Iqbal, who served together in the military, link the first two families. The Chalfens are drawn into the foray through the children.Smith vividly details the internal and external conflicts plaguing the families. There are the obvious generational conflicts and the conflicts between the colonizer and the colonized. Additionally, the immigrant parents and their children struggle to locate themselves in a culture that is racist and exclusionary. Samad Iqbal wages and ultimately loses the battle to instill in his children pride in their culture and adherence to their religion. Meanwhile his wife, Alsana, constantly undermines and ridicules him. Irie, the daughter of Archie and his Jamaican wife, Clara, struggles with her identity and exhibits signs of internalized racism. Add into the mix an Iqbal son who becomes radicalized; a Jehovah’s witness grandmother; a lesbian cousin; an English woman (Joyce Chalfen) disguising her unwholesome obsession with the handsome, young Millat Iqbal in the garb of “I’m only trying to help him;” her husband incurring the wrath of religious communities for performing genetic experiments on a mouse; stir the pot gently with the struggle for cultural and racial identities, sprinkle generously with institutionalized racism, derogatory language and behaviors, and one begins to get an inkling of the abundant story-lines in the novel. Smith skillfully weaves the disparate threads together uniting them in the crescendo of the final scene.Two qualities in the novel are particularly impressive. The first is Smith’s uncanny ability to capture the dialect, intonation, accent, and diction of each of her characters to reflect their ethnicity, racial heritage, and age group. Smith has an impressive ear for replicating the ebb and flow and pacing of dialog so much so that one can almost overhear the conversations and easily recognize the speaker. But even though some of her characters may share the same cultural heritage, they don’t necessarily express the same concerns. Each emerges as a fully rounded, well-developed, flesh and blood individual with a unique personality and distinct voice.The second impressive quality lies in the voice of the omniscient narrator—sharp, witty, funny, and perceptive. The novel is replete with instances of laugh out loud hilarity. The narrator pokes fun at her characters, punctures their grandiose, ostensible motives for pursuing a course of action or embracing a cause when their real motives usually have to do with feelings of guilt and/or sexual desire. There are plenty of asides to the reader as invitations to share the joke. But while we may laugh at the quirky personalities and their dilemmas, what emerges is the narrator’s love for her characters in spite of—or maybe because of—their struggles, their foibles, their weaknesses, their delusions, and their search for belonging—in other words, those very qualities that make us all human.White Teeth is an engaging, funny, entertaining, and well-crafted multi-cultural novel with true-to-life dialog and flawed characters stepping off its pages in all their richness and diversity.Highly recommended.",12,0.9708,0.091,0.78,0.13,0.4900326797385622,POSITIVE,0.9999
