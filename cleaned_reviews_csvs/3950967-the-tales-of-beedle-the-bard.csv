And muggle Arianna, my daughter, cannot but appreciate the umpteenth bedtime reading on the Rowling's universe. In fact, she listens carefully, wide-eyed, then she giggles, then she gets serious, again she laughs heartily, and so on. In short: the perfect goodnight.""The Wizard and the Hopping Pot"" tale deserves a special mention. It is a quite criticised story by the magical community, due to its bottom line in favour of the muggles. A father teach a lesson to his son, preaching love and tolerance for un-magic people, the muggles, that is to say... ourselves, the readers.And I, muggle for many generations, am so jaelous of all the un-muggles. Damn!Vote: 7,5«C'era una volta un vecchio mago gentile che adoperava la magia con generosità e saggezza a beneficio dei suoi vicini»Direttamente dalla Biblioteca di Hogwarts, commentate nientemeno che dal Professor Silente, arriva una raccolta di storie per giovani maghi e streghe, l'equivalente delle fiabe babbane per bimbi babbani (ossia per bambini non magici). E la babbana Arianna, mia figlia, non può non apprezzare questa ennesima lettura serale sull'universo narrativo della Rowling. E difatti ascolta con attenzione, occhi sgranati, poi sghignazza, poi si fa seria, poi di nuovo ride di cuore, e così via. La buonanotte perfetta.Menzione speciale merita la fiaba ""Il mago e il pentolone salterino"", racconto piuttosto criticato dalla comunità magica per via della morale pro-babbana in esso contenuta. In questa fiaba infatti si predica, attraverso una lezione che impartisce un padre al proprio figlio, amore e tolleranza verso il popolo non magico, i babbani, vale a dire... noi, i lettori.Ed io, babbano da svariate generazioni, provo invidia per tutti i non-babbani.

6,971021581,06/18/2014,1.0,"This didn’t work at all for me. It felt too gimmicky. It felt like it was trying too hard to be part of wizarding universe rather than actually being part of it. Dumbledore’s notes were here in an attempt to guide the reader though in actual fact they just made the experience much worse. They felt more patronising than anything really. That being said, it’s a fun attempt to create a foundation for Rowling’s already vast and complex fantasy world. But I don’t think it needs it. If you look at Tolkien and  The Silmarillion,  that book actually added something to middle earth. It builds upon the groundwork and explores the full history of the writing. It gives you so much more detail. Granted, this is an altogether different creature, but I don’t think it adds much to the wizarding world. There are glimpses of this book through the full Harry Potter series, and we hear about its nature, but I don’t think seeing it here changes much.If anything, my perceptions of the book are lessoned because it just didn’t live up to expectations. It’s supposed to be this legendary book containing dark stories perhaps a bit similar to Grimm’s fairy tales in the real world. Generations and generations of wizards have read it and it is always raved about by the characters. It’s supposed to be something fantastic, and it’s not. It’s a book of very, very, basic stories that do not have the ability to stand on their own feet. It cannot be read in isolation from the main work and it is terribly short lacking any sense of substance or literary merit. All in all, it’s a book written for the strongest of Harry Potter fans. I love the series too, but because of this it doesn’t mean this book is automatically going to receive my admiration.

(Throwback Review) I am one among the lucky generation who were able to queue up in front of the bookshops on the releasing day of the new Harry Potter book to purchase it and finish reading it on the first day itself. If you ask me which are the most valuable books I have, the answer will definitely have the first edition of all the Harry Potter books.This book deals with five fairy tales related to the magical world. The additional notes given by Professor Albus Dumbledore will provide you with a unique reading experience. My favorite, like many other readers, is the tale of three brothers, which was mentioned in Deathly hallows

 “The quest for the elder wand nearly supports an observation I have had occasion to make many times in the course of my life that humans have the knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them.”

I can't believe how much effort J.K. Rowling put into every single aspect of her series, just to make it that much more wonderful. I love how she wove magic into five completely different stories of her own making. This takes so much time, effort, and devotion and I will forever be grateful for all the love that she puts into her books. I will continue to reread these lovely tales whenever I need a little magic in my life. Hopefully in the future I will also read these to my children along with the Harry Potter series.

The five legendary tales in The Tales of Beedle the Bard, took me to the times when I used to hear stories from my grandparents, when I was a kid and they were with me.Most intriguing thing about the stories was that unlike the heroines in the Disney World, the real-life witches had to do their homework in time, so they can acquire the magic, powers and mastery. It is their hardship and their tenderness that led them to gain what they wished for. The stories are not just stories.

Rowling's invention, although in part inspired by The Canterbury Tales) are very nicely composed, what is exceptionally smart about this book is the mise en abyme. It goes something like this: these tales were written by a wizard, by the name of Beedle, some centuries ago; they have been used as bedtime stories by generations of witches and wizards ever since; this volume is a translation from the original text, carried out by none other than Hermione Granger (Harry Potter's friend); also, the book includes a commentary for each of the tales, written by Albus Dumbledore (Hogwarts School's headmaster) himself; the footnotes only are by J.K. Rowling. And, last but not least, these tales (especially the last one) are mentioned in the previous book of the Harry Potter series and reveal the origin of the Deathly Hallows.This device gives a fantastic sense of complexity and reality to these tales.

Dumbledore's comments are obviously 100% biased) - the book is really quite cute. It shouldn't take you much more than 30 minutes to read it but I was expecting a short read(and honestly, my #1 complaint is the binding -t he book just feels awkward, and I am dreading when the spine is obviously cracked open).Spoilers start here:Tale #1: The Wizard and the Hopping Pot: The most obvious morality tale in the book. A young man inherits his father's cauldron and his father's requests for aid from needy (but humble & worthy!) Muggle neighbors, resists with an attitude, and is taught a lesson in charity. I found Dumbledore's notes more interesting than the tale itself.Tale #2: The Fountain of Fair Fortune: Almost a Wizard of Oz-type story; a Muggle Knight and 3 witches quest for their greatest wish to be granted at the Fountain of Fair Fortune, but end up solving their problems on the journey. I really think JKR could have expanded this out into much more of a short story, although it does make sense in the fable/fairy tale format. Really quite cute, and the ""happiest"" of the bunch.Tale #3: The Wizard's Hairy Heart: Obviously the darkest tale; a man turns to the Dark Arts and cuts himself off from enjoying life by literally taking his beating heart out of his chest so he will never be hurt. Dumbledore's notes sort of point towards the ZOMG TERRIBLE HORCRUX IS TERRIBLE idea, but never outright says, so this Tom Riddle kid TOTALLY ate this one up at the Muggle orphanage--OH WAIT, HE TOTALLY DIDN'T.Tale #4: Babbitty Rabbitty and Her Cackling Stump: A really stupid Muggle king wants to wipe out witches and wizards, gets scammed by a con man, but his dishwasher is a real witch and not only stops the persecution but even gets a gold statue through her own cunning. I think this was my least favorite out of the 5.Tale #5: The Tale of the Three Brothers: We know this one from Deathly Hallows, but 3 brothers run into Death, get the Elder Wand, the resurrection stone thing, and the Invisibility Cloak. Brothers 1 and 2 are totally dumb and die pretty quickly, but Brother 3 knows meeting Death is inevitable, but hides and lives into old age. Again, Dumbledore's notes are very vague, and full of, NOW, THIS WAND/STONE BUSINESS IS TOTALLY FOLKLORE (also, can I just say how much the term Deathstick amuses me to no end??) BUT INVISIBILITY CLOAKS RUUUULE. Overall, it's sort of cool to think how these tales might have played into the upbringing of some of the characters. The Weasley kids probably heard all of these 10 million times.Oh, AND! I forgot, my favorite part is when ""Dumbledore"" goes into as close as he can get into a rant about censorship concerning the content of the tales (the Malfoys across the ages are big into banning books). It's even more funny considering HP's history, and the fact that JKR was nice enough to let Dumbledore give the gentle smackdown.",49,-0.3688,0.13,0.737,0.133,0.6287760416666667,NEGATIVE,0.9881

46,186008376,07/18/2011,5.0,"Muggles—the vaguely derogatory term for ""non-magical people""—are well-informed about the spirited acts of princes, princesses, and proletarian polliwogs who populate the fantasies of storytellers of yore such as Charles Perrault, Hans Christian Andersen, and brothers Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, whether through the original scrolls, through meliorative retellings like those in Angela Carter's The Bloody Chamber, through modern-day or futuristic adaptations like Joe Wright's Hanna and Steven Spielberg's AI, or through the popular and endearing Disney bowdlerizations. People of magical means in the world of Harry Potter, on the other hand, are supposedly familiar with the inherently supernatural stories of fifteenth-century author Beedle the Bard. His stories have long been available in the wizarding world in a single volume titled The Tales of Beedle the Bard, and presumably it's a perennial presence in the Daily Prophet bestsellers list.J. K. Rowling, Harry Potter's billionaire biographer, was gracious enough to release an annotated, albeit abridged, version of the collection for Muggle public consumption in 2008, a year after the publication of the last installment in her series of books about the life and times of Harry Potter. The public edition of The Tales of Beedle the Bard authorized by Rowling is notable for having two of the most important figures from the Second Wizarding War (1995-1998) involved in its development. Hermione Granger, a distinguished Muggle-born alumna of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and a confidante of Harry Potter's, translated the tales from their original runes, while Professor Albus Dumbledore, a former Hogwarts headmaster and Harry Potter's eccentric mentor, provided a delightful and insightful commentary on each of the tales included in this slim collection, with clarificatory, intertextual, and metacritical footnotes appended by Rowling.Rowling also supplies her own hand-drawn interior illustrations for the five handpicked tales in the book and, in her usual omniscient and ingratiating authorial tone, a brief introduction to Beedle the Bard (""We know that he was born in Yorkshire, and the only surviving woodcut shows that he had an exceptionally luxuriant beard."") and his body of work. In her preamble she points out a significant difference between Perrault and company's tales and those of Beedle the Bard. ""In Muggle fairy tales,"" she writes, ""magic tends to lie at the root of the hero or heroine's troubles--the wicked witch has poisoned the apple, or put the princess into a hundred years' sleep, or turned the prince into a hideous beast. In The Tales of Beedle the Bard, on the other hand, we meet heroes and heroines who can perform magic themselves, and yet find it hard to solve their problems as we do."" This is because, she concludes, ""magic causes as much trouble as it cures.""And how! In the opening story, The Wizard and the Hopping Pot, an irritable wizard inherits the cauldron used by his recently deceased father in getting rid of their Muggle neighbors' many troubles, ranging from dermal protuberances to missing mules. But in refusing to follow suit, turning his back on every suffering Muggle asking for his assistance, the wizard soon faces some troubles of his own in the way the earthenware heirloom grows a metallic foot and seems to sprout and spew physical and acoustic annoyances that are reflective of his discouraged neighbors' woes. To reveal the ending here and now is scarcely an act of spoiling: it's a predictably happy one, with the wizard skipping alongside the newly slippered pot upon learning a thing or two about tolerance and equality, lessons that are related to the ones imparted on an arrogant Muggle monarch who wants to monopolize magic in the book's penultimate tale, Babbity Rabbity and Her Cackling Stump.The conclusion of the second tale, The Fountain of Fair Fortune, is happy as well, not dissimilar to Disney's classic fairy tale endings, but it cogently conveys a nice twist to the arduous journey taken by the main characters, three crestfallen princesses and a fallen knight, to reach the legendary fountain with cure-all waters. The twist, revealed quietly in the story's final sentence, speaks of the power of persistence and selfless love, the ultimate panacea and undoubtedly Rowling's favorite subject.But lest one suppose that Beedle the Bard's fantastical yarns invariably end in favor of their characters, the remaining two tales offer less auspicious turns of events and resolutions. One merely needs to conjure a mental picture of the ghastly object in the title of the third tale, The Warlock's Hairy Heart, to get an inkling of how fate strikes a dreadful blow not only upon the title character, who in the beginning of the story is only figuratively heartless but soon becomes literally that after locking up his cardiac organ in a chest, but also upon his unfortunate bride-to-be, whose own heart is coveted by her cold-blooded suitor. And the last parable, The Tale of the Three Brothers, while it does not contain an image as repulsive as a beastly beating heart, homes in on a most serious matter: death.Those who have read the final Harry Potter book, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, or seen at least the first part of its film adaptation will recall that The Tale of the Three Brothers plays an integral role in the series' conclusion. It tells of the mysterious deathly hallows themselves and how three brothers of differing ambitions procured them—the Cloak of Invisibility, the Resurrection Stone, and the Elder Wand—from Death after cheating him by way of magic. Before the eventual triumph of Harry Potter over his lifelong adversary, the dark lord Voldemort, it was dismissed within wizarding circles as nothing but a somewhat scary bedtime story. But since the world of Harry Potter is itself a bricolage of myths and legends, it's hardly surprising that in this imagined reality the deathly hallows turn out to be genuine and, in the hands of the self-sacrificing few (e.g. Harry Potter), instrumental in conquering death.The Tale of the Three Brothers is the shortest among the stories in this edition, and probably among all in the Beedle the Bard canon, but in its relative brevity it is more than adequate in making the most lasting remarks on humility, death itself, and human, Muggle or non-Muggle, folly. No wonder it was wise, old Dumbledore's favorite: ""This story made a profound impression on me as a boy. I heard it first from my mother, and it soon became the tale I requested more often than any other at bedtime. This frequently led to arguments with my younger brother, Aberforth, whose favorite story was Grumble the Grubby Goat."" Should Rowling publish a second public edition of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, this unmistakably comical caprine fable would be a very welcome addition.—Originally published on Fully Booked .Me",18,0.7185,0.074,0.844,0.083,0.5463610548472936,POSITIVE,0.9991

This is the book that Hermione Granger inherited from Dumbledore, which played key role in how the end in the series unfolded (prior to the release of The Cursed Child). I particularly enjoyed the commentary by Dumbledore at the end of each story as it showcased his knowledge of both the muggle and wizarding world. With themes of friendship, love, death and other moral topics on these pages, reading this book was also quite thought-provocking (as well as an easy read). I love the format and cover of this book.

However, I don't think it was meant to be. This is a collection of fairy tales, fables. As such, they are not meant to be elaborate in scope or remarkable examples of literary talent. No, these are the tales that wizarding parents can adapt to tell their children at bed-time (remember Ron's dispute with Hermione's translation of one of the tales, haha!) they are meant to be sparse so that various versions can blossom throughout the ages. At heart lies the moral of each story. I believe JK Rowling succeeded in capturing the essence of fables/fairy-tales in terms of style while making the morals relevant not only to her wizarding world but to muggle children, as well. Moreover, her illustrations are lovely and apt. The ""bonus"" for me is Dumbledore's commentary on the tales. How splendid to hear more from the beloved Hogwarts Headmaster. Often humorous, always insightful, the commentary reveals a little more of Dumbledore's character as well as some deeper insights into the wizarding world that compliment Harry's story well (i.e., wand lore, wizard vs. muggle relations) and even just some smaller questions that were never resolved in the novels (i.e., the difference between a wizard and a warlock). I bought the special edition and am not at all sorry. It's beautiful! Despite some of the less-than-stellar reviews for this story, I still highly recommend it in either version for true HP fans. Don't go into it expecting something of equal depth, scope or style to the novels. Approach it as you would a collection of OUR fairy-tales. Then, picture Mrs. Weasley telling the tale of Babbity Rabbity to Ron and his siblings, and you'll smile and be well satisfied! :-)",14,0.9965,0.025,0.772,0.204,0.6831696428571429,NEGATIVE,0.8194

73,100455531,04/28/2010,4.0,"The Tales of Beedle the Bard contains some of JK Rowling’s best writing. When she is imagining her fantasy world beyond the confines of Hogwarts – building wizarding history, culture, sport, biology, and hierarchies – her voice becomes incandescent, lighting up the lives of anyone who takes joy in her creations with a simulacrum of life that feels more like a tangible reality than our collective fantasy.The fables in The Tales of Beedle the Bard are a gorgeous part of Rowling’s conjuring act, and some of her most original work in the Potter world. All five of the tales are strong, maintaining the tradition of brutality and bloodiness that Muggle fairy tales are so steeped in, staunchly refusing to write from a position of political correctness and delivering morals that are as universal as anything Aesop ever spoke. My two favourites have to be The Warlock’s Hairy Heart & The Fountain of Fair Fortune. The former is a nasty tale of a Warlock who vows never to fall in love, so he removes his own heart and encases it in a crystal casket where it becomes hairy and twisted and black. The latter is a beautiful tale of three witches and a Muggle Knight who discover that they already have what they thought they lacked. They are simple, lovely, compelling little tales that are better than most everything written by the Brothers Grimm, and are just as good as the beautiful writing of Hans Christian Anderson. But the real triumph of The Tales of Beedle the Bard isn’t the stories themselves but the commentary by one Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore. It is Rowling’s world building at its very best. Dumbledore reveals the cultural significance of the tales, offers little drops of Wizarding history that connect us back to the proper Harry Potter books, and sheds some more light on the Deathly Hallows – all with a gentle touch that is the hallmark of the world’s greatest wizard. I think if I were just starting to read the Potter books now, I would want to start with The Tales of Beedle the Bard, and I’d come back to it again and again. Oh well ... too late for me.

Though each story has its own special charms and captures the spirit of oral story telling that makes fairy tales enjoyable today, each story also reiterates a moral that has already been developed more completely and persuasively in the Harry Potter novels. (Don't be racist, treat others as you would want to be treated, be careful what you wish for...etc.)In one of the most frustrating elements, Rowling follows each story with ""the annotated commentary of Albus Dumbledore"". Hearing the author's personal criticism through the voice of her most insightful character should be insightful and instructive. Instead, it's simply a superficial series of irrelevant in-jokes, like a fatuous DVD commentary that allows the director to laugh at memories rather than provide greater understanding to their audience.On the whole, it's nice to have another addition to the Potter canon, but it's also nowhere close to the standard set by the original series.",11,0.9078,0.028,0.846,0.127,0.5464285714285714,NEGATIVE,0.9676

1st read in October 2014
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐/5 (8.75/10)The Tales of Beedle the Bard are extraordinary clever and magical stories. As usual, Rowling’s writing is superb. I really enjoyed the children’s stories, they are full with wise life lessons and things I ought to remember. Professor Dumbledore’s notes were really helpful and interesting. They showed some insight on both the stories and his character. The notes gave me an inkling that he was slightly arrogant. The manner in which he wrote and the footnotes at the end of a page made him seem slightly pompous.

The length made me think Rowling was just trying to juice out more from the HP series (which is true to a certain extent but...) but she did an excellent job like she always does.You can tell she knows this world inside and out. We even find out other tidbits about the wizarding world. The book is compromised of what we would call fairy tales. The fairy tales were typical but with the wizard component in it. While I was reading it I kept thinking I could actually tell these tales to my kids one day; just like telling Jack and the Beanstalk or Red Riding Hood. It was a welcome sight to see Dumbledore's commentary on the tales. I kind of missed him from the 7th HP book, so it was fun to see what he had to say.It's too hard for me to pick a favorite.

100,3652761659,11/22/2020,4.0,"To come full circle in my J.K. Rowling/Harry Potter reading adventure, I sought to look back at some of the tales that young witches and wizards might have heard in their childhood. Many of these pieces are referred to throughout the Harry Potter stories, at least in passing, though I chose to take some time to explore them a little further. With the help of Hermione Granger—who translated them from runes—and Albus Dumbledore—whose commentary provided a mere Muggle like myself with some context—I was able to make my way through these short pieces with relative ease. I can only hope others are as successful.Beedle the Bard is a master storyteller, whose pieces serve to offer entertainment to the young reader. While some stories are delightfully fun, such as The Wizard and the Hopping Pot, others are much darker and full of spooky narrative twists. One might refer to The Tale of the Three Brothers to see something that might not be as inviting for bedtime reading. The five tales found in this collection offer not only highly imaginative stories that beg the reader/listener to conjure up images of what is being recounted, but also provide strong morals needed to shape the mind of the young. These are tales whose impact deepens the more they are read and one can hope Beedle knew this when putting quill to parchment.As is noted in the introduction, this collection parallels what Muggles might call favoured fairy tales. Much like the tales that are told to young humans, there is a sanitised version for the younger reader, as well as the true version Beedle authored for full impact. Think of the Brothers Grimm and their gruesome depictions that are known to Muggles only when they grow up, if ever. The impact of the morals are significant to the open minded reader, as is the curiosity of those who paid close attention in all the Harry Potter stories and seek some context. Before undertaking the translation efforts, Hermione was as clueless as Harry about these pieces, having surpassed the knee height of a grasshopper outside the wizarding world. While Neo has yet to read these five tales, I will encourage him to do so and hope that he will draw from them something long-lasting. The Dumbledore commentary is essential for Muggles to better comprehend the piece and serves as a great contextual guide to obtain the full meaning. Brilliantly authored!Kudos, Madam Rowling and Bard Beedle, for providing a lowly Muggle with some better understanding of a world I have only seen through eight Potter stories that span twenty-six glorious years!Love/hate the review?

To hurt is as human as to breathe.”“There were once three brothers who were traveling along a lonely, winding road at twilight.”I was thinking that these books were harsh if they were meant for children but then I remembered what our ‘muggle’ fairy tales are no better – I mean just look at The Brothers Grimm’s tales and you’ll see.",7,0.9564,0.083,0.733,0.183,0.6055335097001762,POSITIVE,0.9997
134,1825755033,12/01/2016,3.0,"J.K. Rowling has consistently spread misinformation about trans people and trans activism. I do not stand for any of her ignorant and hurtful statements and stand in solidarity with all trans people. Trans women are women. End of the discussion! I will no longer support her financially by picking up her books or give her my platform by talking about them on my channel. I would encourage other people to stop supporting her financially and/or giving her a platform as well.Here are some ways in which you can support trans people: 1) More protection for Black Trans Women UK, 2) Donate to These Orgs to Support Black Trans People and 3) Homeless Black Trans women fund. //Favorite quote: 'Magic causes as much trouble as it cures.'I actually liked the structure of this book: we got the short stories first and then Dumbledore's commentary — though I wished his commentary would have been more insightful and interesting, but nonetheless, it’s still better than nothing. Here are some quick notes on every chapter: Introduction:— Hermione blatantly states that Harry was Dumbledore's favorite student; that weirded me out a little bit and shouldn't be a published “fact” because it’s just Hermione’s subjective view, right? — Sir Nicolas got beheaded by muggles during a witch hunt; he lost his wand and couldn't defend himself, the poor man! <3Story I: The Wizard and the Hopping Pot— very pro-muggle message (= wizards should help them), which I likedStory II: The Fountain of Fair Fortune— my favorite story; beautifully written and has a great message; I loved how empowered the witches in this were and that they were all willing to give up bathing in that fountain as soon as their problems were solved through other means - ICONIC— the ending was perfect: ""None of them ever knew or suspected that the Fountain's Water carried no enchantment at all.”— Dumbledore recounts a very funny attempt of a Hogwarts play (by students, initiated by the drama teacher) which failed miserably because there was jealousy between the students — WE LOVE TO SEE IT (also who is the drama teacher again?) — Kettleburn (Hagrid's predecessor as professor for Care for Magical Creatures) is just as crazy about dangerous beasts as Hagrid is, and it's absolutely golden — it kinda shows why Dumbledore is so chill about weird ass teachers (…or at least that he always has been)Story III: The Warlock's Hairy Heart— this one was creepy: a warlock wants to remain uninfected by love so he rips his heart out (I mean … MOOD). Then, a maiden makes him put the heart back in, and he is so overcome by emotion that he kills the two of them (I mean … WHAT?)— also, Animagi cannot retain the capability of human speech when metamorphosedStory IV: Babbity Rabbity and Her Cackling Stump— it wasn't as funny as I remembered / wanted it to be— Babbity manages to trick a foolish king (who wants to do magic) into abolishing the witch hunt in his countryStory V: The Tale of the Three Brothers— beautifully written and well crafted— we learn that it's wizarding tradition to bury the wand with ist owner or to burn the wand after the owner's death (=> wands aren't passed on)— ""No witch has ever claimed to own the Elder Wand. Make of that what you will."" -> kinda love that this was written by Dumbledore (…who is, in fact, in possession of said wand)",7,0.9914,0.11,0.729,0.161,0.5962554112554114,NEGATIVE,0.9451
135,28867871,07/31/2008,5.0,"I'm actually quite pleased with this collection of Beedle the Bard's five fairy-tales and Dumbledore's corresponding comments.True, the stories are not very long or detailed, but I didn't feel they should be, because they are supposed to be fairy-tales that wizarding families read to their children as we would read Cinderella or Snow White. I thought the style was quite fitting (if a little gruesome on a few of the stories), and the art work is lovely!It's delightful to think of Ron and his siblings hearing ""Babbity Rabbity"" before bed at the Burrow, or to think of Hermione translating the runes. For those who have finished HP7, reading the final story, and Dumbledore's comments, will be especially interesting (even if not too informative) but interesting nonetheless, and any insight into Harry's world is more than welcomed!One of my favorite parts is the footnotes, added by both Dumbledore and JK Rowling. This, in addition to Dumbledore's insightful and amusing commentary, gives interesting clues to the Wizarding world - such as the difference between a Warlock and a Wizard, and just how Lucius Malfoy and Dumbeldore's long dislike for each other startd.My favorite of the tales is the second, I think. It was probably the happiest and most tame, but also had such a sweet message.If you're a Harry Potter fan, I think you'll find this enjoyable on many levels, and for such a small book, there really is quite a lot packed inside.Happy Reading!I'm so happy to finally be reading this!

So I picked it up and read it.I was delighted to have enjoyed it as much as I have. I knew that Rowling was a fantastic writer, but I never thought I’d be much interested in a small collection of fictional fairy tales. These are children’s tales told by fictional wizard parents to fictional wizard children in the Hogwarts-Harry Potter Universe, and I didn’t expect much except a passing curiosity.The stories are short, very short. But they’re told with wit and humor, as well as packing a moral to be learned with the telling. Even more interesting than the stories themselves are the notes compiled by Albus Dumbledore and the editorial notes to his notes by Rowling herself.These notes give the entire project a strong sense of realism. Not that the events of the stories are real, but that the histories of the stories and the world they exist in are real. Which they aren’t. But it seems like, maybe…In short, this little volume is a brilliant addition to the world-building that we’ve seen from J.K. Rowling over the years. There is much more to all of this than a simple series of “kids books”.",7,0.9848,0.0,0.872,0.128,0.4397089947089947,POSITIVE,1.0

There are five children's tales with a fairytale vibe in The Tales of Beedle the Bard, some better than others, and each has a section dedicated to Dumbledore's true understanding of the story, with a little background reading on the history of some of the magic or creatures within. The illustrations are unquestionably the hero of Beedle's tales, bursting with colour and comedy and since I am far beyond the years of needing a fairy tale bedtime story to send me off to sleep that's lucky because the stories themselves were of little excitement. The better known Tale of the Three Brothers is, of course, the story you're all really in it for though and is absolutely the stand out within the collection. I liked to unashamedly imagine I was Hermione trying to figure out why Dumbledore left me a book as a rubbish clue to Voldemort's demise, and there is genuine insight to be gained from reading this story alongside the Deathly Hallows.

It's not meant to be a fairytale book for kids, universally. It's meant to be a book which gives the Harry Potter reader or fan more insight into the lore and biases which govern the wizarding world. It should help us understand both the tales with which magical kids grow up, and the politics that contest everything, especially the ethereal world of fairytales.

And the most important story was The Tale of The Three Brothers.Each story came with further insight from none other than Albus Dumbledore. Which included great value to the book. Also there were little JK.Rowling info injections. As a whole it was a great experience. It was cleverly written, nicely self criticized and well purposed.

I have learned to accept my fate as a Mudblood, But, there's still a part of me that wanted to learn more about wizards, witches and wands. Sure, I've met Harry, Hermione and Ron. I've pledged my allegiance to Gryffindor and Albus Dumbledore. I've studied Harry's fate through Philosopher's Stone up to Deathly Hallows. But I still wanted to learn more. A fellow Mudblood gifted me this book, The Tales of Beedle the Bard and I couldn't have been happier. I read this book with my kids who were very excited to learn more about witchcrafts and wizardry. Touted as the equivalent to Muggle's Brothers Grimm, I thought ""finally, I'm gonna learn about the wizards' very own version of fairy tales."" Only there were no fairies nor princesses and flying Peter Pan in their stories. The Tales in this book are short, enticing, a little dark and amusing. My kids liked The Fountain of Fair Fortune the most, because it showed how the lack of magical powers could still bring fortune to those who strive and pursue their goals. Me, my personal favorite was The Tale of Three Brothers especially the last brother's story because he was wise and mature even though he was the youngest among the brood. There was also the other tales which me and my children weren't too happy about, like The Warlock’s Hairy Heart, which kind of reminded me of Romeo and Juliet's tragic fate. In my honest opinion, after reading all the tales and reviews by Albus Dumbledore himself, I realized in the end, I would still love to peruse Disney stories and their Happily Ever Afters.

For us, Muggles, we consider fairy tales as stories where we could find most of our values from; where a simple story brought millions of lessons (The three little pigs, for example).As a Potterhead (Harry Potter Fan), my favorite Beedle story is 'The Tales of the Three Brothers"" where the Deathly Hallows came from. It is a story of three brothers who, travelling together, reach a treacherous river. Being wizards, they make a magical bridge over the river. Halfway across the bridge, they meet Death who is angry for losing three potential victims of the river. He pretends to be impressed by them and grants each a wish as a reward. The eldest brother asks for an unbeatable wand which will always grant him victory, so Death carves the Elder Wand from a nearby tree. The middle brother asks for the ability to call back the dead because the women he loved is dead, so Death gives him a stone from the river called the Resurrection Stone. The youngest and smartest brother doesn't trust Death and asks for something that could hide him from the eyes of Death himself, so Death reluctantly gives him his Cloak of Invisibility. Afterwards, the brothers go their separate ways.The eldest brother, bragging about his powerful wand, is robbed of it by a man and murdered while he is asleep. The middle brother uses his ability to bring back the woman he loved, who died before he could marry her. However, she is not fully alive and is full of sorrow. He kills himself to join her. So death takes the first two brothers for his own. As for the youngest brother, Death never manages to find him, as he stays hidden under his Cloak. Many years later, the brother removes his cloak and gives it to his son. Pleased with his achievements, he greets Death as an old friend and chooses to leave with him as equals.

'Magic causes as much trouble as it cures.'
The Tales of Beedle the Bard are five short children's stories that warm your heart and bring you so much closer to the Wizarding world. We first heard about The Tales of Beedle the Bard in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, but now there are four more classic children's tales that I got to experience reading and I loved every second. All have been translated by Hermione Granger and have wonderful commentary by Albus Dumbledore. I couldn't have wished for a better addition to my Harry Potter collection. The five stories included within The Tales of Beedle the Bard are: “The Wizard and the Hopping Pot,” “The Fountain of Fair Fortune,” “The Warlock’s Hairy Heart,” “Babbitty Rabbitty and Her Cackling Stump,” and our all time favourite “The Tale of the Three Brothers.” I love the details added by Albus and the small footnotes by J.K. Rowling, there is nothing more exciting than diving back into a world you love so I was so excited to add this to my #HPWeekendAThon TBR! Challenge five was Hagrid: A comfort read! and The Tales of Beedle the Bard definitely exceeded all of my expectations. I would recommend this one to anyone who loves J.K Rowling, the Wizarding world, and of course Harry Potter!

There has never really been a dull moment in any of her novels. I was excited to read this one too, hoping to feel some of that ol' Harry Potter magic, but I must say, this collection is just sort of lackluster.First of all, every single little tale, I think there's four or five, seems more like a summary of a story than an actual story. There isn't very much depth in any of them, and I get they're supposed to be fairy tales for children, so I guess it was probably done intentionally. But the early Harry Potter books are for children and I don't feel this way towards those! So after the short little summary stories, there is another sort of summary/analysis done by Dumbledore, which sounds fun, but actually kind of cheapens the stories. It makes you feel like there isn't really a whole lot of need to take in the story and analyze it yourself, because Dumbledore will tell you everything the author meant to do. I found myself wishing that instead of Dumbledore summarizing the background and history of where the story came from and how people reacted to it, I was just reading whatever he was talking about in story form. JK Rowling has one of the most creative literary minds of all time, and I feel like she wasted some good stories and imagination on what seems like a quick cash in.

At the same time, the reader gains deeper knowledge of the magical world, it's legends and history, and also, a little, about the relationships between Muggles and Wizards.

232,2375306456,04/28/2018,4.0,"Here is a set of Chinese boxes, fitting intricately one inside the other. As the title implies, a fifteenth-century bard called Beedle is said to have written them down in runes, subsequently translated by ""the brightest witch of her age,"" Hermione Granger. The translation is itself nested within Albus Dumbledore's footnotes, then bookended by Jo Rowling's Introduction (the author added illustrations and additional footnotes) and by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne's missive about the Children's High Level Group charity which supports over a quarter of a million vulnerable children in residential homes across Europe.Bearing in mind the NGO's compassionate aims it's unsurprising that most of these five tales aren't simply about fantasy or magic (though of course these are present); like many fairytales they are implicitly advocating charitable attitudes and ethical behaviour -- in short, common humanity.Learning to soften one's heart is the message from 'The Wizard and the Hopping Pot', while 'The Fountain of Fair Fortune' promotes cooperative behaviour for the benefit of all. Dumbledore characterised the first two tales as being about generosity, tolerance and love but suggested that 'The Warlock's Hairy Heart' is about guarding against ""the greatest, and least acknowledged, temptations of magic: the quest for invulnerability."" One need not add that it's not just magic that tempts individuals to seek that sense of invulnerability: the possession of both power and money has itself been an irresistible incentive for some.The final two tales deal with perhaps life's greatest human mystery: death. 'Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump' underlines the fact that no-one can bring the dead back to life, a truth that's reiterated in 'The Tale of the Three Brothers'. This latter was alluded to in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and brilliantly animated in Part I of the filmed version. As we all know by now, the interlaced triangle, circle and line symbol represents the Cloak of Invisibility, a stone to bring back the dead and the unbeatable Elder Wand.What of the tales themselves? Rowling (for in truth she is ""the onlie begetter"" of these pieces) has managed to conjure up five short stories which are in the great tradition of literary fables or fairytales. The pace, like Goldilock's purloined porridge, is just right (not too long, not too short) and the tropes are all in place (three witches or three brothers, magical objects, quests, the lowliest raised up, and so on). There is humour and there is melancholy, poetic justice and repeated refrains. There are wizards and witches, warlocks and fake magicians, there is a foolish king, a dismal-looking knight and there is Death. And, leavening it all, there are Albus Dumbledore's footnotes, with comments both enlightening and tangential -- who can forget, once they've read it, his description of the disastrous Hogwarts pantomime?What of the eponymous Beedle? Perhaps Rowling took the name from a traditional medieval official whose anachronistic office has survived into modern times: a beadle was originally someone who summoned others to a meeting, a herald or even a messenger. A bard of course is a minstrel or poet; the two juxtaposed names strongly signify the important role of the teller of tales, oral or literary, a role that Rowling has been singularly successful at. Like all good fantasy, these pieces tell essential truths; and Rowling quotes Dumbledore's advice to Harry Potter about truth:'It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution.'If there is a criticism then it's not a literary one. This UK mass market edition (there have others since) features the author's own line drawings. These, while charming in their way, add little to the quality of the writing and would have served better as preparatory sketches to guide a professional artist for the published work. But it's nice to see Rowling's own vision of how the tales should be presented.",6,0.9964,0.075,0.757,0.168,0.5580220734126985,POSITIVE,0.9858

“The heroes and heroines who triumph in his stories are not those with the most powerful magic, but rather those who demonstrate the most kindness, common sense and ingenuity.”
(view spoiler)[Those who follow my blog will know that the Harry Potter series was one of my favorite reads when I was growing up and I still love rereading them whenever I have the chance. I' ve read some of the novellas as well, but somehow I've never read The Tales Of Beedle The Bard before. While it still shows that J.K. Rowling is behind the short stories, I didn't think they were as good as the main series. Sure, they are entertaining enough and I enjoyed reading Dumbledore's commentary, but they didn't reach the same level as the actual books. If you are a Harry Potter fan and cannot get enough of the series, you will most likely enjoy this short and fast read though.The Tales of Beedle the Bard is a collection of short fairy tales set in the wizard world of Harry Potter and his friends. The collection is famous among wizards and parents have been telling them to their children during centuries. Hermione Granger has newly translated them from the ancient runes and an extensive commentary by Albus Dumbledore has been added. “The Wizard and the Hopping Pot”, “The Fountain of Fair Fortune”, “The Warlock’s Hairy Heart”, “Babbitty Rabbitty and Her Cackling Stump” and the famous “The Tale of the Three Brothers”; they are all included in this collection.The Tales Of Beedle The Bard is basically a collection of the wizard version of a few old fairy tales. Professor Dumbledore gives his commentary after each story, although it tells little new for those who have already finished the series. I understand why J.K. Rowling would have published this novella (millions and millions of us have probably bought it over the years), but I wish she would have written more fairy tales or given us more details of what happens to the main characters... Although that would probably never happen. Nevertheless if you enjoyed the Harry Potter series and don't want to say goodbye to their magical world just yet, this might be an entertaining read for you. (hide spoiler)]

250,1948447744,05/06/2017,5.0,"J. K. Rowling wrote this, what is not to like about it? She proves, once more, what a genius and great writer she is, letting us be a part of this amazing Wizarding World, taking us not only to know the classic fairytales that are usually told to kids, but also meet Albus Dumbledore again, and read his personal notes on some of the tales, always funny and with his own personal style. Of course, do not forget, that we are able to read them because of Hermione Granger’s translation of the runes in which the original versions of the tales were written. And there’s also little mentions, here and there, of characters from the original saga, like Lucius Malfoy (and apparently, their hate and contempt towards muggle-borns can be tracked back for generations, to a man named Brutus Malfoy, who had no qualms about speaking his mind, honoring his name and his future descendants with his cruelty and terrible ideas about what, in his opinions, muggles deserved).The book includes just five, short stories, and one of the best parts is that they do not feature mild, foolish heroines who wait to be rescued, nor all-powerful heroes in shining armors, but true, deep considerations and metaphors of human nature, which reminds me a quote from Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix:“We've all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to act on. That's who we really are.” (Sirius Black)Stories like The Wizard and the Hopping Pot and The Warlock's Hairy Heart are those in which that can be seen very clearly, just like in The Tale of the Three Brothers, probably the most famous of Beedle’s tales, thanks to Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. The stories have those simple, even funny titles, but do not let them fool you. All them go deeper than they suggest, and the whole book, including Dumbledore’s notes, are full of Rowling’s clever, unique phrases she normally uses to tease us, and makes us laugh out loud, like with Beatrix Bloxam’s sweetened versions of the stories, I cracked up, and couldn’t stop! Rowling is a master for that kind of things! She has a subtle way to write humor as no author I’ve ever read, and I love her for that (and for many other things too).Here, once again, our most beloved Joan does what she does best, and opens the door to this secret world to let us be a part of it in one of its most classic, everyday aspects, as it is bedtime stories. She’s my overall favorite author, and what her stories did in my life is not something I can easily explain. She’s a must-read. I don’t care how old you are, you MUST read J. K. Rowling’s work, or you will miss one of the best, most complex, magical, and wonderful worlds that were ever created!",4,0.9961,0.087,0.731,0.182,0.5473091458805744,POSITIVE,0.9991

Rowling has written this wonderful collection of fairytales for witches and wizards. It's a Brothers Grimm-like stroll through tales that teach lessons, not only to children but to adults, too. For us Muggle readers, it's a nice treat.The Wizard And The Hopping PotA kind old wizard uses his magical skills to help his Muggle neighbors. But when he dies, his son inherits an old cooking pot, not knowing it will soon teach him a lesson he will never forget. Here, Rowlings also provides a history lesson in the fear that those with magic had to endure during the middle ages when their Muggle acquaintances would routinely watch the purebloods burn at the stake. Great start to the book.The Fountain Of Fair FortuneThere was a fountain that was enclosed by large walls and protected by magic. Once a year, between the hours of sunrise and sunset on the longest day, a single unfortunate was given the chance to fight their way to the Fountain, bathe in its waters, and receive Fair Fortune forevermore. This is a tale that can apply to anyone. Self-helpish.The Warlock's Hairy HeartWhen a Warlock sees friends lose themselves over love affairs, he resolves to never allow that to happen to him. This was the most Brothers Grimm-ish of the tales. It delivers a sharpness that takes the reader off-balance. Whoop, there it is.Babbitty Rabbitty And Her Cackling StumpA king wants to learn magic and a con-man becomes the royal instructor. This is very much a be-careful-what-you-wish-for story.The Tale Of The Three BrothersThis is the last selection and the most known one, as it was in a Harry Potter movie. This is also my most, most favorite tale of all these terrific tales. I loved this book. As with Tolkien, Rowlings has created a world that goes beyond Harry and his friends.

“Magic causes as much trouble as it cures.”
4.5 stars.As you must have guessed by now, if you know me, I adore fairytales of all kinds especially retellings or original fairytales from another world or series and the likes. These tales are no different. Ever since Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was released back in that summer of 2007, and inside concerned the particular Tale of The Three Brothers--there was something truly whimsical there to be had. I was even more excited when there was an actual book that contained this fairytale and a few other wizarding ones. Unfortunately at the time it was for charity--really glad, but I also was sad that I wouldn't get introduced to whatever other fantastical fairytales there were to be had from the HP world.Thankfully that wasn't the case seeing how I now have this copy now, huh? :'DI'm even more grateful to know that each of these books that are purchased actually goes towards a charity--the Lumos charity of the Children's High Level Group.Also, I really adored all the extra stuff that went along with this book besides the fairytales themselves. Dumbledore's commentary attached to each of these fairytales provide more insight into them in a better way than we could imagine and even gives us an idea of how it was like to create these kinds of fairytales in the wizarding world. Especially if you consider when Beedle the Bard would have published these stories in the 15th Century (I believe?), some of these stories are ahead of their time and full of controversies.Next time if you feel up to reading fairytales crafted for witches and wizards, give the Tales of Beedle the Bard a try. ;D

254,29385280,08/05/2008,3.0,"I have to admit...this book was bought purely for sentimental reasons. I was at the tail-end of July’ 11 (unofficially termed as *Harry Potter Month*) and had exhausted all my available resources of Potter memorabilia. I had desisted for long and now, I ordered it with the sole intention of treating it as a cherished keepsake.I still get a smile on my face when I remember Hermione being handed over the book as per Dumbledore’s will and Ron piping in excitedly “Babbity Rabbity And Her Cackling Stump!”, only to be greeted by vacant stares from both Harry and (surprisingly enough) Hermione. The book was basically popular bedtime reading for young witches and wizards, which explains why the usually gormless Ron was so familiar with it. 
The Tales of Beedle The Bard
 is a fairly thin volume that contains five fairy tales from the Wizarding World. Accompanying them are the tongue-in-cheek notes of Prof.Dumbledore. Having a slightly more morbid edge when compared to normal (read:muggle) fairy tales, the stories still weave in wise homilies. My favourite tale has always been “The Tale of The Three Brothers” (especially after watching the brilliant bit of goose-bump inducing animation in the movie) and I’m embarrassed to say that I read it out loud for the sheer pleasure of doing so. This is purely an indulgence for Potter fans and must be read in the same spirit.",4,0.9725,0.02,0.86,0.119,0.629,NEGATIVE,0.8538

I've read it a couple of times in the past, and I've always found Dumbledore's little essays to be taxing, but this time around I found them delightful. I don't know what's changed with me, but this was a far more enjoyable reading experience this time around. I also took my time with the collection, reading only one story a day, and letting myself dwell on that story, and really appreciate each one for what it was. I really like the Fountain of Fair Fortune (the essay it was paired with in particular) and Babbitty Rabbitty and Her Cackling Stump (which was amusing on it's own and great when paired with the essay). The Tale of the Three Brothers was the most familiar, since it's connected with the main series, and so I wasn't overly fussed on it either way, though the bits about wand-lore were kind of interesting. And The Wizard and the Hopping Pot reminded me of Aesop's Fables in the way the story was told, which I really appreciated, even in the story wasn't my favourite. The Warlock's Hairy Heart was my least favourite, though I did enjoy the Poe-esque feel to the story.Overall, a very enjoyable read, and I'm very glad that I picked it up again, since this experience was so nice compared to my past ones.",4,0.9962,0.0,0.771,0.229,0.618395061728395,POSITIVE,0.9997
256,1505745343,01/11/2016,5.0,"Several years ago, when I had just turned old enough to wait for my Hogwarts letter, but soon learned that Errol must've been the one to deliver it (figures, right?), I wandered a library. Mere months before, I had finished the seventh Harry Potter book, and since then, had thrust myself into Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson & the Olympians series. But once I'd finished that, I read nearly every Harry Potter book yet again, and was thus hungry for more of Rowling's magnificent world. So it was quite a delightful feeling when that tiny, eleven-year-old me wandered the library, fingers brushing across the spines of old books, and ran across The Tales of Beedle the Bard.Needless to say, I love this book. Whenever I feel the need for a brief return to the wizarding world, this is the collection I crack open.Filled with whimsical, original fairytales and Albus Dumbledore's commentaries relating to them, The Tales of Beedle the Bard is a beautiful set of stories with bits of moral value.

 “Quite by accident, my little ear fell against the keyhole.""
Favourite quote of the whole book, right there.This I enjoyed much more than Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them because, first, who doesn't love fairy-tales.. Secondly, it was engaging, I really loved each tale and Dumbledore's notes and opinions on them. I found it really interesting, and I also got to know more about the wizarding world, which is always amazing. While Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a textbook, with no plot whatsoever.Also, a very important thing when it comes to books: I could easily imagine everything and with HP books I could always do that, which I really appreciate. The whole time reading it I felt like being a child waiting for her letter from Hogwarts (which I still do btw..) and being read these tales each and every night.

Beautiful illustrations and drawings kept me smiley as the pages went on.I definitely recommend it to Harry Potter lovers and to those who merely enjoyed the other Harry Potter companion books. When it comes to me, I think this is the best Harry Potter companion book, as it's not an encyclopedia (like 'Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them' was) or a historic examination of a sport (like 'Quidditch Through The Ages' was).Overall, 5 out of 5 stars, as it's an artistic and literature masterpiece.

Don't get me wrong; I love Cinderella and rather enjoy Sleeping Beauty as well (at least I really like the Disney movies for each, including the newer real person version of Cinderella), but that's just a fantastic quote.

To hurt is as human as to breathe.""I'm not sure why but that line stuck with me. It seems the point of Beedle's tales are that this is just life so to try and change or prevent such pain with magic is, essentially, pointless. J.K. Rowling never fails to create such beautiful and dark worlds of magic and fantasy.Absolutely loved it!",4,0.5978,0.159,0.663,0.178,0.5863591269841271,POSITIVE,0.9476
