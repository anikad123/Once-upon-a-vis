Due to the large number of negative comments I've received, including death wishes, I've added the following request:Please do not take this review (or yourself) too seriously when reading it.
I became what I am today at the age of twenty-nine, on a frigid overcast day in the winter of 2008. What I am about to tell you about what I became is going to be very shocking. It is going to manipulate your emotions. It may include some random words in my native language for no reason whatsoever. It will teach you unnecessary things about my culture. It will not be smarter than a fifth grader. And it will include as many cliches and as much foreshadowing as is humanly possible. You are going to be shocked. I, for one, never saw it coming. So I doubt you will. Get ready. Aren't you so ready to be shocked? You're never going to see this coming.What comes next is the big revelation, so get ready!Wait, I need to ask you something first. Did you know that the Irish like potatoes? Yeah, we really enjoy them. And alcohol too. It's pretty great. Erin Go Bragh! This means Ireland Forever! Unfortunately, you will be very sad to know that my father just died due to an Irish car bomb. Well, about 15 of them to be exact. All on an empty stomach! It makes me sad and you should feel sad too, kind reader.Ok, on to the big reveal. Here it is:On that frigid overcast day, which happened to be the day that I decided to quit reading The Kite Runner, I became a book snob. Because The Kite Runner is adored by most people who read it, I am forced to conclude that most people need to read more. A whole lot more. You should be embarrassed if you like this book. Seriously. The moment I became a book snob (shortly after ""The Scene""), I became so embarrassed to be seen reading it that I accused the guy sitting next to me on the subway of putting the book on my lap while I wasn't paying attention. ""How dare you, sir! Have you no decency?"" I exclaimed excitedly in my native language. Then I noticed a monkey on the platform waiting to board a train. I quickly hopped off my train, ran to him, handed him the book, and said ""Top O' the Mornin' to ya! Enjoy!""Later that day, I saw that monkey flying a kite in front of the Washington Monument. I noticed that the glass string wasn't making his hands bloody. Do you know why? He was wearing gloves. ---------------------------------------------------------------Please note that I have absolutely no appreciation for life and reality.**Bart Bondeson, who claims to be ""a better person for having read this book,"" suggested that I make this clarification to my review. Thanks for the suggestion, Bart! Hopefully that clears things up for those who were wondering.",1655,-0.9648,0.135,0.768,0.097,0.514726631393298,NEGATIVE,1.0
2,8947952,11/10/2007,1.0,"Finished this book about a month ago but it's taken me this long to write a review about it because I have such mixed feelings about it. It was a deeply affecting novel, but mostly not in a good way. I really wanted to like it, but the more I think about what I didn't like about the book, the more it bothers me. I even downgraded this review from two stars to one from the time I started writing it to the time I finished.Let's start off with the good, shall we? The writing itself was pretty good when it comes to description, in that I really felt the author's descriptions of scenes, and in terms of moving the story forward. That said, it's not particularly challenging writing to read.The very best part of the novel is its warm depiction of the mixed culture of Afghanistan, and how it conveys the picture of a real Afghanistan as a living place, before the coup, the Soviet invasion, and above all, the Taliban and the aftermath of September 11th created a fossilized image in the US of a failed state, petrified in ""backwardness"" and locked in the role of a villain from central casting. Now for the not so good.== Spoiler Alert ==... because I don't think I'm going to be able to complain about what I didn't like about the book without revealing major plot points. (Not to mention, some of what follows will only make sense to someone who has read the book.) So if you don't want to spoil it for yourself, read no further, here be spoilers:My overwhelming emotion throughout the book is feeling entirely manipulated. Of course, one major reason for this is that the author's attempts at metaphor, allegory, and forshadowing are utterly ham-fisted. When he wants to make a point, he hits you over the head with it, hard -- Amir's split lip / Hassan's cleft palate comes immediately, resoundingly to mind.But I feel manipulated beyond that. The members of the servant class in this story suffer tragic, unspeakable calamities, sometimes at the hands of our fine hero, and yet the novel seems to expect the reader to reserve her sympathies for the ""wronged"" privileged child, beating his breast over the emotional pain of living with the wounds he has selfishly inflicted upon others. How, why, am I supposed to feel worse for him as he feels bad about what he has done to others? Rather than feeling most sympathy and kinship for those who, through absolutely no fault of their own, must suffer, not just once or twice, but again and again? Of course this elevation of / identification with the ""wounded""/flawed hero goes hand in hand with an absolutely detestable portrayal of the members of the servant class as being at their utmost happiest when they are being their most servile and utterly subjugating their own needs, wants, desires, pleasures -- their own selves, in fact -- to the needs of their masters. (Even when they are protecting their masters from their own arrogance, heartlessness, or downright stupidity.)I don't see how the main character, Amir, could possibly be likeable. Amir's battle with Assef, momentous as it is, is not so much him taking a stand because he feels driven to do so or feels that he must. Rather, he acts with very little self-agency at all -- he is more or less merely carried forward into events. (And, moreover, in the end it is Sohrab (Hassan again) who saves him.) I finished the novel resenting Amir, and even more intensely resenting the author for trying to make the reader think she's supposed to care about Amir, more than about anyone else in the story.A couple other points: I'm wondering if one theme of the novel is that there are no definitive happy endings, no single immutable moments of epiphany or redemption. Because Amir's moral ""triumph"", such as it is, over Assef, is so short-lived. He manages to crash horrifically only a week or two later, when he goes back on his word to Sohrab about his promise not to send him to an orphanage.And lastly, I don't understand why Baba's hypocrisy is not more of a theme. He makes such a point of drilling into his son's head that a lie is a theft of one's right to the truth. His own hipocrisy there is a profound thing, and it's a shame the author doesn't do more with it. Nevertheless, after all the bad things I had to say about it, I do have a couple quotes worth keeping:""Every woman needed a husband. Even if he did silence the song in her."" (p.178)""'That's the real Afghanistan, Agha sahib. That's the Afghanistan I know. You? You've always been a tourist here, you just didn't know it.'"" (p. 232)=== UPDATE ===I originally posted my review The Kite Runner in February 2008. Since then, my review has generated a very robust response from other Goodreads members. I have responded a couple of times in the comments section, but I realize that by now, the comments section has gotten long enough that some folks may not realize that I have added some clarifications to my review. So, although the extended reply that I posted in the comments section in October 2008 is still available in the comments section, I am re-posting it here, so people don't miss it.I also want to offer my continued thanks to those who have read, liked, and/or comment on my review of The Kite Runner. This kind of back-and-forth conversation on books is exactly why I signed on to Goodreads! I appreciate the feedback, and look forward to engaging in more such discussion. Finally, one more quick reply. One recent commenter asked how I could have given this book only a 1 star rating, if I was so affected by it. As I replied in the comments, the short answer is that I am guided by Goodread's prompts when I rate a book. Two stars is ""It was OK;"" 1 star is ""I didn't like it."" While I have praised a few things about the book, the bottom line is, overall, I didn't like it. -- Linda, 22 July 2011Posted 24 October 2008:There have been many comments to my review since I first wrote it, and I thought it might be about time for me to weigh in for a moment.Before I get into my response, I must start off with a great thank you for all those who have felt sufficiently moved (positively or negatively) by my review to comment and respond. I appreciate all the comments, whether I agree with them or not.First of all, I'd like to address the question of whether we're ""supposed"" to like Amir or not. Yes, I do realize that sometimes writers create and/or focus on a character that the reader is not meant to like. Here, though, the story is clearly meant to be about some kind of redemption -- but I found Amir so distasteful, that I simply wasn't interested in his redemption. The focus of the story was entirely on how Amir's life had been corrupted by the despicable things he'd done - when the things he'd done were entirely part and parcel of the position of power and privilege he occupied over Hassan.Which brings me to my second point, the insufferable current of paternalism that runs throughout the story. The members of the servant and poorer classes are consistently portrayed as saintly, absurdly self-sacrificing, one-dimensional characters. Regardless of what terrible things befall them, they are shown to have nothing but their masters' interests at heart. Granted, it may be unlikely that the powerless would be overtly talking back and setting their masters straight; however, the novel gives no indication that they even have any private wishes of recrimination, or much of a private life, for that matter. Given this portrayal, it is even more difficult for me to muster any interest in Amir's suffering. But to suggest that perhaps we're misinterpreting the servants' subservient attitudes because we approach the story from a different time, place, or culture, is simply to engage in a cultural relativism borne out of -- and perpetuating -- the very same paternalism.To clarify my point, let's look at some comparable examples from US culture. Consider any one of a huge number of films such as Driving Miss Daisy, Clara's Heart, Bagger Vance, or Ghost (all simply continuing a tradition that reaches back to Shirley Temple's days) in which noble servants or similar helpers have absolutely no concern in their lives other than making sure the wealthy people they are serving have happy, fulfilled lives -- while they themselves never seem to have any of their own personal hopes, desires, triumphs, tragedies, or even any hint of a home, family, personal, or romantic life at all. Their total happiness is bound up entirely with serving the lives of their rich counterparts. It is this quality, present throughout Hosseini's book, that bothers me most.In the end, however, a beautifully written story could have overcome these criticisms -- or at the very least, I would have been able to temper or counter my points above with lavish praise for the writing. However, here, again, the novel falls flat. It is not particularly well-written. As some other commenters have also pointed out, the storytelling is quite heavy-handed, and the narrative suffers from implausible plot twists and uncanny coincidences, and a writing style that relies far too heavily on cliches and obvious literary devices.I wish that I could say I liked the book more. To answer [another commenter's] question, I haven't read A Thousand Splendid Suns; I'm afraid I wasn't particularly motivated to do so after my reaction to this one. However, I do believe, as that commenter also suggests, that there is something to be gained from the debate and discussion that the book has inspired.

The story is set against a backdrop of tumultuous events, from the fall of Afghanistan's monarchy through the Soviet military intervention, the exodus of refugees to Pakistan and the United States, and the rise of the Taliban regime.عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «بادبادک باز»؛ «بادبادک پران»؛ نویسنده خالد حسینی؛ تاریخ خوانش در ماه مارس سال دوهزاروپنج میلادیعنوان: بادبادک باز؛ نویسنده: خالد حسینی؛ مترجم زیبا گنجی؛ پریسا سلیمانزاده اردبیلی، مشخصات نشر تهران، مروارید، 1383، در 422ص؛ شابک9645881927؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده 21معنوان: بادبادک باز؛ مترجم: مهدی غبرائی؛ مشخصات نشر تهران، نشر همراه، 1384، در 456ص؛عنوان: بادبادک پران؛ مترجم: منیژه شیخ جوادی؛ مشخصات نشر تهران، پیکان، 1385، در 383ص؛ شابک 9789643284953؛عنوان: بادبادک باز؛ مترجم: مهدی غبرائی؛ مشخصات نشر تهران، نیلوفر، 1386، در 368ص؛ شابک 9644482972؛عنوان: بادبادک باز؛ مترجم: صدیقه ابراهیمی؛ مشخصات نشر تهران، دایره، 1387، در 393ص؛ شابک 9789646939694؛عنوان: بادبادک باز؛ مترجم: مژگان احمدی؛ مشخصات نشر تهران، بهزاد، 1388، در 331ص؛ شابک 9789642569410؛عنوان: بادبادک باز؛ مترجم: پیمان اشراقی؛ مشخصات نشر تهران، نگارستان کتاب، 1389، در 508 ص؛ شابک 9786005541557؛عنوان: بادبادک باز؛ مترجم: سمیه یداللهی؛ مشخصات نشر تهران، شهرزاد، 1389، در 376ص؛ شابک 9786001710421؛عنوان: بادبادک باز؛ مترجم: رقیه فیروزی؛ مشخصات نشر قم، رخ مهتاب راتا، 1392، در 338ص؛ شابک 9786007076026؛عنوان: بادبادک باز؛ مترجم: حسین بخشی؛ مشخصات نشر تهران، آوای مکتوب، 1393، در 368ص؛ شابک 9786007364055؛داستان از زبان «امیر» روایت می‌شود، «امیر» نویسنده ای اهل «افغانستان» و از تبار ایل «پشتون» و ساکن «کالیفرنیا» هستند، که برای نجات یک بچه، راهی «افغانستان» می‌شوند؛ افغانستانی که در تحت حاکمیت «طالبان» است، و یکی از دشوارترین دورانهای تاریخ چند هزار ساله‌ ی خویش را سپری می‌کند، و به بهانه ی همین سفر «امیر» به «افغانستان»، ایشان داستان زندگی‌ خویش را نیز برای خوانشگر بازگویی‌ میکنندنقل از متن کتاب: (ناراحت شدن از یک حقیقت بهتر از تسکین یافتن با یک دروغ است**حسن اینطوری بود؛ لعنتی آنقدر بی غل و غش بود که پیش او آدم همیشه حس میکرد ریاکار است**بابا گفت: «خوبه.» اما نگاهش حیران بود؛ «خب هرچی ملا یادت داده ول کن، فقط یک گناه وجود دارد والسلام؛ آن هم دزدی است - البته برخی هم آن یک گناه را دروغگویی میدانند؛ هر گناه دیگری هم نوعی دزدی است؛ میفهمی چی میگویم؟» مایوسانه آرزو کردم و گفتم کاش میفهمیدم؛ و گفتم «نه بابا جون»؛ نمی‌خواستم دوباره ناامیدش کنم.؛ بابا با بی حوصلگی آهی کشید؛ با اینکار دوباره دلم را سوزاند، چون او اصلاً آدم بی حوصله ای نبود؛ یادم آمد که تا هوا تاریک نمیشد، هیچ وقت به خانه نمیآمد، همیشه ی خدا تنهایی شام میخوردم؛ وقتی میآمد خانه، از «علی» میپرسیدم بابا کجا بوده؟ هر چند خودم خوب میدانستم که سر ساختمان بوده، سرکشی به این، نظارت به آن؛ مگر این کارها حال و حوصله نمیخواست؟ از تمام آن بچه هایی که داشت برایشان پرورشگاه میساخت متنفر بودم؛ گاهی وقتها آرزو میکردم، کاش همه ی آنها با پدر و مادرهایشان مرده بودند؛ بابا گفت «اگر مردی را بکشی، یک زندگی را میدزدی؛ حق زنش را از داشتن شوهر میدزدی، جق بچه هایش را از داشتن پدر میدزدی؛ وقتی دروغ میگویی، حق کسی را از دانستن حقیقت میدزدی.؛ وقتی تقلب میکنی، حق را از انصاف میدزدی، میفهمی؟) پایان نقل از متن کتابتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 19/05/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی",528,0.8074,0.0,0.985,0.015,0.4583333333333333,POSITIVE,0.9887

Sad stories make good books.


""I became what I am today at the age of twelve, on a frigid overcast day in the winter of 1975.""
There are two types of books, usually, that makes one feel like there are no words to describe the experience: They are either unbelievably detrimental, or exceptionally (and positively) impactful. Given the overall high rating, it is redundant to tell, to which category does The Kite Runner belong. I don't think there are that many books, especially fiction, that could leave such a profound effect on a reader's mind.
""People say that eyes are windows to the soul.""

""Time can be a greedy thing - sometimes it steals all the details for itself.""
What I loved the most about this book is the set of characters. Hosseini has done an amazing job developing them, which increases the emotional impact of the plot tenfold. Especially, it's remarkable how well he handled the first person protagonist, Amir. The traditional 'do wrong, then atone, conclude with happy ending' is not the way with The Kite Runner, but utilizes an attempt to direct Amir towards a path of atonement, while sticking to a more realistic ending. Had it not been for Hosseini's unique narrative, Amir's character could have turned far more contemptible. Luckily, for me, it was never the case. Many would probably love the secondary characters more, but it is important to remember that it was the protagonist's undistorted, self-criticizing account of the events that made it that way. It's not a perspective you see everyday, but I loved it.
""It always hurts more to have and lose than not have in the first place.""
I was perfectly satisfied with the pace of the story, including the intermittent jumps in time Hosseini used to separate the book in to a few main parts. Each of these parts had their own theme going on, while introducing an occasional twist to keep things interesting. The only minor complaint I have is about the attempt at creating a villain. Even though it introduced a tiny bit of mystery to the plot, that particular part felt a little out of harmony with the rest.
""That's the real Afghanistan, Agha sahib. That's the Afghanistan I know. You? You've always been a tourist here, you just didn't know it.""
The writing style is somewhat simple, but I believe most readers would be too absorbed in the plot to notice it. If anything, it felt more appropriate, reducing distractions from the flow of the story. But the plot, and the characters make up perfectly for any other shortcoming in my opinion. I wouldn't call this an emotional rollercoaster, for, the majority of the emotions include regret, disappointment, sadness, fear, anger, privation but very little happy ones. But all this helped the book become more moving. I usually don't enjoy books with sad endings but this one was definitely an exception, and worth all the heartbreak.
""Better to get hurt by the truth than comforted with a lie.""
Before starting the book, based on almost all the reviews, I knew this was a sad story. But with fiction, if and when things get too depressing, a reader could always be consoled by the fact that this is, after all, fiction. It's easier attributing everything to being not real, and proceed from that safe spot. You're no going to find that solace here. If anything, unless we are fooling ourselves, the severity of reality has been lessened to make it more bearable. But I guess that's the whole point. That's what makes this deliver a profound reading experience. It enables all readers to understand, to empathize, and be considerate towards others. Kite Runner easily made it to my All-time-favorites and I believe this should be read by everyone.

'For you, a thousand times over!' he said. Then he smiled his Hassan smile and disappeared around the corner.

When you tell a lie, you steal someone’s right to the truth. When you cheat, you steal the right to fairness. There is no act more wretched than stealing.”I’m going to be honest with you. To read this book was a constant struggle, not because I didn’t like the writing style, not because it was bad and not because it was boring. No, if anything “The Kite Runner” was so hard to read because it was so exceptionally painful. This book made me so sad! I felt helpless and angry and there were times I actually was more than just tempted to stop reading. Some of the chapters were just too hard to bear and the book touched me in a way I can’t even describe. It did something with me… and I’m still not sure whether this was good or bad.All I know is that the injustice in this book made me furious and that I just have to think about it and already feel sick to my stomach again. There were so many serious topics in this book but I think what really got to me was the central theme of violence, injustice and abuse. To read “The Kite Runner” was so devastating and nerve-racking I actually couldn’t read more than two chapters a day. It was so upsetting that I found it difficult to motivate myself to read it and even though this was such a painful read, I still wanted to know what would happen next.Amir’s and Hassan’s story was so horrible, appalling, powerful and beautiful at the same time. It left me completely broken and raw and I think my emotions are still all over the place. So if my review sounds a little incoherent and illogical you can blame it on the book hangover I'm currently suffering from. XD”But we were kids who had learned to crawl together, and no history, ethnicity, society, or religion was going to change that either.The plot:Amir and Hassan are best friends who grew up together and live in Kabul. They do almost everything together and one of their favourite hobbies is kite running. One day there is a local kite-fighting tournament Amir is determined to win and with the help of Hassan he is even able to achieve his goal. The victory of the tournament comes with a high price though and in the end their moment of happiness isn’t only short lived but also comes to an abrupt end. What happens after the competition destroys their lifelong friendship and shakes the foundations of their trust, the course of their lives changing as they try to deal with the repercussions of a single day.”It may be unfair, but what happens in a few days, sometimes even a single day, can change the course of a whole lifetime, Amir,"" he said.The characters:
Beware there are plenty of spoilers lying ahead of you!!!
Amir: ”I pretended I was reading from the book, flipping pages regularly, but I had abandoned the text altogether, taken over the story, and made up my own. Hassan, of course, was oblivious to this. To him, the words on the page were a scramble of codes, indecipherable, mysterious. Words were secret doorways and I held all the keys.”Puh, what to say about him? I think I never disliked a protagonist as much as I disliked the narrator of this story. I just couldn’t stand his younger self and I thought he wasn’t just egoistic but also spoiled and more than just unethical. The way Amir treated Hassan made me sick and his betrayal towards his best friend hurt so much! I mean how could he let this happen? How could he stand aside without intervening? How could he even think that Hassan is “just a Hazara”?! I don’t understand it and if I’m entirely honest I really think that it was good he felt bad throughout the entire book! His past haunted him and in the end it actually made him a better person. A person that stood up to bad people and a person I was finally able to forgive. It was a long journey for Amir but he eventually did the right thing and when I read the finial sentences of this book I was even proud of him. XD”It’s all right.” I turned to the general. “You see, General Sahib, my father slept with his servant’s wife. She bore him a son named Hassan. Hassan is dead now. That boy sleeping on the couch is Hassan’s son. He’s my nephew. That’s what you tell people when they ask.”They were all staring at me.“And one more thing, General Sahib,” I said. “You will never again refer to him as a ‘Hazara boy’ in my presence. He has a name and it’s Sohrab.”I waited 331 pages for that to happen!!! XDHassan: ”Then Hassan did pick up a pomegranate. He walked toward me. He opened it and crushed it against his own forehead. ‘There,’ he croaked, red dipping down his face like blood. ‘Are you satisfied? Do you feel better?’ He turned around and started down the hill.”God bless his kind and innocent soul!!! This boy was an angel and I don’t even know how he was able to forgive Amir. As it seems he managed to do it though and my deep respect and love for his character will never cease. I loved Hassan with all my heart and I think his only flaw was that he was just too good to live in this sick and violent world. He would have deserved so much more than life gave him and when I found out about Sohrab’s ordeal I was more than just heartbroken. 
I was devastated!!!
 I know Hassan must have turned over in his grave and I felt so, so, so damn sorry for what happened to both of them. Baba: ”The problem, of course, was that Baba saw the world in black and white. You can’t love a person who lives that way without fearing him too. Maybe even hating him a little.Baba definitely was a very flawed character but I still couldn’t help but had to love him for it. There was so much good in him, yet he also had his bad sides. For a person that was described as seeing the world in black and white he actually was all different kinds of grey and in some way that made him extremely likeable and disagreeable at the same time. *lol* I think he was a very contradictory person and after finding out about his secret I was finally able to understand why. Still, I loved that despite everything he tried to be a righteous man and when it comes down to it he certainly had his heart in the right place. ”Ask him where his shame is.”They spoke. “He says this is war. There is no shame in war.”“Tell him he’s wrong. War doesn’t negate decency. It demands it, even more than in times of peace.””And now, fifteen years after I’d buried him, I was learning that Baba had been a thief. And a thief of the worst kind, because the things he’d stolen had been sacred: from me the right to know I had a brother, from Hassan his identity, and from Ali his honor. His nang. His namoos.”Sohrab: This boy 
B.R.O.K.E
 my heart and I don’t even know how I’m supposed to pick up the pieces. He was just ten!! Damn it!! I don’t understand how people can hurt children and I can’t even… *argharghsdfjklmno* I hate what Assef did to him and I’m so glad Sohrab got away from his clutches! Chapter 22 was so horrible to read… It made me sick to my stomach and I swear I was tempted to throw the book against a wall… Urgh… just to think about his hands on Sohrab… My heart aches so much for that little boy!!! He deserved a better childhood than that! Damn no!! He actually deserved a childhood to begin with!!!! ”I miss Father, and Mother too,” he croaked. “And I miss Sasa and Rahim Khan sahib. But sometimes I’m glad they’re not … they’re not here anymore.”“Why?” I touched his arm. He drew back.“Because –“ he said, gasping and hitching between sobs, “because I don’t want them to see me… I’m so dirty.” He sucked in his breath and let it out in a long, wheezy cry. “I’m so dirty and full of sin.”And OMG that beautiful ending! That hopeful, amazing and beautiful ending! It killed me, it was the death of me, it was the final nail in my coffin!!! That sweet and gentle and shy boy!!!! XD I already get emotional just thinking about it! *blinking away tears* The bottom line:I hated the book! I loved the book! I hated the injustice, the pain Ali, Hassan and Sohrab had to go through, I hated the way the Taliban treated everyone they considered to be wrong and different, I hated to read about the destruction of Amir’s hometown, I hated the violence, I hated the war, I hated to read about the many orphans, the hungry children on the street. I hated the way Amir acted when he was younger!!!”She had a large purple bruise on her leg for days but what could I do except stand and watch my wife get beaten? If I fought, that dog would have surely put a bullet in me, and gladly! Then what would have happened to my Sohrab?”But I loved the details about Afghan culture, I admired the bravery of Hassan and Baba, my heart sang whenever they tried to be righteous and good. In a world that had gone to hell they still tried to be decent, they still tried everything possible to stand up for their people, to do the right thing. They still had values and they didn’t just believe in them, they also acted according to them!!! So yes, for me “The Kite Runner” was a very powerful book. It pushed my boundaries and forced me to fight through it! It made me think about unpleasant things, it forced me to see the bad and ugly things our world is made of, but it also showed me the good in people and their kindness! If you can live with a broken heart and are able to deal with the pain, this book his highly recommended. If you’re one of the faint-hearted you better give it a wide berth. As for me, I definitely will never re-read this book ever again! I’m kind of proud that I accomplished to read it though!

10,12482687,01/14/2008,1.0,"i really wanted to like this novel. judging from its thousands of 'five-star reviews' hailing it as the one of the 'best books ever written,' i'm in the minority when i state that this novel, while well-intentioned, just left a little bit of sour taste in my mouth. my problems with the novel are as follows: first of all the writing itself is so ham-fistened, heavy-handed, distracting and otherwise puzzling that by the midway point, i seriously considered chucking the book against the wall. each page of the novel has at least 5-10 incomplete sentences. i'm all for experimental and fractered prose--but it's important for authors to use it judiciously. hosseini, unfortunately, beats it to death. a lot of his language is cliched, too, which is funny considering there's a passage in the book about a writing teacher who warns the narrator, amir, about using cliches. i don't know if that was supposed to be funny or not, but it made me laugh (and what was worse was the san francisco's chronicle's glowing review on the book's cover and the san francisco chronicle's glowing review of amir's novel--coincidence?). the author's use of farsi--especially in the dialogue--was equally distracting. my point is that no one speaks the way his characters speak. people don't switch back and forth between languages while speaking, and if they do, they certainly don't speak 1/2 the sentence in english, say one word in farsi, then traslate the farsi word to english, then finish the sentence in english, when they're presumably speaking farsi to begin with. i didn't pick up this book for a crash course in colloquial farsi. after 370 pages, i was frustrated--and annoyed. hosseini's plot often borders on the ridiculous. the'twists' are just TOO coincidental--and not surprising at all (except in how contrived they are). for example, in a devasted kabul, amir sees a homeless man in the street. the homeless man, of course, was a former university professor who just happened to teach with amir's long deceased mother. what a coincidence! what makes it worse, is that the narrator, amir then explains that while that may, in fact, seem like a coincidence, it happens in afghanistan happens all the time. of course it does. in another example, amir's former nemesis, assaf (now a taliban crony), beats up amir and amir ends up with a scar above his lip, just like his dear friend hassan, who was born with cleft-pallet. oh, the coincidence! (and the fact that amir even runs into assef again is ridiculous). another example: amir and his wife aren't able to have children, and of course they find an orphan boy who happens to be extended family and they adopt him. what a coincidence! and after amir returns to afghanistan he doesn't call home to his dutiful wife for over a month. i kept wondering 'when's he gonna call home?' and any plot advanced by a series of 'tragedies,' (and in this book they are legion) shows little more than the writer's inability to craft a meaningful and interesting plot. not only is it pretty poor form, it's also highly manipulative and condescending. i found myself continually frustrated by hosseini's apparent distrust of the reader. we don't have to be told how and when to interpret metaphors. and if i read one more book where the protagonist is a writer or professor, i'm gonna ram my head into a metal post. i don't want to sound like a misanthrope or jaded literature reader because i'm certainly not. this novel just left me wanting so much more in terms of plot and characterization. having said that, however, the novel could be important in that shows the cruelty of the taliban. much of what hosseini writes about is important, especially for us westerners unfamiliar with the breadth and scope of the afghani tragedy. in the end, it was worth the $2.00 i paid for it.",280,0.3395,0.096,0.794,0.109,0.4807010582010582,NEGATIVE,1.0

Amir is the spoiled son of a wealthy and prominent merchant. Hassan is the cleft lipped son of an inferior caste, and a servant in the house they both live in. During their childhood they become fervent competitors in kite fighting tournaments, and unquestionable friends. Until one fateful day a traumatic event starts gradually separating them forever apart. Decades later, the dark secret that separated them so many years ago starts re-emerging. A secret that ends revealing long forgotten family betrayals, wars, and ethnic differences that led two little inseparable boys into very different life paths.A novel about the inherent strengths and weaknesses in each person, the guilts, and the terrible consequences of trying to endure them, or avoid them.Highly recommendable, very powerful, inexplicably painful. There are books that tell an unique unforgettable story, but there are a few special ones that also have the exceptional quality of transmitting something immensely valuable about the culture of a foreign country; beyond the deeply ideological differences, pros and cons you may find with such society. And, like I hold ""Shantaram"" as an unequalled novel about indian culture, I will hold ""Kite Runner"" as an inestimable novel about afghan. And I remain hopeful of ever finding books like these two, regarding any foreign culture.

12,2745538959,10/23/2019,5.0,"The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini ( Berliani M. Nugrahani, Translator) is a 2004 Riverhead Books publication. Earlier this year I read Moloka'i by Alan Brennert, another book, like this one, written back in 2004. It seemed I was the only person in the world who had not read the book, and once I’d finished reading it, I wondered why it had taken me so long to read it. This got me to thinking about all the books that I’d intended to read, but never got around to. So, despite my strong feelings about making reading resolutions, I vowed to read more books ‘the entire world has read but me’. Other than Moloka’I, I have also read ‘The Handmaid’s Tale”, and now- “The Kite Runner”. The Kite Runner has over 68,000 reviews on Goodreads, so I’m not going to recap the synopsis, nor am I going to break down all the various ways in which this book touched me in one way or another, or analyze all the important messages in the story, as I don’t think I can add anything more to what has already been said.However, I couldn’t simply leave a rating and felt compelled to add a few personal remarks about my experience with this novel- but I’ll keep it brief. First of all- why on earth did I wait so long to read this book? This story is an incredible gut-punching- heart-wrenching, powerful and very thought-provoking family saga.  The juxtaposition between the two boys and the separate paths on which they embark is tragic, but eventually leads to long overdue penance and justice, as well as redemption and forgiveness. This riveting drama is very reflective, and handled with crisp precision, evoking a myriad of emotions. While the story is deeply depressing and so very sad, it is also an uplifting, inspirational story of a personal reckoning and redemption, which is the part of the story I’ll always carry with me. I’m so very glad I took the time to finally sit down and read this book! Although the book is fifteen years old now, it still has the same profound resonance it did when first published. I’m still hugging my box of tissues! Amazing storytelling, amazing book- One I will never forget!",262,0.9841,0.045,0.836,0.12,0.5730748880748879,POSITIVE,0.9984
13,269989712,01/30/2012,5.0,"I liked this book a lot. Due to the uncomfortable nature of the story told, I'll probably never read it again, but I'm glad that I did read it once. I saw it as the story of one not very likeable boy growing up in a soon to be war torn region and his eventual struggle for redemption. I was quite surprised to see how popular some of the negative reviews of this book were and I'd like to comment on a few of the comments they contained. One condemnatory critic said ""This is the sort of book White America reads to feel worldly."" Ah, if only that were truer. In a study done not long ago, over half of American adult men, when asked, admitted to having read NO books in the last year. Personally, as a white American, this book made me grateful that I grew up where I did, and once again reminded me of how good I've had it, and how little I really know about life outside these insular, isolationist, United States.Another critic claimed that this book ""...portrays Afghanistan as backward"" Personally I thought that it portrayed it as a war torn, deeply wounded country that was at one time a bit like our ante-bellum south. It was made quite clear that we saw pre-soviet Afghanistan through the eyes of a doubly privileged class, the rich child. Another critic claimed ""The members of the servant and poorer classes are consistently portrayed as saintly, absurdly self-sacrificing, one-dimensional characters."" Yes, that's true. But the viewpoint is a that of an over-privileged, rich, selfish child. Given the ante-bellum south atmosphere that our protagonist sees, it's a wonder that the epithet ""uncle Tom"" wasn't used. Finally one critic complained ""The book fails exactly where it most needs to succeed - in the depiction of the Taliban."" Personally, I felt that while that need may be great, I didn't see that as the purpose of this book. I saw this book as the story of one man's journey toward redemption against a background of a troubled heritage. I sometimes recall doing things as a child that now makes me wonder about myself, and while I like to think I've become a better human being, I sometimes shudder at the savage, thoughtless child that was once under this skin. For the personal perspective alone, I think this book is a worthwhile, if sometimes uncomfortable, read. If you let it, it may make you a better person.

I kept putting it off because while I was sure that it would be a fantastic book, it isn't the type of smutty romance that I usually read. I knew that I'd have to be in the right kind of mood to read it. Finally, I found myself wanting to read something a little different to break me out of a reading rut and I downloaded the Audible version of 'The Kite Runner' and started listening.As expected, this book was nothing like my usual love stories. This book is the type of book that makes you think about your life and reevaluate your values and what you think you know. It is the type of book that makes you question what you'd do in a given situation if the tables were turned. If you're like me, and have always been blessed to live in a country where you've never experienced the brutality and terror of warfare firsthand, this book serves as a reminder of how lucky you truly are. As a woman, and a mother of two daughters, I cannot begin to express how grateful I am that I was born in a country where women are treated as equals. Sure, there are still some inequalities. However, when I think of how women are treated in many other regions of the world, I am incredibly thankful to have the freedoms that I do. I won't rehash this story, because it's been done a million times already and I don't think there's anything I could say that hasn't been said already. However, I will say that this was a wonderful book. It was grim, brutal and depressing, but also beautiful at times. It was emotional and infuriating, but you can't say that you didn't ""feel"" while reading this one. I experienced a full range of emotions. In the end, it grounded me and put all of my petty gripes into perspective. We all need to be reminded of how blessed we are at times.

17,22018224,05/11/2008,,"After pondering long and hard, I'm going to try now to articulate just what it was about this book that sucked so much, why it has offended me so greatly, and why its popularity has enraged me even more. This book blew so much that I've been inspired to start my own website of book reviews for non-morons. So let us explore why. First, let's deal with the writer himself. Hosseini's father worked for Western companies while in Afghasnistan. While daddy (who I am guessing, from Hosseini's tragic account of the ""fictional"" father, never accepts his son) worked and got wealthy, normal Afghans lived their lives. When war broke out, Hosseini's father was offered a safe position in Iran. Just before the revolution in Iran, his father was offered another job in Paris, before finally taking the family to the USA. That's fine ... some of us are lucky in life. Others are not. What bothers me, though, is that The Kite Runner is so obviously what Hosseini WISHES had happened.There is no doubt in my mind that the Hassan character really did exist in some form or another. Surely Hosseini had a friend/sometimes playmate/servant who was left behind while Hosseini's powerful family escaped. Surely, Hosseini feels guilty for leaving his homeland by simple privilege while the less fortunate were left behind to fight the Soviets, the Mujahideen, and then the Taliban. And surely, Hosseini wishes he were some flawed hero that didn't simply get lucky. He wishes he'd majored in English, as the protagonist does, and published fiction books instead of becoming a run-of-the-mill doctor; he wishes his father had depended upon him in the USA as happens in the book, instead of getting by just fine as a rich exile with a daddy-doesn't-love-me complex; he wishes he could go back to Afghanistan, risking his life to make ammends for his shitty and cowardly past, instead of remaining a wealthy outsider living happily in the USA. Hosseini is simply some guy who feels guilty about having escaped what so many of his fellow countrymen couldn't, and he makes up for it in fantasy in a million ways: accepting his fallen father, marrying an ""unsuitable"" woman, listening to a voice from the past, saving the son of his friend he watched being raped decades before (when he was too selfish to intervene), stomaching the live stoning of a burka-clad woman and her adulterous lover, taking a beating from an old enemy/Taliban child molestor, giving $2000 to a poor smuggler who tries to feed his kids on $3 a week, and saving a 12 year-old from suicide. If Hosseini REALLY did all this, what a hero he would be. Instead, he just makes it up and calles it a novel ... and people devour this shit with tears, labeling it as ""inspirational"" and ""moving.""What really bothers me? Besides all of the contrived and predictable plot twists?? What really disturbs me is that people not only eat this shit up, but they also call it ""literature,"" award it, and give this guy money and license to write another book. For lack of better words ... WTF?!!!??! Has everyone just gone STUPID?!!?!?I could go on about how the writing sucks, especially when the author admits to using cliches (elephant in the room, dark as night, thin as a rake, et fucking c) but I won't. Why? A couple of reasons:1) If you liked this book, a part of you is sick, and a larger part of you is an idiot 2) I could write a 100-page thesis about how much this book blew monkey chunks, but it's not worth my time3) This shit sells, and Hosseini, between his stupid book and movie deals, is an even richer man than he was before ... which in the end, makes him smarter than you, me, and everyone else .... He understands the market and fed it back to us. We probably deserve it. ",196,-0.803,0.113,0.778,0.11,0.5628663003663001,NEGATIVE,0.9652
18,2076834257,08/03/2017,5.0,"“There are a lot of children in Afghanistan, but little childhood.”I’ve read books before with an unreliable narrator and also read accounts of cowardice and shame. Amir, the first-person protagonist and narrator from Hosseini’s 2003 novel, filled me with such disgust and loathing that I almost put the book down at 25%.My doctor would say that Amir suffered from AWDD – Ass whooping deficiency disorder and I would enthusiastically second that diagnosis.That said, I invite everyone to read the book and see how it all plays out.“There is a way to be good again...”The poet Galway Kinnell once wrote that there are some regrets we can never be rid of. He was right in so many ways. An inability to forgive ourselves for past moments of cowardice, shame and inaction are the most troubling and relentless sorrows we can face as humans wandering around on this poor earth. We can forgive others, even those who have harmed us greatly, but looking ourselves in the eye and offering absolution can be an act beyond so many of us.I took my time getting to this book for a great many reasons and now that I have finally read it, I am so glad. This book moved me. Hosseini was able to pluck heart strings of emotion that I had thought silent and stolid. The themes of loyalty, friendship, devotion countered with betrayal, animosity and selfishness were plaintive notes played out in a literary orchestra of human sentiment. “I wondered if that was how forgiveness budded; not with the fanfare of epiphany, but with pain gathering its things, packing up, and slipping away unannounced in the middle of the night.”We follow a distorted tale of mistakes and timidity towards an ultimate chance at redemption. Amir’s is an understood but still contemptuous plight of lost opportunity. Shielded by cultural, social and religious privilege, his regrettable acts of pusillanimity are displayed against the heroic and admirable examples of his steadfast friend Hassan and his intrepid father. Hosseini paints us a picture of an evolving and destabilizing Afghanistan, tortured for years with Soviet occupation and then granted only the briefest of reprieves before falling to the theocratic and brutal rule of the Taliban. Amir’s journey is one of deliverance and redemption.Hosseini’s skill and adept description of a modern day caste system where an invisible division existed between the favored Pashtun and the disadvantaged Hazara may be a tale of Afghanistan, but this abstract and superficial distinction can also be a universal cautionary story about racism, intolerance and bigotry.Beautifully written and told with compassion, empathy and with a skilled writer’s eye for detail and expression, this can also be a painful book to read. Not for everyone, but for those who can endure what is at times heartbreaking the reward is as magnificent as is this work.“For you, a thousand times over” ",201,-0.9864,0.203,0.639,0.159,0.5260582010582009,POSITIVE,0.999
19,3470840,07/24/2007,1.0,"I found this book a failure of courage and imagination -- all the more upsetting for the author's astute sense of detail and wonderful psychological depth. But ask yourself this: if the Taliban are real humans than why are they not represented as such? No doubt we will all love the movie as well.If you want to read a book on Afghanistan, I recommend Jason Elliot's An Unexpected Light.Below is my complete review: I started out loving this book. Hosseini is dead on target in his depiction of children's psychology, the non-contractual relationships between master and servant, and in his weaving of the threads between trauma, memory, and denial.Further, Hosseini captures the feel of life in a Third World country. His depiction of Afghanistan confirms my own short travels in Afghanistan during the 1970s. Indeed, I was becoming ever more excited with the possibility of teaching this book in my new course on Afghanistan. But alas.The book fails exactly where it most needs to succeed - in the depiction of the Taliban. When we do not have an archive, or the possibility of getting at the facts and narratives of a part of history, fiction can be used creatively and responsibly in order to construct something real. Take, for example, the extraordinary slave narrative written by Guy Endore -- Babouk. After years of research, Endore writes a history of a slave engaged in rebellion just prior to the Haitian Revolution.Hosseini has the skills but not the courage nor the empathy/sympathy to portray the Taliban as historical, sociological, economic, modern creations. Discounting and trivializing his own skills, he characterizes the Taliban in the easiest way -- as simple, cartoonish, evil. He thereby does nothing to enlighten us. Worse, he panders to a sleepwalking liberal public who happily accept his vision as a seemingly authentic reflection of their own myopia.Most everyone is satisfied: the U.S. public for having read about a country they destroyed -- feeling all the better at having disposed of evil; the publishers for their timely profit; and Hosseini for having expressed his romantic sense of loss.At least V.S. Niapaul is honest about his hatred for his own people. Hosseini's twist is less forgivable -- he gives aide to the very people whose malice, neglect, ignorance, and misunderstanding of Afghan people is one key factor in the destruction of this beautiful land and vital people.A failure of imagination is often the result of a failure in will, in courage, in politics. Hosseini traps himself in the politics of nostalgia.

‘’There is a way to be good again.’’
The Kite is a symbol of freedom, of the primeval human need to fly, to be as light as a feather. No one can threaten you or harm you when you fly. In the neighborhoods of Kabul, boys take part in kite competitions, looking upwards in hope. Sometimes, though, hope is futile and becomes a mere empty word.From San Francisco in 2001, we move to Kabil during the 1970s. Amir is a bright, bookish boy with a preference to the tragic myths of old. He is quiet, an enemy of violence. But quietness and cowardliness are separated by an extremely thin line and there are times when bravery and honesty, no matter how unpleasant or disagreeable they may be, are forgotten. Hassan is his best friend. Intelligent and brave and kind. However, he has the ill fortune to belong to a low caste. And then tragedy strikes, born out of hatred and absurd discrimination. Amir reveals an impossibly ugly side and the hardships begin.
‘’When you tell a lie, you steal someone’s right to the truth.’’
Once more, Hosseini paints with words and communicates a world of unbearable injustice. The disputes between the Pashtuns and the Hazaras, the end of the monarchy, the Soviet intervention, the Taliban regime. A life in constant fear, a friendship so strong and yet so fragile, torn apart by shame and misconceptions. Undefeated prejudices. A city that has become the shadow of its former heyday. Children being sold by the ones who were supposed to protect them. Women being stoned to death while the roaring crowd, a mob of uneducated worms, cheers its lust for blood. Fairy tales are seen as the one source of support, a gentle reminder, a warning if you will, that everything can go wrong. And then everything can be fixed. Almost everything…I read the novel and then I chose to read the graphic novel edition. Both were excellent, the shock and terror equally strong. The illustrations by Fabio Celoni and Mirka Andolfo are so vivid that there were times I was petrified regardless of the fact that I knew what was coming. I thought A Thousand Splendid Suns was one of the hardest reading experiences in my life but The Kite Runner was even more psychologically draining. Hosseini is a merciless writer, God bless him…The dialogue in both versions is excellent, the characterization brilliantly executed, the overall result astonishing and awe-inspiring. I cried like a baby upon finishing both. On a lighter note, (please, allow me the use of the phrase here) I was mad with joy to see Wuthering Heights included in the narration as Soraya’s favourite book and I enjoyed the cultural reference to El Cid. Personal trivia: I love Charlton Heston.This is a beautiful, shocking, raw story of family ties, friendship, grief and injustice and the chance to heal the deepest wounds...

22,1855090747,12/29/2016,5.0," Guilt The Kite Runner is emotional and immersive, a story that is amplified with its spotlight on society and culture within Afganistan - both past and present. The story relates to the lives of two boys, Amir and Hassan, growing up in Kabul and narrated through the eyes of Amir. There are major societal and lifestyle differences between them but it is the character and principles of the two boys that defines this literary classic. Amir is the son of a rich man, he is educated, refined, and most importantly for social standing, part of the Sunni ruling class. Hassan is the son of the household servant and is illiterate, physically robust, but unfortunately for him, part of the Shia lower class. At a young age, the two boys probably saw each other as play friends, rather than the additional baggage or benefits their class positions bestow on them. However, as children grow up they inherently know where power resides and it doesn't take long for Amir to recognise his family's dominance and Hassan's family servitude. Following an incident where Hassan suffers physically and psychologically in protecting Amir, it leaves Amir with an unshakeable sense of guilt and culpability that manifests itself in a resentful disposition towards Hassan. Hassan suffers twice for being a better friend. The class system plays its part but the cowardice of Amir clings to his memories and will haunt him throughout his life. The writing flows wonderfully and the story is so imperceptibly built to capture emotions and our sentiments of injustice.Years after Amir immigrated to the United States he returns with the hope of righting some of these wrongs and seeking redemption with Hassan. Since Amir was last in Afghanistan the Taliban are now in control of the state - including government and religion. The country Amir knew now feels alien as he experiences the emotional horrors and fear of life under the Taliban. They are also dangerous times where the outward display of appearance and loyalty are crucial not to fall foul of the authorities.This is a really superb book on so many levels – the history, location, religion, social culture, character interaction and it’s ultimately dealing with human emotions of friendship and guilt. I would highly recommend reading this book. In fact, it's a must-read!",167,0.983,0.093,0.75,0.157,0.479922969187675,POSITIVE,0.9999

But there's no normal way of talking or writing anything without crying whenever that name comes up. I cannot believe a name can make me cry anytime anywhere now.But Hassan never asked for sympathy. But my heart ... (Sorry, I just wailed for the umpteenth time while writing this sentence...) is so broken at the moment. I don't think I will ever get healed from this pain and sorrow. I am grieving. I will grieve for Hassan forever.And grieve for Amir, Amir's father, Ali, Rahim and that boy who died that one night during the escape of Amir and his father to Pakistan.If at all you want to hate a character in this book, hate Assef.

I am just scared to pick it up again. It hurt my tear glands continuously for two days and made me sick for days. *What I feel now after rereading the book:What I thought I remember from this book was so little to what I feel I know now. (Basically, I don't want to debate much about history and political background when it comes to writing my thoughts and opinions on books. I try to stay away from controversial topics because I don't want to waste my energy on controversies and arguments. So, I will be leaving out parts which I do not want to mention here even though they're important in this context.)I look for the writing, the characters and the basic plot and how these three factors develop in the book. I love this book as it's a strong character driven story told from the perspective of Amir. There's a strong portrayal of discrimination of caste and certain groups of people in the community. Hassan belonged to such a community. He grew up with Amir; his father Ali grew up with Amir's father. But Ali and Hassan are 'hazaras' and were regarded as servants. Amir's father is one of the best character portrayal in books so far. This character had the strongest presence in the book. He's so real. An event changed everything where Amir could have done something but he didn't (he was just a kid for god's sakes!) and for someone who lacked confidence and approval from his father for whatever he did, he's the character who O sympathise with. For the rest of his life, he lived in pain and guilt. Hassan. (Sorry. I can't write about him without crying and wailing... So I can't write about him today.)Sohrab. My baby boy. Hassan's son. I hope Amir and Soraya give him all the love he needs. I don't want to give away the plot. But yes, the writing is really good. The emotions raw and gnawing. The story ended well and good.Trigger warnings for rape, paedophilia, violence, strong language, suicidal tendency and self-harm.",175,0.3725,0.136,0.723,0.14,0.5553463693169576,NEGATIVE,0.9891
25,22166925,05/13/2008,2.0,"I must admit that although I had heard plenty of people mention The Kite Runner, I hadn’t actually paid much attention to what was said about it other than, “It was wonderful!” So, a few days ago and several years after the book came out, I heard a couple of people discussing the “wonderful” book I decided to read it.The first day, I read about a third of the novel (Hassan is raped, Amir feels bad, well sort of, he feels bad that Hassan is raped yes, but even worse because Hassan’s rape makes him feel bad and, of course, this means he needs to act badly and do bad things, and make more bad stuff happen to Hassan who is not bad at all.) And, I will admit that this portion of the book had me reading as quickly as I could. I flipped from one page to the next, skimmed over the plethora of annoyances, oops, I mean I skimmed over the Farsi vocab sprinkled evenly throughout to, of course, add authenticity and give it that multicultural feel that is sure to make every publisher drool over a manuscript, and I was even forgiving of the somewhat poor writing. Yes, on day one, I liked The Kite Runner. I was into The Kite Runner. And when I decided to continue my read the next day – I had high hopes!The second day, I read to the point where Amir gets a phone call from a man he has not seen in years, abandons his “perfect life” in America (well, almost perfect, there is the infertility and the gap that his wife’s uterus is forming between them, but their sex life is still good – sometimes… WHAT!? Never mind…) so, anyway, Amir hops on a plane to Afghanistan which is being ruled by the Taliban, yet he enters without issue, and follows the yellow brick road and lands at OZ where it turns out that the man behind the glasses is not John Lennon at all – he is Assef – his childhood nemesis, pedophile, and just plain evil guy (and you know he is evil cause he likes Hitler – although he has never heard of ethic cleansing). So, Amir walks right into the Taliban compound and asks to see the wizard, I mean their leader, and is allowed to do so (actually it was more difficult for Dorothy to get in to see the wizard, she should have taken Amir with her) and when he gets in, we find out that Hassan’s son is made to dress like a monkey - GET IT A MONKEY – ya know like the monkey that Amir and Hassan would go see (too bad it wasn’t a flying monkey) – and provide entertainment for the Taliban, and provide sexual services for Assef – the same guy who had sex with Hassan and, now the obviously simple minded reader that Hosseini wrote for, says, “that is so weird the way that all happened, wow, I can't believe the way this is all coming together, this is sooooooo fascinating!” Oh, and for the thinking reader with any literary competence who MAY think that this is too much of a coincidence, don’t be so critical; this issue was already addressed when Amir ran into a beggar who happened to have taught with (and remembered doing so) Amir’s mother. We, the readers, are clearly TOLD that coincidence is VERY common in Afghanistan. Therefore, if the rest of the story seems too contrived, don’t worry, it is realistic for Afghanistan. So, don’t question it, cause he is the expert on Afghanistan and you (the reader) are not, therefore, just accept that this completely ridiculous, unrealistic, obviously contrived series of events, are very realistic in Afghanistan!My third day of reading, I completed the book and instead of placing my hand over my heart, smiling, and thinking about how wonderful the book was, how beautiful the story was, and how it all came so nicely together in the end (apparently the reaction of the masses), I was mad. I was mad because there are so many people out there who think a book this ridiculous and obvious is brilliant. I was mad because this is precisely what is wrong with some multicultural literature and what gives multicultural literature a bad name. There are many pieces out there that are (actually) beautifully written, provide valuable insight into other cultures, and entertain the reader (i.e. Reading Lolita in Tehran), however, it does nothing for multicultural literature to publish pieces that are poorly written and filled with cliché. I can forgive (to a certain extent) poorer writing when the story is written as a true account and when the purpose of the novel is to re-tell actual events. However, when an author decides he is going to write a piece of fiction, his style, diction, and plotline come into question. The final portion of the novel continues throwing out one cliché after another, and throws out one ridiculous coincidence after another. Just the fact that a good portion of the middle of the book was dedicated to pounding it into the readers head that Amir and Soraya could not have children and did not want to adopt, well, that is unless the bloodline is known, is enough to clue the reader in that they will adopt Sohrab waaaay before Amir even knows that he will adopt Sohrab. What a coincidence that Hassan just happened to be his half brother, happened to have a son, and the son happened to have been taken by Assef. And it was even more convenient that, even from the grave, once again, Hassan could save Amir. He could provide him with a son and the opportunity to finally fight the big bully who STILL carried his brass knuckles. And more convenient yet, the fact that Sohrab always carried that slingshot (And in case we forgot that he always carried it, Amir remembered for us, as if Hosseini wants to say: see readers how clever I am, I set it up that Sohrab always had the slingshot, and now later in the story, it comes back out. See how clever I am readers, everything in my story has a purpose and is connected). However, what Hosseini needed to do is explain how a kid who has been taken from an orphanage, made to dress and entertain like a monkey, lives with the Taliban, and is a sex slave for the Big Bad Assef, still managed to keep his slingshot – the very weapon used against Assef in the past, and the very weapon that Assef has an issue with! Just how dumb must a reader be to believe that the freakin Taliban NEVER NOTICED!? So, okay, Sohrab saves Amir, they escape and the Taliban does nothing, and then another freaking coincidence – Amir will end up with a scar. And in case the reader does not deduce that Amir will have a scar from his busted lip, the doctor points it out and confirms it. Yes, reader, a scar like Hassan’s – get it? It’s connected – get it?Truth be told, there are so many unbelievable incidents and ridiculous coincidences presented to us in this book that it would take pages to go through them all because they were present from beginning to end: The young Russian soldier who doesn’t shoot Baba and the older Russian soldier who apologizes for him and talks about the young soldiers – YEAH RIGHT! The fact that Amir is an author who is published right away and cranks out novel after novel with great success – YEAH RIGHT! Baba dies of lung cancer and then Rahim Khan seems to have to same issue – does Hosseini think all people who die of natural causes die of lung issues? Raymond Andrews who has a bad attitude because his kid committed suicide, and then the receptionist actually tells Amir that this happened – the way this came out seemed completely fake and contrived because – IT WOULDN’T HAPPEN! Then, of course, Sohrab tries to kill himself, so now we know why Andrews kid had to commit suicide – we needed one more obvious instance of foreshadowing. It is also a little odd how often Amir throws out how he knows about medicine because he is a writer – WHAT? I didn’t know I needed to seek out an author when I was sick. And so on and so on…But one final point that I would like to make is that as soon as Amir picked up a kite it seemed that, much like Jesus, his hands began to bleed; therefore, I am left to wonder: why didn’t Amir know about the invent of gloves? Perhaps that is the biggest tragedy of it all. By the way, I am still giving the novel two stars because there is an interesting story in there, and the glimpse into Afghanistan is valuable. It is just that the author did such a poor job of presenting the story that it actually detracts from the positive aspects of the book and makes the validity of his glimpse into Afghanistan quite questionable. Therefore, my two stars are for the possibilities that could have been if it had been written by a talented author.",156,-0.9784,0.13,0.748,0.122,0.5288314193522528,POSITIVE,0.5685

Paralysed”Five stars for a stunning book where remorse, guilt, injustice, prejudice, and forgiveness play a significant part in the heart-breaking stories of Amir, son of Baba, and Hassan, son of Rahim Aga, a loyal friend and servant to the Amir’s father, set against the backdrop of some of Afghanistan’s most turbulent years.'The Kite Runner' is an unforgettable story about two young boys whose lives are shaped by the regrettable decisions taken, inaction and cowardice that strains their relationship and ultimately tears them apart. It is also a story that signifies the power of voice and the devastating consequences of not using it when the time and cause requires it. Yet is also a tender story that demonstrates forgiveness, the power of love, and the importance of confronting the lies and injustices around us. A truly sensational story that is told with sentiment, honesty and with a powerful message. The PlotAmir and Hassan are friends, Amir “..was a Pashtun and Hassan was a Hazara, Amir was Sunni and he was Shi’a, and nothing was ever going to change that” However, the two boys shared a love of kite flying and won competitions and Hassan the title of best ‘Kite Runner’. Yet the two boys could not deny their racial differences as Hassan was forced to sit on the side lines while Amir played with other Sunni friends. Behind closed doors and away from probing eyes they were devoted friends until an evil act of depravity charts the boys on different courses. As Amir struggles to forgive himself for inaction and cowardice, he recalls “.. I had one last chance to make a decision. One. In the end, I ran. I ran because I was a coward” The story continues along two different paths until Amir, despite his successes in America, is forced to confront the ugly past with a twist that he could predict as the secrets hidden from him are revealed.Review and CommentsA heart felt and touching story that shines a light on the injustices, suffering, and racial disparities felt across the world, without being judgemental. A story that needed to be told and a book that should be read. However, it was the forgiveness in the book that pulled on my heart strings just as much. I love books that deliver strong messages but don’t lecture or patronise or seek to influence the reader politically or socially. It is up to the reader to take from these stories what they will and shape their own opinions. Yet they do help us understand different perspectives, the hardship of people displaced and suffering that comes with unrest and for that reason I adored ‘The Kite Runner’.The writing style is superb, and I particularly loved the words and teachings of the wise men, and there is no shortage of them in this narrative. One of my standout quotes from this beautiful book is“…there is only one sin, only one. And that is theft. Every other sin is a variation of theft. Do you understand that?” …. “When you kill a man, you steal a life,” Baba said. “You steal his wife’s right to a husband, rob his children of a father. When you tell a lie, you steal someone’s right to the truth. When you cheat, you steal the right to fairness. Do you see?”Sad, powerful, and poignant, yet beautiful and tender in parts as the power of voice reminds us of when we should use it. I would give this book 6 stars if I could.

36,1511546,05/29/2007,5.0,"So I started Kite Runner two nights ago after finishing Blink. It took me a week or so with Blink since I wasn’t very enthralled, making it easier to put it down at night when it was my bed time.Kite Runner, I started over a long weekend and could not for the life of me put it down. I was so hooked I even found myself reading Bing’s copy when I was over at Deesh and Bing’s this weekend playing an invigorating (and might I add victorious) game of girls vs. boys Cranium and then Cheez Geek (Cheez Geek one of the 3 new things this week). The Kite Runner. Must be the most disturbing, haunting book I’ve yet to read. The close seconds would be A Child Called It and Night. They both broke my heart but not in the way Kite Runner did. I was in tears maybe four separate times during the past two days it took me to finish the novel. A coming of age story with pre–war Afganhistan and the post-Taliban arrival as the backdrop of the story. I tend to take note of books I know my dad will enjoy and as I read them I jot down notes on post its for my dad and flag the relevant pages. I flagged the story about Amir and Hassen tying bumble bees with string and letting them fly a bit before yanking them back. My dad used to do exactly the same thing to dragonflies when he was younger growing up in Vietnam. Then as I got deeper and deeper into the book and found myself tearing up, I started to doubt whether my dad, a vet would enjoy going down memory lane. I took breaks and called Mary Ellen to relay the story and basically to pull me out a little. Relief. The refugee stories seem to make vivid my parents’ stories post Vietnam. I kept imagining I was reading about my dad. Funny how war is pretty much the same no matter where it is. I usually don’t read war books so this is somewhat new to me. Before Kite Runner, the only books I’ve read with war in the background were Anne Frank’s diary, The Hiding Place, and Night. All heart breaking in their own respect but I never felt so invested in events unfolding with each turn of the page as I did with Kite Runner.So aside from making me cry so easily, Hosseini also managed to make me laugh several times out loud. One scene when Amir, in such a detached manner, thinks to himself as someone is experiencing an eye injury, “Oh that’s vitreous fluid.. I read about that, that’s vitreous fluid.” I used to work for an ophthalmologist. So here are a few quotes I jotted down into my reading journal…“There is only one sin, only one. And that is theft. Every other sin is a variation of theft..”“If there’s a God out there, then I would hope he has more important things to attend to than my drinking Scotch or eating pork.”“Children aren’t coloring books. You don’t get to fill them with your favorite colors.” “We plucked the stinger off a bee and tied a string around the poor thing and yanked it back every time it took flight.” “John Wayne didn’t really speak Farsi and he wasn’t Iranian.” “And the beggars were mostly children now, thin and grim-faced, some no older than five or six. They sat in the laps of their burque-clad mothers alongside gutters at busy street corners… Hardly any of them sat with an adult male- the war had made fathers a rare commodity in Afghanistan.”“Returning to Kabul was like running into an old, forgotten friend, and seeing that life hadn’t been good to him, that he’d become homeless and destitute.”‘I’m so afraid…. Because I’m so profoundly happy, Dr Rasul. Happiness like this is frightening. They only let you be this happy if they’re preparing to take something from you.” I wrote the last one down because that’s how I feel when I feel very happy. I get extra wary of freak accidents.“I wondered if that was how forgiveness budded, not with the fanfare of epiphany, but with pain gathering its things, packing up and slipping away unannounced in t",119,0.9534,0.102,0.777,0.121,0.4895944741532978,POSITIVE,0.9967

42,116320672,08/11/2010,2.0,"Because The Kite Runner is adored by approximately 110% of those who have read it, I decided to read the thing myself. After thousands of enthusiastic reviews I had pretty high expectations which the book ultimately did not meet.The Kite Runner is a pretty simple story; how one event can change a whole life - sort of stuff Ian McEwan specialises in. Hosseini is big in foreshadowing - he certainly won't let you forget that A Terrible Event is going to happen on That Day of That Year, but before going to take you to the mentioned Event he'll spend some pages of describing Afghan culture (I quite enjoyed that), then go back to mentioning That Gloomy Day, and switch back to describing how tasty naan was when our heroes were kids.Speaking of which, the book deals with two young boys - Amir and Hassan. Amir is a well to do Pashtun boy, while Hassan is his servant, one of the Hazara. Despite being breastfeeded by the same nanny, both boys occupy drastically different social positions - speaking simply Amir is the master and Hassan is the slave. They're quite close though = they play together and compete in kite flying, where Hassan excels at the titular kite running - catching kites that were cut down by other players.Hosseini, a beginning writer, did what most beginning writers do, unfortunately - made the boys complete polar opposites of each other. Amir is one of the most unsympathetic protagonists I ever encountered in fiction - and he stays that way through the whole book, which I'm not sure was Hosseini's intention - while Hassan is basically a saint, who also happens to be pretty good at ironing, cleaning and cooking.It's difficult to discuss the plot of the novel without giving something away, but I think it's safe to say that the relationship between two boys is doomed to be destroyed by The Terrible Event, which the author surely emphasized often enough. Before the book has the chance to turn into Deliverance with kites, a chain of events happens that forces Hassan out of Amir's household and Amir out of his country.Here Hosseini makes another of the mistakes made by beginning novelists - after putting his character through personal hell, he makes his ""new life"" way to easy. I find it funny because Amir is an aspiring novelist, and there are pages devoted to writing stories and the use of cliches. Speaking of cliches, the language is not that original either. None of the sentences are groundbreaking or jaw-dropping, and Hosseini's use of Farsi is irritating - he injects the words from his native language just to make the book sound smart. I can inject words from my native language ale to nic nie zmieni bo wciąż będzie to ten sam tekst. Do you know what it means? Hosseini apparently thinks we all understand him easily and can pick up the connotations from context. From my experience people don't switch back and forth between two languages when they speak to a person who knows only one, and most certainly they don't start a sentence in English, put in one or two words in Farsi, explain them in English and then finish the sentence in English again...and expect us to understand they've been speaking Farsi to begin with. I didn't read this book to learn Farsi, but I'd appreciate learning what some of the words mean and how they are important in the Afghan culture and relate to the protagonists' lives. I certainly wouldn't like to learn this the Hosseini way, who crams these words not two or three times per page, but five or six per paragraph, which gets old and confusing pretty soon. It's especially evident in the parts where Amir's father tries to speak English but does that poorly, without proper grammar and words, while in the next paragraph he's referring to Amir in a way of a proper Englishman. The reader is supposed to understand that father and son are speaking in their native language, but the transition between the two is never suggested in any way, there are no italics or quotation marks.Another important part of the novel are plot holes. Amir learns about them from Hassan of all people, who points out a glaring one in the story our hero has written. While the first part of the novel is relatively free of them, the second one is one big plot hole, full of implausible plot developments, that are overtly coincidental and very contrived. As mentioned, Amir is an aspiring novelist; he's very quick to get back on his feet again and publish four books in quick succesion, embark on reading tours without any sort of struggle or difficulty...and to top that marry a beautiful, young girl. What follows is a plot from some TV melodrama with impossible consequences - a street bum whom Amir meets is a university professor who knew his mother, Amir can't have children so there's a child to save, and most of all the evil bad guy who shows up is pretty much one of the worst bad guys of all time - Hosseini really outdid himself here and made him not only a sadist and a pedophile, but also a nazi.The biggest and most important plot points (involving emigration) which is quite an obstacle is solved by one phone call! ("" You know Amir, I just happen to have this uncle who...) Seriously, Hosseini got so wound up in the tragedies he made up for his character that he decided to get them out from the situation by the easiest of ways - cheating.I'm not saying that the events Hosseini writes about are not important, not that the story he aims to deliver is bland - there are twists that I didn't predict. It's just that it lacks so much in characteriation and plot development, depends too hard on cliches and deus ex machinas. It didn't made my heart soar as some said it would; certainly it's not ""the best book I have ever read"". Maybe because Hosseini tries too hard to manipulate emotions of the reader, and his attempts at metpahor and foreshadowing are ham-fisted at best. He concentrates on one theme, while ignoring others that are just as interesting.And The Kite Runner never even suggest an answer to the most important question - why weren't they wearing gloves?",91,0.9704,0.092,0.795,0.113,0.5399523607233887,NEGATIVE,0.9821
43,1521895,05/29/2007,5.0,"What a powerful story. I didn't think I was going to like this book as much as I did... but I really did. I got so involved in this book that my emotions were going haywire. Not just feeling happy and sad as you do with most books, but feeling anxious and angry and dissappointed. Everything these characters felt I began to feel. That's definitely the mark of a great novel and a great writer.One thing I think this novel really does is shed light on a situation we really don't know all that much about. It highlights a country we only see in stereotypical clips on the news, skewing our perception and making us think only of one type of world. The Kite Runner puts the world we either never saw or don't see into view. We think of Kabul and Afghanistan only as he writes it in the second half of the novel, most of us have never even thought about it in the way it's portrayed in the first half. And that's how Aghanistan was for the longest time.I think one of the most amazing things about this novel was the friendship between Hassan and Amir. It wasn't what you would think with, ""I don't care that he's in another race I'll defend my friend no matter what."" It was a real friendship against the odds. He didn't make it cute or fake, Hosseini made it raw and how it would really be in the world where a certain race is persecuted.The characters are also all well-developed and three demensional. Never once did I see a character that was just there to further the story along and then left, without a background or history to them. Every single character gracing that page had a soul and had a past.As usual there's so much more I want to say about this book, but for something this good you'll just have to read it yourself. Trust me, it may sound like something you really don't think you'd care for, but you'll be surprised how much Hosseini's writing and characters pull you in. Soon you'll find yourself very grateful you listened to me and picked up this book. Seriously, this book is worth your time.",87,0.9913,0.086,0.736,0.178,0.5362352462352462,POSITIVE,0.9999

 The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn. The more places you will go. 
 Quote by Dr. Seuss.Afghanistan, 1975: Twelve-year-old Amir is desperate to win the local kite-fighting tournament and his loyal friend Hassan promises to help him. But neither of the boys can foresee what will happen to Hassan that afternoon, an event that is to shatter their lives. After the Russians invade and the family is forced to flee to America, Amir realises that one day he must return to Afghanistan under Taliban rule to find the one thing that his new world cannot grant him: redemption.Having previously read this book when it was released back 16 years ago ( that is hard to believe) I was thrilled when it came up as a bubbly read as I felt I remembered enough about the characters and the story to make me want to revisit and discuss this one again. A great book is one that remains firmly is your memory and while you may not remember all the details you will certainly remember the plot line and the main characters. The Kite Runner is an emotional but stunning read with a remarkable sense of time and place. I loved the characters of the boys and that the book takes us from Afghanistan in the 70s to America shortly after 9/11. I love books that introduces to different cultures. Some aspects of the book make for difficult reading but as I discussion book I think this is going to be a great one.

They think everyone else does too.”An unlikely friendship between two young boys told against the devastating backdrop of the history of Afghanistan over the last thirty years.Oh, boy. This one really put me through the wringer. If I wasn’t wanting to batter Amir to death with said book because of his selfish childhood actions, I was sobbing crying on my knees shouting “Why, God? WHY?!” I feel like Hosseini was trying to personally destroy me with my feels.Luckily, I read to feel my feels. Whether that’s excitement, or rage, or tension, or fear, or that moment when you actually feel a pain in your chest and you sincerely hope that your Red Bull addiction hasn’t come back to haunt you and that it’s just an emotional pain deep in your heart. So, yes, Hosseini, you may have broken me, but I loved every minute of it The characterisation is just another level here. Within merely 30 pages I just knew that Hassan was a young boy who must be protected at all costs because he has the most pure heart and soul, and I may or may not be welling up again just thinking about him... As for Amir... we got off to a rocky start *see earlier book battering* but you were only a child and I see that in hindsight.I was worried I wouldn’t enjoy this as I am quite ignorant when it comes to politics in Afghanistan (or any politics, tbh) and I wasn’t sure if the book leaned heavily on this. Thankfully it did not, and any time politics did play a role, the narrator (Amir) explained it in a very accessible and easily digestible manner. Which I really do appreciate!This book is powerful and moving, and I have no doubt it will stay with me forever. My #jobis30before30 challenge has been worth it for this book alone - now a forever favourite.One of the nicest things about this challenge is that it allows me to recommend books to my mum (she ain’t about that horror life).

47,12435874,01/13/2008,5.0,"I have some criticisms for this book, but because I chewed through it in such a short amount of time, I'll start with what I like and move to the criticisms.I did NOT want to like this book. I am one of those annoying people who wants to dislike what everyone else likes, and wants to like what everyone else dislikes. Usually, this works out for me without effort; however, in the world of literature there are occasions that it does not. This was one of those occasions.The book was brutally heartbreaking, but redemptive. Relationships were richly developed, emotions piqued and dropped - hallmarks of a good story. One of my favorite things in literature is learning. If I learn from a book, I consider it valuable. Bite-sized foreign languages lessons will bolster a book's merit. This author taught me about the history, language, and geography of Afghanistan, and about the sport/hobby of kite flying/kite running. I've always thought that a person just bought a kite and flew it. I've never heard of coating the string in cut glass to cut down other kites.The book has numerous other redeeming qualities that are likely to make it a classic read, but it does have some flaws. One thing that just kept annoying me toward the end of the book was the names of John/Thomas and Betty Caldwell. The first time they're mentioned, they're Thomas and Betty Caldwell. The next time, they're John and Betty Caldwell. WELL? Which are they?? Where was the editor on this one? No, it didn't affect the story, and it shouldn't affect me, but it did. I kept finding my thoughts drifting. Because they were never real characters, did the editor/author not find them integral to the plot? Did they have the same issues with Thomases and Johns that I have with Kamals and Kamirs? Perhaps they're unfamiliar with the names, and so it was easy to make the mistake? I admit, I was plagued. I thought about removing a star for it, but we only have 5 stars with which to work, so I didn't.The next flaw is perhaps in my own ignorance, but I can't imagine Assef being in the Taliban. The tale describes him as blonde and blue-eyed. I don't imagine him being part of a hate-group that targets Americans as infidels if he so closely resembles one, but I have also heard that there are blonde and blue-eyed Afghans, so perhaps this is my own ignorance shining through. I have Afghan friends, but none of them has blonde hair, or blue eyes. Further, Assef is absolute evil from an age at which I'm not convinced that any child has such a developed sense of hatred, especially when we consider that, upon meeting his parents, we find them timid. Again, this could be my own ignorance of children outside of my own culture, but it's a bit tough to swallow. I didn't find it too difficult to suspend my belief, but there wasn't too much else in the tale that required such suspension.Overall, the book has all of the ingredients needed to create a great tale - whether or not it required some belief-suspension and some editorial errors. When I complete a book in one sitting, I cannot convince myself that I didn't enjoy it. I must be true to the obvious and give it 5-stars.",83,-0.962,0.131,0.772,0.097,0.5111111111111111,NEGATIVE,0.9998

Hassan is the son of a Hazara servant, Ali. The boys have a strong friendship growing up. Their favorite activities are Amir reading stories to Hassan, and them competing in the kite flying competition. Their friendship remains despite lies, jealousies, politics, sexism and cruelty. The distance between them does not dim the memories of each other, or the feelings the boys have for each other.This impressive novel reads like a fictional biography. We witness everything through the eyes of Amir. I want to label it a coming-of-age story, but it is so much more. The narrative is heart warming yet filled with danger. There is the rape of a child, and the violence of war and of cruel rulership written within this fictional account. We feel the friendship and the effect of lies. Amir's father tells him that the greatest sin is theft. He said, There is only one sin. And that sin is theft . . . . When you tell a lie, you steal someone's right to the truth. (225) This is powerful to me, but not as heart felt as Hassan's comment to Amir, ""For you, a thousands times over."" This statement expresses his closeness and loyalty to Amir. This powerful story will stay with me for a long time. I recommend it with the warnings listed above. ",75,-0.8897,0.17,0.651,0.179,0.6968915343915344,POSITIVE,0.9998

Hosseini, an Afghan-American tells a story where we discover Afghan cultural values, especially how the Taliban are evil in many ways.The Kite Runner's main theme is forgiveness. Amir forgave himself to make choices to fix his mistakes. The kite serves as a symbol of freedom for Afghan children but a different symbol by the end of the book. It explores a myriad of emotions like guilt, friendship, forgiveness, loss, sadness, anger, disgust, fear, shock, and every other emotion one can feel.Additionally, characters are very well developed. It truly made me fall in love as each of their stories developed. Again as in other books, the emotional aspect connecting me to this book is “cancer.” (Thanks for all your prayers)In conclusion, Hosseini did a brilliant job, especially in the last few chapters where he tears your heart with emotional struggles after every two or so pages.

63,374158589,07/22/2012,3.0,"“It may be unfair, but what happens in a few days, sometimes even a single day, can change the course of a whole lifetime...” Agh, a depressing book for sure. Beautifully written and authentic feeling, it also seems to be written for the shock effect of having almost as much tragedy as possible put into the pages. Just when there seems to be redemption and joy soaring my way, something else horrible happened to slap me out of my optimism.I wasn't sure whether to rate it 3 or 4 stars. On enjoyment level alone, it was definitely soul-wrenching and 3. On merit and writing style, it was inching toward 4. I'll slap up the four star and be done with the speculation.The protagonist isn't that likable. Khaled Hosseini shows that a poor decision made in a terrified child may need to be excused to a degree in a grieving adult, but this doesn't make it easier to endure as a reader. He did right himself in the end in his way, although it took awhile to get there and showed he did not have the strength of his father nor the easy honor of his friend Hassan. Clearly it just wasn't an ingrained personality trait, a pity that all the people in his life recognized by still loved him in spite of.The first part of the book was especially beautifully written as it captured that potent magic of friendship and bonding, but it soured quickly when racism and superiority inevitably paved its way in. Hassan was a beautiful character, almost a little too good to be true other than to stand as the martyr of the story, but it was still soul stomping to endure.Through the reading of this book there's a shroud of despair and sorrow that's impossible to shake, even when the book is done, which is a sign of an effective writer. Hosseini pens the words freely and with progress, so I'll be checking out more of his work but hoping it doesn't stab me in the heart quite the same way.I know little of the Middle East but this was an eye opener. Really sad stuff here with children, families, cultures. It was interesting to see different ways of life and how they bonded together in America at the market, and I'm happy that Hosseini held this way of life up for the intent to show the solidity of the culture. Despite this, there was a definite break and breaching in it which is one of two main themes of this story. There was racial divide amongst the ranks and also the crushing divisions of different power players - some who embraced the new world and some who existed in it just to survive but not accept. The other theme is forgiving yourself even if it's not fully possible to be granted pure redemption. The character would be totally unlikable if he didn't seek a relief of guilt and didn't feel that burden throughout this life. It took awhile for the guilt to fully grip him effectively, but at least that emotion shows regret. Despite that, he didn't go out of his way to combat the regret until so late in life. How nice it would have been to have looked up Hassan on his own without the pull of a dying friend pleading with him to do so.As a few others have said in their reviews, this isn't a book I want to revisit or reread. It's a sad, crushing story about the separation of friends from one who was unable to stand up for someone who stood up for him, and the instability of a culture that will still be shaking at its roots for a long time to come.",37,0.9622,0.145,0.689,0.165,0.6201665088383838,NEGATIVE,0.9996

66,7187420,10/02/2007,3.0,"SPOILERS AHEAD!!!so, it starts off strong. it almost feels like a biography, that's how real it felt to me. i actually looked on the back of the cover to see if it was based on a true story or something. one thing i noticed off the bat was hosseini's style of writing. it was an extremely easy read. i wasn't sure if this was so it would be accessible to a wider audience or so we could concentrate more on the story rather than the prose or what. what's ironic is that the narrator and protagonist is supposed to be a gifted writer. anyway, the writing wasn't the book's strongest point. honestly, the author of the inner elvis had much better descriptive writing.however, his simplistic writing style didn't take away from the emotions triggered in the story. i was practically bawling at every emotional scene. i have to say, though, that the rape scene, which is the first dramatic scene in the novel, was the best one. i know that sounds horrible, but it's timing and significance was on point. and that's where things kinda went downhill for me. even though i was caught up in the story, things became really cliche. amir and hassan are the two protagonists in the story. amir is the son of baba, a wealthy and admired male widower while hassan is the hare-lipped hazara, people who are regarded as scum of the earth according to afghani history. anyway, hassan and his father, ali, are servants for baba and amir, but they are viewed as family. it's a refreshing departure from what could easily be a cinderlla-type plot.anyway, amir is this really smart, well-educated pansy who can't stand up for himself for shit and hassan always backs him up, even taking on 3 guys on his own. there's a little rivalry between the two boys, with amir constantly testing hassan's loyalty and scoffing at him for seeming to be such a sucker. but when shit turns serious, amir doesn't return the sentiment.the year that amir won a kite flying competition, hassan takes off for the last kite and ends up being cornered by child-sociopath, assef, and his cronies. when hassan refuses to give up the fallen kite, assef rapes him in an alley and amir watches the whole thing from a hiding place because he's too afraid to jump in and protect his friend.as i kept reading, cliches and implausible coincidences start popping up everywhere. it turns out that amir and hassan are half-brothers. (i think i saw that plot-twist in days of our lives once.) when amir goes back to afghanistan to save hassan's now-orphan son, that son is held captive by --guess who?-- none other than assef who has become part of the taliban. the novel climaxes with assef kicking amir's ass. and who saves amir? hassan's son! with a fucking slingshot! (hassan was skilled at that, too.) amir gets reconstructive surgery and ends up with a scar down his lip like hassan had when he had surgery for his hare-lip. good lord. then there was this brief encounter where amir comes across an old homeless guy who just happened to know amir's mother before she died giving birth to amir. how would that ever happen?to be fair, it had a really good storyline. i still maintain that the first third was well executed. the beginning of the book stands its ground well, but that may have just made the rest of the book pale in comparison even more so. it almost felt like the author was desperately reaching for the audience's acceptance (it's his first novel). or he hurried through the rest of the book and needed to increase the tear-jerker factor exponentially by making me cry at every page to cover up the fact that he was running out of quality ideas. on a positive note, it might add more depth to an already mysterious and often feared culture in light of 9/11.but when all is said and done, it's still an interesting read. final word on the kite runner: i can't wait for the movie adaptation. hollywood would eat that shit up.",36,0.9743,0.087,0.788,0.124,0.5606896150444537,NEGATIVE,1.0
67,1676622,06/05/2007,2.0,"I had serious issues with this book. There might be spoilers below, if you're super-picky. But I'm not going to tell you about how Amir is actually, unbeknownst to the reader, the ghost of the patron saint of Afghanistan the whole time, or anything. Oh, damn.I hated the narrator's guts nearly immediately, and only partially got over that over the course of the novel. I'm fine with narrators I dislike--I LOVE Notes from the Underground, and that guy's the king of skeezes--but only if their voices are interesting enough to counterbalance whatever it is about them I despise.My problem with Amir is that for the boyhood section of the book, he's weak, cowardly, cruel, and dull. He's unapologetic about his really ugly personality, but he also completely fails to take any responsibility for himself. It seemed at times like he was boring himself with his own pettiness. If you're going to be an unpleasant person, I guess, at least take some pride in it. Enjoy your moral decrepitude. Own it. Amir cringes nonstop.Then there were the gratuitous Farsi vocab lessons. No one speaks the way Amir does, first in his native language, then translating for the invisible audience who only knows English. The author used language as a bland condiment instead of allowing for the slightest bit of mystery--part of the book's appeal is that it's about a place and groups of people about which we're woefully ignorant, but I thought allowing for that instead of belaboring every exchange between two Afghani men with explanations for the clueless Americans might have made it a stronger book. I'm OK using context clues once in a while, or wondering what nang and namoos are, besides silly words when I take them out of context.I don't have any complaints about the very moving and human drama that unfolds when Amir goes back to Afghanistan. The story kept me curious enough to keep reading through to the end even when the characters had exasperated me. The parallelism was so heavy-handed, though (GET IT??? His lip was SPLIT IN TWO! That's somehow FAMILIAR!) And I did think Amir managed finally to redeem himself, which is good, because I would have felt a Da Vinci Code sense of betrayal had he not, then thrown the book at the nearest wall.I'm looking forward to the movie.

The first 30% was so filled with raw emotion .It brought me back some memories of my childhood that I had forgotten. I was around the same age as the protagonist, back in 1975. I also (clueless) inflicted pain on insects (fireflies and cicadas were my favourite victims) and played with them just like described in this book. I also threw stones against mean dogs (my street in Brazil was filled with stray dogs). I also made and chased kites, together with my twin brother and neighbours. I remembered the excitement of waiting for a kite to get lost in the air and trying to figure out where it was going to land. I remembered the huge fights with the neighbours and the other kids, trying to catch that lost kite. I remembered the joy I felt when the kite fell on top of our roof or on top of one of our numerous fruit trees in our backyard.That kite competition was real, exciting and frightening at the same time. Yes. I was one of those kids. We did not have electronic games back then.I had forgotten all about it. And I cried when I realized.

While our main character Amir was struggling to gain attention and a loving connection from his father, I felt like I was doing the same with my own. Okay now that that’s out of the way, let’s get into the good stuff.Amir and Hassan were good friends as children. They were born and raised in Afghanistan, but Hassan was the son of the servant to Amir’s family. There was an awkward power dynamic between them heavily influenced by Hassan’s identity as a Hazara (I’m Hazara too!!) that played into the idea that he was beneath his “master.” Just how Amir deals with that is a common theme throughout the book. Obviously, he knows that discrimination against Hazaras — or any people, for that matter — is wrong, but what happens when terrorist groups like the Taliban take over the country and spread this hatred further? What happens when they claim ethnic cleansing is the will of God? Will Amir do the right thing? This was stunning, and I’ve never cried more reading a book ever. Like in my entire life. Reading this was crazy because I could even understand the little words in Farsi (Persian) the characters would use with each other. It made me feel so close to this book.

74,113033943,07/23/2010,5.0,"I felt a bit apprehensive picking up The Kite Runner, considering all the buzz about it. (I don't trust overhyped books.) But, thankfully, it lived up to the publicity. The story starts off set in Afghanistan, before the Taliban were in control and even before Russia began their campaign. It could have been set in the deep south of America prior to 1960 for that matter, or in Berlin right around the time Hitler reigned supreme, or perhaps more closely to regency England and colonial India- the climate is the same. Two little boys, one rich Pashtun, one of the servant class Hazara, two litle boys who shouldn't care about each other, yet they are friends- or as close to it as two opposing classes can be.My favorite stories are the ones that delve into the issues that darken a good man's soul. I love watching characters work their way to salvation. Some who didn't like TKR, say that Amir, the narrator and main character, is too selfish to be likable. And it's true, in the beginning, he is a bit selfish- he is not a nice little boy at times. In fact, his selfishness hits a low point when he sees his best friend, a servant boy named Hassan who is as close to him as a brother, viciously attacked- and stands by doing nothing to stop it. (It was a tough thing to observe as a reader!)Still, I believe in hanging with a character to see where the author takes them. Hosseini did a fine job of rescuing Amir, in my eyes. The hero's guilt-ridden conscience is what proves to me that he is in fact redeemable, after such an act of reprehensible cowardice. If Amir had moved on without a glance back, I would have thrown the book at the wall and not finished it.Thankfully I didn't have to. Eventually Amir grows to manhood, moves to America though not knowing what happened to his old friend (and too guilty to think about it), he marries, becomes a successful writer and, through it all, never lets himself find the forgiveness his soul so desperately wants. Don't fret, Amir gets the chance to go back to his homeland and make things right. And he does so in a way that broke my heart. (The last scenes had me in tears!!)Other criticisms for this book have said that it's too clichéd, too made for movieland. I have to agree, at times it was predictable- the ""big twist"" I saw coming a mile away, and I frankly wanted to shake Amir for not seeing it as soon as I did! All I've got to say is, what's so wrong with that?!Ok, I'll also agree with some other naysayers that say some of the plot resolutions for the characters were a tad convenient. But I seriously didn't notice it until I thought about it later- and read some of the reviews. I think I so wanted this to have a happy ending, I just went along with it.Anyway, despite the fact that I'm in agreement on some of these issues,(a bit, just a bit), I think the good far outweighs the bad. This is the kind of tale that sticks with you, the kind that I obsess over, much like I did when I first got a hold of Les Miserables. In FACT, much of what I adore about Les Miz is in this one. (And the author references Les Miz briefly just to prove the point!) Both the stories share the search for the balance of justice and mercy, of familial love and hate, and also finding forgiveness and the strength to pick ourselves up when we find our faces in the mud of guilt and shame.TKR is not a romance, but it is a love story. A love story between fathers and sons, and those we call brothers- of the heart, if not blood.

80,24352197,06/12/2008,3.0,"Consider me underwhelmed. The Kite Runner isn't a bad book, nor is it a particularly good book. Two boys are the best of friends, until a tragic incident tears them apart. One is doomed to live his life filled with guilt and the other is doomed to be unbelievably good no matter how tragic life becomes. Basically, it's A Separate Peace set in Afghanistan and, for my money, A Separate Peace is a far superior, more nuanced work. Despite my lukewarm reaction, I certainly wouldn't discourage anyone from reading it as there are some things to like. Let's review the good and the bad in list form, shall we? Things that I liked:*In terms of description, Hosseini is a gifted writer. His descriptions of people and of Afghanistan before and after the Taliban took control show the stark contrast between the more prosperous, westernized Afghanistan of the 1970's and the desperate, impoverished Afghanistan that was created by Taliban rule. I appreciate Hosseini's depiction of how some Middle Eastern countries have been crippled by Islamic extremism. For that alone, the book is worth the read.*Okay, in hindsight, I now realize that I probably should have titled that section ""Thing that I liked"" because I am drawing a blank.*Oh, hey! I thought of something else. I appreciate that it didn't have a ""happily ever after"" ending, which I thought it was recklessly careening toward. I thought Sohrab's reaction to his new surroundings as he coped with his past was authentic and heartbreaking.Things that I didn't love:*The relationship between Baba and Amir inexplicably changes after they arrive in America. While it is later revealed why Baba's attitude toward Amir changes, it seems too little too late.*I have to admit, I didn't like the two characters I was supposed to care the most about. Amir was self-centered and petty, while Hassan was unbelievably, ridiculously, annoyingly, and cloyingly good. *The obvious symbolism and predictable plotting began to wear on my nerves--especially toward the end. It's similar to those intricate domino designs that someone so elaborately and painstakingly sets up to knock down, all for the sheer joy of watching one domino slap into another. Each event so obviously leads to the next that I was constantly aware of the narrative as something contrived and something clever. I could never fully suspend disbelief. In fact, I began to play a game with myself: when presented with a new plot ""twist,"" I'd predict what it would lead to and then wait to see if I was right. I was always right.If I had read the book before all of the hype began, something might have been salvaged. However, given how ridiculously high my expectations were, the novel can't be entirely at fault for not living up to them. I still plan to read A Thousand Splendid Suns as I've been told it far exceeds The Kite Runner, but I'm quite willing and ready to leave the story of Amir and Hassan behind me.Cross posted at This Insignificant Cinder",33,0.9741,0.059,0.816,0.125,0.5928109133664686,NEGATIVE,0.9702

I did not rush through this novel, I read a few pages each night. Maybe that had an effect on how attached I became to the characters. Regardless, even if I read it one sitting I am 100% sure it would have been just as compelling. I liked the many themes and life lessons that you can take from this novel. It amazes me how one decision you make or don’t make can alter your whole life. Guilt is a strong feeling and if not dealt with properly it can literally consume you. I did not know much about the Middle East, it was sad reading about how corrupt people were and how much suffering the families had to endure. Although this was a fictional novel, I am certain that many similar (or worse) events occurred.

He is a coward - a jealous, envious coward with absolutely no integrity. Yet I get the feeling that readers are supposed to see that, and see beyond that, to feel a bit of empathy. To reach down into ourselves and see how we might react in similar situations. I reached down. Way down.

This time I'm reading for my brother's English project. And every time when I read, this novel touches my heart in the same way as it for did the first time. It's a tale about friendships and brotherly love and affection and also a bit about respecting one's country land. This book is about 2 boys, living under the same roof, nursed by the same mother, only difference between them is one is a Hazara boy, Hassan and another one, Amir, who belongs from the royal bloodline. But still this caste difference could never weaken their bond of friendship. In fact Amir and Hassan had a lot of other differences, like Amir being the physically weakest one, Hassan being the smartest and so on. There friendship suddenly takes a U-turn, When Hassan tries to save Amir from getting beaten by some rogue guys, Hassan gets sexually abused. Since the whole incident was witnessed by Amir's own eyes, eventually he became cold towards Hassan, basically felt shameful because, being a man, he didn't had the enough strength and courage to save Hassan from getting abused. Then there comes the period when Afghanistan gets invaded by Russia, following which Amir and his Baba jan fled to America leaving behind their name, money, property, memories, Hassan and everything. As time passed, Amir forgot about Hassan. But one day, he gets a call from his homeland, regarding a boy named Shorab, whom he had to save from getting prostituted. When he learns the truth about this kid being Hassan's only child, he jumps for his rescue, and fights with his life to save the boy from child prostitution and hence he finally adopts him and brings him back to America with him. That's how Amir honored Hassan's friendship and loyalty towards him. The writing style of the author is absolutely flawless and the evocative prose drew me in the moment I started reading it. He in fact layered his plot with deep, raw emotions that moved me thoroughly. As we read on this poignant and moving tale of two brothers, our eyes are sure to well up with tears and emotions. The narrative style is completely lyrical and is finely tuned with eloquence. The author brings out or rather say captures the glorious landscape of Afghanistan through his words with sheer intricate details that only made me feel like I'm standing in front of Hassan's house and watching the story unfold through my own eyes. Not only that the author have crafted the background with sensory details like smell, noise, etc. This novel is way too emotional and every time I read, I cry in the same way. Khaled Hosseini is indeed a master-story-teller who knows how to trade his readers to a far distant land through his story.

I have no words to express how exactly i feel now. I feel devastated, happy and angsty. I just loved this book. It certainly was not what i expected, i excepted this to be a heavy love story. In the end, it wasn't. It's about consequences, guilt, redemption and....well, just about everything. I felt like the writer tried to tell that karma is a bitch and that it will eventually screw you in the ways you can't even imagine. Besides, i don't believe in coincidences. First of all, i hated the main character, Amir (and for that, one half star less). I just couldn't believe how reckless, annoying, and cowardly he turned out to be in the beginning. He was given a choice, and he ran away from it. If he didn't do that, his life would be different. And so would be a life of his servant-best-friend Hassan. I loved Hassan, he was loyal, brave and honest. He would have done everything for Amir, and i really mean it, but when Amir betrayed that trust, everything went to hell. I don't remember when i felt such anger toward main character, but this one deserved it. Second, this book is extremely brutal. Like totally. It just felt devastating to read sometimes, and i cried and cried and cried. I thought that life isn't fair, and that it is horrible that horrifying destinies awaited such beautiful souls. In the end, it was well concluded and when i finished the book, i felt at peace (even though i cried last 30 pages or so, especially because of (view spoiler)[ Sohrab and because of what he had gone through.  (hide spoiler)]).

There were some plot twist here and there that i didn't expect, and i loved them. Writing was done excellently, and characters felt three dimensional.

“For you, a thousand times over” 

THAT LINE FUCKING SHATTERED ME!!!!The Kite Runner is a story that will haunt me forever. Never in my life have I read a book that impacted me as much as this novel did. It made me wanna change my life for real, not just in thoughts but also in actions. It’s funny how we take our freedom for granted despite the fact that other countries are still deprived and craving for it. This novel is a startling depiction of war, of desperation, hopelessness and most of all redemption, forgiveness and love.Reading the story of Amir and Hassan is a slap in the face and a splash of cold water that brought the startling contrast of reality. It showed me how petty I was, complaining about school works, slow internet connection and the food I bought but didn’t like. I hate myself for whining on things that other people would die to have.The author of this book is a magnificent writer, you can tell by the way he string his words together that he love his fellowmen, his country, his religion and his God. I bet that the mind of Khaled Hosseini is a morbid place because only people who suffered and survived could write stories as beautiful as this.This book is not for weak minded individuals. It tackled rape, suicide, massacre and treachery. All in extremes. I found myself crying almost in every page of this book, it’s only consist of 371 pages and took me two days to finish but it feels like decades have passed and it my eyes are red, puffy and swollen like I read a thousand pages of tiny words and had no sleep at all.I wish those zealots and officials so fucking full of hubris and greed will read this book and know that for every war they rage, every bomb they load and every bullets they unleash there will always be innocents caught in between.

88,4065859565,06/21/2021,5.0,"Only one word could describe this book and that is ‘masterpiece’. I flew through the pages and was easily enthralled with Hosseini’s simple yet meaningful and poignant narrative about family, betrayal, redemption, and forgiveness with a mix of class, culture, Islamic practices and beliefs, double standards, and parental pressure. As much as this was fictional, I couldn’t get off the thought of reading this as a memoir as I follow Amir’s (MC) struggles as a son to seek validation from his diplomat father and as a better friend to Hassan (their servant’s son) by repenting all of his contemptousness and inequitable treatment throughout the years.
“War doesn’t negate decency. It demands it, even more than in times of peace.”
Along with its great storyline, true to life characters, and equally grotesque and exquisite setting, I found it as a necessary read as I get to see how Afghans suffered during the fall of their coutry’s constitutional monarchy and the rise of foreign conquerors in which they were caught in the tide of war and destruction back in the day.
“After all, life is not a Hindi movie. Zendagi migzara, Afghans like to say: Life goes on, unmindful of beginning, end, kamyab, nah-kam, crisis or catharsis, moving forward like a slow, dusty caravan of kochis.”
Although I haven’t shed a single tear, the book was indeed a sad coming of age story of filial relationship and brotherhood.

Amir, being the son of the richest merchant of the city, has always been at the receiver end of all good facilities and treatment, which the son of an affluent father is expected to receive. Hassan, on the other hand, was the son of Amir's father loyal servant. He dedicatedly assist his father in doing all the household as well as external chores. Although these two boys belonged from two different strata of society, nevertheless they have spend their entire childhood in the embrace of each other's company. Amir, contrary to his father's expectations, was very sensitive from heart. His lack of bravado became his father's disappointment, who himself has always been appreciated for his unshakeable bravery.Adding to this, his father's soft spot for Hassan used to make him feel jealous and sometimes a bit angry too. One fine day, Amir and Hassan took part in a kight-fighting tournament, one of the most celebrated event of Afganistan. Amir was eager to win this game in order to restore back his claim on his father's love and care. Hassan, who from an early age has showed signs of honesty and loyalty towards his best friend, promises to help him in winning the significant event. But what happened later that day has shaken their hearts to the core. Neither of them have ever expected that one incident would impact their lives to such an immense level that it would be impossible for them to move past that memory. From that day onwards, the entire course of their lives has been utterly changed. Due to Russian invasion, many people has been forced to move out to some other place. Amir and his father has reluctantly shifted to America. While Hassan and his father moved to their native place. Over the course of time, distance has been widened between the two childhood friends, but the pile of remorse and guilt keep on increasing with each passing day. Amir could not convince his heart in justifying his behavior against the barbaric act which Hassan had become a victim of. Even after attaining a good position in his career and life, his heart was still seeking apology for the unrecoverable mistake committed by the twelve-year old Amir. Khaled Hosseini has painted a very impactful story of friendship, remorse and redemption. Through Hassan's character, he has established the mark of devotional and unconditional love. On the other hand, Amir and his father's character has shown how difficult it is to escape the repercussions of a wrongful act, whether done wittingly or unwittingly. Besides this, the misery that Afganistan people has been subjected to, the demolition of their peace and the dreadful and endless sufferings after Russia's outbreak into the country has been precisely highlighted. The heart-warming closure has surely added glitters to the gold.

90,3268240172,04/07/2020,4.0,"Reading ""The Kite Runner""In ""The Kite Runner"" Khaled Hosseini has written a widely-praised first novel which intertwines themes of sin, repentance, and redemption on an individual level with the political story of Afghanistan -- a story that captured the world's attention following the events of September 11, 2001.The main characters of the book are Amir, son of a wealthy businessman in Kabul, the father, or ""Baba"", and Amir's friend Hassan, who initially is presented as the son of a long-time servant of the family. Hassan is part of a Muslim group called Hazaras which suffered grave discrimination in Afghani society. He and Amir become fast friends until, at the age of 12, Amir betrays Hassan in a series of chilling incidents. Hassan and his father leave Baba and the employ of his family, and, ultimately, Baba and Amir emigrate to the United States with the Russian invasion of Afganistan. Amir's guilt accompanies him to America. As the story unfolds, Amir marries, becomes a successful novelist, is called back to Afghanistan by Rahim Kahn, his father's former business partner, and, after, extraordinary trials, achieves a measure of self-understanding and redemption.I found the novel worked better in parts than as a whole. The book features several raw, graphic incidents of violence and brutality which are well-prepared and convincingly portrayed. The picture of life in Afghanistan, prior to the overthrow of its monarchy, through the Russian invasion, and the triumph of the Taliban is convincing. Hosseini has a feel for his homeland and I thought upon completing the novel that I knew something that I had not known before about a land that had been totally obscure to me.I also greatly enjoyed the picture of Afghan emigre life in San Francisco, with its garage sales, attempts to adjust to a new culture and language, and attempts to maintain traditions. I thought the author gave a sympathetic portrayal of these emigres and their situation and, more importantly, wrote with an obvious affection throughout for the United States as a land still full of hope and opportunity for dispossessed people. This I found inspiring. Hosseini's theme could readily have degenerated into polemics.I thought the characterizations in the book and the development of the theme of sin and redemption effective on the whole. They were marred, for me, by too much melodrama and by clumsy, unconvincing plotting. The story line of the book is contrived and forced, particularly after Amir returns to Afghanistan. For all its violence, the story fits together too neatly with too many coincidences, taking a great deal away from the overall effectiveness of the novel.In sum, the book explores a universal human condition and does so well. There are moments of raw force in the writing. The picture of Afghanistan society is good, and the ideal the book holds up of American society is even better. The book, alas is weakened by its unconvincing, contrived plot line.Robin Friedman",24,0.9889,0.074,0.78,0.146,0.4866226366226365,POSITIVE,0.9995

I continued on and started to enjoy it about a quarter of the way through, and once I hit the halfway point I was hooked. I encourage you to read on if you're struggling with the first part of The Kite Runner. It's well worth the effort - especially when you keep in mind that this was a debut novel for Hosseini. Amir is a really interesting character to read about. He's cowardliness seems almost unforgivable at times, but he remains hyper aware of it and hates himself for it. It's actually nice to read about a flawed protagonist that struggles every day to come to terms with his past and present self. It's a long road to redemption for Amir and it really makes you question your own beliefs, and what you would do in someone else's shoes.It's not a perfect novel - there was a certain... obvious bias coming from the author surrounding the themes and while I agreed with him, I couldn't help wishing that he had been more subtle about it. As well, the climax is a wee fantastical - but nonetheless I am blown away and am looking forward to reading more of his work.",24,0.9766,0.152,0.633,0.215,0.550036075036075,POSITIVE,0.9995

 Emotional but Unfulfilling - 2.5 Stars 
Given the 1.25 million ratings this book has on Goodreads, there is a good chance that my review will not sway your opinion. Unfortunately for you, I am just conceited enough to believe that you should read my review and believe that my 2.5 rating better reflects the book than the average 4.21 rating! Of course I am joking around. This is a case where I have a hard time seeing the draw of the story when it has clearly appealed to many people. Plot summary This is essentially the life story of Amir, an upper class Afghan and the life long effect of his friendship with Hassan, his friend from a low and despised caste and his own father. As a young child, Amir lived a charmed life. He had everything he wanted except the unconditional love of his father. He had a best friend but the relationship was somewhat strained due to cultural prejudices. Amir is set to experience the greatest time of his life when he enters an annual kite flying contest. His dreams of a triumphant return to his father are dashed after he witnesses the rape of his friend Hassan. Struggling with his guilt, Amir begin a downward spiral of destructive behaviour. Soon after his behaviour changes, he is forced from his home as Russia invades and he begins a journey to a new life. The past haunts him and he is given a chance to atone for old wrongs. The Good The backdrop of Afghanistan was wonderfully drawn. It was the major reason that I did not rate this lower. After hearing of damage and destruction brought on by years of conflict, it was interesting to see a picture of the country before it was ravaged. Their food, their religion, their customs and their prejudices were on full display. The Afghan people are painted in a positive light. As a side note, all of the talk of naan made me go out and buy some. The author certainly made the local food sound delicious! The Bad Outside of the intial setting, there was little that I enjoyed.The novel was essentially one long flashback with flashbacks within the main flashback. I did not enjoy the method of storytelling as at times it felt like I was reading a 300+ page run on sentence.The story is not the least bit uplifting. It is a series of painful, life altering, distressing and depressing events. I appreciate that real life is not always happy and charming. These events are meant to create an emotional story. I am not opposed to emotional stories. Just read my reviews of The Starboard Sea or The Light Between Oceans. Both of those stories packed an emotional wallop. It was the manner in which  The Kite Runner  elicited emotion that left me cold. This book used good old emotional manipulation to drive this story. Just when you think there will be a ray of sunshine, another disaster occurs. In fact, feels as the main character Amir  wants  you to root against him. He is so unhappy with himself and caries such a sense or worthlessness that you can hardly believe that something good could happen to him. In this is one of my BIGGEST pet peeves. It is the character that continually laments and (figuratively) flagellates himself because of events that are either out of their control or not their fault. Much of Amir issues stem from an event that occurred in his childhood. He could never say to himself ""Hey. I was young and scared. There was nothing I could have done"". Characters like Amir lack basic insight into themselves and make reading about them frustrating and not the least bit compelling. Final Thoughts I did not enjoy this one and would not recommend it. While I enjoyed the background, the action up front left me dissatisfied and occasionally frustrated. It is this one man's opinion that this book is seriously overrated.   Content Advisories  It is difficult to find commentary on the sex/violence/language content of book if you are interested. I make an effort to give you the information so you can make an informed decision before reading. *Disclaimer* I do not take note or count the occurrences of adult language as I read. I am simply giving approximations.Scale 1 - Lowest 5 - Highest Sex  -  2.5 There is a moderately graphic scene of a young boy being raped. Some version of the event is relived within the mind of Amir throughout the book. Late in the book there is allusion to another young boy being subjected to sexual abuse. Language  -  2 There is some name calling of a cultural/racist nature. Some the terms were not familiar to me and may be lost on you as well. Violence  -  3.5 As stated above, there was a moderately graphic rape scene. It was proceeded by violence. There was fight between two people that resulted in one person in the hospital and another suffering a gruesome injury. There is description of people being shot in the street and stoned in front of a crowd. When modern Afghanistan was discussed, violence followed",22,-0.9925,0.176,0.684,0.14,0.5066869300911853,NEGATIVE,0.9998
106,1970883953,08/14/2017,1.0,"0 stars and hours of my life that I want back. I hate this book. It is why I laugh at the NYT bestselling list as an indicator of quality. It is contrived, full of ridiculous coincidences. It is heavy-handed, slamming you over the head with every symbol and theme. Like The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and The Perks of Being a Wallflower, it uses rape to emotionally manipulate the reader and become a bestseller immune to criticism. It is for white Americans to read and then feel worldly and sanctified in their deep understanding of a region that their own country has been bombing to pieces, while letting them still feel culturally superior. Its portrayal of the Taliban is of one-dimensional evil, not exploring it or its history in any depth whatsoever. First of all, I hate plotlines based on a relatively small interpersonal misunderstanding that gets unnecessarily blown up over months or years. They are so frustrating. The conflict between Amir and Hassan could have been solved with a simple conversation; thus, Amir's eternal angst feels repetitive and pointless. Thematically, this book makes no sense. The incongruity between the Amir/Hassan conflict and the Assef/everyone conflict creates a fractured narrative. The narrative arc surrounding Amir and Hassan seems to suggest that small-mindedness is the cause of conflict; that it's important to embrace relationships while you can. In contrast, the main villain, Assef, is some sort of one-dimensional Voldemort who goes around raping people, and who Amir defeats in a climactic fight. Perhaps this could have been meaningful had Hosseini written a book about how sexual violence affects its victims, but he didn’t. So, what IS he trying to say?Regarding Assef, like I said, he's just such a flat antagonist. ""The Taliban is evil because this character who leads it is a pedophilic rapist!"" Okay yeah no, Hosseini needs to go deeper if he's trying to make insightful statements about conflicts in the Middle East.In a far-fetched way, everything seems to exist for the sole purpose of carrying Amir's personal conflict and development, which leads to Amir's redemption arc being flawed. Rather than coming from inside him, it is the result of external circumstances, not of his own active choices or realizations. In particular, there's Sohrab, the grand deus ex machina of all deus ex machinas: Hassan's young child, at exactly the right time, in exactly the right conditions, tying up every single loose end. Amir can conveniently save someone from sexual abuse now, cope with Hassan's death, finally deal with the ghosts of his past and stop hating himself, and—the cherry on top—raise the child he and what's-her-name-without-a-personality he can't conceive. Oh, the PERFECT solution to EVERYTHING, a coincidence like the ones that apparently happen all the time in Afghanistan! (Regarding him, what 5 year old even knows what suicide is, let alone that you can commit it by slitting your wrists, with a razor?) Lol bye.Also, I genuinely cannot tell whether Hosseini is condemning homosexuality by writing about a pedophilic gay male rapist, or normalizing the fact that men can be raped.

It is a story of two boys Amir and Hassan, based on Afghanistan. They grew up together, but an incident after the kite tournament changes the dynamic of their relationship. Amir's father is a well-known and respected man in Kabul. He always stood up against the wrong, but his son lacks this quality. Whenever someone troubles Amir, he does nothing. It was Hassan who stood for him, fight Amir's battles. Hassan considered him as his best friend, but for Amir, he was just a son of a servant. When he needs Amir's help the most, he turned his back. The guilt stayed in his heart for the rest of his life. Soon things started to change politically in Afghanistan, and Amir and his father flee to America. They both miss their time spent with Hassan, his father Ali, and Rahim Khan, but they acquainted with their new life shortly. Amir married to Soraya and living a sound life. But a phone call from Pakistan changes his life forever. It was Rahim Khan who was dying and wanted to meet him. Amir knows in his heart that it is a bad idea to go there, but he still proceeds and discovered the truth about Hassan and his family. He travels to Kabul to settle some old debts and seeking redemption. The trip alters his life forever. Everything he knows about his motherland is changed now. People lost humanity, hope. The gruesome murders, corruption is the new reality of Afghanistan. In the midst, Amir tries to do some good for the sake of his lost friend Hassan. So, that he can earn some dignity and self-respect, he always lacks. Khaled Hosseini wrote an artistic, but a melancholic tale. One can feel the pain of Hassan, and all the other boys, who go through debasement. This book leaves a long sadistic impact on me. The language is lucid, the narrative is smooth.

Ils ont grandi ensemble, mais un incident après le tournoi de cerf-volant change la dynamique de leur relation.Le père d'Amir est un homme bien connu et respecté à Kaboul. Il s'est toujours opposé au mal, mais son fils n'a pas cette qualité. Chaque fois que quelqu'un dérange Amir, il ne fait rien. C'était Hassan qui le défendait, combattait les batailles d'Amir. Hassan le considérait comme son meilleur ami, mais pour Amir, il n'était qu'un fils de serviteur. Lorsqu'il a le plus besoin de l'aide d'Amir, il lui tourne le dos. La culpabilité est restée dans son cœur pour le reste de sa vie.Bientôt, les choses ont commencé à changer politiquement en Afghanistan, et Amir et son père se sont enfuis en Amérique.

Mais un appel téléphonique du Pakistan change sa vie pour toujours. C'était Rahim Khan qui était mourant et voulait le rencontrer. Amir sait dans son cœur que c'est une mauvaise idée d'y aller, mais il continue et découvre la vérité sur Hassan et sa famille.Il se rend à Kaboul pour régler certaines anciennes dettes et demander le rachat.

“The generation of Afghan children whose ears would know nothing but the sounds of bombs and gunfire was not yet born.”
I understand now how this book is a classic. I really enjoyed reading it, even though I found it uneven in term of quality, and it was really educational. I vaguely knew that Afghanistan has been through a lot, but this book made me realize how much I lack in world history (I was ashamed when I told my boyfriend about I was reading a book setting in Afghanistan in the 1970s and he was like “Right, then the Russian will come, then the Talibans” I felt so stupid not knowing that). So as I said, the story takes place in the 1970’s in Afghanistan, we’re following Amir a rich Afghan boy and his everyday life with Hassan the son of his father’s servant. But Hassan is a Hazara, and his people are persecuted by most Afghans, treated like dogs, yelled insults at when they walk in the streets. Amir knows about that and avoids hanging out with Hassan in front of others Afghans, even though he considers him as his best friend. Amir doesn’t stand up for himself nor his friendship, but Hassan is quite the opposite. He defended Amir many times, risking his safety while at it. Hassan’s loyalty is dangerous, the day he stood up to a group of bullies in order to protect Amir, they promised to make him pay. 
“You’re a prince Hassan. You’re a prince and I love you”
In Kabul, there is a Kite Fighting contest, it’s a tradition and it takes place every year. There are two winners, obviously the last kite standing wins (which is Amir’s specialty), but also the one who catches the last kite that has fallen. (and this where Hassan has a gift). Amir, in constant seeking of affection from his father wants to win the contest, and he does, while Hassan goes running the last kite. Not seeing him coming back, Amir started looking for Hassan, and saw him cornered in a street by those bullies. When they begin to rape him all Amir can do is hide. Guilt he’ll have to carry his whole life.This first third of this book (basically until the Russian arrive and Amir and his father fled the country) was the best part for me. It was hard to read, yes, but it really was the part that touched me the deepest, and it was the promise of a 5 star read. But along the way, I began to get bored, as the second third was not interesting to me, I wanted to know about Hassan who stayed in Afghanistan, not of Amir seeking a wife in America. The love interest part really bugged me story wise. It was interesting to see how war immigrates lose everything and have to start over in a new country, but it sounded more like a documentary and less than a fiction, which was a total shortage with the first third. 
“That’s the real Afghanistan, Agha sahib. That’s the Afghanistan I know. You? You’ve always been a tourist here, you just didn’t know it” 
The last third managed to make me regain some interest, I liked how Amir had to atone his past’s mistakes, to overcome his guilt. I enjoyed especially how as a grownup he could realize how he was a privileged child, because it’s easier to blame an adult than a child for his mistakes, and as an adult he couldn’t realize the depth of what he’d done without doing this trip into his past. One of the other point I liked the most about this book was 
the food
! I’m a huge fan of Indian-Pakistani food (naan, pakoras, chicken tikka masala tandory, basmati rice…) I could visualize most of what he was describing and I spend so many time drooling! Really, this book even made me order so many take-out I’m ashamed! Moreover, I loved the way young-Amir narrated the story, it was so innocent and gullible and yet funny at some part, I really spend a good moment reading through his eyes for the first third (for instance, this quote made my day “Afghan tendency to exaggerate – sadly, almost a national affliction; if someone bragged that his son was a doctor, chances were the kid had once passed a biology test in high school.”)

115,259339958,04/16/2017,4.0,"I found it a very compelling read. Amir is, in my opinion, not a likable protagonist, but that didn't make me any less interested in what happens to him. I think I liked A Thousand Splendid Suns just a tad more. It was fascinating to get an inside view of the dramatic events of the Taliban takeover. That pretty much happens offstage in this book, but the glimpses into the Afghan culture are extremely interesting.*** SPOILERS AHEAD ***Amir is not a nice person. Yeah, I know, I know--he's just a kid, and a motherless kid at that. Yeah, he's always trying--and failing--to win his father's approval. Amir's dad is like the guy who was the star of the football team in high school. He has a son and waits eagerly for him to grow up and continue his legacy, only to find that his son is a book nerd. Not only is he disappointed, but he's puzzled. Where did this strange creature come from? That's tough for a kid to deal with, but it doesn't excuse the pretty big character flaws this situation teases out of Amir. I felt like the things he did to Hassan as a kid were so terrible. A small child, say, five or six, is thoughtlessly cruel to his friend. At that age, they're not really able to empathize too well. They're often not able to look past their own feelings to acknowledge that the feelings of others exist, especially when they're in distress. Amir, however, is twelve. Twelve is old enough to appreciate the difference between right and wrong, and also old enough to have formed a personal moral code. Pelting Hassan with pomegranates is so cowardly--Amir's not brave enough to use his own fists, and he's hurting and humiliating someone who refuses to fight back. I know Amir is trying to assuage his own guilt, but a twelve-year-old is old enough to understand the cruelty of kicking someone when they're down. How could he do that to Hassan, knowing what he had already been through? Framing him for theft is in another class--that's diabolical. He knows he is essentially evicting not only Hassan, but Hassan's dad, as well, from the only life they've known. Hassan and his father have never been anything but good to Amir, and this is how he repays them. I was just struck by Amir's selfishness throughout the book. He destroys Hassan and his father's life and never looks back. When Baba moves them to America and takes a job working twelve hours a day in a garage to support his son and put him through college, Amir complains about Baba's expectations and concludes that he has made too many sacrifices for Baba. Really? You consider driving Hassan away a sacrifice for Baba's sake? It broke Baba's heart! When Amir goes to Afghanistan to retrieve Sohrab, he says he has to go quickly, without thinking about it, or he would back out. Once there, he finds out his true relationship to Hassan and Sohrab. Even knowing that Sohrab is his nephew, Amir is still planning on handing him over to strangers after he finds him. It doesn't even occur to him to take the child home with him until later. He does show some courage in confronting Taliban members in his search, but I'm not sure he fully appreciates the level of danger he is in. Would he have gone into that house if he had known that the man inside was Assef? Maybe, but I tend to think no. Once in there, instead of rescuing his nephew, his nephew has to rescue him.I think Amir shows growth, but he doesn't completely redeem himself--at least, not in my eyes. I did really enjoy the book, though. It's an engrossing story, and the ending doesn't fully whitewash the tragedy that goes before. That's okay--that's how real life goes. We make mistakes, and we try to make up for them, but no one is able to erase the past. It haunts us, no matter how hard we try to escape it.",21,-0.9544,0.147,0.734,0.119,0.5559725183605779,POSITIVE,0.8995
116,6386249,09/18/2007,5.0,"Oakland Airport. Finished my last book...what more can I say? Okay, well I feel like a real jackass because I was, honestly, feeling pretty stupid reading this, hence the disclaimer above. It's like when I took the cover off the Da Vinci Code so nobody would know I was really reading it...but, um, holy cow this book was amazing. I was truly never bored, never skipped a passage, hung on every word, loved every character. I cried, really and truly cried during some of the sadder parts (no spoilers--although it was interesting to find Afgans care about the endings of things and there's no such thing as a ""spoiler."")I knew nothing of this culture, which is probably sad, but I think I've taken great care to avoid it--I don't watch the news or anything, and I suppose it would be pretty absurd of me to think I've come to grips with the entire middle Eastern situation via a best seller (that's precisely why I hated people's thoughts on The Da Vinci Code--it made people who hadn't read a book in years suddenly want to talk about books, which should be a good thing but the book snob in me felt really offended by this, especially since there are other books, better books on the same subject matter--that book was really fun, I admit it, but seriously, it SUCKED all in all, let's be honest, it was sad to read, like if you had to hear some one with broken English recite The Lady of Shallot or something), but, I digress--anyway, it's just, for me, this was at least a bit enlightening (and I promise I'm not going to start soapboxing at coffee shops and thinking I'm an authority on Afgan culture now), and just...a fantastic read. This was a flawless bit of story telling combined with a really helpful look into a culture that's very much in the public-eye and kind of reassuring, really human sort of approach to providing some insight into a culture I knew nothing about and didn't really intend to research. Now I know I will--this book was a stepping stone and at least got me interested and that's exactly why I love reading and books, because this is what education SHOULD be, you know?

A leaf in the woods, shaking in the wake of a startled bird's flight.This was my second read through of The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini and my perspective of the book has changed. I always remember it being a good read but this read through has provided a lot more.The book delivers a simple plot with a clear message: Redemption. It captures you into a story of love, envy, heartache and strength whilst surrounded by hate and war. The protagonist Amir tells the story as his own and makes it clear as a child he longs for the love of his father, willing to sacrifice anything to gain it. The book could be best described with the biggest cliche as a roller coaster as your emotions are up and down throughout.Amir's most consistent partner is emptiness regardless of his achievements and it's this which leads him to forming the habit of suppressing his thoughts and never facing anything head on. The book holds no prisoners and allows you to experience feelings at opposite ends of the spectrum, I actually stopped reading last night as I was left sickened and shocked during the latter end of the book.Reading the book from a Western perspective was fascinating as the way of life is completely different for your typical Afghan. The visual descriptions are always beautiful and poetic and there always seems to be strict household rules among all families. I could even go as far as saying I gained insight into a completely different culture.My one bug bear is the fact that Khaled Hosseini seemed to try a bit too hard to reconcile certain parts of the story which came across as a bit far-fetched. Nonetheless it's an excellent read with a stunning but heartbreaking story.If you've read this or are planning to, please share your thoughts.",26,0.9829,0.115,0.704,0.181,0.4970127865961198,POSITIVE,0.9994
118,1310360067,06/17/2015,4.0,"I went through a bit of a slump while reading this book which resulting in it taking me over a month to finish. It was an entertaining, informative, and heartbreaking story of two boys growing up in Afghanistan on opposite sides of the social hierarchy. Having the knowledge today of what the Taliban did to the people of this area during their rein, it is hard to imagine that the Afghani people at one point in time saw them as their saviors. I was heartbroken for both Amir and Hassan in this story. Amir always sought the approval and love of his father but rarely ever got to experience either. Hassan simply loved Amir and wanted to please him in every way possible. (view spoiler)[Life would have been so much easier for both boys if Baba had admitted he was also Hassan's father. Amir wouldn't have been jealous of the attention and affection Baba showed Hassan, and Baba most likely wouldn't have resented Amir and the love he was able to show him publically. I know it isn't that simple, though, because of how society functioned - and still functions - in this part of the world. It was also extremely heartbreaking to learn about the orphans the Taliban has left in Afghanistan. I don't understand how anyone can be so cruel to other human beings. I don't understand how they feel like slaughtering entire helpless families is the will of God. When reading about Assef, it felt like he was using it as an excuse to do the evil that was already in his heart. Maybe others use it for their excuse as well.

It would be too simple to say that the whole story stems from the boyhood friendship of Amir and Hassan and their teamwork in becoming kite champions of Kabul, but that is the way that it is. However, there are a hundred sub-plots adding complexity which is necessary to complete the picture. The overtone of their fathers' life-long friendship, the changes to their country that come with the Russian invasion and the subsequent dominance of the Taliban, an early lie as one friend betrays the other. There is so much contrast in this book: love and hate, kindness and cruelty, grief, happiness and sadness. It stirs every possible emotion in the reader, and one cannot escape without shedding a few tears. Those who believe that they understand the recent history of Afghanistan, but have formed those opinions around what they have learned from the newspaper and television reports, need to read this book to gain a new perspective. Even if you would not put yourself in that class, you should still read The Kite Runner. A book that cannot be ignored. ",18,0.9101,0.117,0.706,0.176,0.4818344155844157,POSITIVE,0.9963
120,3151668281,01/20/2020,4.0,"I have mixed emotions about this book. The first chapters reminded me of Angela’s Ashes by Frank McCourt, a book I really enjoyed. In that book, a young boy grew up in poverty-stricken Ireland; in this book, a young boy grows up in a wealthy family, set in Afghanistan before the series of wars tore the country apart. Apart from the lack of humour in The Kite Runner, the tone and style of the two books are similar.As I started to read, I thought The Kite Runner was also a true story, but my suspicion arose as the story progressed. A quick Google search told me it was fiction: disappointed, I kept reading. (I wanted it to be true).The further I delved into the book, the more obvious and predictable the contrivances became, which made the end fall flat. Also, there is stuffing and repetition between high points and I found myself muttering to Mr Hosseini, “Get on with it!”But there is much in this book to like: the delightful insight into Muslim society, the acute observations of Afghanistan’s tragic recent history, and the many powerful emotional tugs on the heart.",18,0.7039,0.076,0.813,0.11,0.5607971014492754,NEGATIVE,0.9938

The Kite Runner is the story of two boys, Amir and Hassan, whose friendship as young boys is shattered by an event neither of them will speak of for years to come. As their home of Afghanistan is torn apart by war, their lives head in vastly different directions; Amir and his father escape the war in America, while Hassan remains behind and starts a family. A quarter of a century later, Amir has the chance to amend the consequences of a decision he made and regretted for the rest of his life.As always, I'm eager to learn more about different countries and cultures through books. This is the first book I've read set in Afghanistan and Hosseini paints a devastating picture that is unfortunately still pertinent today. I appreciated the depiction of Amir and Baba's refugee status in America, their dreams of a better life, but also their lingering love for their war-torn  watan . Languages nerd over here really loved Hosseini's inclusion of Farsi words, as well as the insight into traditions and customs of Afghan culture!Unfortunately, the book is not all language-learning and wedding ceremonies. There is also the heartbreak part. Hosseini successfully manipulated my tear ducts into releasing some kind of liquid several times during the book. Seriously, The Kite Runner is just a series of heartbreaking events, one after the other. But this is not a bad thing! Yeah it's tough going, but Hosseini's writing is gorgeous, and even the after toughest scenes (spoiler/trigger: sexual abuse) you still kept going because you become entwined in the lives of Amir and Hassan, you can't let them go until the end, and not even then.

143,2953112326,09/13/2019,1.0,"The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini made me cringe. It reminds me very strongly of Markus Zusak’s The Book Thief because they both share the same kind of forced tear-jerker, weepy, artificially amped up emotionalism. I hate that kind of crap. Both of those novels are what I call grief-porn: novels written with only one intent—to pile on the sadness in the most dramatic and artificial ways possible to elicit the most sadness in readers, to absolutely wallow in the characters’ grief to a sickening degree. Novels like this are repugnant.Amir and Hassan are boys born so close together that they nursed from the same breast. Although the boys are very close, they are separated by their status in life: Amir is a Sunni Pashtun with a powerful and wealthy father and Amir is a Hazara, an ethnic race descended from Mongols who follow Shiite Islam. The Hazaras are harassed by the Pashtuns. Hassan is also the son of their servant and is actually Amir’s servant, so their friendship is a complicated one. The novel follows the path of their friendship from beginning until its traumatic end, an ending that causes guilt in Amir. The wars in Afghanistan force Amir and his father to escape to Pakistan, then eventually to the United States. Amir loses touch with his Afghanistan roots until Rahim Khan, a friend of his father, asks him to return to Pakistan. Amir goes because Khan tells him there is a way “to be good again” and redeem his guilty conscience.I bought this book a long time ago when it was getting rave reviews and I put it on my crowded book shelf and never read it. I pulled it down with absolutely no expectations from it other than to immerse myself in a different culture and perhaps learn something about Afghanistan. This novel failed me even in this, my most basic expectation. The Kite Runner is a frustrating novel because it has the potential to be very good, but the author fails to meet the challenge of writing complex characters. Instead, the characters are entirely predictable and forgettable. There is no depth to this story—a story which should have layers of depth. Unfortunately, again and again, the author sidesteps the difficult parts of the story to present readers with lots of drama and emotion but very little subtlety. The characters are simple. Hassan represents love in its purest form. He does not envy, he is brave, he is trusting, he is forgiving, and he turns the other cheek many times over. I am not familiar enough with Islam to compare him to one of that religion’s holy figures, so let’s say he is the Islamic Jesus—the most idealistic, Sunday-school, let’s not really-read-the-Bible-and-bring-facts-into-it vision of Jesus. When Amir is cowardly, Hassan beats off the bullies. When Amir is cruel, Hassan is loving and self-abasing—or at least shows incredible amounts of humility. He loves Amir and tells him: “for you, a thousand times over” (a sickeningly pious phrase that causes nausea as soon as I read it). It’s clear immediately that Amir does not deserve this love. He is, basically, a shithead. The author is so successful in painting Amir as a shithead (but, oh, such a guilt-ridden shithead! Why must he be such a shithead when he knows it’s wrong? One word: jealousy. Let’s all sigh with exasperation over such a fucking obvious plot point) that I dislike him immediately and my opinion never wavers. He sees how much Hassan enjoys being read stories, but refuses to teach him because he likes the power of knowledge and status he holds over Hassan; in every instance, Amir chooses to be a cowardly shithead and he’s so boring, so mundane in his awfulness that I don’t care about him—which is unfortunate because Amir and his journey to being a better person is the whole point of the book. Yuck.The problem with this book being about Amir’s path to salvation (this book is full of all sorts of religious connotations) is Amir is not interesting. Hassan, despite his undisputed purity, intrigues me more. He’s clearly very intelligent and the better person—does he not feel anger about his position in life? Having his closest (and only) friend deny their friendship when it’s inconvenient to him? What’s going on in his brain? But alas, Hassan is merely a convenient prop for the author to beat up; terrible things, including the Life-Changing Incident, happen to him constantly and he must passively accept them. After all, he is the vehicle that provides Amir with his worst moral losses and his moral redemption. Hooray for stock characters!There are way too many coincidences. The author (and readers who love this book) probably see these events as life balancing itself—that they were “meant” to be. I consider them cheap and easy plot plots designed to make certain readers tear up with emotion. These events are: (view spoiler)[Hassan just so happens to be his half-brother; Hassan has a son who needs to be rescued from Assef, the evil boy from their childhood who has become (as expected) an evil man who rapes children; when Amir fights Assef to rescue Sohrab (a fight that Amir miraculously wins despite all the odds), he ends up with a split lip…a split lip that will leave him with a scar exactly like Hassan’s scar from his harelip!; Hassan couldn’t smile after the Incident and Amir can’t smile for weeks after fighting with Assef, the perpetrator of the Incident; Amir and his wife are mysteriously unable to have children—not so mysterious when you consider the author left them barren for a reason: Sohrab would eventually and oh-so-conveniently drop into their lives; and the kite-fighting at the end—OF COURSE that would be the one thing to bring Sohrab out of his depression—flying kites! The author solemnly closes the novel with the shithead Amir vowing to his nephew: “For you, a thousand times over” and this vomit-inducing bit of sentimental crap at the end: It was only a smile, nothing more. It didn’t make everything all right. It didn’t make anything all right. Only a smile. A tiny thing. A leaf in the woods, shaking in the wake of a startled bird’s flight. But I’ll take it. With open arms. Because when spring comes, it melts the snow one flake at a time, and maybe I just witnessed the first flake melting (371). Congratulations, Khaled Hosseini, you scored a million points on my Barf-O-Meter scale.  (hide spoiler)]As for this novel being a fascinating look inside Afghani culture and history…um, no. The author skips anything that would give this novel that kind of depth. I learn very little about Afghanistan, pre-Soviet invasion. The Soviet invasion, the toppling of the aristocracy (?), Amir and his father’s flight to Pakistan and how they got into America…forget it. The reader gets very basic details. How did Amir and Dad get citizenship in America? Who knows. Was it difficult to assimilate? Maybe. Certainly there’s a hint that Amir’s dad struggled. This novel takes place before and after the events of 9/11. There’s absolutely NO exploration of those events. Nothing. Nada. They may as well not have happened at all. The only thing Amir mentions is wow, lots of American flags being flown now. Really? That’s it? No heightened tensions? No white people looking at you suspiciously because you happen to resemble the 9/11 terrorists and are Muslim? Nothing? And when (view spoiler)[ Amir wants to bring Sohrab to America (which causes the novel’s second biggest Incident—and it’s so fucking manufactured and stupid my eyeballs caught on fire when reading it—and he’s told, oh, that won’t happen but then—magically—his wife makes it happen—there’s no discussion of how this happened. Just, a friend of the family contacted the wife and shazaam! Sohrab’s in America. Again, hooray for taking the easy way out! (hide spoiler)]. Writing this review has made me hate the book more than I initially did upon finishing it. So much about this novel is repugnant to me, but what I despise the most is the very calculated manner in which the author crafts scenes that luxuriate in horrific details that are not necessary to the plot or to rouse the reader’s compassion. One perfect example: (view spoiler)[ We already know that Sohrab cuts himself and almost dies in this suicide attempt. We know the scene was bloody. We can imagine what it looked like when Amir found him in the bathtub. However, the author is not satisfied with us merely imagining it, he has to take us through Amir’s step-by-excruciating-dramatic-step imagining of the scene: Sohrab filling the tub with warm water, “twisting the razor handle and opening the twin safety latches on the head, sliding it between his thumb and forefinger. I pictured him lowering himself into the water, lying there for a while, his eyes closed. I wondered what his last thought had been as he had raised the blade and brought it down” (351). The only reason to write that scene is to further horrify the reader and double the emotional impact—grief porn. (hide spoiler)] And just when you’d think it’s impossible for me to despise Amir (and this fucking awful book) anymore, this scene on page 355 caused me to write in my notes: “oh, fuck you”: (view spoiler)[Sohrab is recovering in the hospital from his suicide attempt and is not speaking (imagine that). Amir is trying to cheer him up (“hey, you’re coming to America with me! Now! Forget about all those other empty promises I made you—this one’s for reals!”) but it’s not working and Amir is now begging for forgiveness (Sohrab’s bakhshesh, a sample of one of the many words and phrases the author drops into the book willy-nilly to assure the reader of European descent that yes, she is reading a culturally-diverse novel). Sohrab isn’t buying that either and this is what the Shithead thinks: “As I waited for his reply, my mind flashed back to a winter day from long ago, Hassan and I sitting on the snow beneath a leafless sour cherry tree. I had played a cruel game with Hassan that day, toyed with him, asked him if he would chew dirt to prove his loyalty to me. Now I was the one under the microscope, the one who had to prove my worthiness. I deserved this.”  (hide spoiler)] Oh, fuck you, Amir. You don’t have a clue. The Kite Runner is a fucking awful book. It misses the opportunity to place the characters within the context of historical events and does a piss poor job of recreating Afghanistan for me. The characters are there simply to carry out a moral message—quite frankly, they are so badly formed they could be of any ethnicity or religion because their ethnicity and religion don’t matter to the events in the book. Amir is a jerk, Hassan is a good guy, Assef the bully…put them anywhere and the major plot points can stay exactly the same. The book is written to maximize the tear-jerker and emotional response of readers and that’s despicable. ",16,-0.9974,0.156,0.718,0.126,0.5818092134432917,NEGATIVE,0.9999

“some stories don't need telling” 
Sometimes reading a book HURTS. Very much. It hurts like hell, and this book made me realize this.
“it always hurts more to have and lose than to not have in the first place.”

“It may be unfair, but what happens in a few days, sometimes even a single day, can change the course of a whole lifetime...”
 No matter how many times I try to edit this review, deep inside I know I'll never be able to express my feelings towards this book, and how it pulled me into its abyss of beauty within despair. This one shows that Love is not only confided to certain people. Everyone is allowed to love, to feel, to befriend. And that is the greatest gift to be savored by mankind. I still remember closing the book and just realizing that I am so lucky, so lucky then millions of others who have to face true hardships of life. It made me feel for them. It made me love this world a little more than before. It made me embrace my hardships and gave me the will to face the rickety roads of life. This is a book not to be taken lightly, and never to be underestimated.It has power, and can change you. After reading the first few pages, I was horrified. I first read it in Class 6 and shut the book immediately after first few chapters. It was too much to bear and I knew if I keep on reading this, I would insult this great work by not understanding a thing and criticizing it without getting something in my head. I read it again when I was 14(well, I still am 14, 14+), then only I could understand, what kind of truth and deadly beauty does it hold.The Kite Runner tells us a story about two boys through the eyes of one of them, Amir. The boy of royal bloodline and his friend Hassan, a Hazara boy. But they shared a bond weld in Titanium, a bond of friendship. But suddenly, everything comes breaking apart as Amir witnesses a heinous crime done to Hassan. He gets sexually abused and Amir is horrified, he is guilty and ashamed as he could do nothing to save his beloved friend. He grows cold towards him, but Hassan is still a true and loyal friend. Amir tries to break his ties with Hassan. And then comes the time when Afghanistan is invaded buy Russia. And Amir with his ""Baba""  is forced to flee to America leaving behind everything, thier money, property, name, but most importantly Hassan and the memories of him.Time passes and Amir forgets his past but suddenly he gets a call from his homeland and later meets a boy called Sohrab, who is none other but Hassan's son.And suddenly 
“There is a way to be good again...” 
 He rescues him from prostitution and adopts him.The act of courage by admitting the wrong which he had done when his friend needed him the most but also 
the final act of redemption
. This time he saved Hassan's son from danger which he couldn't do in the time of his beloved friend,the Kite Runner, Hassan. Hossini is a legendary artist who weaves the story in unforgettable, heart wrenching story ringing with truth of life, the power of love and sacrifices and the act of redemption and undoing the wrong done. It is a unique story which deserves to forever stay in the heart of their readers. The reality of the book is one of its elements which makes is strikingly epic and painful. Hossini made every effort to make it epic. And damn my heart, the story struck right through. The author just bled his heart into it, so that the readers could glimpse everything:the sheer beauty of Afghanistan, the very feelings running inside the characters. And the characters. They are true to their very core, never making the reader doubt, never straying away from what they are supposed to do, to make the reader feel for them. And yes, I felt for them. I felt for them with all of my heart. The narrative is style is of first person perspective but extremely beautiful. It can be compared to a symphony which rings right through our minds and hearts, and is felt in our bones and flesh. A perfect symphony with stunning lyrics. that what it is. A miracle in itself.
“It was only a smile, nothing more. It didn't make everything all right. It didn't make ANYTHING all right. Only a smile. A tiny thing. A leaf in the woods, shaking in the wake of a startled bird's flight. But I'll take it. With open arms. Because when spring comes, it melts the snow one flake at a time, and maybe I just witnessed the first flake melting. - Amir”
This one book made me raw from within, made my heart twist and untwist a thousand times, made me cringe to the harsh realities of life. Hossini is a true writer, treading over hearts, breaking them and wielding them in utmost beauty with the ending. I am honored to have my heart shattered by him.

145,858951238,02/18/2014,4.0,"I have mixed feelings about “The Kite Runner”. There is no question that Khaled Hosseini is a talented and charming storyteller. He knows how to titillate readers’ sensibilities. Indeed, that the movie adaptation was as much a success as the novel bears evidence to that. Somehow the story reminds me of the hugely popular film “Slumdog Millionaire”. Maybe because both stories are great tear-jerkers.“The Kite Runner” does touch my sensibilities. I am deeply saddened by what happens to Hassan. I can empathize with Amir for his burden of guilt. I am moved by the description of Hassan’s unquestioning loyalty towards Amir and of the father-son relationship between Amir and Baba. I am shocked at the human conditions in war-torn Afghanistan and I am appalled about the plight of Afghan children. But I can’t help feeling there’s still something amiss in the novel. Perhaps a precious chance to embed a deeper meaning to the novel was lost.In my humble opinion, a great novel should have one or several strong moral messages besides being a fantastic read. In other words, there should be more than just the surface layer of a story which serves the superficial function of entertaining, touching, thrilling, shocking or in whatever other ways of catering to the stimulation of the reader’s senses. In “The Kite Runner”, one important theme would seem to be that of social dilemmas arising from class distinction – between the privileged class of the Pashtuns and the downtrodden servant class of the Hazaras. I’m just a little disappointed that the author didn’t leverage on this theme to deliver a universal ethical message – that of the necessity of eliminating class discrimination in all societies, that all humans should be treated as equals. If the message is already there, it may be a little too subtle for detection.In the main storyline, where Hassan’s unreciprocated loyalty and affection towards Amir is implied as the chief cause for Amir’s guilty conscience, there is no mention that Amir is in any way angry about the social norm that pits his class against Hassan’s class. Inasmuch as Amir has genuine feelings of remorse for mistreating the pal he grew up with, it’s not the same as showing disgust for the unjust social norm of class distinction and discrimination. (The best Amir can do in this respect is to tell his father-in-law never to refer to Sohrab, Hassan’s son, as ‘that Hazara’, in his presence.) One would wonder whether the adult Amir would fight for equality in his society if there was no war and if he and Baba didn’t have to flee to America, or whether he would just wallow in his snug privileged position all his life.And then there is so much hypocrisy in Baba, the one who is portrayed as the brave, self-righteous, loving and generous father. He would rather endure not acknowledging Hassan as his lawful son and take the secret to his grave than having his “good” name ruined because of the shame he felt for sleeping with his servant’s wife, a Hazara. For all the charitable deeds that Baba does and for his kind treatment of Ali, he is still someone who condones class distinction. What he could have done for Ali and Hassan is to help them stand on their own feet rather than keeping them as servants and taking care of them. Again, one is not sure whether Amir thinks that Baba is in the wrong here, as playing patron to someone is quite different from respecting him as an equal.Having said all that, I do admit that I may be overly critical, because in times of great turmoil, who would give a damn to social equality when there are the wounded, the hungry, the homeless and the destitute to worry about? But then shouldn’t every opportunity be grasped to spread the important message to and educate societies about a basic value?",16,0.9946,0.096,0.74,0.165,0.5771072796934866,NEGATIVE,0.9821
146,3418505155,06/30/2020,5.0,"I was just a year shy of 18 when I read Khaled Hosseini's brilliant, heart-rending novel and felt, all of a sudden, my 17 year-old self suddenly coming of age a little, becoming aware of life with all its little joys and extraordinary disappointments in that one single moment of catharsis. I can still remember the day when I finished it, in the shade of a big banyan tree in my college premises, very much a loner, an outsider to the gangs that other boys had made in full view of my loneliness and isolation and suddenly, as I closed shut the almost dog-eared, second-hand paperback in my hands, I could feel as if I was no longer alone, I was no longer all abandoned and adrift in the motion of life; it was normal to feel alone and abandoned, it was normal, after all, to feel that yearning for some reconciliation, some redemption, another chance to find a friend or a lover who will be at your side till you breathe your last, another chance to bring a smile on a stranger's face, another chance to be good again. ""The Kite Runner"" is about a young man who finds that chance for reconciling with his childhood friend, who was almost like his own brother in flesh and blood and who had been separated from him due to unforeseen circumstances and a lie told at the naive age of boyhood. The tragedy of the novel, however, is that he finds this chance too late. I won't be revealing too much about who is this young man, who is his friend, what were those circumstances and how the slowly, almost elegiacal unfolding of a betrayed nation's tumultuous history acts as a powerful parable at how even the strongest friendship, or kinship, can be betrayed by the malice and selfishness that lurks inside us all. And yet, yet, as much as the book bruises us emotionally and viscerally by both its unflinching portrayal of the horror of insurgency and war that flooded through Afghanistan through the 1980s and right till the transformation of the Taliban, from a force of vigilantism to a totalitarian order of its own, and by its equally raw portrait of how our seething jealousies get the better of us, it is in how Hosseini gives his characters a shot at redemption and forgiveness that truly makes this novel so special. I am falling short of words here, so I sign off by saying that this novel is a beautifully crafted marvel, a story of childhood and friendship, of truth and untruth, of fathers and sons, of love and marriage, of guilt and redemption, of hope and despair, of good and evil. And it hits all the right beats in such spectacular, unexpected ways that you will be surprised, even shocked and scared and then also stirred and moved to tears.

It made me cry many times actually. I haven't cried over a book for a pretty long time. Tears are cleansing, they relieve you, even partially, from struggle and spiritual corruption.I believe that's the sign of great novels, they must make you weep! They must heal you! They must open your eyes and make you a different person, a better person. “And that, I believe, is what true redemption is, Amir jan, when guilt leads to good”“My body was broken—just how badly I wouldn’t find out until later—but I felt healed. Healed at last” All I can say about this novel is that it definitely became one of my all time favorite novels. It's indescribable. Khalid Hosseini is a genius.

156,243847811,12/06/2011,4.0,"Book snobs try to trivialize The Kite Runner by saying that it is a novel that white America reads in order to feel worldly or cultured. Why? Because it was a bestseller? Because the masses read it? Because it was turned into a film? Would they say this if Khaled Hosseini was an unknown refugee living in a small village somewhere and wrote this book on a scrap of paper as a means to escape his humdrum life? And then what if a very small independent publisher took a chance on it and published a limited number of copies and it wasn't available for the masses, and the New York Times never wrote a review about it and a film was then never produced? Would that make this book any more or less appealing to them?Don't get me wrong. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and I, for one, never make a first impression of a book by its standing on the New York Times bestseller list, but I can't help but roll my eyes and feel irked when some people have to rag on a book that is popular, just because it is popular.And The Kite Runner is a very popular book. And yes, I do believe that people read this book to learn about Afghan culture, and since Mr. Hosseini is from Afghanistan, I can safely assert that if you read this book, you will learn a little about Afghan culture. And so much more.This is a lovely book. The prose is magnificently and beautifully painted and Hosseini's descriptions of Afghanistan, both past and present, are exquisitely rendered. The novel centers around two boyhood friends, Amir and Hassan, who have a deep but flawed relationship. Amir is the son of a wealthy Afghan businessman, and Hassan is the son of his servant, Ali. Amir is our narrator and his struggles as a boy reflect his desire to make his father proud of him and his seemingly failed attempts at doing so. Even though Hassan is the son of a servant, it is Hassan who seems to capture ""Baba's"" admiration and respect the most. The boys' relationship is further complicated by the fact that Hassan seems to worship Amir and treats him as a dog would treat his master. Jealous Amir resents the admiration and conflict develops between the two boys, resulting in Ali taking Hassan and leaving Baba's household, much to Baba's anguish. The backdrop of the novel is the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and later, the takeover of The Taliban. Amir and Baba eventually travel to America to flee the violence and conflict, but find a whole new realm of change and conflict there.I find this to be a story of redemption. Amir is thought of as a coward and a weakling, both by himself and his father. The second half of the novel, which takes place in America during Amir's ascent into adulthood and marriage, is about his living with and eventually making up for his transgressions as a child, especially with respect for how he treated Hassan. Amir eventually returns to Afghanistan to save Hassan's orphaned son from the fate of his father, as well as from a very different Afghanistan than the one Amir left decades earlier. What ensues is a truly heartfelt story of loss, identity--both personal and cultural--guilt, and ultimately, hope. I was very deeply moved by the story, and by the end of it all, enlightened.I loved Amir's redmption story, but I found the writing just as powerful, and had anyone less proficient with the written word authored it, the impact would have been lost. Hosseini chose to inject a few phrases of Amir's native Farsi into the prose, which could have been disastrous, but I found it to be very tastefully and consistently rendered. I believe he made this decision to show the beauty of Farsi, to transcend the radicalism and ugliness that has become associated with it today. The descriptions of Afghanistan are exquisite, and they remind us that Afghanistan was and is a beautiful country, deeply rooted in history, culture, and (ironically) forward thinking. Amir's mother was a professor of history at the university in Kabul during the sixties and seventies. How many women in our country held a profession of that sort during that time period? I love that Hosseini painted the Afghan landscape before and after the entrance of the Taliban, just to demonstrate the difference the people of Afghanistan endured during their lifetimes. Above all, Hosseini reminded me that Afghanistan, Islam, and its people and followers should not be judged based on a radical few, and that the Afghan civilians and refugees, in fact, may be the sorest victims of the Taliban's ruthless tyranny. This book really broke down stereotypes that I believe Westerners have held, and still hold to this day about Eastern cultures and religions, particularly those that exist in America, and if only for that reason, I am happy to have read this novel. So yes, book snobs, I, a member of White America, gained something from reading this important novel. I don't feel more important, or more worldly, or more cultured, but I do feel different.I will leave you with an early passage which haunted me the rest of the way through the book. Amir is just learning to write his own stories, the first of which he shares with Hassan. I think it beautifully depicts each boy's personality and marks the differences in their mindsets:""I wrote my first short story. It took me thirty minutes. It was a dark little tale about a man who found a magic cup and learned that if he wept into the cup, his tears turned into pearls. But even though he had always been poor, he was a happy man and rarely shed a tear. So he found ways to make himself sad so that his tears could make him rich. As the pearls piled up, so did his greed grow. The story ended with the man sitting on a mountain of pearls, knife in hand, weeping helplessly into the cup with his beloved wife's slain body in his arms."" When Amir told Hassan the story, he loved it but asked one question of it: ""Why did the man kill his wife? In fact, why did he ever have to feel sad to shed tears? Couldn't he have just smelled an onion?""4.5 stars",15,0.9973,0.099,0.749,0.152,0.5649316927034319,POSITIVE,0.5071
157,2662337022,01/12/2019,5.0,"You can read all my review on Blog -  Books Teacup and Reviewshe Kite Runner was the story of Amir and Hassan, their childhood, life and complicated relationship; societal issue, selfishness, betrayal; casualty of regime change, insurgency; and kite fighting tournament that changed both boys’ life.Tw- sexual abuse of minors, selling kids and derogatory behavior towards women and Hazaras.Hassan was illiterate hazara, a servant’s son but was most modest, clever, so content and happy with himself and whatever Amir and his father provided. He was most brave kid in the book who accepted everything thrown towards him and stood up to defend Amir without thinking of the consequences. But on that dreadful day I really wished he didn’t stand up to defend Amir. Even after what he suffered and faced his heart was so pure that didn’t harbor ill feeling for Amir and I loved him for that. My heart ached whenever I saw him hurt and suffering and even after all he lived fullest leaving past behind.Amir was rich boy who wanted all attention, respect, and love of his baba. In doing so he lost something precious, a friendship of Hassan, his peace and conscience. I really hated him from running away when Hassan needed him most. It broke my heart and I almost cried for what happened to Hassan. Like him I had that thought throughout the novel, if he reacted on that day, stood up for Hassan and himself the things might have turned out differently. There were many flaws in this character but at the end he learned his lesson and earned his redemption and for that I like him.Amir’s fatherwas remarkable character but there was a surprising twist in his characterization as well. Ultimately there was a flaw in this idealistic brave man as well but I also admired him for the way he tried to share equal love and kept his corner of heart reserved for his son.Other secondary characters of the book, Ali, Soraya, Rahim Khan, Farid were great to read. Antagonist of the book was horrendous. Who will you consider the real antagonist, was thought-provoking question.Book was set in Kabul, Afghanistan. The setting was vivid and bringing the real Afghan and its people alive. The juxtaposed picture of Afghan before and after Russian coup and Taliban insurgency was shocking to read.The story was first person narrative from Amir’s perspective. It started with a phone call from Rahim Khan that reignited the past forcing Amir back to his life in Kabul until the winter of 1975. Reading Hassan’s description, Hassan’s father Ali and his unfortunate life with his wife, Amir’s beautiful house and Hassan and Amir’s birth story in the beginning, hooked me to writing of author. I knew I’m going to like this book in that first chapter only.In very early in the book we read about Shia- Sunni differences and conflicts. How religious and societal issue kept Hassan and Amir’s friendship tainted and even Ali and Amir’s father- A relationship with strong brotherly bond still they never called named it friendship.A question that was raised by narrator in first chapter kept me reading the book to get its answer- What happened on the winter of 1975? And why would he seek atonement? As I dived deep in the book more questions sparked that hooked me to the book till the end- what happened to Hassan after winter of 1975? How and where he lived? Why Amir and his father left Kabul and how they reached American? Why Amir returned to Kabul? Will he find his peace at last?The book gave answers to all questions. Life of Amir and his father in America was depicted with realistic touch. An immigrant and asylum seeker can relate to their life. The effect of Taliban insurgency on people of Afghan as well as characters’ life was tragic and unfair. It was poignant to see poverty, hunger and homeless on the street of the country.It shattered my heart reading what happened to Hasan on the winter of 1975. It broke something in me on reading what Rahim Khan delivered to Amir in Pakistan but on reading what happened to Hassan’s son and how he was treated made me cry. And chapters after climax were soul shattering. I almost wished to enter in the novel and do sometimes to make Hassan’s son feel better.Relationship between Hassan and Amir, Amit and his father, Amir and Rahim Khan, Hassan and Ali, Amir and Hassan’s son was perfectly portrayed. Each relationship had something good to teach. Each will hold you to the pages of the book and ponder about it until you feel it in the heart.End of the book was bittersweet. I wish it had turned out all right, but such shattering story takes longer than 344 pages to be completely all right. The afterward of the book just great.This was utterly intense, poignant, soul-stirring and thought-provoking very original fiction that I highly recommend to fiction and classic lovers.",15,0.9969,0.102,0.735,0.163,0.580703463203463,NEGATIVE,0.6054
158,4615136,08/15/2007,4.0,"i had a little bit of a hard time getting into this book at first. i'm picky about characterization and overly sensitive to indulgent description. at first, i found the characters too one-dimensional. Baba never seemed to confront a situation that was morally complicated -- he never actually -wrestled- with bears. similarly, none of the other characters had must wrestling -- only broadly-painted blocks of emotional themes.like most people [i think] i was sympathetic to Amir's thoughts and reactions, but eventually i found him annoying -- pushed too far into caricature by the theme of his childhood. it was hard for me to put up with his dramatic descriptions of Soraya.but in the end (where i've read a number of reviews that claim it resorts to fable) i liked it again. it still paints too easy a picture of the good guys and bad ones, but it complicates things. i liked the fable-like quality, as if Hosseini was hitting his groove in storytelling, where the hero gets to wrestle honestly--not just fail or succeed as a matter of trope.i kept wondering how Hosseini felt about Amir. there seemed to be false notes in the early descriptions of his childhood, as if he was trying too hard to set up the lessons Amir would learn later.i also found Assef to be a fascinating character -- clearly stating Hosseini's perspective on the nature of the Taliban. still quite broadly painted, but i think i have to believe on some level that people who are committing atrocities like this are using religion and politics to play out their cruel impulses.i think part of the book's success was explaining Amir's reactions in a way that i suspect most people (most US readers) would understand. i think Amir and Hassan's relationship provides an good description about some of the dynamics of power and privilege. Amir sees Hassan as exotically good, ""salt of the earth,"" and therefore better than him. he reacts with minor cruelty yet expects devotion. he feels guilt but can let it pass. he can (as Farid accuses later) always leave and go back to his walled mansion (literally or figuratively).Hosseini seems to be at his best when (like Jhumpa Lahiri?) he's dealing with the complex yankings of modernism and tradition in national/cultural communities in the US. i'm looking forward to reading A Thousand Splendid Suns because there are (hopefully) real -women- in that one. i found it a little difficult to read all the absences of real women. the theme of the dead mother written in Amir's perspective, i guess, and a symptom of a few of the broad thematic sweeps that don't get complicated.wow, that's a long review. if you read it, sorry for wasting so much of your time.",15,0.988,0.099,0.741,0.16,0.524056603773585,NEGATIVE,0.9392

So I feel like there is a lot I could criticize about this book on a structural/literary level, and it would be a lie to say that the moments of incredible and unrealistic coincidence, of predictability and clichés, of over-wrought, heavy-handed sentiment, didn’t bother me as a reader.BUT, to be completely honest, I don’t care. When it came down to it, none of that mattered, because this book has HEART, and it made me weep like a baby. I can see why people have issues with it, as I said above I had some myself, but I just don’t care.Because okay yes, Hassan seems almost too good/saintly to be believable, but I believe anyway, because I know a few rare souls like that do exist, too good for the world they were born in. And Amir made me furious for so much of the book, but his battle with guilt and shame and the growth he ultimately found felt authentic and multi-faceted, as people and their paths through life are. And that final scene, I guess I could have focused on how it was another of those heavy-handed, sledhammer-sentiment moments, but it’s hard to be a literary critic when you’re sobbing through half a box of Kleenex. So ultimately I would recommend this book to anyone who is willing to take off their metaphorical literary snob glasses for a bit (like mine they might get too foggy with tears to be useful anyway) and get lost in a beautiful, heart breaking story.",15,0.6508,0.134,0.72,0.146,0.5477053140096616,NEGATIVE,0.9968
160,1628093485,05/03/2016,5.0,"Khaled Hosseini’s The Kite Runner is a tale of redemption in Taliban Afghanistan. Throughout the book, Hosseini’s poignant writing complicated entanglement of loyalty, tolerance, and forgiveness that compose friendship.The story follows Amir, a Pashtun boy and the son of an affluent businessman in Kabul. Amir’s closest friend is Hassan, a Hazara and Shi’a who is the son of the family’s servant. In a society bound by tradition, Hassan and other minorities are treated as second-class citizens, and Amir struggles to rationalize their friendship with his family’s influential position. Amir eventually betrays Hassan, and, shortly thereafter, he and his father leave Afghanistan in the wake of Soviet occupation, but Amir quickly finds that the past is not so easy to bury. Years later, he returns to Afghanistan in an attempt to right a wrong and redeem himself.Over the course of the novel, Hosseini not only tells the story of Amir, but the story of Afghanistan. From the peaceful and prosperous place of Amir’s youth, the country transforms through a series of brutal occupations and regimes into the broken and war-torn land of today. The stark contrast between the Afghanistans of Amir’s past and present creates a backdrop that perfectly echoes Amir’s search for morality in an increasingly depraved world.Despite dealing directly with the struggles of an exiled Afghan, Hosseini’s beautifully woven tale transcends culture as it grapples with themes of acceptance, fidelity, and redemption. The Kite Runner is ultimately the timeless story of friendship and deserves a well-earned spot on any summer reading list.",15,0.9404,0.09,0.763,0.147,0.6042748917748918,POSITIVE,0.9997

I knew only a tiny amount about the story but did know about at least one scene in which a young boy was abused. That was enough to dissuade me. What a mistake that was. Yes, this book is brutal. It is jarring, difficult and sad. It is hard to digest. It made me angry. But it is also, beautiful, honest, and full of heart. More than once tears dripped from my eyes and those tears didn't fall only because of the abusive scenes. They fell for the loss of a culture. They fell for the destruction of history when the big buddhas were destroyed. They fell for a man struggling with the guilt from a childhood tragedy. They fell for a silent boy who no longer knew how to trust. And they fell for the hope renewed by the simple act of flying a kite. My favorite books are those with beautiful character development, deep exploration of culture, and tragic, traumatic events which destroy everything ... except hope.

At first I was under the influence of A Thousand Splendid Suns, which is, in its own way, a very troubling book. But overall, The Kite Runner is probably the one that will haunt me forever. There are no words to express my horror at this very moment. What broken creatures, what devastating stories. After what was done to Hassan, I thought nothing could touch me as deeply... But I was wrong. With every page another painful cut was added to my mind and heart, where this story is now deeply seared. And finally it was the child, that shattered child, that did it for me. Truly, I view myself as an avid reader, but most books just don't impress me anymore. For a while I was very afraid that something was wrong with me.

Amir is a bit out of place, he likes to read and write in a community where those qualities are not important, the ones that belong here are those who can stand up for themselves and those who love soccer, even more those are the qualities his father wants in his son. Amir is not but he has Hassan, the unbelievably good and loyal boy, he steps for Amir every time and he’s always there for him. All of this shapes the character of Amir to be a coward and when the hard choices face him, he makes decisions that will haunt him for the rest of his life.I hate Amir, I hated him most of the book, I hate him because first he doesn’t do good things then he does nothing about it and then he does bad things about it.I like Hassan, I liked him most of the book, I like him because first he does good things then he does more good things and then he does everything he can about it.I can’t say much so I wouldn’t spoil you.What I don’t like about this book is the views about religion, especially from Amir’s father and also the picture they draw about America, as a happy land, you just cross the borders and you instantly happy.I didn’t enjoy the writing very much but all in all it was good and I totally recommend it.",17,0.9874,0.096,0.726,0.178,0.5970420420420421,POSITIVE,0.9983

I loved the emotional element in the book which kept me caring about the characters and almost brought me to tears a few times. I also loved the first part of the book and it felt real to me. However, as I was advancing in the book, the events began accelerating until I felt I was watching an action movie instead of relishing the reading process. And no, I am not against action, but I want the happenings to be credible, and this rapidly turning carousel lost its credibility to me in the second half of the book. Although I cared about the characters and wanted to know what happened next, at the same time I also felt unable to become truly emotionally attached to them. It rendered the characters somewhat distant and vague, the least tangible of them being Amir, the narrator himself. Hassan, idealized and improbable as he might be, had more form for me, as well as Baba, the inapproachable and fearless father of Amir.It was interesting as well to see how Hosseini smartly evaded the extremely complicated topic of women rights in Afghanistan, by having the mothers of the two protagonists die before the story even starts. Women characters start appearing only when the action is transferred to US.A bit too predictable, but an easy, colorful and entertaining read, which speaks to its reader.
