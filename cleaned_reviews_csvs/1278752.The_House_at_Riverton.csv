1,2332797292,03/24/2018,5.0,"This was such a delight to read! I absolutely loved every single second I spent in this universe, and I could have gone on reading forever...The book includes many characters. I tend to get confused by that, but thankfully all of them were well developed in this case. They had different personalities and character traits, so I was able to easily tell them apart and picture them in my head.The Relationships between each of them were all kept on a realistic level. None of them were too close or too distant. Especially the amount of contact/closeness between the house residents and the working staff at Riverton Manor seemed believable to me and never over the top.The writing style was very nice and ""comfortable"" to read. It was perfect for the time period the story plays in, and I felt like I was a part of this world. The transitions between the past and the present were done very well and it all fit together (better than I would have expected).I also liked how some script pages, letters, E-Mails and articles were added into the story. This helped to explain some of the background stories in an easy way. I can't stand it when characters have conversations in which they provide huge amounts of information to each other (including every single little detail)! It's always so awkward and unnatural. By providing these little extra snippets, the author prevented those stiff interactions in a simple, but smart way.I found the romances that took place believable as well, and also rather ""tender"". I can't explain exactly what I mean by that; I was just touched by it in some way. It made me feel things - which does mean a lot, since I'm normally not too overly excited about the romance aspects in a book.These developing relationships had an appropriate speed (especially for the time period) and was kept at a convincing level.There are also two portrayals of the aftereffects of the First World War. Those weren't done unnecessarily dramatic or over the top, either. They were kept at bay (to a believable point), and I really liked and appreciated that. The only little thing I have to complain about is the lack of mention of the characters ages. I sometimes wasn't sure how old I should picture them. I would have liked a clearer distinction of the age differences between each of them and between the years that passed.This is such a tiny little thing, though. It didn't really intervene with my reading experience.I truly developed a big love for everyone involved at Riverton Manor, and I absolutely just need a movie or TV-Show based on this fantastic book!",104,0.9975,0.042,0.767,0.192,0.5480592757936509,POSITIVE,0.9996
2,1918686143,12/12/2018,4.0,"Kate Morton came into my life just under 3 years ago. I don't remember how, but I picked up one of her books and absolutely fell in love with her writing style, characters, and multi-dimensional storytelling abilities. After almost 3 years, I've finished reading all 6 of her books; it's a tad amusing that the last one I read is actually the first book she wrote -- The House at Riverton, or The Shifting Fog, as it was previously known. For me, she's the queen of historical fiction when the focus is on 'ordinary' families in a world from ~ a century ago. The House at Riverton is no exception, and while not my favorite of her tomes, is quite a splendid novel very reminiscent of Downtown Abbey.In this book, Grace is ~100 years old and dying very soon. She has a story and a secret about the past to tell her wayward grandson who's gone missing after his wife died of an aneurysm. Through flashbacks and other POVs, we learn about Grace's time as a maid and ladies maid in the Hartford family household. We witness conversations in the current period between Grace and Ursula, a film director telling the story of what happened when a family friend and renowned poet committed suicide in the 1920s at the Hartford estate. We find out who actually loved whom, and which family members shouldn't have been trusted. All set against the gorgeous backdrop of the English countryside, it's a powerful and emotional tale about fighting your desires and knowing when it's time to give in.One of the things that made this book so appealing is how similar it was to Downton Abbey. There's a family torn apart by war. Girls cannot inherit their father's estate. Love between classes is forbidden. Estates cost too much. A daughter must marry into a wealthy family to survive. But then it goes off on its own path with a murder, an affair, and a past indiscretion connecting two people who never knew until it was too late. Morton can weave the most elaborate stories to warm the heart. I feel such passion and connection with her words and imagery. I can think of no other author who evokes such lyrical enthusiasm and despair in a scene on multiple levels that overwhelm you and excite you at the same time.While a majority of this book is amazing, there were a few areas that I struggled with... hence 4 stars. The beginning is a bit too slow; it takes time to develop characters, but Morton uses a few different techniques to foreshadow what's to come in the future almost crossing that invisible line with audience. For example, there's a paragraph ending a chapter that actually speaks to readers saying, ""You think she should have done this, but no, instead, she does this... and this is why what happens to her later was so painful."" I paraphrased to not give away any spoilers, but you get the basics. Another concern I had was how certain storylines were left too open-ended for my taste. We know two characters re-connect 40 years later, but how / why. We know there was a blood relationship between two characters, but was it ever acknowledged? We know one character leaves a letter to another, but what happened with the gift she also left behind? Who was Lady Clementine and how did she fit into this family?Some of those were loosely explained, but with a powerhouse like Morton, I expect everything to be properly tied together. I'm okay with vague, but there needs to be some clarity on what the 'options' are as opposed to just making a statement and never exploring the follow-thru aspects. That said, this doesn't happen in her later books, so I think these were debut author style changes... and definitely ones I'm glad she eventually made. All said, it's a must read. The book is slower than others, with less of a major climax, but fully immersive and extravagant in other ways. I am sad that it'll be at least another year before her next one...",78,0.9933,0.084,0.776,0.14,0.4441028334410687,POSITIVE,0.9999
3,1725972265,08/11/2016,4.0,"""Whooshing like a wind through a tunnel, an angry wind that drags behind it a summer storm, rushing towards me, faster and faster. It is my past, and it is coming for me. It is everywhere; in my ears, behind my eyes, pushing my ribs…""Grace is 98 years old and living in a nursing facility when a visit from a young film producer compels her to relive her past; a past that is full of secrets that she has kept to herself for the last seventy years. Her story begins pre-World War I in England, when at the age of fourteen Grace secures a position as housemaid at Riverton House. It was a time of prosperity and vitality for the inhabitants of Riverton, and Grace relishes her new position. She quickly becomes fascinated by Hannah and Emmeline, granddaughters to her employer Lady Violet and daughters to Master Frederick Hartford. When she discovers ‘The Game’ the sisters share with their brother David, Grace learns that secrets are a pleasurable diversion for the trio. ""For The Game was more than its name suggested. It was a complex fantasy, an alternate world into which they escaped. There were no costumes, no swords, no feathered headdresses. Nothing that would have marked it as a game. For that was its nature. It was secret."" But at what point do secrets go too far?As expected, with the onset of World War I life as the Riverton household understands it will inescapably alter. Two young girls grow into womanhood and the desire for independence will affect both Hannah and Emmeline in different yet significant ways. Grace will pine for a young man sent to war and will continue in her dedication to the family and to Hannah in particular, with whom she feels a special affinity. Choices will be made, a tragic young poet will enter the scene, and more secrets will be cultivated. As the reader learns the story as told by the elderly Grace in a series of flashbacks, secrets are slowly revealed and some are still kept close. The tension mounts throughout, but not at a mad pace. You can sense a build-up to a shocking conclusion, only parts of which have been disclosed from the start. An astonishing twist made the gradual unraveling only that much more gratifying by book’s end. I found this to be very entertaining, with a satisfying gothic-like feel to the story. The distinction in the social classes during the first half of twentieth century England, as well as the roles and interactions of the servants in an aristocratic home were interesting elements and, I thought, authentically portrayed. The characters were well-drawn, despite the fact I didn’t develop any special connection to any of them. I also enjoyed contemplating the effect that the passage of time plays on a person’s memory. ""True history, the past… It isn’t flat or linear. It has no outline. It is slippery, like liquid; infinite and unknowable, like space. And it is changeable: just when you think you see a pattern, perspective shifts, an alternative version is proffered, a long-forgotten memory resurfaces."" I liked this more than my first Kate Morton novel, The Forgotten Garden, and now feel compelled to read more of her work in the future. Recommended for those who enjoy historical fiction and a slower-paced but suspenseful plot. ""It is a universal truth that no matter how well one knows a scene, to observe it from above is something of a revelation."" ",72,0.9953,0.05,0.804,0.146,0.5040772385509228,POSITIVE,0.9991

The book concerns sisters Hannah and Emmeline Hartford, aristocratic children who grow up over the course of the book. They chafe at the constraints of their class and find themselves floundering in the chaos of the 1920s. The other main character in the book is the narrator Grace, a housemaid at Riverton. She has her own unique connection to the Hartford sisters. Grace tells the story, practically from her deathbed as at 99, of the two sisters and how they witnessed a modernist poet commit suicide in 1924. Of course, things aren't really as they seem, and each of the characters plays a big part in the poet's death. So the premise was interesting, but I found the book to be kind of boring. It took too long for any of the secrets to be revealed and then when they were it was really underwhelming. I also wasn't a fan of the lack of denouement.

6,3013297193,10/17/2019,5.0,"4.5 I have to say, spending a few grey, drizzly days* getting lost in this book was a lot of fun! 'The Shifting Fog' (also published as 'The House at Riverton') was an interesting mystery of sorts, as we know from the beginning that a young poet took his life at Riverton in the sumer of 1924, witnessed by sisters Hannah and Emmeline Hartford, who never speak to each other again. In 1999, Grace Bradley is looking back on that time, and it quickly becomes clear that the public version of events is far from the full story.We alternate between the past and present, and slowly, small details are revealed. However, more than a mystery, it is also something of an examination of what it was to dedicate your life to service. Grace was a young housemaid at Riverton Manor, and the way it consumed the lives of those who worked there was fascinating. At the beginning, we learn 14 year old Grace has snuck her Sherlock Holmes books with her and keeps them carefully hidden, in case they are taken from her:'Mr Hamilton had been clear. The Holy Bible was acceptable, but any reading material beyond that was most likely injurious and must be presented for his approval or otherwise risk confiscation. I was not a rebel -- indeed, back then I had a fierce sense of duty-- but to live without Holmes and Watson was unthinkable.' Not only did this instantly endear Grace to me, it was also a reminder of one of the many ways used to keep people in their place - something that never fails to make me bristle with anger. As the book progresses, I was rather delighted that perhaps one of the few brighter aspects of a war-shattered country was many people questioning this world view. When it comes to the sisters, I adored Hannah, and felt a great deal of empathy towards her. Emmeline annoyed me quite a bit, especially as she got older, though I did sympathise with her at times -- but, more frequently I found her an irritant. I got more caught up in this story than I had expected, and my hands were shaking slightly as I got to the end of the book, to finally confirm the truth I had suspected. This was the first book by Kate Morton that I have read, and I'll definitely be keeping an eye out for more of her work.*After I wrote that, the sun came out!🌞",52,0.982,0.053,0.82,0.128,0.4446180555555555,POSITIVE,0.964

Well, as it turns out, it could feel like a cobbled-together collection of Upstairs-Downstairs stereotypes, played-out female character archetypes, and plot twists and sub-plots that, after lots of set-up, amount to very little. Also, the book is told in flashbacks, and there were structure and continuity problems that annoyed even me, and I think I'm usually pretty chill about that kind of thing.I just went online and noticed that reviewers disagree with me.

In this page-turner of a novel, beautifully written and evocative of the era in England prior to and after World War 1, the author succeeds in weaving a complex tale of passion, jealousy and intrigue utilizing the past memories of 98 year old Grace Bradley and the secret she has jealously guarded for over 60 years. This jigsaw puzzle of a tale cleverly takes the various, seemingly insignificant, strands of Graces life and plaits them with the lives of other members of the Riverton household to form a lusterous braid with a couple of astonishing twists at its end. There is literally not a hair out of place in this fascinating journey through an era of crumbling social barriers and evolving English social morals and traditions.

11,49478311,03/16/2009,3.0,"I had such high hopes! Our heroine, Grace, now a feisty but failing 98, spent her early life at Riverton House in the service of the Ashbury family...and then spent her adult life trying to forget about them. However, she's contacted by a filmmaker about the mysterious suicide of a World War I poet that occurred at the estate back in 1924. Is the set of the Riverton drawing room accurate? What was it like being a housemaid? Does Grace have any insight into the circumstances of the suicide? Why did the two Ashbury sisters never speak to each other again after the suicide? Grace may get sucked into remembering, but not necessarily into telling. For me this is the stuff of dreams...an English country manor, mysterious death, World War I...it should be a slam dunk! Alas, it’s more like a shot that rolls around the rim for a while before someone else taps it in.Grace’s flashbacks are nicely interwoven with the present, and, as always, descriptions of life in service underscore how different society was a hundred years ago. But while much of the story of Grace’s interaction with the Ashbury family is compelling, it doesn’t always ring true. People just aren’t metaphysically “connected” to each other — and across class barriers! — to the extent Morton imagines them. And some of the minor characters are merely caricatures. Of course the Americans are crass, insensitive, and materialistic — and naturally, that means they must be Tories — because IS there any other type of American? On the plus side, I liked the way Morton portrays the war’s impact. And, in spite of a few “revelations” that were so obvious I think they were probably intentionally obvious (but if so, why??), the twists at the end of the book really do pack a wallop. What bothered me, however, is the way the two adulterous affairs that caused most of the grief were glossed over, as though being “in love” excuses everything, and it’s just an unfair coincidence that destruction follows in the wake of bad choices.

I mean, really, Hannah couldn't throw the gun in the lake rather than shooting her lover? Grace couldn't tell Hannah that she didn't know shorthand and got someone else to tell her what the first note said? And why did Hannah think Grace knew shorthand, anyway? She put a lot of work into learning it herself . . . I don't recall her ever teaching Grace. In fact, it seems likely that most employers would have assumed Grace couldn't read at all. Also, why did Frederick let Grace's mother live in utter misery and solitude, and have no interest in Grace, if they had such a big love affair? The timing of Grace's latter day career, of her relationship with Albert, of her marriage, and of the birth and ages of her children was also never terribly clear. On the sloppy side, I think the minimal dates given for the duration of Grace's later relationship with Albert and the age of their son didn't match up. Much more irritating was the mention of Riverton Hall burning -- a whole wing plus blackening of the rest of the house -- followed by a visit by Grace and her (secret? why didn't she disclose the family tie?) great niece to an apparently completely intact house.

15,239945868,08/01/2019,5.0,"4.5 stars. This is an absolutely terrific period piece. It felt very much to me like watching Downton Abbey, mixed with a side of The Blind Assassin, which is one of my favorite books and is listed in the Author's Note, along with other works of fiction and a list of nonfiction books Morton consulted while researching this time period. She did an absolutely stunning job with this as this is a 500-600 page book, depending on whether you read The Shifting Fog or the shorter American version The House at Riverton, and I never felt the disconnect that often comes in historical fiction when the author misses a step in diction or description. This predates Downton but if you have been missing that show, you absolutely cannot go wrong with this book. Our main character, Grace, a fatherless 14 yo girl, starts out as a maid at Riverton. She was told to seek work there by her mother, who had retired from the same house. There is a lot of family drama, mostly after WWI ends and the young women living upstairs become adults. I'm being careful not to give anything away but there are secrets, mysteries, love affairs both upstairs and down, etc., and great characters you will fall for. The writing is completely immersive and the book is very hard to put down, right from the beginning. If you live in the US, I highly recommend that you get your hands on the uncut version of the book, which is The Shifting Fog. I always alternate between paper and audiobook when I can get copies of both. I move through books faster this way. Unbeknownst to me, I had the long version on audio and the short version in the paper book (both library editions). Because the long and short versions begin differently, I knew from the start that there was something amiss. Quickly realized the long version actually has 100 pp more than the short - which was quite a surprise, as often the British version has a different title or cover but I believe it's atypical for the content to be so different. Comparing them, I found that so much good stuff is cut from the American version. It is a *completely* different reading experience than the long one, as various newspaper clippings, letters, etc as well as much of the narrative itself are not present in the Riverton book. These characters became so real for me. One of the upstairs characters was imo quite unlikable and she gets into some situations that had me docking half a star but I start to wonder if that is actually fair to the exquisite performance Morton turned in with this book. I was also a little offended, if I'm honest, that so much good meat was cut from the American version. I think the rest of the world looks at America as being a bit dim, and I'm sure the 2016 election did nothing to dispel this. But the Riverton book, imo should be labeled as an abridged work, to be fair to anyone picking it up. I love audiobooks, but I don't waste time with abridged ones. Had I known up front of the huge disparity between US and UK versions, I would have ordered TSF from Book Depository, but I was hooked pretty hard off the go and didn't want to wait for the book to come from overseas, so I decided to listen to the long version instead. For the most part. There were times when I just had to know what happened, and switched to the paper book instead. I'm sure I missed a few things reading this way. Anyway, I digress. I absolutely loved Grace. I kept seeing Anna from Downton. Hannah reminded me of Mary. I was wondering throughout if Julian Fellowes read this book prior to conceiving Downton and I wouldn't be at all surprised if that's exactly what happened. We go back and forward in time, and Grace as an old lady was my favorite character. Oh I loved her so much. Thinking about her and about her grandson and daughter.......honestly, these characters are begging for a sequel. There is so much more I want to know about all three of them. I found them way more interesting than the two upstairs women on which this plot primarily focused. For fans of historical fiction who enjoy the pre- and post-WWI periods, you truly can't go wrong with the long version of this book. I will almost definitely be reading this again. And I really need to work my way through Kate Morton's backlist. A brilliant book.EDIT: I've already changed my mind. This book deserves a five-star rating. Highly recommended.

The Remains of the Day has so much character development. It has subtle yet intense emotion. But The House at Riverton felt bland. Grace was our narrator, but I felt nothing for her. She was too outside the story to make a reader feel connected to the sisters, but she also didn't give much of herself to make a reader feel connected to her. Downton Abbey is full of interesting characters and lots of drama. While The House at Riverton promised suspense and passion, the majority of the book was dry and dull. The suspense and passion here was confined to the last 100 pages, mostly only the last 50. The book is 470 pages long. That's way too much time to build up to a final scene of drama.I'm sure I'll try another Kate Morton book sometime. I've heard that her others are better than this one, but after reading this, they won't be at the top of my list.",20,0.9919,0.019,0.796,0.184,0.5512820512820512,NEGATIVE,1.0

I loved, loved it since I gave the book the highest rating that exists here, but my emotions are still roiling. An omission of truth led to tragic consequences. But great British Gothic stories are almost always tragic, aren't they? I loved how Kate Morton paid homage to one of my favorite novels, Rebecca, Upstairs, Downstairs even my favorite drama, Downton Abbey and the The House of Mitford. I knew this fact before I read the authors answers in the novel's Q and A. And Kate Morton does a wonderful job of blending these influences to perfection.  Morton's style reminds me of Daphne du Maurier, easy to read but powerful. She develops the characters so well, that I sometimes forgot that they are fictional. I'd love to meet every one of them, even Mr. Hamilton. She accurately depicts the Edwardian Era and her vivid description of Riverton made me feel that I was actually there with Grace and the Hartfords.  Some reveiwers did not enjoy Morton's use of flashbacks, tapes, and letters. I did - I don't think Grace's story could have been told any other way. We readers too become archeologists peeling back layers upon layers to find out what happened on that dark, pivotal night by the lake when a young poet died and a family was forever changed. Summary A young film maker is doing a bio-pic of the Hartfords and Riverton. She learns that Grace Bradley was a servant at The House at Riverton and may know what happened the night that the young poet R. S. Hunter committed suicide. Of course the 98 year old Dr. Grace Bradley knows exactly what happened - she was there! And she knows the why. Will she tell Ursala? She does tell, but whom? But first Grace must tell what led up to ""the crossing the Rubicon"". It started when she was 14 and entered service to the Hartford's at The House at Riverton in 1914.

22,269339585,01/29/2012,3.0,"This was the first, but likely not the last book I read by Kate Morton. It is quite long, which put me off for a while, though it had been sitting on my shelf for a year or so. I read it for the November Book Pals group and have to say, I am happy I finally did.The story is part mystery, part historical fiction with some romance thrown in as well, so there is something for everyone:-)Partly written in the present and partly via flashbacks, it tells the story of Grace, a former housemaid at the English country house, Riverton. She is prompted to remember certain events that took place surrounding the family that lived at Riverton many years ago, by a film producer wanting to make a movie about a particularly shocking suicide that took place there. Grace mostly remembers through her interactions with the staff and the two young women who lived there.I enjoyed the story though it is a slow moving one, and though it wasn't entirely satisfying in some respects, I felt it was well done and engaging. Grace was sentimental but not sappy, and I found her voice to feel quite reliable. The ending was, for me at least, a little predictable, but that didn't bother me much. Morton obviously did her research and the language and atmosphere feel spot on. My only issue is that, on a whole, I didn't really connect with the characters. Their stories were interesting and well told, but at the same time I felt a certain level of distance. Maybe this is somewhat intentional, as commentary on the relationship between upstairs and downstairs, but I doubt it somehow, because we are not excluded from the intimate details of every character's lives, so it is probably just my personal feeling. All in all, I do feel I will be looking up some of Morton's other books as well, and have already been recommended ""Forgotten Garden"" and ""Distant Hours"", which both look intriguing. I have a sense that Morton writes books that could very well be adapted into mini-series:-)Find more reviews and bookish fun at http://www.princessandpen.com",16,0.9937,0.05,0.768,0.182,0.4741758241758242,POSITIVE,0.893

It also gave me my Downton Abbey-time period fix without being overly soap-opera or unrealistic. The character of Hannah is one I adored and will think about for some time to come, as I will many of the characters. As I was reading, I found it extremely easy to assign actors to the roles in my mind, which I do enjoy doing - I obviously know the time periods are totally off here, but I definitely saw Hannah as a Keira-Knightley-as-Elizabeth-Bennet, and Emmeline as a Carey-Mulligan-as-Daisy-Buchanan. I have a weird thing sometimes where I find the main protagonists boring (hi Harry Potter), but I also enjoyed Grace the maid as our narrator. I wasn't a big fan of the scenes at the elderly rest home, but those were so few in the big picture that it hardly mattered.Most of all, I was so excited to see that (for the most part) Kate Morton reigned in the tendency to tie up each and every loose end into a big ball of overly-happy ending. It's one of my biggest reading pet peeves when an ending is so perfect and happy that it's a little annoying or extremely unbelievable. I loved loved loved her latest novel, ""The Lake House"" beyond words, but she ruined an otherwise perfect book in the last 15 pages with an awful sickly sweet ending ""twist"" that didn't fit with what the book had been up to that point. ""The House at Riverton"" was her first novel, and she definitely had a near-perfect book with the right ending here - gloomy, gothic, a bit abrupt, atmospheric, with a twist that belongs. Wonderful. So, Kate Morton - hi! Hello! Love your books! Please don't ruin your endings anymore! Let them be organic! Thanks :-)I still have ""The Forgotten Garden"", ""The Secret Keeper"", and ""The Distant Hours"" on my Kate Morton to-read list, and after ""The House at Riverton"", now I'm even more excited to dive into them headfirst.",19,0.9978,0.072,0.681,0.247,0.6283322120056812,POSITIVE,0.9997

It had more passive drama than I would've wanted but it is a perfectly enjoyable read, Morton has a lot of talent and a beautiful style. I highlighted so many quotes, I won't even count them.

La casa de Riverton cuenta la historia de porque ocurrió el suicidio del poeta Robbie Hunter y porque las hermanas Hartford estaban presentes. Es una historia bien contada, pero que tiende a irse mucho por las ramas para mi gusto. Creo que a todos los amantes de Austen y libros dentro del género de esa autora les encantara esta historia de Kate Morton. Tiene personajes lindos pero sin mucho trasfondo salvo por nuestra protagonista Grace quien es una sirviente de la casa. La pluma de la autora es simplemente bellísima.El libro está catalogado dentro del género “misterio” y aunque si hay cierto misterio en la novela, no vallan con la idea de un semi thriller como yo porque no lo es. Y por lo mismo ciertos giros se ven venir a kilómetros de distancia y no impactan tanto, salvo el final que me gusto bastante y como se llegó a él. Muy dramático pero de forma realista.

Morton has a great way of weaving the story so that you think you finally have worked out the great twist at the end, but as usual, even with all my varying combinations of possible outcomes, I didn’t guess the final twist, which was so simple, yet cleverly executed.

33,457175454,11/16/2012,5.0,"Morton’s novels are always fun reads for me and this one didn’t disappoint. With shades of du Maurier’s Rebecca and the BBC’s Downton Abbey, the book was a wonderful mystery. We meet Grace at the end of her life. She is living out her days at a retirement home when she finds out a movie is being made about a dramatic event that happened in her youth. As a teenager Grace worked as a house maid at a large manor, Riverton, in the English countryside. A young poet committed suicide at the home one night and the mystery surrounding the evening has always left people wanting to know more. Grace decides it might be time to finally reveal the truth of what happened. Like all of Morton’s novels, this one has themes of mother/daughter relationships, long-kept secrets and the English countryside. Grace’s mother used to work at Riverton and we slowly learn bits of her history as well. After a few years at Riverton Grace becomes a lady’s maid for the Hartford sisters, Hannah and Emmeline. Their close relationship allows Grace to give us a wide-view of the happenings in the house. As the years pass and relationships become more complicated the story reminds us that one man’s happiness is another man’s prison. I thought the relationship between Hannah and Emmeline was one of the most fascinating elements of the story. The relationship between sisters is like no other. It tends to be fraught with both love and jealousy, creating a strange and precarious balance. Morton captured this perfectly, allowing us to understand and sympathize with both sisters throughout the novel. BOTTOM LINE: I really enjoyed it. The Forgotten Garden is my favorite of her’s so far, but I have a theory that your first Morton is always your favorite. This one was the perfect book to give me a Downton Abbey fix until I can watch the third season. “Reading is one of life’s great pleasures; talking about books keeps their worlds alive for longer.”“‘No. Not a mystery. Just a nice safe history.’ Ah my darling. But there is no such thing.” “…for home is a magnet that lures back even its most abstracted children.” “It is an uncanny feeling, that rare occasion when one catches a glimpse of oneself in repose.

Told from the perspective of a 14-year old girl sent to serve as a maid at a great estate in the Edwardian era, it lovingly detailed her world and her interactions with the family she served. The characters all felt real, flawed but wonderfully engaging, and the story sustained my interest and emotions throughout.

I was so swept away by Kate Morton’s facile command of the English language that I almost lost my critical faculty… until I got to the end. And then I was PISSED.There was a lot of foreshadowing that raised expectations that were not fulfilled and questions that were not answered. Several passages in the book were terribly misleading, intentionally so. Here are just a few of my problems with the book: MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD(view spoiler)[1. Who was Grace’s father? She raised continual questions regarding this, and poof, it was done away with and never fully answered. Plus, after all the time and energy spent on this storyline, it really made no difference. You could argue that that was why Grace was so loyal to Hannah, but I think she would have been regardless (as she had already proven herself to be).‘Why had Lady Violet welcomed me (Grace) onto her staff? Surely I’d have served as a not-so-welcome reminder of what had gone before.’…‘Unless my employment was some sort of recompense. The price for Mother’s silence. Was that why Mother had been so sure, so certain a position would be found for me at Riverton?I had those exact same questions. And then Grace discounts this all by simply saying: And then, quite simply, I knew. How the hell did she KNOW? And what did Hannah know? I guess WE’LL never know!2. How come everyone and their brother seemed to know all about this scandal (including Nancy), but not Grace?Nancy opened her mouth and closed it again, like one of the fish the storms washed up on the lake bank. ‘Ask no questions and I’ll tell you no lies,’ she said finally, holding her vase up to the light for inspection.3. What was Ruth’s problem with the Hartfords? Why could she never bear to hear talk of them? ‘Ruth, who’s been listening, said, ‘One of them married an American, didn’t she?’ I (Grace) looked at her, surprised. She had always made it her business not to know anything about the Hartfords.4. Emmeline was NOT engaged to Robbie nor to anyone else.‘What about the other sister?’ Ruth continued. ‘Emmeline. Did she ever marry?’ ‘No,’ I (Grace) said. ‘She was engaged.’5. ‘A rising star of the English poetry scene kills himself by a dark lake on the eve of a huge society party. His only witnesses are two beautiful sisters who never speak to each other again. One his fiancée, the other rumored to be his lover.’Well the two sisters never spoke again because Emmeline DIED shortly afterward. And as I said, she was never his fiancée. It certainly sounded more dramatic to say so in this passage.6. I thought their midsummer party was always in August. It was on June 21 that year, yet they called it their traditional midsummer party. Indeed, it was the excuse that Hannah gave for wanting to throw the party in the first place - tradition.7. Everyone’s death was treated so matter-of-factly (except for Robbie’s). Each death only rated a page or two (if that).8. And finally, I’ll nitpick… just how big was this locket? So big it could hold a small book or a key to a safety deposit box? That must have been one small book or one big locket. (hide spoiler)]The book is teeming with secrets, some more important than others (but you don’t discover that until the end of the book.) None of the above deters me from reading more of Kate Morton’s work, as she writes beautifully… a truly masterful wordsmith.",8,0.8598,0.09,0.804,0.106,0.5029723000311236,NEGATIVE,0.9999
40,128747734,10/31/2010,2.0,"It wasn't my intention to buy ""The House at Riverton"". A salesperson at a local bookstore recommended ""The Forgotten Garden"", also by Kate Morton, but I wasn't sure if it's any good, so I said that I'll read some reviews first and think about it. And from what I've read, ""The Forgotten Garden"" is a must-read-gothic-mystery novel. I just had to purchase it. I told my mom about the book, and she was also excited since we both have similar tastes in books and movies. When me and my mom went back to the bookstore for a mother-daughter-shopping day, we were anticipating for the bookstore to have copies of the book, but unfortunately, it was sold out after just a couple of days. (I forgot to call-in and have a copy reserved). And so, we settled for ""The House at Riverton"" since it was written by the same author and the story's equally interesting... And we didn't want to leave the store empty-handed. I was really, really, really excited to have it sheathed in clear plastic cover and get started!...And after just a number of chapters, I was genuinely trying to think of ways to procrastinate so I won't have to finish the book.But I want it to be ingrained in me to finish what I've started. So I begged my eyes to keep reading and not to roll around from boredom and disinterest, and dragged my fingers to turn the next page just so I can get to the end where the “secrets are waiting to be revealed”. But I must admit, I liked the way Morton wrote the last chapter (The Tape and Hannah's Letter).I was a little disappointed with ""The House at Riverton"". I like to read gothic-Victorian/Edwardian mysteries with a romance-gone-wrong twist to it. As written in the back cover: A STORY OF LOVE, MYSTERY, AND A SECRET HISTORY REVEALED... Set as the war-shattered Edwardian summer surrenders to the decadent twenties, ""The House at Riverton is a thrilling mystery and a compelling love story.I get the 'mystery' part, but it wasn't thrilling for me at all; Maybe because it was hinted at the first or second (or was it third) chapter that one of the sisters had something to do with the poet's suicide... or wasn't it? Although there were some scenes that got my mind working, I just wanted to keep skipping on to the next chapter for the most part.As for the love story... well, it's a given that in most gothic-mystery novels, the romance part is bound to end tragically, if not, in a macabre fashion (or some characters just end up in the loony-bin). But here, it wasn't the least bit compelling! I never felt the passion and tension between the lovers. Even in a scene where the lovers were meeting clandestinely, I was, in all honesty, preparing myself to be erotically stimulated, but just ended up scoffing. I wasn’t very impressed with the writing and portrayal of the characters Grace and Hannah’s sister-like friendship. The heroine and narrator, Grace, always talks about how she and Hannah are really close and how she was happy to be sharing each others secrets. But I just didn’t feel their connection. It was, as if, Grace was just delusional. I was sighing with relief (and pride!) that I was able to finish the novel as I was just frustrated with almost every page of the book. And I know I won’t be re-reading “The House at Riverton” anytime soon... But hey, that’s just me. In a way it’s still a gothic-mystery-romantic novel in itself. Just see for yourself. Who knows, maybe you’ll love it! ",8,0.9987,0.052,0.753,0.196,0.4851388888888888,NEGATIVE,0.9363
41,903680039,04/07/2014,4.0,"This saga threaded together innumerable intricacies. I warn antsy readers, patience is a must. This story isn’t linear. We veer from 98 year-0ld Grace, who led an extraordinary life, to the origins of the important people in it. It’s abundantly clear that one event cataclysmically scattered the directions of their lives. A director Grace befriends is covering a mysterious death in a film. Grace derives closure from revisiting “Riverton” and being Ursula’s consultant but nothing is blurted. The principal circumstances simmer, for Kate Morton wants us to understand all of the cast members first.I admire what she accomplished more than three stars look. She’s an Australian who knows England. The 1880s conclude in dizzying societal change. War affected enlisters as much as their families and technology exploded; basics like telephones and bathrooms. Shifts in expectations were conveyed astutely through sisters Hannah, who wanted a career and Emmeline, a partier reared with upper crust propriety. Errors that eroded enjoyment were: punctuating queries with “said” instead of “asked” and every page containing “shook their head”; excessively!Everyone is memorable because I understand them intimately but I feel the bulk of traversing 90 years. A sampling of significant periods would be ample, with detailing reserved for key scenes. Much background flavour could be omitted. It’s ludicrous to announce that Alfred reunited with Grace in their sixties but to only give this joyous news one sentence! I would prefer seeing that moment. I couldn’t imagine Grace not telling Hannah she wanted to marry him. Notably, far too much hinged on not correcting Hannah on the street when they were fifteen. She thought Grace had visited a nearby secretarial school. It’s nonsense to not tell Ursula she’s related to someone special. I’m certain her Grandson will, after he has heard his Grandma’s cassette tapes.",8,0.9871,0.062,0.773,0.166,0.5909632034632034,POSITIVE,0.5511

It's not that it's a bad book quite the contrary but there were just so many irksome things that for me detracted from the book as a whole.The House at Riverton tells the story of the Hartford’s, the sisters Hannah and Emmeline specifically through the eyes of Grace their housemaid and later lady’s maid. The story is told through the memories of Grace. Memories that are called to mind all the more with the recent movie being made. The story flicks between Grace in the present winter of 1999 and her memories of the events leading up to 1924.I have to say I enjoyed so much more when we were back in the early 1900’s and into the roaring 1920’s and I think Kate Morton did a great job of capturing that time and era.I liked the characters, some more than others. The character of Grace I loved and I’ll explain why in a moment but first I must talk about what irked me as you will see why I loved Grace.I found we got so much information before the event that I’m not sure it was all totally necessary. I felt we could have gotten a handle on Grace’s character and her devotion to the family and in particular Hannah in far less chapters. I felt the story dragging for the first 3/4 of the book with unnecessary volume.When I look at the break down of the story the first ¾ of the book was given over to the lead up and only in the last ¼ of the story do see the actual events that lead to the death of Robbie Hunter. I also found it a stretch to say this was a mystery. A doomed love story yes and I loved that Hannah finally fell in love with Robbie but a mystery, no for me it wasn’t. The story in that sense was easy to figure out. What I can’t figure out is why we were offered so many tantalising views of Grace’s life after the event and that was not explored. I think Grace and her life were far more interesting. I think the events made Grace into the woman who was not afraid to train to be an archaeologist and even in post war Britain to become a single parent. The part I especially liked was hearing how she and Alfred met again.In whole I felt Ms Morton should have perhaps taken the idea she had for this story and just turn it on its axis a degree or two and begin the story with the events of 1924 and tell us about Grace and her life.",7,0.9971,0.044,0.788,0.168,0.5323953823953824,NEGATIVE,0.9996

48,27744140,07/19/2008,3.0,"I probably should have written my review of this book closer to finishing it, because as of right now, my reaction is pretty much just: Meh. The House at Riverton is a post-WWI gothic type novel that chronicles the life of the Hartford family through the eyes of young Grace Bradley, a servant at Riverton Manor from the age of fifteen. Grace is now ninety-nine years old and recounting the story of her time with the Hartfords (particularly with the two sisters, Hannah and Emmeline) just before and after the war. She is doing so on cassette tapes for her grandson, Marcus, in order to set the record straight about a few things she has been keeping secret for her entire life. The story is now coming to light because a film is being made about the most infamous event surrounding Riverton and the Hartford sisters: the suicide of a famous poet in 1924 at a summer party. The two girls were the only witnesses to the violent act, and neither ever spoke about it publicly. Every summary of this novel makes it seem like the death of Robbie the poet is the central concern of the book, when really it’s barely an issue. This book lives in the moments leading up to Robbie’s death, and the actual events when revealed are really more of a closing note than a climax. Grace, our eyes into this world, tells us what she deems important in order for us to understand the full impact of that night and why it turned out the way it did. I also think Morton wasn’t interested in a shut and close mystery novel. She was telling the story of a era through this family, and in some cases I think her interest in showcasing that period got in the way of her creating effective character moments. The biggest issue I had with this book is one that I picked up on in the first thirty pages: Everything there — themes, events, plot arcs, character types — I’ve read better somewhere else. I don’t think this book added anything of note to any literary discussion involving the gothic, post-WWI books, books about repressed femininity or domestic space, stories about trangression and regret, or the well-worn even in its time literature about The Bright Young Things of the roaring ’20s. Another problem was Grace herself. I get that using a framing device is an homage to novels of this type, but her passivity and her seeming stupidity (despite evidence of intelligence in other places throughout the book) was extremely frustrating. Grace was a cypher character, essentially only there to relate the story of Hannah and Emmeline and Robbie (and the others). This wouldn’t be bad, except that it’s clear Morton was trying to make her a 3-D character in her own right, and I don’t think she succeeded. The only times Grace was a worthwhile character was during the sections of narration from her ninety-nine year old self. During the flashback scenes, she’s just furniture, not even active in her own life, not even aware that she’s passive. If later Grace had made it clear that her past self was useless then this wouldn’t be as much of a problem, but it’s not something that’s acknowledged in the text at all. Grace the character might as well not even have existed, frankly. This is particularly frustrating because the way Morton wrote her, Grace was perfectly placed to have some great character interactions with the others, but never does. The fact that I so wanted her to have these interactions made it even worse. And the ending. The soapy and melodramatic nature of the whole thing was a complete turn-off, and even though Morton tried to play it off as being all about Grace and her regret, the actual execution of it didn’t make it come off that way for me. It just played out as pointless tragedy, from my point of view. I also thought that ending actually cheapened the relationship between the sisters, and that Emmeline’s actions were not at all understandable within the framework of the story Morton had created. Very out of character. If that was going to be the ending all along, Morton needed to have set up different character work entirely on Emmeline. I don’t believe at all that she would have done what she did. It felt cheap. I also thought the bits about the film being made felt very shallow, especially since we were clearly meant to think that they were deep and insightful. The thing that bugged me most about the book is how dumb Grace seemed (view spoiler)[in not realizing her father was Frederick (the lord of Riverton), and that Hannah and Emmeline were her sisters. It was INCREDIBLY obvious, especially during the funeral scene when he shows up to mourn her mother. She’s like, Oh gee, why is Lord Frederick here? I have no idea. Oh, also, I wonder who my father is? GRACE YOU FUCKING IDIOT. (hide spoiler)] Can’t figure out if Morton meant us to realize it long before Grace did, and if so, what would be the point of that. Did she WANT us to think Grace was the world’s stupidest person? In terms of the audiobook version, which is the one I read, it was very good excepting the times when Caroline Lee had to voice American characters. Her American accents were the worst I’ve ever heard. She is incapable of speaking in an American accent without elongating every word and making every character sound like a pretentious asshole. In some cases, her accent actually harms the characters and undermines the way I think they were meant to be perceived (particularly in Teddy’s case). There were some truly enjoyable aspects to this novel, despite my issues with it. I thought Morton’s handling of the post-war stuff was really good, as was the the girls’ frustrations with the limitations put upon their gender. I also liked the love story, even if I didn’t like how it ended, and genuinely liked all the characters as well. I just wish she had been a bit more conscientious of character interactions, because as far as I’m concerned, having all these great characters and missing out on potentially great moments between them is a crime.",6,0.9948,0.094,0.76,0.146,0.5338017598343685,NEGATIVE,0.9985

It is a time of change, too quick for some, too slow for others.

These are books in which the story, place, and characters all conspire to sweep the reader away from current reality, current problems, current worries. And this book would lead the way.Written by Kate Morton, this is the story of Grace, a housemaid-turned-lady's maid in a large manor home in England beginning just before World War I. (Think ""Downton Abbey"" but with more of a ""downstairs"" focus.) When Grace begins working at Riverton, she is only 14 and very shy but totally dutiful. She soon meets the grandchildren of the master and mistress, David, Hannah, and Emmeline, who frequently vacation there. Grace feels an immediate connection. Through loveless marriages, tragic wars, illicit lovers, the revelation of shocking secrets, and desperate financial losses, this book, with a touch of literary Gothic, traces the history of the slow decline of the great British aristocracy after World War I through the lives of one family. The house, named Riverton, is as much a character as any of the humans who inhabit it. Morton's incredible descriptions paint a word picture that is bold and bright and makes this 300-year-old mansion and its extraordinary gardens and grounds pop off the page in full life.Bonus: Agatha Christie makes a cameo appearance at a dinner at Riverton. If you're a fan, you'll love this part!The novel's ingenious plotline is complex enough to make it fascinating (albeit a tiny bit predictable), and the characters are distinct and vibrant.

This is a long read, 468 pages, therefore, if you are not one who enjoys slow-burns, who does not appreciate a story which trifles backwards & forth through time, & perhaps someone who is not in the mood to read such a long story then, I would not suggest you endeavour this one. However, if you are in the mood to be transported through a story which moves through the World Wars, through the changing times, & within the recollections of an individual as they gauge the impact of their participation in things which at a glance seems to render her the third party; I would highly recommend this book. What I enjoy most about Morton's writing is the ease with which she crafts a complete & delectable story; the characters are so well fleshed-out that I often find myself convinced of their antics & terribly sad for them when they move, permanently, off-page. She is able to delicately weave a tale so absurd yet, so like the lives we lead in reality that, I cannot help but crave another book once I've put one down. I find myself reflecting for hours after the final pages, about the unfortunate reality which is missed opportunities, chances we didn't take & love we never had the luck to see through.

The writing in itself isn’t spectacular, though the story is good. Nice characters, nice setting, interesting plot. I wish the writer hadn’t told us beforehand what to expect at the end, though given the entire concept of the book (young woman making a film about a tragic event that took place at Riverton while gathering details from Grace, former housemaid in the house 80 years before) it was pretty much inevitable, yet not completely. For some reason, Morton chooses Grace to be the narrator of the story, so given the 1st person narrative, all the details she gives about the other characters’ inner lives and private conversations seem rather hard to believe. Actually Morton uses an artifice – Hannah (one of the main characters) telling Grace everything in a confession – (everything? seriously?) which is again hard to believe, lest a 99 year old woman’s memory is as intact as it was many decades ago.

Grace, the main character, was like the ghost of the story, appearing only in the present day as a frail and elderly woman, to recount her story. I think the author did this intentionally to emphasise the essence of the life of a maid, one dedicated to the aristocracy of the house, where is was desirable to go unseen. I also did not enjoy the chronological order of the story. Many of the final events were revealed early on, which spoiled the surprise affect, and what was hidden till the end was hardly surprising, and I felt not worth the wait.

I did not think it made sense that all the service people knew who Grace's mother was, said they liked her yet had no relationship with her at all. Plus they all liked Frederick yet he showed no redeeming qualities at all. He was a really really an unlikeable character. And the archeologist business, please!

The house maid has a secret, a secret that makes no difference in her life what so ever. And the secret was no surprise! We all knew Robbie really didn't kill himself. I never found my self reading as fast as I could to figure out what ever mystery the next page would hold. The story boils down to a love triangle with a tragic ending. I feel like if Kate would have focused more on the rivalry between the two sisters, and expressed more of the passion between Hannah and Robbie the book would have been better. Instead the book focuses on Hannah and her kept secret. I wish her keeping the secret would have meant something in her life, changed something for her that would have created more of a climax... in HER life. Instead it's only her conscious that's effected. In my opinion Grace was way to happy being a Lady's maid!

She then blackmails them into giving her her rightful inheritance and goes on to marry Alfred and they have adventures together!

The story is ok and very ""Kate Morton"", what with a character reminiscing about a past full of history, mystery and secrets, but I couldn't shake off that feeling of ""this looks soooo much like 'Downton Abbey'"". Not that I'm saying that Morton decided to plagiarise 'Downton Abbey' (I think this book was written some years before the to the series came to the screen), but since I've watched all the series' seasons, it didn't feel like something new. And, as I said, the story wasn't that breathtaking. Except for the end, when we understand what exactly happened. For me, that was the best part of the book. Hence the half star I'm adding to the three I was set up on giving.As for the characters, there wasn't exactly one I felt drawn to. I liked Grace, of course. But I thought it a shame we weren't told more about her life after Riverton. What we know are the few crumbles the author felt like throwing in, but they are not enough to make a full path. Hannah reminded me too much of Lady Mary (yes, Downton again), I didn't like Emmeline, but it would have been interesting to know a bit more of her end and what led to it, and Robbie Hunter didn't exactly faze me.

Neither is this a mystery so much as a melodrama à la Atonement. Sure, there are secrets and crimes and star-crossed lovers, but the blurb is an unabashed red herring: this is Grace’s story, not the young poet’s, not the Hartford sisters’. The result is gentle rather than thrilling, but what blurb would proclaim a book “a gentle mystery”?In the frame story, the elderly narrator is too frail to be a dramatic storyteller. Morton might have left the main story unframed; although these sections provide reasons for Grace to confront her memories, they left me with irrelevant questions about her daughter Ruth and her grandson Marcus – not to mention his late wife, Rebecca. In the main story, the young maid is such a character of contradictions that, ironically, she seems utterly realistic. She’s a fan of Conan Doyle and Christie but a terrible solver of Riverton’s mysteries. She is principled but not completely honest; intelligent but not, as a rule, perceptive. Grace keeps secrets of all sorts but blows the lid clean off the one that matters.Yet, therein, for me, lay her appeal. Like the stolid sidekicks of Holmes and Poirot, Grace merely describes things, thereby giving us the satisfaction of figuring things out.

The GR/Amazon summary describes it as ""perfect for fans of Downton Abbey,"" but I found it much more evocative of Upstairs Downstairs in the rigidity of class structure, social attitudes, and suspicion of anything or anyone non-English, especially in the Downstairs characters; Mr. Hudson and Mrs. Bridges could easily have substituted for Mr. Hamilton and Mrs. Townsend as butler and cook. There are plenty of secrets and plot twists, one of which is Grace's parentage (which I deduced early on), and it's a bit predictable.

I bought this book in May 2018, intending to read it ""soon""; but it seems like I can't understand the meaning of this word!I buddy-read The House at Riverton with two friends: it was so good!! I loved basically everything here, but let's detail a bit! It's the first book ""labelled"" for fans of Downton Abbey that I really love, and which makes me feel just the way I feel when I'm watching the TV series. It's like I'm part of the family when I'm watching; well, I felt so close to Grace and her relatives when I was reading! She becomes real throughout the book, a friend, someone we listen to for more than 500 pages. Of course, the period helps: exactly the same years as Downton Abbey! Because of this closeness, I pictured Mr. Hamilton as Carson in the series, Mrs. Townsend a bit like Mrs. Patmore, Alfred as Alfred, Mrs. Tibbit could have been this damned O'Brien, Lady Clementine was Rosamund to me, and Lady Violet Ashbury felt close to Lady Violet Grantham! Hannah made me think of Mary; Emmeline might have had bits of Rose! I was absorbed by this book, transported in Riverton, in Grace's room, in Grosvenor Square: it was an amazing feeling. It felt like coming home, just like when I'm watching Downton Abbey! But, this book had more than just a Downtonesque atmosphere: it was also quite Gothic: HOW CAN I NOT LIKE SUCH A BOOK?! The author's note convinced me I was not dreaming: she lists all the Gothic bits she put in her novel! From the very first sentence, the reader can feel that she is heavily influenced by Daphne du Maurier: it is just, basically, the first sentence of 
Rebecca
, rewritten! What a delight! Just to track all those Gothic aspects, I would like to reread this book! Then, as I just said earlier, I felt very close to Grace. She is an old woman, a granny, when we first meet her, but she also tells the story of the time when she was a young girl at Riverton. I don't know if it's the double narrative, or if it's just her character that is so lovely and attaching, but I loved both stories, the past and the present. The latter revolves around her relationship with her grandson, and the way she tries to reach out for him *shivers*. I was so moved by her: I nearly cried at some points. (view spoiler)[I was so frustrated when she learns Alfred married Lucy Starling, and so so SO glad when we learn they finally got together at sixty! (hide spoiler)] I was completely in for the romance!! For the past: Grace has a secret she doesn't want to share; but she needs to. It's so heavy she is, and has been, plagued by it her entire life. She needs to tell what happened this night, and what led up to this event. Such a mystery! I guessed some things, but not the biggest reveal!! (view spoiler)[What a shock to ""see"" Mary (sorry, Hannah: I definitely thought she looked like Mary Crawley!) killing Robbie, when I was sure it would be Emmeline!! (hide spoiler)] I also loved the way we can see both worlds: upstairs and downstairs; but also the way women are imprisoned socially: (view spoiler)[when Hannah decides to marry to escape her fossilized situation, the reader kind of already knows that she will only get in an even more fossilized position! She can't live the life she would like to live: she is not allowed to travel, to work, to be witty, intelligent, and to think about important things. Kind frustrating!! And I was so glad Robbie and Hannah matched so perfectly. What a cruel ending!! (but what a Gothic one!) (hide spoiler)] Both Grace and Hannah aren't free in a way: Grace is at the bottom of the social ladder, while Hannah, being on top, can't choose what she does for a living. Their relationship was beautiful (view spoiler)[but also quite toxic: Grace lives through Hannah, by proxy. For her, she refuses to marry Alfred, who's clearly the love of her life!! And, in the end, this ""privilegied"" relationship spoils everything: Grace wanted to be loved by Hannah, and lied to her to be close to her. The reader can finally understand her guilt in the end: what a mess! (hide spoiler)]Lastly, the writing-style: I already wanted to read all the books published by Kate Morton because their synopsis attract me, but now MORE THAN EVER! She writes so beautifully: I reread and marked some quotes I found so true! She captures the moment and succeeds in putting words on it, words we can't always found by ourselves.

88,3192744662,03/03/2020,3.0,"I've enjoyed Kate Morton's books and was looking forward to this one. In The Shifting Fog, (also known as The House of Riverton), a dual time narrative, an elderly woman, Grace Bradley, reflects on her time as a maid for the Hartford family. She begins service in 1914 at the age of 14, and soon is entranced by the grandchildren of the house - David, Hannah and Emeline Hartford. She remains in service during the war, and afterward as Hannah's Lady's maid during the roaring twenties. Grace’s recollections show a shift from the certainties of an earlier era, shattered by the brutality of World War 1 and the frenetic, brittle greed for wild parties and experience in the twenties. It also unravels the personal tragedies of the Hartford family. There is much to love in The Shifting Fog, the loving detail and recreation of two (or perhaps three) eras, the well-drawn characters and the element of mystery and tragedy. That said, I found it a slow start and even towards the end, the pacing dragged at times. Grace is slow to realise a secret hinted from early in the book and, while the climatic ending has a twist, it did feel a little contrived. And at times I felt more entranced with Grace's other - second after-service life as an archaeologist, which we learn so little about. But then, I'm being picky. The Shifting Fogholds pathos and tragedy, an ode to a changing world, and a fabulous recreation of a transition from seeming stability to chaos with changing ideas of duty, honour and worth.

I thought I had figured out the ""twist"" in this book but was surprised in the end to find out I had gotten it wrong. Description of life during and after WWI in England feels authentic, and she does a great job capturing the emotions of the different characters.For this book, I want to give a trigger warning for PTSD.",3,0.8199,0.05,0.838,0.111,0.5447936507936508,POSITIVE,0.9994

It's hard to believe this was Kate Morton's debut novel, as good as it is. It makes me very excited to read more of her books.The story is told from the perspective of 98-year-old Grace Bradley, who was once a housemaid at Riverton Manor, a large estate in the English countryside. During her decade or so in service, beginning in 1914 when she was just 14 years old, Grace witnesses and becomes entwined in the lives, losses, and secrets of the Hartford family, in particular of the family's two daughters, Hannah and Emmeline. As her life comes to a close in the late 1990s, Grace recounts for her grandson the complicated truth about life at Riverton and her role in a tragedy that took place there in the 1920s - something she's kept silent about for over 70 years.In addition to the riveting family mystery at the heart of the novel, Morton also explores the changing world of the British aristocracy and those who worked for them during the years before, during, and after WWI. It was fascinating and enjoyable to slip away into that long-lost time and feel like I was living alongside the servants and family at Riverton.Hauntingly beautiful and so, so good.

95,2100370088,09/25/2017,4.0,"This was a beautifully-written novel that takes us back to early 20th century England, and the stately manor home called Riverton (very Downton Abbey-esque). The central setting of the book, in fact, is just like Downton Abbey - featuring upstairs/downstairs relations, with our main character, Grace, as a housemaid-turned-lady's maid. The premise of the novel is that Grace (a now 98 year-old woman in a nursing facility) is approached at the beginning of the story by a filmmaker, keen to re-tell the story of poet Robert Hunter, who'd famously committed suicide on the lake at Riverton. As Grace had been present at the scene when it happened, and she's the only surviving witness now, she's asked to assist with some interviewing and scene-setting. But 'going back' to Riverton and reliving that summer of 1924 is a heartbreaking thing for Grace to do. She has reason for doing so, though. Through a series of tapes (a diary of sorts) for her long-lost grandson, Grace wants to tell her story, and piece together the puzzle of Riverton and the Hartford family that she served - namely the sisters Hannah and Emmaline. As such, the story moves back and forth through time - to the 1910s-20s, and back again to the 90s when Grace is telling her story as an old woman. Slowly, we see the bonds of sisterhood (Hannah and Emmaline) come together, the sacrifice and dedication of servitude (Grace and the rest of the servants at Riverton), plenty of scandal, secrets, and yes... tragedy. I genuinely enjoyed this book a lot. Having read Kate Morton's ""The Secret Keeper"" just a month ago, I couldn't wait to dive into another of her fabulous stories. While this was not as good as ""The Secret Keeper"", it was well-written and very creatively thought out. I can tell, however, that it was Morton's first book, as the details of the intricate plot line don't as seamlessly fit together, and even I was able to guess at one of the twists (something I could not have done in ""The Secret Keeper""). I'm having a hard time putting my thoughts into words, because while I really liked this book, it left me with an uneasy feeling. This is not a happy ending - and I hadn't expected that. There's no great love story, or heartwarming connection (of friendship or family, even). Sure, there are bits and pieces of those as the story moves along, but nearly every relationship is severed and destroyed at some part - some permanently. There's a lot of death, a lot of sadness, a ton of heartbreak. By the time I got to the last line, I was sad to see it end because I wanted to be left with a warmer feeling. I was not. I think that's the point, though, so the book isn't to be faulted for it. It's deep and moving and makes you feel, which is a beautiful trait in a novel. I genuinely liked the characters and their development - especially Grace and Hannah - and found myself surprised (not for the better) by the ways others turned out. This is a story that has twists and turns right up to the very end - and it IS the ending that makes the whole novel. I'll admit that the middle portion dragged on a fair bit longer than it needed to, but things certainly wrapped up by the final page, and not in ways you'd expect. Again, a fairly dreary end to a very well-done book. That makes my review somewhat lackluster, I suppose, but I promise it isn't because I didn't like it. I really did!

96,269927146,01/30/2012,2.0,"A friend of mine recommended Kate Morton, but the only novel of hers available at my library was 
The House at Riverton
. I didn't realize when I checked it out that it was Morton's first work. In this case, inexperience shows. I prefer character-driven novels, but I do love a good mystery. However, if your plot is going to be the driving force, rather than the characters, it needs to be pretty darn spellbinding to keep my attention. And if the characters are going to be the main focus, they'd better be brilliant. I fully admit to skimming through major portions of the middle of this novel. The plot is clichéd and unfortunately the characters are too. Grace, the narrator, came across as flat to me. I didn't really identify with her motivations, if she had any. Loyalty is one of her main characteristics, but the idea that she remains loyal to a childhood fascination with her employers doesn't really come across as realistic. The other main characters were unlikeable. I don't care for the precocious-children trope as a rule and in this case Hannah, Emmeline, David, and their poet friend Robbie read as watery faux-Brontës. If you don't like the characters, it's hard to understand why they would like each other, and since their relationships form the underpinnings of the mystery plot, it all kind of falls apart. The plot is just a mish-mash of gothic melodrama, and it's fairly predictable once you get into the story and have the characters established. With the heavy foreshadowing that Robbie's tragic suicide is not as it seems, (no spoiler, the suicide is referred to from the start) it's not too difficult to figure out where the author is taking us. It all sort of ties into Grace's present-day family dilemmas, but I found myself too uninterested in her to care. Side note: I've come to a realization about my own reading tastes. I've discovered I don't actually like Epic Sagas. I don't like Fantasy Sagas at all, and I don't like Historical Sagas or Family Tragedy Sagas. They all tend to feature unrealistically larger-than-life characters and melodramatic motivations I just can't relate to. I make a few exceptions, like for Tolkien. Epics have to be extremely well-written to keep my attention. This novel is just not very well-written at all. Aside from being clichéd, it also features prose that seems to be trying too hard. A painting is described as ""furtively hanging"" and while I understand what the author is trying to accomplish by personifying the painting as ""furtive"" it just reads as affected and silly. Or she uses words incorrectly - ""Hannah said wondrously"" for instance. I think you mean ""wonderingly"" and anyway adverbs to describe speech should be more sparing. Any good points? Well, the setting is fun and the author clearly did a lot of research, but most of the time she's able to include historical detail without coming across as info-dumpy. And since it's only her first book, I'm willing to give her another try. I'll have to find one of her later novels. Several other reviews mention that this is definitely the weakest. If the plot and characters are stronger, I'll even accept some Family Tragedy Epicness. ",3,0.9782,0.102,0.753,0.144,0.4914351851851852,NEGATIVE,1.0
97,2719231765,04/10/2019,2.0,"I'm leaving The House at Riverton feeling frustrated. Frustrated, because this book was full of promises. Frustrated, because the last quarter of the book was really good, but I was so underwhelmed by everything that came before. Frustrated, because I've read one of Kate Morton's more recent works, The Lake House and adored it so much.To be honest, I was so intrigued by this book : it was labelled for fans of Downton Abbey and it is rightfully so. The setting and some of the characters are so reminiscent of it (but this book was written before Downton Abbey aired). I probably tried to like this book very hard from the beginning because of it. The setting and some of the characters (well... Hannah and Grace, that is) were probably my favourite things about the story.Then it all went downhill, because I quickly found myself bored. While the summary speaks about a glittering party in 1924, this novel starts ten years earlier, and you only get to 1924 in the last quarter of the novel, which is a shame. Summaries that give too much away can ruin a book for me and oh my, did it do that this time. I felt like it took me ages to finish this book, because I was waiting for an event to happen : an event that was discussed in the summary, but only happened at the end. Somehow, I feel cheated and I hate it so much.While most of the book felt painfully slow to me (… and I actually love slow-paced books), I found the foreshadowing to be too heavy at times : I discovered almost everything that was part of the various mysteries of the novel and I didn't really feel shocked by anything that happened. I did feel for the characters though : I found myself compelled by the story in the last quarter, but it wasn't enough to save the novel.Moreover, I found peculiar to have Grace be the narrator of the story... But barely scratching the surface of what happens to her after these infamous 1924 events. From the glimpses that we got, she seemed to have such an interesting life and I would have wanted to know her story. It made me feel so distanced from her and even more so when her narrative was mostly erased during the last quarter of the novel... During the exciting parts of The House a Riverton, that is.As I've read one of Kate Morton's latter novels, I know what her writing style is like now and I can say that she improved a lot as a writer, in my opinion. The storytelling felt a bit clumsy at times in this debut novel, while the ending of the novel was so much stronger and gripping, showing her potential. I think that I should just stick to her latter works from now on.Overall, I wanted to love this book more than I did and it unfortunately is a very disappointing read. I was so happy to read a novel a little bit reminiscent of Downton Abbey, but it didn't live up to my expectations. I found it so very slow, even though the last quarter of the book was a bit better, but it wasn't enough for me. It was a missed opportunity for me, but I know that I can like Kate Morton's books, so it makes it okay somehow.I didn't hate it, but well...

98,3460060443,07/26/2021,3.0,"The House at Riverton provided very satisfactory entertainment during a long and arduous flight, for which I’ll always be grateful. Morton is my go-to for travel reading because she can cut through the distractions, and her first novel was up to the job.Riverton is an upstairs-downstairs story, and gets off to a fairly slow start. The novel seems divided into halves, one with a Downton Abbey-ish story, the other with a darker, more gothic tone. It’s completely unfair to compare Riverton to Downton, since the novel precedes the show, but they both live in the same cultural memory and cannot escape comparison. The upstairs-downstairs thing just isn’t my favorite; I’d prefer sticking with one or the other rather than both. (view spoiler)[The Game was disappointingly unexplored. Is that what Hannah left to Grace? What did she do with it--give it to Marcus? I wanted more of that. (hide spoiler)]Having read all of Morton’s novels except one, I could see how this story is 100% Morton, but the storytelling craft is refined in her later books. If she’d written this same story in the pattern of her later novels, I could tell exactly what choices she’d make. Ursula would have been in the scriptwriting stage, and been the contemporary narrator. The climax would have come earlier, and the denouement would have been longer. More time would have been spent in certain places, less at the beginning. Yet, Riverton is a fine novel, just not up to the standard Morton sets for herself with later books.The author’s note included the following paragraph in which Morton outlines the concepts that scaffold every single one of her books:“I have long been interested, as a reader and as a researcher, in novels, like The House at Riverton, that utilize tropes of the literary Gothic: the haunting of the present by the past; the insistence of family secrets; return of the repressed; the centrality of inheritance (material, psychological and physical); haunted houses (particularly haunting of a metaphorical nature); suspicion concerning new technology and changing methods; the entrapment of women (whether physical or social) and associated claustrophobia; character doubling; the unreliability of memory and the partial nature of history; mysteries and the unseen; confessional narrative; and embedded texts.” (472)For any literature students out there, this list held up against all of Morton’s novels would be a fantastic (and easy) exercise. I love it when a writer succeeds at her craft, comfortable in her way of storytelling. Morton’s novels aren’t “deep” or particularly ~literary~, but they capture the human experience and construct marvelous settings that sweep readers away. That’s why I like reading them while traveling. They don’t require too much brainpower, but are more substantial than fluff. They give me something to think about while waiting in security lines and lugging bags around. And for that, I’ll always reach for Morton when I leave.",3,0.9915,0.053,0.816,0.131,0.3469469127363865,NEGATIVE,0.9964
99,36801816,11/02/2008,4.0,"This book is a gently-told narrative that brings the reader into the Edwardian period and takes us right through into the 1920s, with all its changes in society and mores. Living through the eyes of Grace, our narrator at the age of 98, the story comes alive. It is 1999 and her memories are awakened by Ursula, whose project is to tell the story of the House at Riverton to be featured in a film, reflecting on the historical significance of the family and household. Grace agrees to be interviewed about her recollections of life with the prestigious Ashbury family, against the wishes of her caretaker/companion Sylvia.At the urging of her mother, Grace is hired on as a housemaid in this home to Lords and Ladies prior to WWI. The staff is fairly close-knit and she is treated well. There are three children related to the family visiting when she arrives and she forms a bond of sorts with them, in particular with Hannah, a rather independent young lady.Grace tells the tale of the many unexpected but ceaseless changes (some very surprising) through her long life through the eyes of remembrance. But there is always a feeling of something not quite right as the story unfolds with an ongoing background of secrets untold and misunderstood. Our storyteller is one of the very few remaining witnesses to this history alive. She tells her story between brief interviews with Ursula, producer of the film, with whom she bonds and whose visits she begins to look forward to as time goes on. Between these interludes her story is told in word pictures of her mind, her memories become alive and she takes us with her. The two daughters of the original family are inextricably entwined with the life of Grace throughout. There is no difficulty in knowing when she is in the present and when she is in the past.Everything is here, romance, missed opportunities, casualties of war (physically and psychologically) at a time when very little is known to help these victims, old-wealth class, rebellion against the place of women, and more, but there is something more human than we find in the usual Edwardian/Victorian era historical books, and always the hidden secrets are lurking about.

100,1585451935,03/20/2016,3.0,"My last book by Kate Morton. I've now read them all and this is by far, sigh, my least favorite. The House at Riverton was slow paced, scattered, uninteresting at times, divulged way too much of details that did not contribute to the central plot and was not half as cohesive as her other works. The novel was still the exquisite writing of Kate Morton and in parts and sections, beautiful paragraphs and chapters that I could totally re-read for pure pleasure, but as far as the story and plot moving forward in a reasonable pace to keep me intrigued, not to mention characters that I could fall in love with, boy did I struggle. I started with the audiobook, and then turned to my Kindle and finished the last 200 pages staying up until 4am last night. You know how you get frustrated that things aren't happening as fast and maybe you are not reading as fast, well, it did pick up pace, but I was still not as intrigued.What I liked: The mystery element that is present in all of her works, and the focus on secrets, long ago secrets and immediate secrets weighing on the conscience of the characters. Grace was certainly one to sympathize with, and her guilt was revealed at the end, filling in the final pieces of the puzzle. I couldn't care much for David Harford, Hannah or Emmeline. I found myself caring more for the servant staff at Riverton than the main characters: Nancy, Mr. Hamilton, Alfred and Mrs. Townsend were far more important to me than Hannah and Emmeline. The river scene was creative, and I have to say, she managed to surprise me yet again. I did not see how a simple white lie early in the story between Hannah and Grace could have let to such a disaster at the very end. Assumptions can not only make fools of us. They can be fatal too if taken too far!!! Still, no matter, I would highly recommend any of Morton's works. The story telling gets tighter as she moves on and grows and matures even more as a writer, gifted as she is, she too shows improvement and growth and it's a beautiful process to watch, once you have experienced the author's entire works.

As she nears the end of her life, she forces herself to confront her past and what happened on that fateful night when the Hartford family legacy was forever stained.Grace begins her service with the Hartford family as a young girl at the urging of her mother. The lives of the servants at Riverton are every bit as dramatic and intriguing as the lives of the wealthy family that owns the home, and their loyalty is largely unparalleled.Siblings Hannah, Emmeline, and David are the lifeblood of the home, and their relationships, secrets, and games entrance Grace while stirring her envy and admiration. Hannah takes the most notice of the young serving girl, and as time progresses, cultivates a relationship with her of extreme trust and dependence.As the war comes and takes the men in body and in spirit, the Hartford siblings become scattered and lost. Hannah and Emmeline long for independence and take different steps to obtain it–steps that have terrible and far reaching consequences.Morton’s strengths are in her deft rendering of intimate friendships and complexities of plot. Story lines are woven through time, space, and character with facility. She is a master of suspense, and even when some stories can be guessed, others come as a complete surprise. All three of Morton’s novels have kept me entertained throughout and satisfied upon their conclusion.Morton has established herself as one of the great literary gothic writers of our time.

Du Maurier was my first grown-up author when I was young. She wrote gothic type romantic mysteries such as Rebecca and Jamaica Inn which were my two favorite books.My very favorite quote from this book is on page 366 When an arrogant and affluent man named Teddy says to Robbie, the bohemian poet. ""So, what is it you do for a crust, Mr. Hunter? My wife tells me you're not in business."" That an alternative existed no longer occurred to him.I laughed out loud and choked on my morning coffee. I don't know why this was so funny to me except that it was so very pretentious. Actually the novel is a serious step back into the 1920s and 30s diving into the romanticism of gothic literature. Up until the last third of the book I was going to give it 4 stars but the ending swept me along like a fast wave that I was almost numb to the end. It was shocking and unexpected. So, 5 stars I gave it.The story is mainly about two privileged girls, Hannah and Emmeline and Hannah's personal ladies maid, Grace. It takes place partly at Riverton, an English countryside mansion and London. The story is told by Grace in flashbacks, who is 98 and living out her last days in a nursing home. The story revolves around the suicide of Robbie the bohemian poet who is Hannah's true love. I will say that it is intriguing mystery but to say any more would be to give the story away.

Place was important here, too, but what mattered more with Riverton were the characters, and she got me to really care. The book's not perfect (hence the ""touch generous,"" above) -- I saw a couple of the surprises coming about 10 miles away, but I hadn't quite predicted the biggest surprise, which was actually satisfying. With TFG, Morton wove a number of storylines together, across 3 or 4 different time periods, and part of the mystery was how they were going to come together in the end. For a slow reader like me, there was sometimes difficulty in keeping up. This time, even though Morton again goes back and forth, it's really only from present to one past storyline. It's much easier to follow and much easier to begin to feel for the characters. Grace, the protagonist, is in service at Riverton, although it's clear from the present scenes that she decidedly broke away from that life, and you wonder why and how. She is delightful in her old age and, as I got to know her in the 1910s and 1920s, I began to love her then, too.

The novel opens in 1999 when Grace Bradley, the narrator who is ninety-eight years old, is approached by a film maker who is interested in Grace’s memories of a tragic night in 1924 when a young poet took his life at the House at Riverton. Grace has been haunted by the fateful night, as well as her unwitting role in the events, and knows the real secret of what actually transpired. Sent to work as a maid at Riverton House in 1914, Grace was witness to the dramatic changes within the Hartford family, as well as the end of the final days of Edwardian nobility and the long standing traditions of country life. Told in flashback, the reader bears witness to Grace’s coming of age, as well as the unraveling of many long kept secrets. Exploring topics such as familial love, duty and responsibility, and truth, The House at Riverton is full of twists and turns, some the reader will see coming, others that they will not. Morton does an excellent job illustrating the divisions between the gentry and the working class, as well as the devastation and effects of World War I.

The ominous foreshadowing from the beginning until the final chapter was annoying.

I was relieved that she was forthcoming about her sources of inspiration, because her plot was incredibly derivative. She also owes a debt to Rosamund Pilcher and Elizabeth Jane Howard, who are the queens of British war melodramas. The mystery and intrigue central to the plot are pretty quickly sussed out, which renders clumsy the frequent foreshadowing.Yet, there is so much to enjoy. Morton is gracious and endearing storyteller, exacting of historical detail and honest of emotion. This was her first novel; I read her second, The Forgotten Garden a few months ago and was completely enchanted. I admire the evident joy she takes in the novel and look forward to reading her next.

As told through the eyes of Grace, a lady's maid to the affluent Ashbury family and sometime confidant of the beautiful eldest daughter, Hannah, the novel revels in the secrets we keep from each other and from ourselves, and how sometimes those secrets can return to haunt us. As an old woman in a nursing home, Grace has hidden away the secret of a tragic suicide on the Ashbury estate that marked the end of her innocence and the end of an era; a visit from a filmmaker recreating the halcyon days at the house at Riverton stirs Grace's memories and plunges her back into the past. The novel skillfully veers between past and present, the observations of naive younger Grace salted by elderly Grace's wit and foreshadowing. Grace is an engaging narrator, with a few secrets of her own; and secondary characters such as the effervescent younger sister, Evie, liven the tale; but it is Grace's mistress, Hannah - headstrong, intelligent, and constrained by society's hypocritical mores - who captures the reader's heart.

You come to care about her, to understand her motivations and loyalties. And then, the end of the book comes, and you realize what she REALLY has been living with for so many years. My heart hurt and my gut wrenched for her. I can't explain without spoiling the end. Neither of the two books that I've read by this author had happy endings, but neither does life. It's messy.The historical aspects that this book captured were very interesting as well. Seeing the way life changed, both upstairs and down, due to the World Wars. My favorite thought from this book was about relationships. There were 3 siblings, and so as long as there were 3, they formed a triangle, and it was stable.

This one has elements of the popular British series, Upstairs, Downstairs. The narrator, Grace was once the maid to the Hartfords who lived at Riverton. Riverton is an old country estate set near Essex. Grace is now 99 years old and lives in a nursing home. She is contacted by a film director whose film concerns the sisters Emmeline and Hannah and the suicide of a poet, R.S. Hunter. Where Mrs. Morton shines is in creating the atmosphere of the 1910-1920s when life changed drastically as a result of the Great War. She is able to blend past and present day seamlessly and naturally. Whilst there will be few dramatic twists, and the story can be slow in parts, she is definitely a good storyteller. But it does have some moments of suspension of belief but well worth reading. Even though this meshes romance with mystery, some great themes are shown and not told. These include gender, class and some racial disparities. And for book lovers, well mystery novels featured heavily here. Even Agatha Christie. For me, the icing on the cake was the author’s note and conversation. Never would have classified this as literary gothic work.

Grace Bradley, a woman in her late 90s, is the main narrator of the novel. Her account of her life in service as a maid at Riverton House begins in 1914, shortly before the outbreak of the First World War. She is then 14 and spends the next decade of her life in service to the Hartford family. The novel, as it unfolds, is a bit of a slow burner. But I hasten to add, not dull. It has all the flavor and suspense of 'Upstairs Downstairs' and 'Downton Abbey.' Read on and you'll find yourself transported back to a time in which a society caught between the dying echoes of the Victorian and Edwardian Ages, was harshly shaken to its core by a world war and then afterwards sought to rebalance itself in the Roaring '20s through resuming a normal and ordered existence, wild parties, and licentious living.",3,0.3732,0.067,0.844,0.089,0.3936507936507937,POSITIVE,0.9996
115,1997034212,05/17/2017,4.0,"Actual Rating: 3.5 StarsThis is my very first Kate Morton book, and unsurprisingly, I found it extremely addictive to read in spite of the fact that there were so many frustrating events.  The story itself even seemed to drag a little bit at some points, and I found that there were some points where I wished the progression would just move on already and give us the next event.  Foreshadowing left little to be interpreted, thus making all the secrets left to be revealed pretty predictable.  Really, the only thing I think I finished reading the book for were the little holes of the story left to fill in, and Kate Morton's beautiful writing style.I guess I also kind of hoped that we would get to catch a few more glimpses of Grace's life post-Riverton.  Truth be told, while the story about the Hartford sisters, with the main focus being on Hannah, was intriguing, I can't say that I truly felt much care for their day-to-day lives, or how conflicting their life decisions were.  Even the main, tragic event that Grace continually alludes to throughout the book ended up being less than interesting, once you picked up all the hints and figured out what probably really happened.I knew going into this that it was obviously not going to be a Happily Ever After; that the book was going to be hauntingly tragic, even if atmospherically attractive.  While I had a hard time relating to characters--this was, after all, a much different world than what I'm used to in modern times--it was hard not to entirely sympathize with them, even though it was clear that our main characters all kind of dug their own graves (pun, not quite intended) with each and every step they took forward in their lives. I found myself wincing outwardly whenever a character made an important decision that I KNEW was not going to end well for anyone.I even openly winced when Grace kept getting dragged into the middle of her Mistress's secrets, and while I found it frustrating that she would be so intent and passionate about her loyalties to Hannah, it was also understandable, in a way.  Again, this is a different world than what I know, after all, and people's mindsets were infinitely different.Nonetheless, the book was written very beautifully, and with such a big secret being lead up to for the bulk of the book, I subconsciously found the need to keep right on reading.  Predictable as it was, I still loved how the story was framed and formatted, as Grace remembering the past and recording her story and the story of those at Riverton for her grandson to hear.  It was a very nice touch, and I DO love how we drift back and forth from present, to randomly different times in Grace's history, with only the main story following a specific timeline.Once again, those slight mentions of how she came to be pregnant with Ruth, and how she ended up pursuing archaeology as her career, and how he came to be part of the next war, thus separating her from her husband (whom she did not love), were sweet little gems that gave the story telling a more down-to-earth feel, rather than the Gothic, almost incredible story of events that took place at Riverton.I will probably continue to read books by Kate Morton, as this was a great introductory to her work.  However, reading this book reminds me why I have a hard time loving or one hundred percent enjoying historical fiction.  This book shows a much more detailed, nitty-gritty accounting of the times, and takes a closer look at how snobbish aristocrats can be, and how divided classes were.  It gave us a different rendering of how one culture unabashedly stereotypes and judges another based solely on their own closed-minded knowledge of the world.  It showed a more historically accurate representation of how women were treated and, in turn, how women responded to this treatment, even during the timeline wherein the ""times were changing.""Basically, I have a hard time NOT getting angry on behalf of how obviously unequal people were treated dependent on class, gender, birth, etc....  And while I had some issues with Hannah, as a person and as a character, I couldn't help but to sympathize with her, and grow indignant on her behalf when everyone pretty much implied that she was good for nothing but being married off.  That her ideas and dreams of being independent and working and seeing the world needed to be quashed by marriage to a good man who would keep her in line.Anyway, this book was a great read, very enjoyable, even if not my typical cup of tea.  The secrets were obvious and predictable from the start, and while I enjoyed the build up to each reveal, I also found I wasn't overly excited about them, and was actually quite relieved when said secrets were no longer secrets, because that meant we could move on to the next secret reveal.One thing is for sure, as I told my BFF when describing the book to her, this book may not be a personal favorite for me, but it sure incited a lot of emotions, and it certainly stays with you for some time after you've finished reading it.***

Bereft. In an odd way, I had lost myself. That is what happens when you give your life and service to another person. You're bound to them. For I knew nothing of life outside service. Was panicked by independence. Wary of going places, doing the simplest things, making my own decisions. *Sigh* Every now and then, I have to deviate from my horror, murder mysteries and dark fantasy and give in to my occasional weakness: the dreaded women's fiction. Usually involving, God help me, forbidden romance. A bonus if dead bodies happen along the way to ease the sting of this personal failing.I got lucky with this one: there are several. I never said the romances I gravitate towards are happy ones. Naively tragic suits my self-image better. That could just be me whining, though. This is the third Kate Morton for me. They're not sequential and so don't need to be read in order, but I wish I had. My first was The Distant Hours. It was, in fact, Morton's third novel and it set the bar so high that I'm not sure I would've enjoyed any of her books as much. Truthfully, while I did enjoy The Forgotten Garden, it didn't blow me away as the other had. So I've delayed picking up another one for a long time, fearing disappointment. But it's spring, and a woman's fancy turns toward ill-fated love affairs with suicidal poets suffering PTSD. Or something like that.So this, finally, is Kate Morton's debut novel. And it is very nearly perfect. But can I just take a moment to bitch about the covers? What was the publisher thinking? The original covers for the first four novels were perfect. Yes, they looked like women's fiction. But they captured that hazy historical, gothic romance feel perfectly. They were actually beautifully classy and are what caused me to investigate them in a bookstore initially. But somewhere along the way, somebody re-released them with horrid covers of girls on the front. eyes peeking out of shrubbery. I would NEVER pick those books up to see what theywe're about.

138,2804385132,05/20/2019,3.0,"This debut novel drew me in with its atmospheric writing, but ultimately I just couldn't get into the story. The story centers largely on Grace, a former Riverton servant now in her 90s. An upcoming film about a notorious suicide that happened at Riverton in the 1920s has Grace going back through her memories of life in that house during the Great War and the years following. Through her eyes, we see her bond with Hannah and Emmeline, the young ladies of the house who were of similar age to Grace at the time.On the one hand, I loved the layered view of life back in the 1910s and 1920s. The author captures it in such a way that I got drawn in the rituals of life both upstairs and down. It's obvious that the Hartford family harbors some secrets and at first I enjoyed trying to puzzle out what was going on beneath the surface at Riverton. However, the characters failed to really draw me in, so partway through the book I started getting bored. By the time, we finally got to the infamous death at Riverton, it honestly felt like a great big ""So what?""And then there's Grace's life. In some ways, she is content and I am happy for her for that. However, at a crucial point in the book, she makes a choice that just made me *headdesk*, for lack of a better way to express it. (view spoiler)[I won't spoil it all but let's just say that Grace gives up her own chance at happiness for someone in the Hartford family who does not value her loyalty nearly enough to warrant such sacrifice. Also, Grace's near obsession with one of the daughters of the house just felt ridiculous rather than touching.

And later on he points Emmeline out in the paper, commenting on her being wild, ""that sister of yours"", but then says nothing more of it, and does not react in any way-??? And when Alfred waits for Grace to take her to the theatre and she is late, he then later says that he took miss Starling instead, just to make Grace jealous- but Alfred could not in any way have known that Grace would find that out, because she only goes to miss Starling because of the short-hand note from Hannah and thus only accidentally finds out that Starling and Alfred went to the theatre.

This is my first novel from this author and I see why many of my fellow goodreads friends have enjoyed her. This is the author's first novel, so it will be interesting to see how her style gets with later novels. The author's writing style was what drew me in. Secrets and mysteries, some of which I guessed before I was told them, but nonetheless not to the point where I was annoyed by the story or felt like it was a waste. You really felt for many characters within the novel---what a terribly tragic family. This had a Downtown Abbey feel to it and a novel I would say that is sort of similar is Longbourn by Jo Baker---but there were far more secrets and mysteries within this story(Lougbourn is still a great read though). I found myself unable to put this book down at times. The main character's voice--a maid and later a lady's maid, truly gave this story a powerful, haunting voice throughout. I was sad to say goodbye to Hannah and Grace when it was over. Oh Hannah was definitely born in the wrong time period. I don't want to give too much away in this review, only to say that I feel that this story befit the grand families during this time period in many different ways and quite beautifully written at that.

141,1636363469,05/12/2016,4.0,"Grace is an elderly woman living out her last years in a British nursing home. Ursula, an American film maker has asked to speak with her about a movie she is making. The film is about the suicide of an up and coming poet which took place at a large country estate called Riverton in 1924. Grace worked at Riverton many years ago, first as a house maid and later as a ladies’ maid. Ursula’s visit and her questions about what happened that fateful night bring Grace back to a series of memories about the Hartford family and the grand estate where they lived. Grace is the narrator of this historical novel and it is through her eyes and ears we hear about this family and the tragedies and secrets that are part of Grace’s deeply hidden memories.In telling her story, Grace goes back to the time when she first began to work at Riverton at the age of fourteen. Her position as a housemaid often made her invisible to the family as she worked silently in the rooms they lived in, so she got to know the family well and often knew many of the details surrounding the various family crises. Lord and Lady Ashbury were the owners of Riverton. Major Jonathan their eldest son, was a military hero and heir to the estate. He and his wife Jemmina had two boys but both died at an early age from hemophilia. Jonathan's younger brother Frederick was a widower and a businessman who had three children, David sixteen, Hannah fourteen and Emmeline who was ten. The children often visited their Uncle Asbury at Riverton and it was during those times that Grace got to know them. Life was brought to an abrupt halt by World War I, which brought many changes in the family as well as British society. Major Jonathan went off to fight in France and never returned. David also joined the war effort despite his father’s wishes, and set out for Europe with his friend Robbie. David had studied with Robbie at Eton and Robbie had visited Riverton one Christmas when he met Hannah and Emmeline. The two boys were out to see the world and wanted to experience an exciting adventure, sure they would be home in a few months. But like his Uncle, David never returned and Robbie simply disappeared. Alfred, the footman at Riverton and Grace’s close friend was the only one who returned, but he was a different man, affected badly by shell shock. And then shortly after the close of the war, Lord Asbury died from a stroke. Following his older brother’s death, Frederick inherited the title of Lord Ashbury as well as the Riverton estate. But Frederick struggled with the role as head of the household. He had never been a good business manager and in the past many of his businesses ventures had failed. When he lost his car factory, money became a huge problem and he had trouble maintaining and funding the estate. Riverton fell into disrepair and Frederick was forced to sell much of the furniture and close off several of the rooms. Hannah married Teddy Luxton, an American from a wealthy family. Her father was against the marriage and demanded she break the engagement, but Hannah refused. She left Riverton under a dark cloud and although she and her father had always been close, they did not speak again. When Hannah left the estate to move to a London townhouse with her husband, she took Grace with her and hired her as a ladies’ maid. Hannah had hoped that marriage might free her from her constraining and boring life in the country, but she was mistaken. After Teddy joined his father in the banking business, he became a man much like him, interested in politics, sensitive to what others thought and careful never to make a public misstep. He was preparing to enter the volatile world of politics and had to be careful what he said and did. It also required him to entertain on a regular basis and fill a proscribed role as a family man with a supportive wife and family. This was not the world that Hannah thought she had married into and after her honeymoon in Europe, which Hannah had enjoyed, she felt stifled and bored entertaining at home or suffering through the countless affairs she was required to attend. Robbie returned to London after wandering the world and travelling to several foreign countries, trying to escape his horrific memories of the war. He was haunted by horrible dreams and hallucinations and at times behaved erratically. Several years after the war’s end, he met up with Hannah to return a small book David had given him. Under the guise of courting her sister Emmeline, he began a relationship with Hannah. Emmeline loved Robbie and was unaware of her sister’s relationship with the man she hoped to marry. Morton does an excellent job of recreating the atmosphere and ambiance that permeated the large English estates in the 1910s and 20s. We get a good sense of the “upstairs downstairs” dynamic between the staff and the families they served. It was a time when those who worked “in service” took pride in the work they did even though their roles were subservient to the wishes of others. And we see how life with is rigid class structures changed with the war, disrupting a way of life that disappeared and never returned. Morton provides all the small details that help us appreciate society and a country on the brink of monumental change and the difficult process of moving through a new and different world.Grace is a compelling narrator of the story and through her voice Morton easily manages the transitions in the narrative back and forth through time. The characters of the two sisters are well drawn with Hannah beautiful, intelligent and strong minded and Emmeline a sharp contrast, flirtatious and wild, whose only concern was having a good time. The two are complete opposites but they are devoted to each other and the ties that bind them are strong.There are several secrets and a mystery to be solved with hints dropped slowly throughout the story. And although the reader may easily guess some parts of it, other may be more of a surprise. At times the narrative is a little too long and took a while to get going, but it is still a comfortable and enjoyable read. ",2,0.9623,0.113,0.753,0.135,0.4573751760644963,POSITIVE,0.9996
142,4389537136,12/14/2021,4.0,"This is the first novel written by Kate Morton, and with it, I have now read all she has written to date. It is a remarkable first novel, with all the trademarks I’ve come to love about Morton’s writing — interesting characters, a sense of time and place that is remarkably tangible, and a feeling of sadness and foreboding that lingers with you a while after you put the book down for the last time.That said, this, I must admit, is my least favorite Morton novel so far. I actually got a bit bored (gasp!) in the middle of this. It just went on too long and was too sad. I think maybe I just wasn't in the mood. I should have read something lighter instead of following one Morton with a second. Still, I enjoyed unraveling the mystery of why things happened the way they did — or I should say, what *really* happened in the long-ago memories of an old lady as she looks back on a traumatic event from the past. Sometimes things are not as they seem. Morton is the master at this type of reflection.I think if you’re a Morton fan you should definitely read this, but if you’re not already don’t start here.

At times there were too many character names, and I truly got confused and mixed up with the Lords and Ladies. A lack of character development left this book just flat, with the story plodding along ever so slowly.

Too cute for my taste, and I soon set out to reading it solely for the time period chucking all anticipations of mystery out the window.What I enjoyed the most were Morton's dialogues. They seemed to have a certain flow to them and they gave alot of information on the characters and events. That's it though, really. Morton muddles the story in over-descriptive writing and I ended up skipping alot of it. Also, I really had to make myself forget that there is supposed to be a mystery deep down there somewhere because mystery, she does not write.

I also enjoyed the echoes of Daphne Du Maurier's Rebecca that threaded through the story. The ending was definitely a plot twist but I found it rather a stretch... after sharing all her secrets with Grace why would Hannah keep back the most important moment of her life?

For this book, we are at Riverton Maor in country England just prior to WWI breaking out through to around 1924 ; and then we move forward to 1999 where a prior maid of this manor is living her final days at the very respectable age of 98.As I read this I couldn't help but think of the popularity of Downton Abbey and how well this book would do as a TV series. Mainly because I think this book gives a more realistic portrayal of ""upstairs / downstairs"" where the servants are to be invisible while their ""betters"" move through society.The mystery was not difficult to guess as the book went along, but it should also be remembered this is Historical Fiction rather than Mystery so if you are happy to meander through the years while the story slowly unravels you should really enjoy this.Also, I would like to give a shout out to Caroline Lee who narrates so many of Kate Morton (and Liane Moriarty's) books and does a fantastic job.

160,213983989,09/23/2011,3.0,"Kate Morton specializes in memories... in secrets... in showing us the lives of people in days-gone-by. In The House at Riverton, she tells the story and the secrets of an English manor and the Hartford family in the early 1900s and until after WWI.At 98, Grace is living in a nursing home. But when she discovers a movie is being made about the house at Riverton -- a movie about that fateful night when a famous British poet shot himself at a house party... the poet supposedly engaged to one sister and the lover of the other sister... memories begin to surface. Secrets that she's kept for so long can no longer be forced down; they must be told. But to whom? And so the tale weaves back and forth, between Grace's life in service at the house at Riverton to the Hartford family then (early 1900s to just after WWI) to the present, where she's living in a nursing home. She started her life in service to the family at 14 and quickly became fascinated with the family and especially the children of the 2nd son: David, Hannah, and Emmaline.Grace grew up with secrets in her house -- who her father is and why her mother never speaks of him. She finds herself part of the household family and quite content. Until WWI comes along, and changes everything. David enlists against his father's wishes and rushes off to France with his school chum, Robby Hunt. The Hartford family loses the eldest son, a decorated Boar war hero, to the war, and shortly after, the patriarch dies of a broken heart. The 2nd son, Frederick, is now the heir without an heir. And Frederick's heart never quite seems to be in anything as he dabbles in everything. When the family is in danger of losing everything, Frederick turns to ""new money"" bankers, only to discover that the bankers wish him to sell. Hannah, caught between wanting to be independent and wanting to help her family, convinces herself that she can gain what she wants by marrying Teddy, the banker's son. And for a time, she's content, and Grace is content as her lady's maid. Except that Robby Hunt comes back into their lives, and it seems tragedy won't let the Hartford family alone.I enjoyed this book, but not quite as much as I did The Forgotten Garden. While friends who read this book first, said they prefer it to other Morton tales. So perhaps it's the 1st Morton book that you read that stays with you?Grace is a wonderful character -- so naive, so trusting, and so much a part of her time. I love her contrasting herself as a young girl in service and Sylvia, one of the nurses' aides in her nursing home. It does seem almost shocking to realize what it was like to be ""in service"" in the day... perhaps that's why we're so fascinated with watching and reading the dramas of the Upstairs/Downstairs crowd -- it's so much unlike our own.I did feel as if the narrative wandered a bit and included more than was necessary. It might shock Grace to figure out who her father is, but the reader has known for some time. Some of the details about banking and Frederick's business... the family... seemed not to matter very much. They felt like delaying tactics to prevent us from rushing into the heart of the story.And some pieces never did quite make sense, like Marcus, Grace's grandson. It makes sense why Grace wants to tell Marcus her story, but what is Marcus' story? What takes Grace so long to figure out who Ursula is? Does Ursula ever really know the truth - does Marcus ever share it? He says he's writing a book, but... And WHY does Hannah write THE MOST IMPORTANT NOTE to Grace in shorthand, when she knows that Grace doesn't know shorthand? Is she assuming that Grace won't open Emmaline's letter? That it will take Grace time to find someone to read shorthand? Is that what she's counting on?Lovely, bittersweet tale of love, longing, and loss.",2,0.9967,0.05,0.817,0.133,0.4070856290174471,POSITIVE,0.9082
161,1069156714,10/01/2014,5.0,"I'm so glad I took the time to reread this one...this is one book by Morton that I had read before I joined Goodreads and before I started writing reviews. I remembered only the vaguest notion of the plot. The narrator was a young lady's maid for a wealthier young woman, becoming her confidante of sorts...and that it was tragic. That's basically it, and yet, Morton has constructed so much more here. This was right on par with her other exquisite book, The Distant Hours, both of which I have given five stars.The utter tragedy of the ending, with an abruptness so final, is brilliant—allowing the weeping moments for the reader to occur as the book's back cover closes. The careful sequencing and timing in which Morton delivers the tale of Hannah, Emmeline, and Grace (the two sisters and the lady's maid, respectively), is really cinematic and masterful. The key pieces of Morton's stories that become a little heavier in her later books—the secrets discovered, the familial connections revealed, the beginnings of a few characters continuing towards happiness—are delivered quietly and gently in The House at Riverton.In true Morton style, her characters, and the house that becomes a character, are what holds the threads of the book together. She writes such brilliant life into each of them—vivid and fully-formed, there is no effort in knowing they have a life in moments not featured on the page. And what adds to an intricately woven story here is the tie to the present time is also the tie to the past—Grace. It's funny to see the recommendation of ""for fans of Downton Abbey,"" not because it's untrue—it's very much like the atmosphere in the Downton Abbeyseries—but because this came first. It's a more focused and haunting story—no shiny ending wrapped in a pretty bow here. It also reminded me of Fall of Giants, published in 2010. But it also has whispers of books that did come before it. Atonement. Howards End. A Room with a View. The Remains of the Day. It's all of them and it's none of them exactly. But that makes it familiar and knowable. Ghosts of other stories, other lives, hiding in the spaces between—that goes a long way to give it some grounding in the weight of the past.

163,112998942,07/22/2010,4.0,"The House at Riverton is the story of 98 year old Grace Bradley and is told through a series of flashbacks. It is a story of the classes, the loyal servant class and the idle rich, and the changes to the English class system from Edwardian times through two world wars and into the present.In 1914, Grace Bradley came to Riverton Manor as a 14 year old housemaid. Hers was the life of dutiful and selfless service to the Hartford family. There was a fierce loyalty to the family shared by the servants at Riverton creating a ""downstairs"" camaraderie. In fact, a real ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" feeling permeates the book. During her early years of service, Grace's life becomes forever linked with those of the Hartford grandchildren Hannah, Emmeline, and David.One of the key events and that which really drives the story and binds the past to the present, is a tragedy that occurred during a lavish house party at Riverton in 1924. This tragedy forever changed the lives of those involved and continues to haunt Grace. Grace has remained loyal to the Hartford family and has never divulged the true events of that long ago night. Grace knows she will not live much longer and, as she is the only living person who knows what really happened, decides to narrate her story onto tape recordings that she sends to her grandson.The House at Riverton is Kate Morton's debut novel and, as such, has a lot to recommend it. Her writing captured the Edwardian class system and the difficulties experienced by the characters as this system faded away and they struggled to find their new ""place"" in society. I truly enjoyed the way the past haunted the present. The author did seem to lose some steam though about two thirds of the way through the book and character development suffered. One thing in particular disappointed me. Several characters returned from military service, in the Great War, with shell shock. This condition was pivotal to the events and ending of the book, yet it was merely mentioned and the characters with shell shock unsympathetic and two dimensional. A bit remiss of the author to gloss over something so pivotal.I have Morton's next novel, The Forgotten Garden, on my stack of books to read and I am looking forward to it.

164,127828600,10/25/2010,4.0,"Australian author Kate Morton popped onto the literary scene in 2007 with her debut novel The House at Riverton. Having since published two additional internationally acclaimed novels, Morton is now gaining a foothold in the genre of mystery gothic fiction as her stories climb the bestseller lists of the US and UK. What is mystery gothic fiction, you ask? In essence, it is the haunting of the present by the past, which is further accompanied by the ideas of haunting (physical and psychological), the mystery of the unseen, deja-vu, and other reincarnations of history that occur in modern times.At a summer-house party in the mid 1920′s, Grace Bradley, servant to the family at Riverton House, witnesses a suicide that will forever change her life. The true story behind the event is known only to Grace, and as Grace reflects on her 98 years of life, she can’t help but to think back on the memories of her past. Thinking back on what she’s witnessed, she realizes that she must pour out her secrets so that she can finally rest and pass away in peace. A woman named Ursula is making a film about the events of the fateful night, and contacts Grace to consult on the film. Initially hesitant, Grace eventually agrees and talks to Ursula about Riverton, causing her memories to flood back into sharp focus, and making Grace all the more anxious to tell her story before she leaves this earth.I need to start off by saying that the book does take a while to take off. The idea behind the story is awesome, weaving the past and present together until, to Grace, it is indistinguishable. Once Morton finds the correct pace in switching between the past and present the novel soars. The last two hundred pages really shine. The way Grace’s “secrets” are revealed is done in a truly perfect fashion. The true events are written very gothic and dark, making the reader hungry to know what really happened! Although Grace obviously regresses throughout the book, her memory of the past is picture perfect, giving the reader an awesome account of the opulence of the roaring twenties. There are many characters in the novel that each have their own strong qualities that make them stand apart from the others. In other works, only the main characters do this, yet Morton strays from the beaten path and gives us strong supporting characters as well. Although the first 100 pages seem slow and uneventful, the multitude of supporting characters fleshes out the plot and the storyline quickens soon after, making the novel irresistable. Elegant, opulent, and beautifully written, this novel will keep you guessing as to what really happened up until the very end.

165,2241874555,01/12/2018,5.0,"In “The House at Riverton” we see Grace from two perspectives, one as a 98 year old in a nursing home in 1999 and in the other she is a 14 year old who has just joined the staff as a housemaid at Riverton House during the period of Pre-World War I England. As the story unfolds, we find out that Grace (and a few of the other characters) live a life where secrets are kept. One of the strengths of this novel is how we are able to approach her secret from two distinct vantage points, moving forward toward it as we read of her past, and moving backward as we read the scenes from her life in the present. Kate Morton does a masterful job of holding Grace’s secret at bay in both timelines, revealing it at the time of her choosing. This only enhances the overall appeal of the story. Over and above the fantastic job Morton does with weaving timelines is her ability to deliver one suburb scene after another. One scene I really enjoyed was when 98 year old Grace is sitting in a room with the young actress who is cast to play her when she was a teenager. “The girl, Kiera steps from the shadow. She is seventeen if a day, and I am struck by her symmetrical prettiness. Blond hair to her shoulder blades pulled back in a ponytail. A round face, full lips coated in thick, shiny lip gloss, and blue eyes beneath a blank brow. A face made to sell chocolates.” This scene had me imagining what it would be like to be meeting a person whose current job is to be a past version of myself. To add to the intrigue was the fact that it was not fame that placed Grace as a character in the film, but rather her proximity to significant historical events. Morton then enhances the scene when the director has to leave and it is just Grace and Kiera in the room. Things become a bit awkward as the two are sizing each other up, “I sneak another glance at Kiera, study her face, and try to recognize my young self in her pretty features.” This got me thinking that I would do exactly the same thing if I were face to face with an actor who was to portray me in a film, I’d be looking at him, trying to determine why someone decided that this person sufficiently resembled me, or perhaps had similar mannerisms. This scene once again showcased Kate Morton’s incredible ability to fluidly move from one time to another, from one perspective to another, from a feeling or emotion from long ago to one in the present. I enjoyed every bit of “The House at Riverton” the story will stay with me for a long time yet. ",2,0.9786,0.019,0.899,0.083,0.4122093023255813,POSITIVE,1.0
166,123552997,09/26/2010,4.0,"Needing a break from Real Life this month, I once again dove into a Kate Morton story. Almost exactly one year ago Kate Morton got me through 6 weeks of bronchitis and pleurisy and basic exhaustion. Winter 2013 features cancer in the family, a stressful workload for my spouse, as well as all the usual worries about finances and schedules and getting everyone where they need to be at the right time while simultaneously getting my work done at the office and at home. The 21st Century has lost a bit of its questionable lustre lately and I have basically fled into Kate Morton World.You know...stately manor homes with dread secrets...whispers from the past...a survivor or two from a distant era who may uncover the truth at the eleventh hour. And lovely pictures of glamorous people from storied eras...The House at Riverton especially appealed to me because it placed me in my fantasy setting: The Jazz Age. Being Kate Morton, it automatically placed me in my fantasy geographic location: Britain. Beyond that, all I need is a reasonably good story in the hands of a reasonably talented writer. Kate Morton fills the bill superbly.In short, the troubled Hartford family is introduced through the narrative memories of 98 year old Grace Bradley. She was in service to them at their estate, Riverton, during the heady days of World War I and the glittering 1920s. Young Grace comes from her own small family of secrets and has a special connection to the Hartford estate through her mother, who also had worked at the manor as a domestic during her own youth.Her duties put her in the path of the three Hartford children, David, Hannah and Emmeline. Grace's life is vastly different from that of the privileged Hartford children, but fate has put her on a parallel course with theirs. Grace grows especially connected with the eldest daughter, Hannah, and, for a decade or so, their paths are entwined, Upstairs/Downstairs style. Tragic events involving the casualties of war and of love ensue. Grace is haunted throughout her life by the cameo role she played in the drama at Riverton and...eventually...the dark truth is revealed.This is a great choice for anglophile readers who enjoy Country House dramas and gothic tragedy as well as family sagas.

168,331565099,05/17/2012,2.0,"I’m rating this book low not because it’s not good, but because it’s not the kind of book I enjoy. It’s actually quite well done for a first novel, but I definitely like Morton's later books better. I enjoyed the Downton Abbey-esque atmosphere of the servant’s point of view before it all starts going to hell (which is worth giving it an extra star I suppose). What I didn’t like about it is the pervasive sense of impending doom. You know that disaster is its way, just not exactly how it comes about, and it takes its time getting there (I was impatient with the pacing at times). You see the lives of all the characters disintegrating, you know nothing can be changed and want to make different decisions for them, and finally you find that no one gets a happy ending, not even Grace, the maid who is now telling the story in her old age. It’s a story of hopelessness and being trapped in roles dictated by society that end up ruining everyone’s lives. Not my cuppa tea.I was especially frustrated with Grace in the past. She is completely unable to go outside of the mindset that she’s not to get personal with her employers, even when she’s explicitly invited to do so. She longs to be seen as a friend by her mistress, but doesn’t return any of Hannah's confidences. In fact, (view spoiler)[she hides silly things like the fact that she isn’t learning to read shorthand - was merely smuggling a fiction book into the house, a much lesser crime. She allows Hannah to think she is her friend and confidant while holding back from her. This ends up having a huge impact on the outcome, and  (hide spoiler)] I just want to go back and tell her not to be so stupid.It was just too bleak for me, and I hated how it ended even though I knew some kind of terrible doom was coming. I did not relish the feeling I had at the end when I learned the twist, and felt like I needed to wash the bitter taste out of my mouth. I haven’t felt like that about a book since reading Thomas Hardy’s Tess of the d’Urbervilles, the quintessential tragic train wreck of a story. The difference here is, there were so many small tragedies all the way through that added up to one big tragedy, while Tess was only tragic towards the end.But because it wasn’t for me doesn’t mean others won’t enjoy it.

169,1592854096,03/28/2016,3.0,"If you like interwar country-house romantic dramas, you might enjoy this. In her Author's Note Morton is quite open about her influences, which range from Evelyn Waugh and Nancy Mitford to the gloomier contemporary visions of The Remains of the Day and Gosford Park – and indeed Downton Abbey, which this book predates but anticipates in many ways.It ticks so many boxes: aristocratic country houses run by exacting butlers and housekeepers; forbidden love affairs; smart women who yearn for something more; beautiful young men killed in WWI; sensitive, traumatised poets; loveless marriages between impoverished aristocrats and vulgar capitalists; the silly Bright Young Things… It's firmly in the 'fiction' rather than 'literature' camp, though. While it has some elegant language, the plot is very sentimental, with a few too many coincidences tying characters together and a melodramatic insistence on secrets, scandals and turns of fate. (Morton was also influenced by what she calls the 'gothic' but which is closer to the sensation novel.) Most of the narrative momentum is in the central mystery about what really happened at the lake that night in 1924, which means that other storylines are weirdly relegated to the background, or tied up in a very perfunctory fashion so we can get to the tragic revelation.Also, it's narrated in a very convenient way. Grace, the only person alive who knows the whole story, just happens to be present for certain key events, or Morton gets around her absence by saying that Grace only realised the significance of something years later, or was later told everything by characters who were present. Yet every scene is related with atmospheric immediacy, with levels of detailed perception and even emotions that are not flagged as belonging to someone else, eg ""She told me that…"" It's as if Grace possesses the uncanny ability to inhabit someone else's body – which would be an interesting device if it were consciously deployed.Despite all this, I was engrossed in the book and enjoyed its pastiche because I generally enjoy these kinds of settings and stories. It's a very thick novel and would be a great-value holiday read. Like a 1920s fancy dress party, it's a bit trashy, and not very intellectually or aesthetically challenging, but it's fun.",2,0.9957,0.068,0.727,0.206,0.5020412440123978,POSITIVE,0.92
170,108368749,06/23/2010,1.0," ""The House at Riverton"" was a disappointing read after all the 5-star reviews here on Goodreads and its commercial success as a ""No #1 bestseller"" in England. In the afterward Kate Morton states that she always wanted to write a Gothic-type romantic novel, inspired by Du Maurier and others, which would incorporate some of the great themes of the 20th Century including the effect of the Great War on the social and economic structure of aristocratic England. I think that is the problem. Perhaps Morton was so distracted by that goal that she lost sight of things that engage a reader like character development and an intriguing plot. ""The House at Riverton"" although grammatically well-written, has a ridiculously predictable plot, stereotypical and poorly thought through characters, and a dialogue so stale it reminds me of the Harlequin Romances I read as a young girl. Grace, our narrator, at age 98 is approached by a young film maker who is planning a movie about the suicide death of a young poet at Riverton following the Great War. (technique used in the film ""Titanic"") Thus Grace, the only child of a single mother who had once worked at Riverton as a maid, begins her story. Each chapter switches from Grace's current life in a nursing home, to her old life at Riverton where she too, became a servant to the titled family. Great Britain was just entering the War in 1914 and the effect of those years on the British was staggering.  As a servant Grace observed the daily lives of the family she worked for and learned their secrets and dreams. There is drama, jealousy, greed and pettiness on every page as Grace struggles to reconcile her own dreams with the loyalty she feels for those she has become devoted to. Sadly the novel lacks heart. Morton describes the emotions but fails to convey them. There is no humor, no warmth in the interaction between many of ""The House at Riverton's"" most important characters. Morton admits to the influence of other writers of that era, in fact there is a reference to ""Clarissa's party"" (Mrs. Dalloway) but just doesn't pull this all together in a meaningful way. It is Morton's first novel however, and hopefully her next one will improve. ",2,0.9755,0.095,0.743,0.162,0.4469246031746032,NEGATIVE,0.9998

Why, you might ask. Let me explain: The story was long, but I really like a long book. (Long stories take longer to read, since I hate a good book to be over too soon.) Many reviewers on here said they did not care for the characters: I totally got attached to them. It was a good read for me because the end totally tore me up. I knew something horrible was coming, but I never knew it would be that way she did it.

Something on the road holds your interest more at the moment.Eventually, the things you pass by seem familiar, and you recognize that these are all signs that point out you're getting closer and closer to the end of your journey, and this fills you with so much anticipation because finally, you're so close..but at the same time you dread the end because the trip wasn't as arduous as it had seemed at first, and now you're reluctant to let go of the things that held your interest on your way here.When you finally get to your destination, your favorite place in the world, you're elated because the trip was so worth it, no matter how long it took and what you had to go through to get here. Yet, at the same time, you glance wistfully down the road you just traveled on, because while there were times when it was tiring and things seemed to move quite slowly, the journey was just as great as getting to the end of it.This review can also be found on my blog, Lambent Lights.",2,0.9588,0.059,0.826,0.115,0.4878352490421456,NEGATIVE,0.9917

No. Look, here's the thing: In order to pull off a book of this, um, I don't even know. Plotless meandering/allegedly epic family story? You have to create characters that are compelling and and interesting and sympathetic. She didn't do that here. So what you have is four hundred -- yes, FOUR HUNDRED -- pages of absolutely nothing happening except exposition and character backstory (FOUR HUNDRED PAGES) on characters that are really not very interesting. The narrator HINTED at being an interesting person, but Morton never bothers to give us enough detail to care. I mean, it's the NARRATOR and Kate just sort of acts like her voice is enough, when it isn't. And the narrator had INTERESTING THINGS happen to her, but Kate doesn't even give us the courtesy of detailing them. She just throws them in there in ONE SENTENCE DETAIL DROPS, I do not even lie. Then takes 400-some-odd pages to talk about other people who are just not interesting at all. And then the end is just tragic and stupid and you don't need a spoiler alert for that, because it's OBVIOUS the entire time. I am so pissed. The book jacket makes it seem like this is a brilliant gothic mystery and love story. Do you guys want to know when the FIRST HINT of the advertised mystery-slash-love story makes its appearance? Page 387. I am not even kidding you. The book only has a little less than 450 pages. So you know, the PLOT starts to ACTUALLY ARRIVE at page 387. Until then, you have little of interest. I am really disappointed in this one, as Kate Morton's The Forgotten Garden is one of my favorite books of all time. I read it two years ago, and I still think about it.

I think we read five or six different novels that semester including Atonement, Possession, Waterland, and Blackwater Lightship. There was something about every single one of those books that made me think or changed the way I looked at the book. I fell in love with contemporary literature and haven't gotten into a lot of it since I graduated.Until I read Kate Morton's book. The book reminded me of those contemporary lit books I read three years ago and made me remember why I love reading so much.The House at Riverton is narrated by the elderly Grace, who in her younger years was a maid at Riverton. She's been approached by a woman in her mid 20s who is making a film about the suicide that took place at Riverton so many years ago. Grace is taken back to a time long ago when she was a confidant for the young ladies in the house, Hannah and Emmeline, and when she witnesses something she'll never forget. Morton takes you into the lives of this family living in the time of World War I and dealing with the pains of war, loss, coerced marriages, and real love. She pieces things together slowly as you finally find out what happened on the night of Robbie's (a rich young poet) suicide. She keeps you guessing until the very end and even then I was surprised by the ending.This is one I recommend for anyone. There's really nothing in it that I didn't like, and there was a lot that I loved. I loved how Morton developed Hannah's character through Grace's eyes and how Morton just kept stringing me along. I like to be led somewhere in the dark rather than being able to see exactly where I'm going. And Morton definitely kept me in the dark.

Why did he do it? Was it over the sparkly celebutante Emmeline or over the beautiful but married elder sister?Only one person alive knows the truth. Now an elderly lady, Grace was just a girl when she started working at the Riverton House. She was the same age as Hannah and grew up fascinated by the glamorous Riverton children. Grace finally reveals the truth behind a horrible incident that happened at the Riverton House.It is a beautiful story. The way the story unfolds and flashes back and forth in time. I really felt swept back in time to when young men were going off to fight in the Great War and the loss everyone felt afterwards when a whole generation of young men were gone. And the roaring twenties that Emmeline thrived in. And Hannah. I liked Hannah. She reminded me of my sister, so strong-willed and beautiful.At times I felt like Grace was just a tad bit obsessed with the Riverton House. But then again I think that was the point.

But as is the norm in any aristocratic family of the time it is also home to many others - to the staff who ensure the seamless running of the household. Grace joins the household staff following in the footsteps of her mother who had worked there until as a single woman she became pregnant. Grace feels a fascination toward the two granddaughters Hannah and Emmeline which transforms into a sense of connection and loyalty. As a reader I suspected part of the root of that connection long before Grace herself did. But then the world, expectations and opportunities she was born to were so different to mine. But as the nineteenth century gave way to the twentieth century the aristocratic world began to crumble. As the book begins Grace is now an old lady in a nursing home. Approached by a film writer she is jolted into a remembrance of the past and all the secrets she has kept faithfully all these years for people long since gone. As she drifts in her own mind between the present and the past the story of the House at Riverton and the Hartford family is revealed to us. The book allows the reader to get to know every character, but through the eyes and understanding of Grace. I really enjoyed this book. Full of intrigue and drama and yet the style feels totally in keeping with the era it belongs to. As I was reading I couldn't help wondering if the creators of Downton Abbey had read it as there were definite similarities - though Downton is far from being a dramatisation of this book.

Then it occurred to me that the childhood pastimes were extrapolated from the Brontes, the story in the beginning much like PBS's series ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" and the ending very predictable. The form of presentation was very much like that of Titanic. If there had been a fresher approach, I would have liked it more, but I did like the main character, Grace Bradley, very much and looked forward to seeing how she handled her situation and her trials.

At the same time, large estates were being lost and the tempo of life radically changing along with that of the role of women and ""servants"" and ""masters.""

Add a ghost, an unmarried gruff master who falls in love with the governess and this would be just another hackneyed English novel. No, there is neither a ghost nor a gruff master, and only an insignificant governess.It is to Kate Morton's credit that she plowed through such overworked plots and came up with an interesting, in places unusual, story.Unfortunately, Ms. Morton did fall into one cliche: the crass, rich Americans who marry into titles. That cost her 1 star.Some of her writing is brilliant, especially her descriptions of sunsets and lovely ladies in Parisian slips. She tackles the issue of how war ruins the lives of soldiers: shell shock as it was called then. Her re-creation of World War 1 is engrossing. However, the novel does bog down after a couple of hundred pages, only to pick up at the end. Grace's revelation about the reason for Robby's suicide is a real surprise. However, her not guessing why she's never seen her father is unbelievable. Raised in a village near the manor and nobody even hinted the truth about why her mother is alone? And she never guessed?

I was impressed by how well she brought the teens and twenties alive in Briton and how compassionately, but unapologetically she writes about Grace--the elderly woman who narrates the novel. As a teenager, Grace went into service at the big house at Riverton and kept the secrets of her employers until her death. Her narrative well illustrates the complexity of the servant/employer relationship, the changing culture of servant use after World War I, and the way we treat the elderly. It is a lovely novel told in Morton's best warily beautiful narrative.I will admit to at first being disappointed--not by the plot or the prose-- but by the fact that so many of the plot elements seem to have been borrowed by Downton Abby and stirred up a little for different results. I don't know if it is because these are the conventions of novels set in this time period (the wait to see if an heir I will be born, the impatience of daughters to make something more of themselves then the life offered, the stuffy butler) or if this was just what the time was like. I somehow still believe that Dowton's producer has read this novel.

Like Downton, this book is set during that traumatic time in European History around the First World War. Morton also includes a number of great reading recommendations, including Ishiguro, in her acknowledgments. The story is narrated by Grace, now a woman in her 90s, remembering when she was ""in service"" with an aristocratic family. Her memories introduce us to a cast of characters of all classes, while slowly revealing how the tragedy, the apparent suicide of a famous poet during a summer party, came to occur. This is not a murder mystery, but our heroine loves her mystery novels (graduating from Conan Doyle to Christie during her narrative), but like any good story, there are clues along the way for those who want to predict what will happen.

There is a Dickensian conceit in that they are all supposedly equal in birth but I found the self-important tone of impending tragedy rather tiresome after a while. The author pays tribute to movies like Gosford Park, Remains of the Day and the show Upstairs/Downstairs. But where these films showed the richness, gossipiness and subversive humor of downstairs life, her novel depicts servants' lives as voyeuristic shadows of their employers' lives. I think this book wanted to re-do Atonement, the movie version. I found the original pretentious and boring and this book is, if possible, worse.

Set in the time immediately before the Great War and careening all the way through to the present day, Kate Morton has written an incredible chronicle of the life of a fictitious manor house family, told from the perspective of ladies maid Grace. There are amazing twists and secrets and shames and scandals surrounding the Hartford family, despite the best efforts of its matriarchs to keep things under wraps. It's an epic romance of Romeo and Juliet proportions, with the concurrent storylines of Hannah Hartford and Grace Reeves being explored in depth. Everything I wanted out of the story, I got. The romance I wanted to happen, happened, albeit delayed by decades, the secrets came to the surface and it wasn't a bit predictable.

I didn't love that the person telling the story was actually a bystander for the first part of the story, and had to glean details by lurking in the corners dusting books (she was a maid in the house at Riverton.) It was implausible that someone overhearing and spying would catch so many nuances and details that were described. And then a big chunk of the story was second hand, but the details were crisp and too clear for someone who hadn't been there. I love the classic Kate Morton time hop generational format I've followed in her other books. This was less credible to me. Plus I didn't care for the main character's personality much. Morton remains high on a pedestal for me, though. It will take more than throwing one ok book at her to knock her off. ",2,-0.3603,0.087,0.83,0.084,0.41575,NEGATIVE,1.0

I see here on goodreads that this is her debut novel and I'm not surprised.I immediately felt like I was in the midst of ""Downton Abbey"" and I was impressed that this was written first and not just to soar on the fame of D.A. I could feel the tension between the upstairs aristocrats and the downstairs help. It was even the same time period of World War One and into the start of the roaring twenties. I could easily see the Crawley family as neighbors that would socialize in the same circles. Also of note the matriarch is also named Violet and one of the central servants was Alfred! Anyways, back to the book...I was sucked in quickly, but felt the last third of the book lacking. When the point of view switched to Hannah it didn't seem to follow the continuity that this was Grace's story. Maybe Hannah shared some of the details with Grace, but I doubt she shared all the juicy parts. I also didn't like the author's treatment of 2 extramarital affairs as if they were totally okay because they were in love and their spouse wasn't a perfect fit. I did feel like the ending amped up and I wasn't sure how the suicide was going to play out. I liked how Grace was always fond of mysteries, hiding Sherlock Holmes, meeting Agatha Christie, her grandson wrote mysteries and here she has found herself in the middle of one. I liked the short nod at the end to Grace finding some happiness in a past relationship, that made me smile.I was onto the mystery of Grace's father very early on, it seemed too obvious. I wish there had been some other potential options to make that more interesting. Grace seemed so surprised when she figured it out, but it seemed so clear. I remember this same annoyance in ""The Forgotten Garden"".I didn't love any of the characters. Grace did seem to have more depth. The downstairs characters were overall more likable (although not really Nancy or Katie or the London staff, so maybe not?). I wondered if the author intentionally made the wealthy characters seem more distant and one dimensional. Mr. Frederick especially seemed like a jerk and everyone talked about him with such fondness, I wished he was more well rounded. Although, Grace's mom and aunt were poor and they were kind of jerks too. So overall a good book with an interesting time period.

Last November, I had a nightmare.
In 1914, teenaged Grace begins work as a maid at the Riverton House. Over the years, she befriends the two young ladies of the house, Hannah and Emmeline. On a summer night in 1924, a party guest at Riverton winds up dead. The only witnesses to the incident were Hannah, Emmeline, and Grace. They are only ones who know the truth of that night. Seventy-five years later, a filmmaker visits Grace to learn the truth of what happened all those years ago, something Grace isn't ready to reveal. I picked this book up on a whim from a library book sale. I had previously read The Forgotten Garden and enjoyed it, so I figured I would give this one a try. I highly enjoyed this story. I'm not always a fan of books that try to mix a more modern setting with a historical one, but this one did it well. I think because we were in Grace's head most of the time and not following a completely different person in the modern setting. I feel like the story also switched between time periods just enough; there weren't any times that I felt like things were going too quickly or that I got bored. There was a bit more foreshadowing than I like, and I feel like most of the big reveals I could see coming from a mile away, but overall I found it to be a good story that kept me glued to the page. I would recommend this to those who enjoy historical mysteries, especially those with a Gothic flavor. Also, those who enjoy historical fiction about the time period. If you are a fan of Downton Abbey, you may want to give this a try as there are many similarities between the houses.

I’m so glad I read the book Rebecca so recently because I loved the parallels: the focus on two women connected in the same house, in this case a lady and her maid, and the themes of secrets, deception, and untold truths. Like Rebecca, this novel also took some getting into, and when I finished and reread the beginning, all of the revelations made sense. Grace was the perfect storyteller with a name that suited her perfectly. I loved her young and old. I found the added themes of duty and obligation - particularly in association with Grace, a servant, and Hannah, the lady - fascinating. The time period was fitting, and like all of Kate Morton’s novels, I loved the perspectives of past and present, the variety of characters, especially the other servants at Riverton, and the lovely prose. I do wish I had learned more about Grace after her time at Riverton. It seemed she had led such a fascinating life. While I can definitely guess at how things turned out the way they did, I wanted some of the holes filled in. Things are not ever what they seem in a novel by Kate Morton, but the mysteries of this novel weren’t quite as shocking as others. Not her best, but a fabulous debut.

I truly enjoyed this as I continue to miss Downton Abbey and will gladly read any novel reminiscent of a grand old house of the Edwardian Age and rich people's problems. The plot was very much in the vein of Atonement as it involves a mystery at its core. I found the contrast between the family created by the servants in contrast to the dysfunctional Hartford family upstairs to be one of the most interesting elements in the novel. I loved Grace's story and her characterization, especially as Morton has her leave Riverton to experience London and the possibilities outside life of service. I found the Hartfords children to be catalysts for Grace's life, even as she wants desperately to be part of their worlds. (view spoiler)[ I wish that the revelation that she was Frederick's child was revealed while they were all still alive. I wonder what kind of relationship they would have had. Perhaps she could have saved them from their demise. (hide spoiler)]. I also liked that Morton shifts between the Hartford children's lives, too, showing that wealth cannot save a person from failed marriages, scandals, or war. World War I's impact on society is another theme and event that I wish would be written about more in historical fiction, as it shows the major repercussions the war and its aftermath left upon families, society, and the aristocracy like the Hartford family. The novel also speaks the social changes brought by the Great War such as photography, film, cars, women's rights, and social mobility. I'm left wondering if Hannah, David, Emmaline, and Grace would have maintained a relationship into their old age. Lastly, I loved that Grace was able to tell her story via recording in contrast to Ursula's film, which focuses on the murder mystery at the center of the novel. Morton gives an extensive reading list as well as texts she consulted as part of her historical research, a rabbit hole I am looking forward to pursuing in the next few months teamed with more of her works.

240,1905245307,02/06/2017,3.0,"This is the author's debut novel, and in comparison to her more recent offerings, you can tell; it's decidedly less polished and complex than its later siblings, though it remains an engaging story. The setting is excellent and the characters are mostly well-drawn, though sometimes lacking in depth. The mystery is compelling, but it lacks the many twisting layers of The Forgotten Garden or The Distant Hours; there aren't many twists, and the existing ones tend toward the facile or are so heavily foreshadowed that the reveals, when they happen, feel anticlimactic.Certain mechanical aspects of the writing are also problematic here, particularly the issue of perspective. The meat of the story is ostensibly framed as Grace recording her own personal memories for her grandson, but there are large chunks of important action that it wouldn't make sense for her character to have witnessed; this is awkwardly shoehorned in by including a section from Hannah's point of view, ostensibly told by Grace as Hannah told it to her, but in such vivid detail that it's hard to believe this is supposed to be a nonagenarian's memory of someone else's story shared with her over six decades before. In more recent books, the author makes skillful use of multiple POV characters, which is a distinct improvement over this style.I was also disappointed that Grace's own personal life didn't have more of a connection with the Hartfords' story or get more attention in its own right. You could remove her entire relationship with Albert and most of her interactions with her mother and not lose much of anything from the main story, and her own life after leaving service is merely summarized and utterly dismissed. For setting her up as such a fascinating character, her own story gets little to no attention, and the fact that at the end of her life, she seems to define her entire existence in relation to these people who occupied no more than 10% of her very long and successful life seems more than a little depressing.Overall, it was by no means a bad book, and for those new to this author or completionist fans like myself, it's worth reading. However, if you've read and enjoyed her later books, just be warned that this one doesn't quite measure up.",0,0.9564,0.069,0.82,0.11,0.535366032776747,NEGATIVE,0.9954

278,2099811184,01/15/2019,4.0,"Not surprising - I love another Kate Morton book! She really knows how to weave a story and keep you intrigued. I was bothered by how she portrayed Americans. Namely how annoying and disrespectful she wrote the American tourist family. As an American living in Europe, I can state with confidence that we are not all the way she has depicted them. However, this is a very small part and therefore a small gripe. It is definitely a must read for fiction lovers. It was very Downton Abbey like. ",0,0.5063,0.106,0.763,0.13,0.392,POSITIVE,0.9916

Her mother had worked there before Grace was born. It is 1914 when Grace becomes a maid at Riverton. The story unfolds in the memories of 98 year old Grace. She was informed that there was a movie to be made at Riverton and she was asked to consult. The movie is to include a tragic time in the houses history as the story flows from the present and the past. I really enjoyed this.,0,0.8955,0.029,0.83,0.141,0.3499999999999999,POSITIVE,0.9992
