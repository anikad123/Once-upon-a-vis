Secondly, her writing is as good as mine was in the third grade. I do give her points for trying to convey peaceful, happy, self-centering messages, but overall the book is a flop.After reading the book I researched Marlo Morgan and found out that she merely worked for four months in a pharmacy in Queensland, came back to the United States and started selling Melaleuca, a tea tree oil based product. She began supplementing and boosting her sales by handing out manuscripts of her ""experiences"" with Aboriginals and the healing powers of tea tree oil.

With the second and third (this time) reading I had the thought that the book would be stupid and hokey. But oh man, I love it. It totally makes me want to clean out my house and get rid of all my stuff so that I can just enjoy life and the moment. The author gets semi-kidnapped by some Australian Aborigines. They go on walk-about across the Outback. I feel my skin getting pink and sunburny just thinking about it!The people in the book ate giant spiders at one point. They were very thankful to the universe for that gift of nourishment. The same morning that I read that chapter, I saw a giant spider in my bathroom. I have some spider traps. They are cardboard with SUPER sticky goo on one side. The package said that it could catch not just spiders, but also snakes. I don’t have a snake problem in my house, but now I know for sure that I never will. So the spiders (or snakes) run (slither) onto the goo and get stuck. So this morning, I found the spider and I got all freaked out and herded the spider into the trap. He was obviously trying to run away from me, the big evil giant, and rightly so because I was indeed trying to kill him (her?). Thinking about the aborigines made me feel super ungrateful, so I ate the spider to make up for it. Ok, no, I didn’t eat the spider. But I feel real bad about it. I can’t get him off the sticky stuff without breaking his legs or touching him. Breaking his legs=bad for him. Touching him=bad for me. So, I have to let him die. That way at least one of us (me) comes out ahead. Maybe I should catch some fruit flies and feed him so that he doesn’t starve to death. Maybe I could feed him until he just died of spider-old-age.

(Although, if you want to read this, which I strongly suggest you don't do, please take note of the controversy surrounding this book!)In fact, I might even have just given four stars and pointed that fact out to you, if the book had been good. The trouble is, Mutant Message Down Under isn't good. It is far, far from good. One thing that really annoyed me was the protagonist herself. If you plan to work in Australia for at least a few months, if not years, you've never thought of picking up a book about Australian history and the Aborigines before? Really?If you think about helping young people to get off the streets, you then offer to teach them about businesses? As a doctor who is struggling to sell her own theories? Really?If you have worked with young Aborigines before, and you then get invited to another Aboriginal tribe, you think it would impress them if you wore a brand new peach coloured costume with matching high-heels? Seriously???If you can overlook these things (and really, it is quite hard to do), you are then confronted with a storytelling structure that doesn't exist, and a style of writing that is in parts unreadable. However, it gets worse. That is, unless you love to read every selfhelp book there is, even the really bad ones. And don't mind reading every random and general advice over and over again. One would have thought that, having travelled with people of such eye-opening wisdom and naming herself a travelling tongue, Marlo Morgan should have been able to describe which wonderful experiences and thoughts led her to beliefs such as ""You shouldn't hide yourself from the world"" or ""It is important to look for the harmony within"" or even ""Don't put so much importance on things, look toward people and emotions instead"". But no. Every short chapter has at least five of these (rather obvious) advices, and no explanation how her understanding, if she did indeed get it, came about.

14,152661315,03/07/2011,3.0,"The narrator of this book is a middle-aged American woman who is kidnapped by a group of nomadic Aborigines and taken on a several-months-long walkabout through the Australian bush. The resulting story is a narration of her experiences with skin exposure to the elements, eating bugs and worms and experiencing unexpected spiritual growth with a group of people who are the opposite of herself. When it was first published, the book was presented as a non-fictional memoir. Except resulting criticism from experts show the story to be a gross misrepresentation of Australian Aboriginal culture and the response from Aboriginal people is that the book is not only a blatantly fictional account, but also offensive and racist. At this point in time, the general consensus indicates that the book is merely the product of the author’s imagination, although the author continues to maintain the fact that it is a truthful account. I chose to read the book as fiction and was struck by it on two levels. First, as a student of sociology I was utterly fascinated by the methodology specifically because so many presume it to be a complete fake. And secondly, as a mutant (a white person), I couldn’t help but feel sucker-punched by some of the observations made by the narrator. For example, this passage especially hit me close to home -“Certainly mingling in the center is the position most Americans seem to lean toward. Not too rich, not too poor. Not deathly ill, but never quite healthy. Not morally pure, but somewhere short of serious crime. And sooner or later we must step out in faith. We must lead, if only to become responsible for ourselves.” (p. 131)Reading that passage forced me to acknowledge that I’ve been sitting on a fence for years and merely existing in the middle rather than grasping life fully and becoming responsible for myself. I am fully entrenched in the rat race and even though I’m not happy about it, I’m not in a position to help myself at this point in time. It’s the old “can’t see the forest because of the trees” adage. Sad, isn’t it?Anyway, three stars. Even though the descriptions of the Aboriginal people in this book may be a hindrance to gaining actual knowledge about their culture, the book made me think so I can’t rate it poorly. And yet I can’t gush about it because there’s a greater part of me that wishes the author would have chosen a more legitimate means of addressing the spiritually bereft American psyche without insulting a group of people and adding fuel to the race fire.

15,539936653,02/18/2013,4.0,"Marlo Morgan is certainly not a spectacular writer, but there is great wisdom in her message. She highlights the many flaws in our ways of life: our attachments to ""stuff,"" competition with each other, insecurity, excess, greed, waste, mental enslavement, abuse of Earth's resources, lack of true spirituality, and so much more. These are all things worth thinking about and improving as we attempt to awaken from the illusions. However, I'm not sure how to feel about the book's delivery. What the book tells us: The author, Marlo Morgan, was summoned to Australia under the premise of learning about Aboriginal culture; but she ended up getting somewhat tricked into a deeply transforming walkabout through the desert with an unheard of tribe of aboriginals. (view spoiler)[These enlightened people turn out to be the only living humans who are so connected to Divine Oneness (God) that they communicate telepathically, live completely free of attachment, and maintain various powers that all humans (supposedly) would be capable of if we weren't ""mutants"" who have lost touch with intended humanity.  (hide spoiler)]This group, The Real People, remained hidden from the government and travelers for many generations, refusing to entrust anyone with their knowledge, gifts, secrets and whereabouts. Nonetheless, they choose to share everything they know and have with this one particular woman, Marlo, who happens to be American and as white as the oppressors who pushed the Real People into hiding. Critics, of course, say this is a major reason to doubt the story.My understanding is that Marlo Morgan claims this book to be a truthful memoir marketed as fiction in order to protect the Real People from invasion or other negative consequences. Obviously, none of this can be verified because the tribe lives deep in the desert where ""mutant"" humans (including other aboriginals) cannot find them. They won't surface or communicate with anyone except Marlo, which means we just have to take her word for it. Or not. If this book is indeed an accurate account of the author's experience in Australia, it is absolutely fascinating. If not, she has a great imagination and I like her outlook on the woes in our world. Yes, I have a problem with supporting authors who make false claims; but I won't dwell on something that I can't prove or disprove.

She said, “Oh, you’re into this kind of transcendental, living in the woods, sitting around a campfire, eating with your fingers kind of mumbo-jumbo. I think you might like it.” She was right. If you are one of those who believe indigenous, hunter-gatherer peoples have a certain innate wisdom that our culture dismisses or doesn’t value or has forgotten, then you might like it as well. Cited as a complete work of fiction, “Mutant Message Down Under” follows the adventure of the author who is summoned to remote tribe of nomadic Aboriginals in Australia. The isolated group call themselves the ""Real People,"" and they want the author to accompany them on a 1,400 mile, four-month long journey through the rugged desert Outback. Surprisingly, she does.

And while traveling barefoot with the nomadic group, she learns a new, simpler way of life, including their ancient methods of healing, based on the hand-me-down wisdom of their 50,000-year-old culture.

20,167291563,05/10/2011,2.0,"First, I'd like to preface this review by saying I know absolutely nothing about real aboriginal culture or history. I can't possibly tell you what is fact and what is pure creation by the author. This book is aparently extremely controversial because while some people love it as the tale of a spiritual journey amongst a mysterious native population, other people say that the author didn't accurately portray the culture truthfully, and was actually blatantly offensive.I also have no idea if the author actually wanted this book to be taken as a mostly true story, or as just an extensive metaphor, a spiritual fable. It is written in the style of a memoire, and the author writes that it is based on real events, but it is shelved as fiction. Personally, I think that if any of it is actually ""based in reality,"" its really just an extrapolation of one night she spent camping in the desert and probably got a bit high. Wikipedia states that eventually she condeded that she made the story up, but... well... its wikipedia.All of that said, I'm not going to evaluate this book on the intentions of its author, or the dubiousness of its origins, but only on the story and the message itself.This is the story of a typical middle aged american woman who is on buisness in Australia teaching methods of wholistic healing (she mentions acupuncture, theraputic massage, etc). She is invited to a ""meeting"" by a native aboriginie, and she thinks its her big moment. She thinks she's going to be recognized for all the good work she's done trying to help the lower-income mixed race young adults. At heart she is a city woman, and she sits on her high horse expecting to receive a pretty little plaque, a big thank you, and maybe a lunch buffet with some ""authentic cuisine.""Maybe predictable, she quickly finds out that true aboriginal culture isn't anything like she expected. Still dressed in her buisness suit, heels and make-up she's driven out to the edge of the desert, told to remove all her clothing, jewelry and belongings and instead put on a rag dress so that she can be cleansed. Which she does. They then burn all of it, tell her she's going on a walk-about across Australia to ""become one, and experience true beingness,"" and promptly head out into the desert on foot. Which she does. She's afraid and confused, but she follows them, and naively expects to back in the city by check out time at her hotel tomorrow.What ensues is three months worth of ramblings, physically across the width of Australia, and mentally through various memories she has and spiritual realizations she comes to. It turns out that native aborigines can communicate telepathically, can heal broken bones overnight, and perform illusions to either disappear from sight, or to make one man look like 50 men. What is also mentions, and that I believe may actually be closer to the true culture, is that they can find water nearly anywhere within the desert, can eat just about anything, and have been using natural remedies that are completely unique and unknown to the rest of the world to cure various health problems that keep them surviving and able-bodied to an incredibly old age.Eventually she finds out that she really is on her way to a meeting, of sorts. When she was born, a similar spirit was born in the exact same moment on the exact opposite side of the earth. She and her kindred spirit made plans to meet again in 50 years and share their experiences. It was her destiny that brought her here. A destiny that even a mysterious fortune teller in the tea-shop in the city told her, but that she just didn't understand until this moment... Right. It turns out that her companion spirit is the tribal elder, and they share many different things about their cultures, finding similarities and differences in elaborate metaphors. My favorite one: ""It seems Mutants [their names for non-aboriginies] have something in their life called gravy. They know the truth, but it is buried under thickening and spices of convenience, materialism, insecurity and fear. They also have something in their lives called frosting. It seems to represent how they spend almost all the seconds of their existence in doing superficial, artificial, temporary, pleasant-tasting, nice-appearing projects, and spend very few actual seonds of their lives developing their eternal beingness.""Eventually they share with her their true secret. The aboriginies are leaving the world. When they die, they will become one with the world, they already are one with the world. But the mutant world holds no place for them anymore, so they have stopped having children. They need her to go out into the world, and take to the rest of the Mutants a message, teach them the things she has learned about being and oneness and the true intent of the universe. And so she does.To be perfectly honest, this book was not for me. I found it over-written, and over-moralizing. It was a soap box of very little support, and distinctly unbalanced and prone to wobbling. I don't entirely disagree with its message, as a culture we most definitely place too much emphasis on materialistic gain within the short frantic time-span of our own lives. But I believe that taken seriously, this is a fanaticism of the opposite extreme. Growth and change are good and necessary. As well as personal identity, ambition to create, and not to mention will to survive. In the end, the main character gallops out of the outback on a higher horse than the one she rode in on (metaphorically of course, though she does describe her now calloused feet as ""hooves"" several times). She is distressed that the local Mutants she tells her story to seem uninteresed in her grand philosophies of reincarnation and the one-ness of the universe. She encounters meanness and uglieness in the world that she hasn't had to deal with in the last three months, but proves to herself that she has grown in ""beingness"" by not being hurt and instead blessing the person that wronged her. She makes her way home, to a family that wants to hear her story, and with a willingness to tell it to the world.Basically, if I take this book too seriously, it bothers me very deeply. But if I take a step back, and instead look at the silliness of the adventure of it, at a woman in a situation she is utterly not prepared for but willing to take a go at, its not so bad. I think maybe this story would have been greatly improved if the author had not claimed it was based in reality from the beginning.

I want to believe that the author, Marlo Morgan, was sincere in her desire to deliver a message of spiritual transformation in impoverished times. If only she had used a fictional race for her story, she could have avoided the anger and anguish that was unleashed by her thoughtless use of the indigenous people of Australia. Because the Aborigines have been used and abused by white people in so many ways over the centuries (slaughtered, enslaved, studied, and herded off their ancestral land), the outrage is understandable. Morgan’s narrator (presumably herself) purports to have been the sole recipient of centuries-old secret rituals of the “Real People” and she published as fact what has since been debunked. (Yes, Harper Collins lists the book as fiction, but Morgan does her best in her notes to the reader to undermine that designation.) Publishing and making money off these misconceptions would have been more forgiving if she had owned up, apologized, offered to make amends, and perhaps shared some of her royalties. I’m sorry that she did not.

My problems with the book were these:- The writing is just plain bad. It's like a B- high-school essay at best. You can sometimes excuse this kind of bad writing in a non-fiction account if the author has an interesting (and believable) story, but this is clearly fiction, and I like my fiction to be well written.- The scenarios she gets into with the tribe seemed really campy and fake to me- even if I didn't know about the fiction/non-fiction controversy, I don't think I could have believed half of it. - I guess there's a possiblity that you're not supposed to care whether it's true, becuase the author has a ""message"" (basically that white people are ruining the world and we should all care about the one-ness of mankind and nature, be less dependent on possessions and live simply, etc. etc.).

Aborigines outraged as US author makes a million with `New Age fantasy' of lost tribe in the bushRobert MillikenSunday 11 December 1994 01:02ONE OF the publishing sen- sations of the year has landed its author in a furious argument with Australian Aborigines, who claim that her account of walking barefoot through the outback with a ``lost tribe'' is a hoax.The dispute centres on Mutant Message Down Under, by Marlo Morgan, 59, a divorced mother-of-two from Kansas. The book, her first, has made her a millionairess. Three years ago, unable to find a publisher, she paid for it to be printed herself. Her daughter did the illustrations. After an initial print run of 300 copies, the book became a runaway hit among devotees of New Age spirituality and self-discovery in the US, selling mo re than 300,000 copies.Morgan acquired an agent, and this year the giant publishing house HarperCollins paid her a reported $1.7m (£1.13m) for the rights and embarked on a $250,000 marketing campaign. The book has sold a further 350,000 copies since the company published it inthe US in September and in Australia last month. It will be published in Britain in March. Two Hollywood producers are preparing a script, with Susan Sarandon and Goldie Hawn being considered for the role of Morgan.The problem is that the ``true'' story which has made Morgan a celebrity may not actually have happened. As Morgan tells it in Mutant Message Down Under, she was a health education worker in Kansas City when she received a telephone call from an Australian, whom she had met at a conference, inviting her to Australia to see how ""socialised medicine"" worked.On arrival she was distressed by the lot of young urban Aborigines, who seemed to spend their lives sniffing petrol. She helped 22 young blacks set up a successful business making window fly screens. Then came a telephone call from an Aboriginal man who told Morgan she was required to attend a tribal meeting. She flew 2,000 miles across the continent and was met by the the man, ``Ooota'', who then drove her in a Jeep for four hours into the outback. He introduced her to a tribe of 62 Aborigines, adornedin feathers and paint, who spoke no English and had never seen a white person before.""They were the last of the hold-outs,"" she wrote. They called themselves ``the Real People"". Ooota informed her that she had been chosen for the singular honour of meeting the Real People because her work with the dispossessed urban Aborigines showed she""seemed to care"".The Real People ritually cleansed her with smoke, then made her undress and throw her clothes, credit cards, jewellery and every other aspect of her Western identity into a fire. They named her ``Mutant'', and beckoned her to join them in a walk across the empty outback, the length of the continent. ""It is what you were born to do,"" Ooota told her. In bare feet she spent four months learning to live off kangaroos, wild horses, lizards, snakes, grubs and giant ants that tasted like orange blossom honey, washing in crocodile-infested lagoons. At the end of her walk the Aborigines took her to a secret, sacred cave where an elder explained the real purpose of her journey.The Real People, he said, were the last of the ``pure human race'', but had decided to become celibate and die out because the Earth was being destroyed. ""You have been chosen as our messenger to tell your kind we are going. We are leaving Mother Earth to you. We pray you will see what your way of life is doing to the water, the animals, the air...""￼By any stretch of the imagination, Morgan's story is a fantastic one. She gives no clues to when her journey happened, or where it started and ended. The names she gives the tribe members- Great Stone Hunter, Spirit Woman, Female Healer, Sewing Master - smack more of a Hollywood version of American Indians than Aboriginal reality. She bestows a supposedly Stone Age tribe with an astonishing awareness of New Age-speak: they teach her to replace her Western material values with ""Divine Oneness"" and to learn through them the meaning of ""my own beingness''. In Morgan's self-p ublished book she insisted that her story was true. But the HarperCollins dust jacket describes it as a ``fictional account of (a) spiritual odyssey"".Outraged Aborigines are calling on Australians to boycott the book. They say that, while Morgan may have visited Australia and met some Aborigines, her story is a fantasy. They are scornful of her depiction of Aborigines as cannibals. They say she portrays an inaccurate picture of their culture and history to a naive American public in order to make money.",0,0.8422,0.049,0.896,0.055,0.376125663413799,NEGATIVE,0.9788
85,4237262300,09/14/2021,5.0,"Marlo Morgan, an American living in Australia, is invited by an Aboriginal group to what she thinks is an awards banquet. Her guide, Ooota, picks her up from her hotel in a beat up Jeep and drives her deep into the Outback to meet a waiting tribe whose members call themselves The Real People. The tribe burns her clothing, wallet, camera, passport and all other possessions and invites her on a walk across the continent.They spend the next four months trekking barefoot through some of the world’s most inhospital land. The tribe carries virtually no food or water. They begin each day with a prayer of gratitude and trust the world will provide for them.It does, as it has for thousands of years.As her journey progresses, the author reflects on the contrasts between the fear-based culture of the industrial world, which has chosen to subdue nature, and the faith-based culture of the ancient tribe that lives in harmony with nature.In the West, those who don’t already live in poverty live in fear of it. They cling to jobs they don’t like and accumulate possessions to which they become slaves.The Real People live with virtually nothing. They don’t know where their next meal will come from, or if they’ll even eat that day. In their morning prayer, they ask simply for what “is in the highest good for all life everywhere.” The tribe accepts with gratitude whatever follows, trusting in the generosity of the Divine Oneness who sang the world into existence.Scientists know [the Aborigines] have inhabited Australia for at least fifty thousand years. It is truly amazing that after fifty thousand years they have destroyed no forests, polluted no water, endangered no species, caused no contamination, and all the while they have received abundant food and shelter. They have laughed a lot and cried very little. They live long, productive, healthy lives and leave spiritually confident.All the world is one, and what you do to others, you ultimately do to yourself. “We think of Divine Oneness,” Ooota says, “as feeling the intent and the emotion of beings–not as interested in what we do as in why we do it.”Mutants, in the tribe’s view, are those who have strayed from nature. They injure the world that nourishes them, injuring themselves in the process, though they refuse to see this and refuse to care.The human body is a vessel for eternal spirits who have chosen to come here. Human life is the process of discovering and becoming who you already are, while learning to deal with intense emotion that can take you off course.Life is a series of spiritual tests, and it will keep giving you the same test again and again until you pass. (Think about that from the perspective of Western psychology. People get locked into destructive patterns of behavior, they keep having the same damaging relationships again and again. Moving forward is often a matter of “breaking the cycle.”)But “the Divine Oneness planned no suffering to any living creature, except what the creature accepts for itself.”Why did the tribe choose Morgan for this journey? They felt she was compassionate and open. They felt that many Mutants, witnessing the death of nature and feeling the spiritual emptiness of modern culture, are on the cusp of becoming Real People. They felt she could bring their message of oneness, openness and gratitude to those in the industrialized West who “contain yet the spark of divine perfection.”When she parts from the tribe, Morgan thanks them for the new spiritual awareness they have given her. The Elder says, “There was nothing we could give you that you did not already have… you learned to accept, receive and take from us. That is our gift.” And it’s the one the author wants to pass on to you.Keep in mind this book is fiction and, according to Australian Aboriginal tribes, does not accurately represent Aboriginal culture or spiritual beliefs. It depicts an idealized tribe of noble savages who don’t seem to suffer from the seven deadly sins that afflict the rest of the human race. Take a look at what the Aboriginal Research and Resource Centre had to say to The Independent when the book was released.Critics have said the book is primarily a vehicle to express New Age spiritual beliefs, and it does read that way. But it gives the reader much to reflect on, particularly in its critique of the materialism and spiritual poverty of modern consumer life.",0,0.9735,0.077,0.813,0.109,0.3739690134426975,POSITIVE,0.9633
86,4337519412,11/14/2021,1.0,"Do not read this book. Do not give money to this author for this book. Please read up on the literary hoax surrounding this now-called ""novel"" for legal reasons. (Wikipedia is a good place to start with references and external links.) This book is so inherently problematic in its racist (meaning: marginalization and ""othering"" of non-dominant people groups based on their race; prejudiced attitudes followed by negative actions towards marginalized people groups based in race), white supremacist (meaning: the inherent and implicitly-biased view that white is ""better"") views via its centralization around the ""noble savage"" trope. My book club decided to read this book based on a recommendation of someone who read it over 25 years ago after it was first published. The author could get away with such a book 30 years ago in that it was still okay for white women to spiritually appropriate native and indigenous cultures to facilitate their spiritual/New Age agendas back then, but this does not fly in 2021. I almost always can find something redeemable about a book (almost!) but then there are those which are so offensive in their premise that I cannot sit by quietly and ignore their offensiveness. This is one of those books. A couple of people in the group who read this took the attitude of ""I loved and appreciated the book."" It's not so much that the spiritual ideas within the memoir-turned-""novel"" are offensive; in fact, many of the spiritual values expressed in the book are great values and ideals to have. What is so offensive is that the book is centered around a white woman's appropriation of allegedly ""secret knowledge"" and using (profiting from!) indigenous people as the vehicle to espouse those beliefs, not to mention that it is very likely that key pieces of information in the book are falsified and not drawn from first-hand personal experience, but entirely fabricated. Here's a quotation to explain why this book is inherently so problematic (from this source: https://ct.counseling.org/2014/05/the...)""The problem with stereotyping of any kind — even if there are positive intentions behind such views — is that it categorizes the objects of the stereotyping as people who are somehow “other.” ... The noble savage is a fictional archetype based on a common social stereotype. The noble savage describes an idealized indigenous person, outsider or “other” who has not been corrupted by modern civilization, therefore symbolizing the innate goodness of humanity. The noble savage concept suggests that indigenous, native people are somehow closer to nature and therefore possess a heightened spirituality compared with “civilized” people who do little more than corrupt or destroy the natural world.""What's so bad about the ""noble savage"" trope, you say? It is the inherent ""othering"" adding to stigma of indigenous groups. It's still a dominant white point-of-view and interpretation of events.The claim by indigenous First Australians is that the author has entirely fabricated the story, and there's evidence to prove that's the case. Even if billed as ""fiction,"" the book sets up the ""protagonist"" (meant to be the author herself) as a ""white savior"" (https://www.healthline.com/health/whi...) and the indigenous people as ""magical beings."" Whether fact or fiction, this book is so embedded in inherently racist themes and perspectives, it can't be taken seriously either way. It doesn't work as either a memoir or fiction and is not worth the time. I feel sorry to have paid for this book, and am making it a mission for people to NOT give this book the time of day nor any more money to the author for it.

87,4497777682,01/22/2022,4.0,"I really liked this book. However, I struggle with the fiction/nonfiction uncertainty of it. It is published as both, and as the author’s note says, “This was written after the fact and inspired by actual experience.” It doesn’t say it WAS her actual experience, and it doesn’t say it was inspired by AN actual experience, but “inspired by actual experience.” Well…isn’t that everything? Even good fiction has to be based on the author’s actual experience somewhat, even if they have an imagination as big as the sky. So that left me a little unsettled, wishing I knew what, exactly, was true to her experience, and what was just “based” on her experience. I’m sure the spirit of it all is what she was trying to convey, so that shall have to be good enough. It was insightful; I especially liked thinking of all of us who would either (A) die if they had to live off the land or (B) would rather die than live off the land, as mutants. Such a nuanced word…so literal in this book, but also all the connotations it drags around…fascinating. Quotes:(When finally letting go and letting the bush flies eat her skin—even in the ears and nose!) “So the flies came and I left. I went to New York in my mind. I went to a very expensive health spa. With my eyes closed I felt someone cleaning out my ears and nose. I pictured this trained technician’s diploma hanging on the wall above me. I felt hundreds of tiny cotton balls cleaning my entire body. Finally the creatures left, and I returned mentally back to the Outback. It was true, surrender is definitely the correct answer in certain circumstances.I wondered what else in my life I perceive to be wrong or difficult instead of exploring to understand the true purpose.” (69)About business, fascinating, a quote from Sewing Master and then the author: “‘It seems business has become a hazard to mutants. Your businesses were started so people could get better items collectively than they could get for themselves and as a method to express individual talent, and become part of your money system. But now the goal of business is to stay in business. It seems so strange to us because we see the product as a real thing, and people as real things, but business isn’t real. A business is only an idea, only an agreement, yet the goal of business is to stay in business regardless. Such beliefs are difficult to understand,’…After we had retired for the night, I was still thinking about her remarks. Business is not real, it is just an agreement, yet the goal of business is to stay in business regardless of the outcome on the people or the product and services! That was quite an astute observation for someone who has never read a newspaper, seen a television, or listen to the radio. At that moment I wish the entire world could hear this woman.” (105, 107).At the end, when they are praying over her to let her go back to civilization: “‘We have taught the mutant much, and we have learned from her. It seems mutants have something in their life called gravy. They know truth, but it is buried under thickening and spices of convenience, materialism, insecurity, and fear. They also have something in their lives called frosting. It seems to represent how they spend almost all the seconds of their existence in doing superficial, artificial, temporary, pleasant-tasting, nice-appearing projects and spend very few actual seconds of their lives developing their eternal beingness.’” (177).“The only way to pass the test is to take the test.
