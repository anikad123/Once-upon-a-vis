0,390111647,08/12/2012,5.0,"I finished the last book with a sharp pang: I had read them all. There were no more to read. I felt a sense of loss.Stieg Larrson simply wrote three of the most compulsively readable, engaging books I've read in decades. The characters were fantastic, complex and multi-dimensional and intriguing, flawed but heroic. I cared about Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist. I liked them and I was rooting for them.When I discussed the books with my mother, who reads continually, she said, ""When Lisbeth got her revenge, I stood up and cheered!""I could see my mother at her kitchen table with a cup of coffee, standing up to holler as Lisbeth took her vengeance. It's that kind of novel. It moves you to your feet.The books are suspenseful: the engine of the plot works robustly. I always look for that in a novel. Does the story move forward? Does it build suspense and tension? Yes, yes, yes for this trilogy.One of my rules for writing novels is that every story is an argument for a specific value. The value at the heart of the Millennium trilogy is suggested by its original title ""Men who hate women."" It has something to do with sexual politics, with the power dynamic between men and women, a power that, at its basest level, comes out of physical strength alone, without making reference to intelligence or character. But that's at the most base, least evolved level. Tiny, waifish Salander with her multiple piercings and autistic affect gives the lie to the importance of physical size. She is a trained fighter. She is a resourceful person with hidden gifts. She doesn't give up and she takes her power into herself. She isn't traditionally beautiful, she isn't seductive or pleasing, and she doesn't fit the stereotypical sitcom image of the good girl we all root for. But we all root for her. She stays in the reader's imagination for long after the back cover closes over the pages. According to Wikipedia, Larrson witnessed the gang-rape of a young woman when he was young, and it haunted him. It led him into thinking deeply about gender relations, and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo trilogy is a meditation on the power dynamics between the genders, and how men feel about women, especially strong women, women who defy traditional roles and categorizations. Basically, insecure men want to hurt women they can't control. It's not an accident that Blomkvist's magazine profiles sex trafficking in the second book, ""The Girl who Played with Fire."" Men who hate women see them as objects for their use.At one point, I think in the last book, Larrson refers to Salander as 'the girl who hated men who hate women.' I'm paraphrasing because I was too caught up in the story to remember exactly, though I took note of that phrase. Lisbeth Salander personifies defiance of the approved female roles. She just isn't going to be objectified.So the trilogy was deeply pleasurable on many levels. It worked as a riveting story with characters who grabbed you and didn't let go no matter what. It also worked on the intellectual level, with ideas that matter.Read The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo trilogy. I recommend it. It will satisfy you and make you think, both at the same time.",44,0.9859,0.096,0.751,0.153,0.5320979335130277,POSITIVE,0.9999
1,2256610715,01/13/2018,5.0,"This is one of the best crime thriller trilogies ever written and such a sad twist that Stieg Larsson didn't get to see the success his books had.A lot of people have seen the movies and understand the storyline but I would recommend reading the books as they offer much more depth to the characters with their personal demons and principles, particularly experienced by Lisbeth Salander. The plot is excellent and while each book can more or less stand on its own, there is the real expansive plot at play across the trilogy, where the past can never be laid to rest. The story is fast-paced and adventurous, and also brutal and upsetting.The job that Salander does just seems to suit her character so perfectly - slightly removed and introverted, yet highly capable and focused. I loved her she is high maintenance. Mikael Blomkvist, the journalist, is another wonderful character with his own flaws and like Lisbeth is highly motivated to uncover the truth.",15,0.9939,0.048,0.68,0.272,0.5892424242424241,POSITIVE,0.9999
2,134652709,12/11/2010,5.0,"I started The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo back in February of this year, and for the first time in years, I read right through this and the other two books in the Trilogy (The Girl Who Played with Fire and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest). So I must give these books my highest recommendation. Why? Mainly because Stieg Larsson has created the most unforgettable character in fiction since who knows when. For me, probably since Elizabeth Bennett. Will you like these books? If you like very complicated, detailed characters (and many many of them), a complicated espionage story, and fairly good writing that is both plot and character driven, I think you will. Since I am absolutely NO fan of The Twilight books, J.D. Rowling books, Nicholas Sparks or Dan Brown, if you liked these books, you may not particularly like these books, but who knows? You might. 48 million and counting are devouring these books around the world. (And don't miss the films - the undubbed Swedish versions, not the soon to be completed US version which I am expecting to be typically zipped up American movies without the subtle deliberate context of European films.)

But as some agents did say on Twitter some time ago, if this book was first published in the States, it would have been trimmed and it'd be better. The three of them are too long.On the other hand, Lisbeth Salander character is one of the best characters I've read lately. You become instantly attached to her and want her to succeed. In general, Larsson treats better women than men. Lots of women are great characters in the trilogy. Didn't root for male first character though. It lacked strengh or something.

4,471461660,12/06/2012,5.0,"I began Girl with the Dragon Tattoo with the goal of understanding what there was about this book that made it so popular. I was gritting my teeth, convinced that getting through the book would be a most unpleasant labor. But then I found myself turning pages, not able to put it down, suprised, pleased, impressed.And so I soldiered on to the second and third books of the series, and I loved them. But to answer my original question: what is it about these books that makes them so popular? Well, I can at least say why I like them so much. In a word, it's characters. Lisbeth is one of the all-time best fictional characters I've ever encountered and it is her story that carries everything through. By the third book there is no doubt that the whole series is really about her. She's unique, well-thought-through, mysterious, yet consistent and totally believable.Almost every other character with a few notable exceptions is similarly well-constructed. There are a few stick figures - minor villians mostly. As for the plots, you could make a case that books two and three are just one long story, but Dragon Tattoo is a distinct story, though it ties closely into the next book. I liked the Dragon Tattoo plot the best, the other story is a bit far-fetched at times, but often engrossing and believable. Two other things that make these books great are the attention to detail and the incredible sense of place. Larson paints vivid pictures of all the locales, including the Caribbean island Lisbeth spends some time on. The plot details are just that - details that sell the story, that make you believe it's happening as you read it.If you are one of the eight people in the world who haven't read these books yet, I do recommend that you get right on it!

5,451923205,11/09/2012,5.0,"I don't know what to say about this Triology or not a triology but an incompleted series. I have loved this all in all but at the same time I have regretted reading it as well. It has kept me awake at nights but at the same time bored me. It has left me wanting to read more but at the same time left a bad taste in my mouth. There are so many contradicting emotions this series has left me with.This has to be the most weird series or the most weird set of books anyone can read. Its so filled up with flaws that at the start you can't understand what the hype is about but the more you read the more you can't resist giving it 5 stars as well. The Hype and IntroductionThe hype that surrounds these books is probably understandable. Especially in Sweden where these things (abusing women) really happen. Swedish people can feel all the concept brought around in these books.Let me tell you that this is a series and it would be totally wrong for anybody to rate each book differently or to make a certain good or bad opinion just after reading 1 book. Every book is incomplete at the end and continues into its next part.The 1st book is just a start. It by no means a great sensation. It just leads into the introduction of characters through a sub-plot of the actual series. The plot is irrelevant of the whole series but it is very interesting mystery and a good development of the characters for the rest of the series to follow. Many might say just after reading this book that it is over-hyped, I also had the same feeling when I read further into the series the opinions started to change and I realized that this is actually a proper series and not individual threads.The second book is where this series actually starts. The story gradually morphs into a tale of sexual prejudice, abuse of power, and governmental conspiracy. This book starts to thrill, get into your nerves, forces you to stay awake at night. The same thing continues into the third with much more excitement and thrill. The third book is also incomplete as Larsson had planned a 10 book series and could only finish 3.Why you love it?The character development is the essence of this book and is the most striking thing about these books. Larsson make you dwell so much deep into the characters that you can feel each and every character's each and every emotion and activity. You can have sympathy for Lisbeth, like Blomkvist's friendly and smart behavior, hate Sapo's secret force and so on with every character not matter how small or big roles they played. I have never seen a better character development and feel for the characters in any other book.Besides Character Development there are many other lovable things as well.The Thrill - It takes some time in every book to get into. The first 100-200 can be very boring. But once you get into it there's no stopping. You will be forced to stay awake at nights, turn page after page until you complete it. The more you read the more you will like it. The Plot - Larsson has done an exceptional work in this department. Not only is the plot very believable but he mixes up so many characters and so many things into a single plot that it becomes impossible to keep a proper track of things. Lisbeth the heroine, Blomkvist the hero, Erika the supporter, Different levels of police, millennium staff, murder, mystery, thrill, suspense etc... etc... so many thing involved. That makes it a must read.I am utmost sure that Larsson has created memorable characters and plot which I even if I try my hardest would not be able to forget.Why you regret it? What went wrong? What messed it up all?As I mentioned above the book is most weird one could ever read. It had a great, great characters, overall a mesmerizing series. Then what it was that messed it all up that some people talk about it being over-hyped and what it was that made you feel regret reading it. I guess there are two separate answers to these questions and both are equally important. Firstly I want to talk about what went wrong or what messed it up all. I have never seen a 5 Star book with so many flaws and I am pretty sure that I won't see any 5 start with more flaws than this. This all goes down to 1 reason and that is COMMERCIALISM. The publishers and the marketers are the sole ones to ruined these books. Just to make some good, quick money they have damaged this heavily.TRANSLATION - They say that poor translation can ruin a good story. This book is a perfect example of it. It was originally written in Swedish and then converted into English worldwide. Now let me tell you that Reg Keeland is no mug of a translator. He has done translation for years and most of the books english versions have been quite successful. So the reason for bad translation are again the marketers and publishers. If you search the internet you would find it that Reg Keeland whenever he's used this pseudonym has been because he's not satisfied with the time he's been given for the editing by the publishers/marketers (he's original name is Steve Murray and he uses that as well when he has his terms clear with the publishers but when its not he uses a pseudonym). The same thing has happened in this case. EDITING The commercials people have done a great in messing up this as well. Editing if it has been done at all has been really really poor. If it hasn't been done then its even more to feel sorry for Larsson. There are parts in the series where you feel the story just goes on passively without any interest. Those parts feel a little bit stretch and take the original excitement of the book to some extent. All this is down to editing. Larsson was a journalist not a writer so these books needed a very good editor but the marketers have again not allowed this to happen.Bit parts and pieces in the series are rather quite awkward. Not fatally so, but a few sharp-eyed beta readers could have done wonders for ironing out these books. (The style improves steadily through the trilogy, but not without hiccups.) And that's a shame, because there's a really good story here, and some terrific characters. Again a editorial mistake not allowed to rectify by the marketersThere were many other reasons which have messed it up all, I won't go into much details about that since all is down to Commercialism. They have done a perfect to fuck this more than a 5 star worth book down to a lot less degree. So the people who complain about the hype are not totally wrong.TITLE The original titles of these books were different. For the first book it was ""Men Who Hate Women"" and I think the original Swedish titles would have suited all the books rather much better even though it would not have been that catchy. The stories are rather surrounded around the Swedish titles than the English ones. This thing was discussed when Larsson was alive and despite serious protests he wasn't allowed The Swedish Titles.Why do you regret reading itOne reason you regret these books is it was actually planned out to be a 10 book series and Larsson had wanted it to write in that way. But since he died midway he could only finish 3 of them. Because of just 3 books planned out of 10 the triology doesn't fit well into parts. After reading the end of every book it leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Each book got better than the previous one. The first was good, the second was lovable and the third set a different level for crime books and the 4th never came. You could just wonder how good all would have been had all 10 books been published. Also another thing happened since only 3 books were published is that many things were left unsaid or incomplete, that upsets a to quite an extent. The main reason for the regret is if you feel so sorry for Larsson after reading it. I have never ever seen any book in which one can get so realistically involved. As you read you would probably come to know that Larsson was on his way to change the world, atleast Sweden or Europe if not the whole world & also go on to become one of the greatest writers of all time but unfortunately he couldn't do it. I felt so sorry for Larsson at the end that I was almost brought to tears. And adding salt to injury the marketers fucked it off even more. I wish Larsson had completed all 10, I am not content with 3 moreover I feel regret that I read this because I was so deeply involved in this that I couldn't read 7 more sensations This was clearly not how Larsson had planned to end the series. The ending left so much scope for other stories to come after it.ConclusionsThese are not just normal books, they are thought provoking , burning your chest, making you feel raged. These books are violent. The treatment of women is ghastly to the point of misogynistic. I'd be tempted to call Larsson on it, but is the world so different from the horrors he portrays? No, it's not. Terrible things happen to women all the time, but here the author makes you look at them and understand that justice is not about what's right or wrong but who holds the power and common man like me & most of you just cannot do anything about no matter how much we feel like doing so. By the end of the last book I wished that these characters actually existed. The world is in dire need of more Blomkvist and Salander's. Some things must be put to right.The memorable characters Larsson created will forever be etched into the mind of us readers. I am sure that I will never forget you as long as I live. I don't have words to describe how good the writing was, all i can do is bow down to Mr. Larsson. I am also pretty sure that after reading this I won't be able to give any other crime fiction book 5 stars because then this book would also fall into the same category as the others. This series has set a different category, a different bar for everything else to come. It's first Millennium, then 5 stars, then 4 and so on.THE MARKETERS, PUBLISHERS AND ALL OTHERS INVOLVED IN COMMERCIALISM OF THIS SERIES COMPLETELY FUCK OFF.

8,941871183,05/19/2014,2.0,"I’m going against my better judgement here and reviewing a trilogy as a whole, rather than as individual books. I didn’t truly find enough difference between the stories to promote an in-depth look at each, and so here I sit, reviewing the series that took the literary world by storm.I think I will annoy a great many people when I say that not only did I not love these books, but I didn’t even particularly like them. The stories were undoubtedly gripping, but overall I found them shallow. They profess to tackle significant issues regarding sexual violence, especially violence against women. Still, I feel they addressed them in a way that was just as exploitative as the actions Stieg Larsson so professes to hate. The books are pure voyeurism, and the characters were fundamentally unlikeable and completely two dimensional. We never got to know them as people, simply as the concepts they were meant to represent.The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo introduces us to characters who will play a role throughout the series. It tells the story of Journalist, Mikhael Blomkvist, and computer hacker Lisbeth Salander. Blomkvist has recently been tried and charged with libel, and with his career on the rocks takes the opportunity to work on the case of the murdered of the niece of business mogul, Henrik Vanger. In return, he will be offered the chance to clear his name. The case brings him in to contact with Lisbeth Salander. They work together (and inexplicably sleep together) to not only solve the case but to uncover a great many other family secrets, only to ultimately (in my opinion) destroy their integrity. The next two books, The Girl Who Played With Fire, and The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet’s Nest, follow the same story arc. It is essentially a story revolving around clearing Lisbeth Salander of murder charges while they research the case of sex trafficking, and political intrigue in Sweden. Naturally, there is more to the stories than this, but I can’t go into too much detail without ruining the suspense of the books.The suspense, unfortunately, is all the books have going for them. The real tragedies that occur in the novels, the violence, rape, sex trafficking, etc., are lost entirely in pages of pointless rambling about the sexuality and sexual exploits of the series’ protagonists. The victims of these horrible, dehumanizing crimes, are lost and hardly mentioned, then replaced instead with descriptions of shallow characters, with shallow lives, who have shallow sex, and write shallow articles. The fate of a young Eastern European girl who has been kidnapped and forced into the sex trade is deemed far less critical to the plot than the relationship between a man writing an article on sex trafficking, and his thesis writing girlfriend. They are, after all, ‘the good guys’. Again, the stories of countless women murdered, and tortured in the first book are deemed far less important to the plot than the fact that one woman doesn’t want her secrets told. There is no way this can be redeemed in my eyes. The victims are given no character, and instead, we have to sit through pages of incidental detail about the tiniest moments in the lives of these superficial protagonists and their sex lives.Larsson’s disgust of sexual violence purportedly inspired the series after he witnessed the gang rape of a young girl when he was 15. He allegedly never forgave himself for failing to help the girl, who’s name was Lisbeth. While this sentiment is admirable, in my opinion the books fail in their objective of absolution. Perhaps these books were meant to be an homage to a woman who was a victim of a terrible crime, but the injustice is furthered by sensationalizing something that affects the lives of so many. Misogyny, sexism, sexual violence - they are all real things. The book doesn’t glorify them, but it gives the reader exactly what the author thinks they want; more of it. Instead of writing sympathetically he – taken from his own website – “knew what ingredients a good detective story should have, and [Larsson] even reluctantly decided to spice it up with a bit of sex as it would probably please his readers.” A bit of sex? These books are some of the most graphically, sexually violent books you will ever read, and that constitutes a bit of sex? Put in there only to “please the readers”? For me, this is raping your characters all over again. If the sex was put in there only to please readers, and what readers want is sexual violence, then the writing thereof is nothing short of exploitative.The character of Lisbeth herself is interesting, in that she metes out her own form of vigilante justice. She is meant to be a role model, but she is just as typecast and stereotyped as anyone else in the books. The way she dresses, her penchant for fetish style clothes, her genius-level mind, all serve to give an image of a woman who is out of the ordinary; a social outsider. The men in her life judge her, become sexually attracted to her, and in some cases sexually abuse her. There is not a single man in the books who is a friend who is not inexplicably sexually attracted to her, for no other reason than that she is ‘different’. Of course, a sexual relationship has to begin between Blomkvist and Salander, which serves no narrative purpose, and peters out after the end of the first novel as he embarks on several other sexual exploits which in turn serve no narrative purpose. The only man who is her friend and who does not seem to want her sexually is Poison, a fellow computer hacker. But he is described as a fat, socially inept computer geek, with some form of implied agoraphobia who lacks personal hygiene and basic human cleanliness. Therefore, he too fills a stereotype. Salander is often described as violent, but with her own internal moral compass with its version of North, as if that is meant to make us excuse her behaviour and actions. She is a social outcast because she has made herself one. Her moral compass points to Nietzsche’s Superman Theory all over again. While Salander has been through a lot, she is not above the law, she cannot do whatever she wishes, and she cannot treat people however she wants. While she understandably has issues with authority, these issues are exacerbated by her actions to the point of psychopathic. She is described as sociopathic and socially incompetent, and I am inclined to agree with those sentiments. She is encouraged at every turn, and her illegal activities are hushed up because they prove useful to the journalist protagonists. She is not likeable, she is not a role model, and I don’t think she serves as a good illustration of the power that women can hold, especially in combating sexual violence. Most judicial systems do fail to punish the perpetrators of heinous crimes adequately, but ultimately the real victory goes beyond just punishment. Victims often lack support, so a colossal personal win is how they carve a place for themselves in a world that betrayed them. Some things can never be forgotten, forgiven and excused, but the triumph lies in not letting it ruin, and control your life. In Salander’s case, this is precisely what has happened. Her entire personality and all her actions are driven by her inability to combat her demons and come through her experiences personally victorious.The plots of the three novels are odd. Each follows the formula of a simple case turning in to something bigger. These novels are different in the cases they pursue, but they become overshadowed by the personal lives of the protagonists. Research into sex trafficking is dominated by the double murder of a journalist and his academic girlfriend, as well as the pickle Lisbeth Salander finds herself in regarding her supposed role in the killings. While eventually, the stories tie in to be part of the one big whole, this is just another case where things turn out just a little too conveniently. Everything is one big coincidence after another, and ultimately the fate of an unnamed Eastern European victim of sex trafficking is deemed less important than Salander’s ultimate revenge and pardon, or Millennium Magazines annual sales.I could continue and complain about the rambling, detailed, completely unnecessary descriptions of almost every detail, mainly of her ‘gear’. I am not kidding when we find out that she owns an Apple iBook 600 with a 25GB hard drive, and 420MB of RAM (outdated as most of the technology is from 2002), an Apple iMac G3, and the long, incredibly detailed description of her Apple PowerBook G4, which we’re told has an aluminium casing, and “PowerPC 7451 processor with an AltiVec Velocity Engine, 960 MB RAM and a 60 GB hard drive” (The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, page 216). I’m a techie, but even I think that these descriptions are unnecessary. They don’t serve the plot in any way; the specs were already outdated by the time the books were released and so failed to impress on any permanent level. If you’re interested in some more detailed descriptions of gadgets, or even just a trip down electronics memory lane, check out this website: The Girl With The Insanely Long Gear List. This doesn’t even begin to mention the significant number of times that IKEA is mentioned. Apparently, no other furniture stores exist in Sweden, because we are subjected to a long product list of IKEA furniture with which the characters furnish their homes and offices. They even using IKEA to give directions, i.e. turn left when you get to the IKEA. Also, I have the feeling that a company called Billy’s was possibly paying Larsson to plug their ‘Pan Pizza’s’ as every time Lisbeth Salander makes herself a meal, instead of just stating that she ate a frozen pizza, it is mentioned every time that is was ‘Billy’s Pan Pizza’. Unnecessary. One day I will go through these books and count ever time those words are mentioned, every time coffee is mentioned, and every time someone talksabout someone that they’ve slept with, especially Blomkvist. I have a feeling I’d reach the word count of one whole novel.All in all, the books are gripping, the plot drives you forward, you’re interested in what happens, but I still can’t like them. They fly in the face of everything they’re trying to achieve, using sexual violence to increase sales, rather than to raise awareness. These books have been described as feminist, finally giving women several strong, female, literary role models, but I disagree. All I see is a man who chose to exploit women in his own way to gain literary fame, in the guise of writing strong female characters. Characters who, like so many others, eventually do come to rely on the men in their lives. Perhaps that’s the real tragedy; the idea of the ‘us and them’ mentality. It doesn’t need to be. Women don’t need to be fine without men, the same way that men don’t need to be fine without women. We can need each other, not as gendered beings, but as people. Our survival and sanity depend on it.",6,-0.9994,0.153,0.752,0.095,0.5118901420217213,NEGATIVE,0.9998

In the second, they get involved with trying to find a Soviet spy who just happens to be Lisbeth's father.

I was really sad at the end of the Millennium series. Larsson wove such an intriguing tale of Lisbeth Salander's life with a mix of political intrigue and conspiracy. I became completely engrossed in the story. The books are long but savory. It's difficult to imagine that Larsson just wrote these three books for fun and relaxation with no intent to publish.

12,3292781092,04/21/2020,3.0,"I never reviewed the first two books, so I’ll remedy that by giving a more general review of the trilogy.First off, I should point out that I resisted the hype for a long time, but finally caved after visiting Stockholm and seeing some incredible Lisbeth Salander street art. I'm glad I went into this with a) a good idea of the city's geography and b) an understanding of Swedish culture and the importance of ""fika"", otherwise I probably would've been annoyed that all they ever seem to do is make/drink coffee and eat sandwiches/pastries. I don't think you can read ten pages without it coming up.Larsson was a far-left-wing activist, and this also shows. When there’s a point he wants to make, he’ll beat the reader over the head with it repeatedly. I didn’t mind, because he makes good points about important issues.Stieg Larsson was also a journalist, and it shows in his report-like writing style. If he were to write a book about a day in my life, it would start off with a page describing me waking up in my MALM IKEA bed wearing a PJ set bought at Primark for 12€, checking my iPhone for new messages, getting up and putting on my IKEA slippers, taking care of my bodily functions, brushing my teeth, washing my face, drinking coffee filled to the cup’s brim with milk and sweetened with two sugars before thinking about what to wear… you see where this is going. He is very descriptive, but not in a poetic sense at all. I don’t know if I’d go as far as saying that it’s bad writing, but it's certainly choppy. It takes some getting used to, but you will, eventually, and it became kind of an endearing quirk. I've since read that the English translation was a rush job commissioned by the Swedish company that adapted the books for the screen, who hoped to hire an English-speaking screenwriter, and that this translation wasn't intended for publication, but it's the one Knopf used when they bought the U.S. publication rights after Larsson's death, and it explains so much in hindsight.These books weren’t what I thought they would be at all, and they honest to God should not work—but they do. They are oddly addictive, and I understand why they climbed the worldwide Bestseller lists. I didn’t find them particularly suspenseful in the traditional sense, but I guess they must’ve been, because despite being quite the doorstoppers, I’ve read each in less than two weeks. So there’s got to be something that pulls the reader in deep—despite the lack of actual mystery thriller plot. The first book does that well enough, but the subsequent ones are very political in nature—Swedish politics, which I don't think anyone's ever really considered to have global political mystery thriller appeal before this series.I think Larsson's big selling point is the characters. I mean… this boasts a bisexual goth hacker heroine, and generally just lots of badass, smart, and sexually liberated female characters that don’t take any shit from men. Give me more of that any goddamn day, honestly.Apparently, if he hadn’t unexpectedly died, there would’ve been seven more volumes in the series, or so he hoped. I have no interest in reading the ones that were written by some random guy against his partner’s will (she got nothing when he died because they never married, and the family he had virtually no contact with got the rights to his unfinished works), so this is it for me.",4,0.9153,0.068,0.839,0.093,0.5005592366816857,NEGATIVE,1.0

The women characters have real depth and agency. While horrible violence against women is indeed depicted in graphic detail, and I understand why some criticize the series for this reason, I am glad that at least the books' message is firmly against misogynistic violence. Lisbeth Salander is someone whom I can relate to while simultaneously being way cooler and more mysterious than I could ever dream to be.My main complaint with these books is that (view spoiler)[Kalle Fucking Blomkvist has sex with nearly every woman character in the trilogy.

That, and I find it slightly irritating yet hilarious how often the characters indulge in cigarettes, coffee, and sandwiches.

The next day I went out and bought the books.The first book, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, was my favourite of the three, I found the murder mystery plot more interesting than the political themes of the second and third books, although all of them were gripping and held my attention from start to finish. They are well written, with a wealth of detail - in fact, my only criticism is that at times there was slightly too much attention to trifling matters and a slight tendency to overdo the recapping of previous plot lines; necessary, I suppose, if you are inexplicably reading the books out of order, but a bit frustrating otherwise.The real genius is in the characterisations; Lisbeth Salander is the most original, refreshing and readable female protagonist I've come across in a long time. She's socially dysfunctional and eccentric in all kinds of ways and is described as looking like an adolescent boy - but she is also intelligent, strong and moralistic. Given the choice between Salander and the beautiful, mawkish Anastasia Steele - it is Salander I would aspire to, every time.The male protagonist, Mikael Blomkvist, was a bit dull in comparison, but by the end of the trilogy this actually seemed to be the perfect foil to Salander's outlandishness. I found him slightly irritating at times; he was almost preternaturally clever and instinctive, often facilitating an easy way out for some of the plot's trickier twists and turns. I also struggled with his seemingly irresistible fascination to women; his character never came across as exceptionally charming, if anything, he struck me as being somewhat careless with regards to women. Nor was a full description of his looks ever given, which left me to form my own mental image of him; since I'd just watched the Swedish film version I often found myself putting the actor's face to the character in my head - and whilst I'm sure that Michael Nyqvist is a very nice chap, he doesn't have the face, in my opinion, of a man who is snog-bait to the ladies (sorry Michael). But he, as with all the characters, is believably written and adds a great deal of colour and depth to the overall storyline.On finishing the books, I had enjoyed them so much that I Googled Stieg Larsson with a view to finding other works by him, only to find he had died in 2004. I don't think there is anything quite so sad and disappointing as discovering an author whose work you enjoy and respect and then realising there is nothing more of theirs to be read.So, in summary: if you like crime thrillers with interesting characters and subject matters that make you stop and think, then I highly recommend these books.",3,0.9937,0.091,0.74,0.169,0.5406701940035272,POSITIVE,0.8203
17,136019746,12/21/2010,5.0," Sets like this have several purposes. One is simply putting a set of related works together, for people who want to acquire all parts, for instance, of a set of books. Another is ""value added"" by putting together a set. For those who have not read the Millennium trilogy, this is a nice way of ""one stop shopping."" Begin with a ""murder mystery,"" ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo."" Here, we begin with journalist Mikael Blomkvist losing credibility and being humiliated for lack of journalistic integrity, all because of a set up concocted by someone whom he was investigating. We get introduced to Lisbeth Salander, a victim of many kinds of abuse, but independent, extraordinarily talented, and a keen researcher. She partners with Blomkvist to solve a series of murders. ""The Girl Who Played with Fire"" follows. Salander has separated herself from Blomkvist and others. She ends up, in essence, being framed for three murders (although by accident). Blomkvist tries to solve the question as to what happened; Salander does her own research to find out what actually happened. We see the dynamic story that results from her relationship to her father, a vicious Soviet defector, Zalachenko. At the end of the novel, in trying to get her revenge against her father, she is grievously wounded. ""The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest"" follows up where the previous novel ends. Salander has surgery for her multiple wounds, rehabilitates, and is subject to a government effort to put her back in a mental institution--to protect a rogue element within the Swedish security establishment. The book, which is drearily slow and detailed in the middle, ends with a dramatic (albeit not totally believable) courtroom scene, a confrontation between Salander and her murderous half-brother, and a quiet reconciliation (perhaps) with Blomkvist. The other aspect of a set like this is ""value added."" There is an extra element here--a piece focusing on Stieg Larsson himself. Many will know that Larsson died of a heart attack before the trilogy was published, thus never experiencing the success of his creation. So, this set works pretty well on two separate levels.

In the first novel, I nearly put it down until I got the part where he introduced Lisbeth. Then it got interesting. In the second book, it started out the same way as the first; slow pacing and lots of unneeded detail to the personal lives of the characters, like Lisbeth apartment-searching, shopping, etc. I actually put the book down for a couple of weeks before picking it up again. Then BAM - I hit the middle and then it starts to get interesting, via the twist. I actually haven't finished reading the third, but overall, Lisbeth Salander has to be one of the most interesting female characters I've ever read. She doesn't take mess from anyone and if any one of the characters screw her over - which happens a multitude of times over the duration of the series, hence the first book's original title in Swedish, 'Men Who Hate Women' - watch out. There's also a ton of violence and sexual content.

23,154533547,03/15/2011,3.0,"The first of three books in the Millennium Series, THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO, has a slow beginning. The first half presents two separate lives in Sweden: Mikael Blomkvist, a 40-something journalist convicted of libel, and Lisbeth Salander, a 24-year-old eccentric computer hacker working for a security firm. The first half was boring. Eventually, the book gets better when Blomkvist and Salander join forces to find a murderer of a member of the Vanger family who disappeared 40 years ago. The Vangers, including husbands, wives, adult children, cousins, aunts, and uncles, are all very rich and very strange. Together they own a worldwide corporation, and they mostly hate each other. Blomkvist and Salanlder uncover their deep, dark secrets, discovering secrets much worse than they bargained for, much worse with every page.The book is billed as a mystery/thriller. But mystery/thriller lovers should be warned: THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO contains only a small portion of what I would call ""thriller."" That is near the end of the book when Blomkvist, after figuring things out and confronting someone, discovers the hard way (the really, really hard way) that, as bad as what he figured, it was way, way worse. Again, that is near the end of the book.The majority of DRAGON TATTOO is mystery, not thriller. And too often the mystery is tedious as Blomkvist and Salander search and research old news clippings, picture archives, old snapshots, others' writeups, etc.I was assured that the other two books are better than the first, so I read the next in the series, THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE.However, this book is also, I feel, a bore in its first half. Most of it describes Salander (""THE GIRL"") in more detail than DRAGON TATTOO did. Frankly, the extra detail made me like her less. I saw her as nothing but a caricature, not someone I could care about.In the second halfof PLAYED WITH FIRE, Salander, who has managed to get copies of several people’s hard drives, learns that Blomkvist plans to publish the findings of a fine upstanding couple investigating sex trafficking crimes. This interests Salander. So she visits the couple, and the next thing we know, they’re dead.Salander is accused of murdering them and, within a short time, she is all but convicted of the crime in the eyes of the public and the police in Stockholm. (Don’t forget, this story takes place in Sweden.)The rest of the book involves Salander hiding out from the law and the few people who think she’s innocent doing the job of the police.And all the new characters introduced in PLAYED WITH FIRE are more caricatures. I can easily imagine them in a Saturday-morning cartoon, especially the giant who feels no pain and is afraid of the dark and the ponytailed, pot bellied bad guy who's no match for Salander. I could clearly see ""ZAP"" and ""POW"" during the batman-like fight scenes between the bad guys and the unbeatable Salander.The third book in the series, THE GIRL WHO KICKED THE HORNET’S NEST, is a continuation of the story in PLAYED WITH FIRE. HORNET’S NEST does not have a boring first half, and it is, indeed, better than the other two.In this book, Blomkvist is a tramp, taken to bed by, seemingly, every attractive female who comes along. This even as he organizes “The Knights of the Idiotic Table,” a group of all the people who want to see a good outcome for Salander. She’s in the hospital, miraculously still alive after being shot in the head. The police are guarding her room because they think she is a murderer. When she recovers, she goes to jail.But “the knights” are investigating a small group within the Swedish police who they suspect are corrupt. When they get to the bottom of this, Salander will be free. Of course, Salander helps by illegally hacking into the computers of any high-level official. And she does so from her guarded hospital room.In the meantime one of Bloomkvist’s love (read “sex”) interests, Erica, has an ordeal of her own going on. Not surprisingly, Salander helps her, too, as she illegally hacks into the computers of newspaper reporters and managers, again, from her guarded hospital room.Of the three books in the series, THE GIRL WHO KICKED THE HORNET’S NEST is the best. But the series as a whole does not deserve all the attention it is getting. Classics, the kind of books everyone remembers years later, the books I’m proud to have in my bookcase, deserve this.The Millennium Series is up there with former bestsellers like PEYTON PLACE and THE STEPFORD WIVES, the kind of books that get attention for a while.

24,136657158,12/26/2010,4.0,"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo read quickly and really liked it! Some reviewers have critcized the amount of backstory provided at the beginning of this book, but I thought it was all relevant and ultimately added to the whole story. This book was a good introduction to those who would become the central characters of the series. The Girl Who Played with Fire was a little slower getting started. Of the three titles this was the one I liked the least. It is important for character development and further information about Lisbeth Salander, who becomes the focus of books 2 and 3. We learn where Salander's self-sufficiency originates and more fully understand many of her attitudes. The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest continues the focus on Salander as her supporters prepare for her trial. It seemed odd that a person lying in hospital could still play such a strong and central role in the story. I very much enjoyed this trilogy and am very sad that Larsson's death leaves us with only these three volumes, at least so far, with only a glimmer of hope that a possible fourth title may appear one day. I appreciated his sensitivity and development of Salander's character. It was nice to read books with strong female characters in central and active roles. It was also uplifting to see them defeat those who were trying to victimize them. An important aspect of Salander's character, pointed out by many, is her refusal to accept the traditional role of victim. It was as if she drew strength from being victimized and ""took on the world,"" so to speak, to reject that characterization both of herself and in the view of others. The large number of characters, while a bit daunting to handle at the outset, does make the story lines in books 2 & 3 seem more realistic. No murder investigation is carried out or resolved by the efforts of a single person, as some murder mysteries would have us believe. This is a series of books that really needs to be read together in publication order to be best appreciated. The inclusion of the short book On Stieg Larsson was a bonus in helping to gain further insight into Larsson from the perspectives of his editor and friends. Most poignant were the email references to ""we have plenty of time"" to address this or that and the only deadlines dealt strictly with publication schedules. This serves to remind us how fleeting life can be.

32,951774466,05/29/2014,5.0,"This was the third time I read the Millenium trilogy. I was traveling, had my Kindle, lots of airport and flying time, there were the books. I was hooked. Midway through the last of the books, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet’s Nest, I sat with my niece, whose work involves counseling abused women and advocating for them. It’s stressful work. Given that these books deal with the very issues she addresses each day, I asked whether she’d read them. She thought she may have read the first (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo), but she hadn’t read the other two books. She thinks she saw the movies. I expressed my enthusiasm for the books. She said that in her circles, the books have generated “controversy.” The books’ graphic images of violence towards women—in many forms—make the books suspect. Ditto for the movies. Maybe more so for the movies, which, after all, profit from explicit images. I argued the merits of the books, which include 1. identifying the problems; 2. arguing on behalf of abused women and against the men who either perpetrate the abuse or enable it; and 3. educating the public about the problem. She wasn’t convinced. I doubled down to finish the trilogy. My reading confirmed, for me, that far from marketing in graphic, pornographic scenes of men brutalizing women, the books are largely about the undercover work of journalists and private investigators driven to expose the salacious elements of society, however seemly their exteriors. The books were written by a feminist (Stieg Larsson), whose career in journalism consisted of outing criminals camouflaged in official and officious titles and settings. Like his protagonist, Mikael Blomkvist, Larsson was a meticulous and indefatigable investigator. In print, he battled neo-nazis and hate groups of many sorts. He was merciless toward men who abused women. The books are propelled by plot. The plot is gripping. The central figure, Lizbeth Salander, is inspiring, even though she is anti-social, unaccepting of social morés, and unresponsive to almost everyone. She has cause. She also has brains and a photographic memory. She is a computer hacker of the first order. She is thin (without being anorexic), which happens to conform to modern tastes. There is much to admire in this character, even though she might well spit in our faces, if we tried to befriend her. Once we understand the history that so twisted her, the degree of torment she has suffered, we sympathize. It is also no small matter that she and the male protagonist, Mikael Blomkvist, become friends. He draws people, including us, the readers, into his sphere. We identify with him. If he falls for Salander, so do we. The books are no literary paragons. It is amusing to see how often Larsson has his characters making coffee, ordering coffee, drinking coffee. Ditto for sandwiches. In the last few days, immersed as I’ve been in the books, I’ve eaten more sandwiches than I did in the last three months. Likewise, it is amusing to see that the journalist Blomkvist, who is based on the author himself, is slightly overweight (as was Larsson) yet irresistible to women. He is a tender and considerate friend and lover. He is the polar opposite of the greedy types who, in bed, banks, and titles, seek to profit only themselves. Among the surprises this time, for me, was my reaction to seeing the name Dr. Anders Jonasson. The doctor’s name was originally Dr. Anders Jakobsson, a tribute to Larsson's friend. But Larsson’s father, who had an altercation with this doctor, changed the name before the book was published. That Larsson’s father and brother “inherited” the author’s estate is scandalous. By rights, the estate should have gone to Larsson's 30+ year life partner, Eva Gabrielsson. As far as I understand, the father and brother were estranged from Stieg Larsson. Yet they inherited his posthumous fortune. This is strange. One would think that in Sweden, common law marriage would hold sway. Not so.It is said that the real-life Dr. Jakobsson told the senior Larsson that the literary estate and the fortune that followed should have gone to Gabrielsson. Larsson counter-attacked by changing the doctor's name in the book. Blech. It all makes me wonder whether the evil at the heart of the book, Alexander Zalachenko, is based, however obliquely, on Larsson’s own father!In any case, thanks to my kids, Josh & Lisa, for getting me the Kindle. It made for exciting waits in airports and quick two and three hour flights. I could never have fit all 3 hard-copy books in my backpack. Nor would I have thought to return to these books just now.

33,122857094,09/22/2010,3.0,"""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" is about the efforts by a journalist, Mikael Blomkvist, to solve a decades' old missing person case, which result in uncovering the trail of a sadistic serial murderer; about Blomkvist's efforts to expose, via his magazine, the dealings of a corrupt Swedish business tycoon; about the illegal activities of Lisbeth Salander (an extremely high-functioning autistic savant), both on her own behalf and in her attempt to assist Blomkvist; and about sexual promiscuity and excessive coffee consumption. The bottom line is this: It's a far better book than YOU could ever write, but not nearly as good as the very worst of Updike or Nabokov or Heller.""The Girl Who Played With Fire"" is about the extensive but inept efforts of the Swedish police to capture the perpetrator of a triple murder; about the efforts of Lisbeth Salander, who is falsely accused of those murders, to elude the police, while also eluding the real murderer; about Mikael Blomkvist's efforts to prove Lisbeth's innocence; about Lisbeth's hunt to find and kill her gangster father for a multitude of crimes that have impacted her life; and about sexual promiscuity and excessive coffee consumption. The bottom line is this: It's a far better book than YOU could ever write, but not nearly as good as the very worst of Hammett or Chandler, or Ross Macdonald.""The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest"" is about Lisbeth Salander's long recovery from injuries sustained during her failed effort to kill her father; about the path to her eventual triumph in court while on trial for lesser charges; about her various criminal activities, including the ""elimination"" of some of her adversaries; about the efforts by Blomkvist, and others, to expose the activities of a top-secret ""Section"" hidden inside Sweden's national Security Police; and about sexual promiscuity and excessive coffee consumption. The bottom line is this: It's a bit unsettling to read this trilogy which absolutely DRIPS with a bizarre version of ultra feminism-- ironically written by a male writer who can't quite resist including numerous, extensively detailed accounts of extreme violence against women, and whose alter ego in the story, Blomkvist, has an effect on most women similar to that of James Bond-- only to ultimately realize that ""equality between the sexes,"" in this author's mind, merely means that it's implicitly ""OK"" when a woman dishes out similar examples of cruelty and death, if done in the guise of vigilantism.",0,-0.9984,0.226,0.731,0.043,0.6435606060606059,POSITIVE,0.9582
34,3311750402,05/01/2020,4.0,"The books are exactly what one requires as a travelling companion – large, engrossing and easy to read.Those already familiar with the three books will already be aware that calling them a ‘trilogy’ is not entirely accurate.  Though all three contain many of the same characters, the first is very much a stand-alone story, while the third book is a continuation of the story that began with the second.REPORT THIS ADI would have thought that those already familiar with the series will probably share my view that the first novel – The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo – is comfortably the best of the series. However, after a little bit of online scouring, I am surprised to see that many reviewers put all three novels on equal footing, if not placing the latter two even higher. I maintain the first novel is the best crafted, the best thought-through, the least flawed and the best paced – building to a tense and thrilling conclusion.The second novel – The Girl Who Played with Fire – is certainly more action-packed, more hardcore but perhaps more flawed. But I will come to that later.The third novel – The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets’ Nest – is the weakest of the three. It essentially just wraps up the story from the second novel. It lacks conciseness as the relatively simple plot is drawn out by, for example, providing back-stories to various new characters. It is page-filling disguised as character development. To Larsson’s credit though, he includes enough plot-turns and keeps enough possible endings open to keep us interested. But the real reason we keep turning pages is because of the strength of the first two novels and our desire to see them satisfactorily concluded.What annoyed me most in the third novel was the scene in court. There is such a thing as being a bad winner, even in fiction. The gloating came off as sanctimonious and was a turn-off. The personal asides also detracted from any sense of reality in the scene.Larsson sometimes had to make the characters behave inconsistently or illogically in order for the plot to develop in the direction he needs it to.All three novels suffer the shortcomings familiar to pop-fiction; the story is heavy on plot and light on the other elements that distinguish literature from pop-fiction. The characterisation is a little formulaic, it feels like it was developed on a spread-sheet or pulled from some dummies guide to writing a best-seller. The plot may have actually been helped by being written on a spread-sheet, if that would have helped iron out the flaws. The style is very matter-of-fact; spelling things out to a reader whose intelligence the writer does not respect. There is no thought to creating setting and mood.While perusing other reviews I could not help but notice that many fans seem to give the series high regards due to it’s anti-misogynistic themes and celebrate a female protagonist who meets violence with violence as the world of the novels (if not the real world) offers her no alternative she can trust. As noble and notable as these elements may be, they do not excuse the deficiencies of the writing in my mind, nor do they tempt me to elevate the books in my regard.Crime is one of the largest, if not the largest, genre of popular fiction today, but admittedly I have not participated in the interest. So I am not sure if the main issue I take with the series is a common failing in the genre or not.What I mean by this is that there were many times I found the actions of characters did not make sense; either they were not in keeping with the character or there were alternative paths that were more logical. But reading on, you find that these seemingly illogical actions set up what occurs next. In other words, the author sometimes had to make the characters behave inconsistently or illogically in order for the plot to develop in the direction he needs it to. The inconsistencies are plot devices.These instances were mostly minor and more prevalent in the second and third novels; as I say, the first novel seems to me to be the best crafted and thought-through. Again, I can’t say I have read enough crime fiction to decide if this issue is specific to Larsson or if it is a common obstacle in crime fiction. Works that avoid this issue by being more consistent in character and deed should be considered superior to ones that do not.Most of these instances did not necessarily detract from the entertainment value of the books, but perhaps the skill of the author goes down in ones estimation. But there were some larger instances in the series.In Millennium I – surely the first thing Blomkvist would have asked Vanger, when the latter promised him information on Wennerstrom, would have been how old the information was and therefore whether the statute of limitations has lapsed? But Larsson needs a reason for Blomkvist to stay so the question is not asked until the end of the book.In Millennium II – surely basic forensics (blood spatter, angle of entry, etc) would have quickly established that the shooter was much taller than the diminutive Salander? But Larsson needs Salander to stay on the run and in hiding.In Millennium III – it seems bizarre that a victim of an attempted murder and the suspected murderer are both given rooms in the same hospital corridor without armed guards. If their conditions were not so severe and the crime scene not so remote, you would not even place them in the same hospital and Salander would have most likely been placed in a police hospital. But Larsson needs it to be so, so that he can make what follows occur.Lisbeth Salander comes across as a collection of clichés stapled together from a world Larsson does not know much about.Moving on, there is something that bugs me about Lisbeth Salander. The compliment most often repeated about Larsson’s character is how innovative she is. That bugged me, although admittedly I cannot think of any other character to compare her to in specific terms. So I don’t think my issue is necessarily that Larsson’s creation lacks innovation.It is not necessarily that I find her hard to believe either. While I am not an expert on the technicalities of her deeds in the novels it would not surprise if they were possible. Nor would it surprise me if there were real Lisbeth Salander’s out there. So it is not that either.It is more that I do not feel that Larsson made her believable. No one in the novels really knows or understands Salander; not her lovers, not her fellow hackers and certainly not Blomkvist. However, I sensed from the books that Larsson does not really know her either. It was a difficult line for Larsson; he wants Lisbeth to remain mysterious and unpredictable but he failed to make her knowable to the reader; he wants her to be a loner and thus the reader also does not know her world either. Instead her persona comes across as a collection of clichés stapled together from a world Larsson does not know much about.The real tragedy though is the untimely death of Larsson that deprived the world of one of it’s most popular writers, whose fans would have hoped for more output from and whose craft they may hoped to see become more refined.",0,-0.3354,0.097,0.798,0.104,0.4293989641311071,NEGATIVE,0.9787

I happened to read it partly while living in Sweden, which was a nice bonus, since I could actually walk down the streets and visit the places Stieg Larsson actually uses throughout the stories.The primary reason that these books are worth reading, are:1. The series is gritty and dark. 2. The characters are complex and interesting. (Two examples are the criminal Ronald Neidermann who is a hulking assassinn who cannot feel pain, but happens to be scared of the dark, and Liesbeth Salander, an extreme introvert who is hostile to nearly everyone to the point of being unlikeable, a trained boxer, with a photgraphic memory/computer wiz.)3.

72,406108886,09/02/2012,5.0,"A Charming Journalist, Corrupt Corporations and Lisbeth Salander (The Millennium Series)Okay, so by now I'm sure that everyone has heard of the phenomenon that is ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"". The new film has recently been released and there have been multiple discussions about the series. So, the series contains three books; ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo""; ""The Girl Who Played with Fire"" and ""The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest"". They were written by Swedish author Stieg Larsson and were released in 2004. Unfortunately, Larsson never got to see what a huge success his books became, as he passed away in 2004 at age 50 of a heart attack.It should be noted as well, that the Swedish title for ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is translated as ""Men Who Hate Women"". Sure it's less prose-like, but it fits the series better in my opinion. Although, I do have to agree that the English title is just a better hook. Though, my problem with it is,1. It is not the original title (but fair enough) and2. The dragon tattoo is never explained and is in fact not a core part in the books. It's just a tattoo that Lisbeth has. We never find out when she got it, whether it represents anything or anything about it at all. All we know is that it hurt to get and is on her back/ shoulder blade. But hey, it makes for good cinematography.Now, this is just a little side note, but I absolutely love this version of the cover art. All the details in it are amazing. For those who own these books, have you noticed that on the back covers at the top it says, ""Issue 1 (or whatever the book number is) Millennium Magazine""? Great little detail.Okay so some background on the books themselves. Well, they're predominately crime novels. The best of the best. In terms of what kind of crime novel they are? They're a mix of murder mystery and corporate and government scandal. Describing what the books are about is hard, as there are so many different story lines going on that it would take a while, but in the most pure terms of description then""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is about: (courtesy of the blurb)""The IndustrialistHenrik Vanger, head of the dynastic Vanger Corporation, is tormented by the loss of a child decades earlier and convinced that a member of his family has committed murder.The JournalistMikael Blomkvist delves deep into the Vangers' past to uncover the truth behind the unsolved mystery. But someone else wants the past to remain a secret and will go to any lengths to keep it that way.The Girl with the Dragon TattooLisbeth Salander, the enigmatic, delinquent and dangerous security specialist, assists in the investigation. A genius computer hacker, she tolerates no restrictions placed upon her by individuals, society or the law.""Okay, so I'm not going to put the blurbs for the other books up because they might contain spoilers, but onto the review.So, just a little bit about the flow of the books and the time frames that each of them are set in relation to one another. ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is the first and most unrelated to the others. It's more of an introduction to the characters and their relationships. Don't get me wrong, it's a great book in itself and is definitely going to keep you hooked and wanting to read the next two books, but the plot line isn't really carried on into the next books. Elements of the first book are brought into the next two, but only little things.However, I do think that the first book is the best in the series, just in terms of the ending. I'm not going to give it away to those who don't know, but I will say that the ending is amazing. Larsson has an incredible ability to be able to start with several seemingly unconnected threads, that he slowly brings together into one story. It's fascinating to watch as the connections are made. Some are ones I guessed were coming, but others were almost out of nowhere, and the ending definitely keeps you guessing till the end."" The Girl Who Played with Fire"" takes place a year after the end of the first book. So a large portion of it is catching up with our characters, as well as the introduction of new ones. This is the book where I would say the actual story begins. The first book is almost like a one-shot and the next two are where the mysteries start to get explained and we find out how many bad men there really are in the world. And in Larsson's books it is always men. He very much plays the women as victims, which may be a reason why he has so many powerful female characters in his books. To be fair, he was very much trying to prove a point, and it may be of interest that when he was 15, Larsson witnessed a gang-rape of a young woman, who interestingly enough was called Lisbeth.And finally, the last book in the trilogy is ""The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest"". It takes place right after the end of the second book, which ends on a cliffhanger. And of course, this is where we finally get our answers and discover the entire truth.Now onto the characters. I thought they were very well rounded and intriguing. And I made that all important connection with a lot of them, that makes you care about their fate and upsets you if they suffer or die. However, I didn't feel that with all of the characters. There are a LOT of them, and it would be hard to get us to care that much about each and every one. There are also a lot of deaths in these books, which are shocking, it's true, and I did feel bad that about some of the deaths- but that may have been partly down to how violent and brutal they are. I cannot think of a single death that wasn't. Well, except for one, but that was a long drawn out death that can't have been pleasant.Personally, Larsson did a great job at getting us to care about the pivotal characters, but more than that, he made us want them to care about each other. Not necessarily in a romantic sense, but there is a large amount of the story where the two main characters have no interaction at all, and I missed them playing off each other.I'd be interested to know whether Larsson himself was anything like Blomkvist. Larsson was a journalist himself (at a magazine called ""Expo"") and the magazine was in the same financial crisis as ""Millennium"". So, I'd like to know what other similarities they had, if any.I know that Lisbeth has been described as a unique character and indeed she is, at least in terms of any heroine I've read about or watched. She is a little hard to relate to, simple because her personality is on the extreme side, but for good reason. But I think what works best about the characters is that they are flawed. They are in no means perfect and are indubitably human. They are believable characters, which is definitely saying something in Lisbeth's case.I did, however, have a few criticisms. Like others have said, the books can be a bit slow moving and there are long pages of description about Sweden's past that can be a little confusing for those of us who don't know much about it. Now, I do think it works in this book, just because there is so much going on that it needs a lot of description, but it can feel like overwhelming. In one of the books, Lisbeth is in hospital and remains in the same bed for 500 pages. But, on another note, the last 100 pages of each book is always very fast-paced and will have you on the edge of your seat, unable to sleep until you reach the conclusion.Another criticism is that there are a lot of names- be it places or people- and it can be hard to remember them all, especially from the point of view of someone who has never been to Sweden and doesn't speak Swedish. But, even if they were all in my first language, I still think I'd have trouble remembering them all. And in each book more are added. You do get to know what the recurring characters names or place names are, but I found myself often confusing them, and thinking that it was a different character or place.My last one is Camilla. She is mentioned quite a few times, but never really explained. And in the end, we never really find out anything about her except that she is ""listed as living abroad"". I don't know if Larsson was perhaps planning to write another series or book about Camilla, but it would have been nice to learn more about her.But these criticisms are pretty small compared to all the ways I can compliment this series.Now the overall ending. I think it was very well written. I will say that (for the most part) we know how it's going to end on the whole. Maybe not what will happen with all the characters, but the main plot line is predictable- although Larsson pulls that off as a good thing. If it had ended any other way, the books would never have been as good as they are. The ending, afterall, is all about justice and there was really only one way to achieve that. And the way it's told is so satisfying. As the net is slowly tightened and the ""bad men"" start to realise what's going on. And if you're worried that not all the questions will be answered, fear not. All the loose strings are then explained and tied up with the rest.I do have one more thing to add. This is one of those series where having read the series really makes a difference to the way you view all the characters if you re-read it. Knowing everything about each individual and exactly what's going to happen brings a new light to it and you notice little things and hints that you missed the first time around. I know that's true of pretty much everything, but I think it's especially true for this series. Maybe because we know so little about our main character that, when the blanks are finally all filled in, she almost becomes a completely different person.I would absolutely recommend this book. I think it caters to a wide range of wants, and it can be enjoyed by people of all personalities, both men and women alike- which is hard to do. I will say that there should probably be an age restriction though, just because the content is not really suitable for younger readers and there is a lot of violence. Other than that, read these books. I was introduced to them by my cousin, read the first book and instantly went out to buy the series. You really can't not get hooked by it. And the books raise an interesting question. If you were in Lisbeth Salander's place, what would you do?",0,0.9989,0.077,0.794,0.13,0.4964893113422525,POSITIVE,0.9954

75,1997822584,09/08/2017,5.0,"PT 1 [POTENTIAL SPOILERS AHEAD - PROCEED WITH CAUTION OR PREPARE TO BE VERY ANGRY AT ME]The Millenium trilogy was recommended to me by a friend back in high school, but it wasn't until years later that I got around to checking it out for myself. I blazed through the trilogy and I've revisited it several times since then.But what captivated me wasn't merely the plot. It was the characters. More specifically, it was Lisbeth Salander.Lisbeth Salander was a woman who hated men who hate women. But underneath her tough exterior lies an infinitely more complex character. Mikael Blomkvist was a man enamored by women - specifically of the older variety - but his innate respect for women ran deeper than the sea. Waters uncharted. Erika Berger was an independent and intelligent woman with two lovers. No secrecy or shame in her game. And Holger Palmgren was the empathetic and doting father figure Salander rightfully deserved.This is the retribution of Lisbeth Salander's cumulative woes. Throughout her life, Lisbeth has been at the mercy of corruption - familial, social, and societal. Emotionally, physically, and sexually abused. She's been pegged a sociopath by some, an autist by others, and - in a few rare cases - she's been pawned off as insane. Plastered all over the internet you'll find articles attempting to decipher the mystery that is Lisbeth Salander, through the use of DSM diagnostic criteria, as if that even begins to decipher the hidden nature of her presumed ""insanity"". As if we can't find those answers written in the pages themselves. Treating her no different than she was treated in the novels.Lisbeth Salander was the survivor of a series of unfortunate events - from witnessing her father repeatedly abuse her mother - which rendered her irrevocably paralyzed - to losing the protection of her sole guardian due to a stroke which similarly paralyzed him, to being violently raped by her newly appointed guardian - all before and during the first novel. And that's only the tip of the iceberg. Here's where we find the seemingly incomprehensible rationale behind Lisbeth Salander's ""insane"" attitude and behavior.It's the attitude and behavior of a survivor. We can assign any which label we please to her presumed ""insanity"" as chicken-feed to the masses, but those labels are frivolous. It's only through understanding one's history that we can understand one's character, such as Lisbeth Salander.The Millenium trilogy not only aims to put Lisbeth Salander into perspective, it aims to do the same for anyone who has felt misunderstood or downtrodden in life. The misfits, renegades, and pariahs of society. That girl who was bullied for her round figure and temper tantrums. That guy who couldn't catch a break with the ladies so he turned elsewhere to find solace among like-minded individuals. As unique and as fictional Lisbeth Salander's tale may be - where she's renowned for being an edgy and socio-autistic cyberpunk hacker with tattoos and boxing gloves - everyone else we meet has an equally explanatory tale subtly driving them to speak or act in such a way that we may mistakenly deem ""insane"". And the misplaced labels only serve to further isolate us readers from the character of Lisbeth Salander, who - like us - was a human at the mercy of other humans. Not a victim, but a survivor. A reminder of our humanity.Or lack thereof.",0,-0.9926,0.141,0.778,0.08,0.5400138854855836,NEGATIVE,0.9111
76,843269401,02/03/2014,5.0,"This trilogy is probably the best one I’ve read. I’ve never encountered such plot with so many twists and such characters that I never thought would have etched in my heart.At first, I was blatantly ignoring the trilogy’s first book – “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo”. I found the title boring. I thought that maybe reading this would only waste my time. Even with the suggestions of some of my friends to at least watch the Hollywood movie, I just shrugged it off and didn’t even given a damn to watch the trailer.Not after a few months later did I start getting intrigued by this book when I saw it on a bookstore’s suggested reads. The bookstore was on sale, and I finally bought the book, but with a little bit of guilt. I don’t usually read books about espionage and crime. But I thought I’d give it a try.The first book of the trilogy, “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo” was originally entitled “Men Who Hate Women” in Swedish. I don’t know what made the editors, publishers, or marketers change the name but I think that the original title would have made more impact to the readers, and especially those looking for books. The first book serves as an introduction to the trilogy. A thriller, mystery, and crime that includes hatred against woman to the point it becomes misogynist - it starts off with a journalist and publisher of the Millenium magazine, Mikael Blomkvist, losing a libel case against the billionaire industrialist Hans-Erik Wennerström. Consequently, Blomkvist had to step down from the Millenium board. On the other hand, Dragan Armansky, director of the Milton Security, asked a mind blowing, intelligent but anti-social woman, Lisbeth Salander to get information about Blomkvist. Blomkvist was then called to the Milton Security to meet with Armansky – only to find out he was given a freelance job by Henrik Vanger. Blomkvist goes to Hedeby to meet Henrik. There, Henrik offers him a big amount of money in change for writing the Vanger history and solving the 40 year old case of his missing great niece, Harriet. From thereon, he is helped by Salander, and together, they solve the case that brings about horror.What I love about the first book is that once I started reading it, there’s no stopping. Every turn of page kept me craving for more. It gave me shivers down my spine with the mystery it encompasses. The way Stieg Larsson described his characters gave me solicitous feeling towards them. Though there were contrasting emotions and morbid scenes involved, I had no choice but to finish it right away and continue on to the next book.Although it seems as though the story from the first book already ended, the next book is just the real beginning. The second book “The Girl Who Played With Fire” is the start of Salander’s life. From solving a mystery case, the story gradually turns into government politics, sex abuse, and misuse of power. After the case was solved from the first book, Salander went abroad to relax then finally went back to Stockholm. Meanwhile, a journalist named Dag Svensson approached Blomkvist if he could work together with him on a book that would expose powerful names in the government who are involved in sex trafficking. Blomkvist agreed, got a copy of the draft, and continued with Svensson’s investigation on the names. Because Salander could hack Blomkvist’s computer, she read through Svensson’s work and was puzzled by the name she saw -- “Zala”. Unfortunately, shortly before the printing of the book, Svensson, along with his wife, was shot in his apartment. Salander’s fingerprints were found and she was the center of attention of whole of Sweden – she was wanted. This led to the investigation of Salander’s dad, with an alias “Zala”, and how Salander was declared incompetent. On the last part of this book though, Salander went to his father’s place to deal with him. But due to certain circumstances, she got shot on the head – however, she survived and tried to kill her father using an axe.Just like with the first book, the second one also kept me awake at nights. However, there were parts that I got bored. Though I love his exceptional style, Stieg Larsson got a little bit meticulous with each of the character’s movement in this book. Unlike in the first one where there are only 2 POVs, one for Blomkvist and one for Salander, here, Larsson makes you look at the bigger picture -- having more than 3 stories of characters that connect to only one plot. It was somehow hard for me to puzzle out the bits of scattered pieces throughout the story. And in which, because of this, I was forced to continue on to the last book.Originally named ""The Air Castle That Exploded"", “The Girl who Kicked the Hornet’s Nest” proved the rights of women. The third book only shows how Stieg Larsson tried to change the outlook of men towards women, only if he hadn’t died. Going back from the previous book, Blomkvist found Salander on her father’s place and he called for emergency. Salander, along with his father, was brought to a hospital. Obviously, what happened in her father’s place was reported to the police and this led to a new investigation now involving the deep, dark secrets of the Sweden’s section, a secret division of the Säpo (security police). This section happens to be involved with importing a political figure from Russia in order to get information and power. They spent billions of kronor (Swedish currency) just for this single figure. Meanwhile, because Salander was accused of many violations, she had to prepare for her trial. The police tried to resort to any way of taking out information from Salander, but then to no avail. Luckily, Blomkvist’s sister, Annika Giannini, happens to be a lawyer. Blomkvist suggested her to be Salander’s lawyer. With a slight hesitation, Salander agreed. Though it was hard to make out any knowledge out of Salander, Giannini succeeded in winning the trial and putting into jail those who were expected to be. Lisbeth Salander is a unique character that anyone would wish to exist. With the vast criticisms against her, she managed to make her way out of it – but of course not without the help of Blomkvist. She did not dwell in the abuse and torment she had gone through in her youth, but instead, seared her way to vengeance against the men who belittled her. Unlike many other main characters, Lisbeth doesn’t mess things up. She analyzes the problem and thinks of a way to solve it. She not only helps herself but also other people.If you are looking for a book that would give thrills, this is something I recommend. This isn’t like other books which has fillers. Every single part of it is important. You can’t miss a single information. I assure you this is a book you will not regret.",0,0.4694,0.095,0.808,0.097,0.4606565656565656,POSITIVE,0.5009
77,2476166200,07/30/2018,4.0,"In the first book of the trilogy, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, we are introduced to Lisbeth Salander when she helps disgraced journalist Mikael Blomkvist solve a decades-old missing persons case. Salander, a reclusive yet brilliant hacker, and Blomkvist form an unlikely alliance. When Salander is on the run from police, accused of murder, Blomkvist helps her prove her innocence and bring down the government institution that tried to destroy her life.Salander is, hands-down, the most unique and compelling heroine I've read in decades. She's a strong, intelligent woman who operates by her own internal moral code.The complexity of the plot is awe-inspiring. Several different stories are happening all at once, and Larson not only never drops a thread, he manages to tie them all up together.I know nothing about Swedish politics or history, and there were times I felt like I was missing something. Not anything that would affect my understanding of the story, but there were many references that were unfamiliar to me. There is considerable information about the Swedish legal structure included in the narrative, and the edition I have contains footnotes, which is helpful. I also found it helpful to read the book on a tablet (as opposed to a dedicated e-reader) so I could open a browser and search for names and events. I also suspect those steeped in Astrid Lindgren's children stories would recognize many hidden Easter eggs.

Her story was not really entertaining, its filled with pain, hatred and a lot more that most people can muster.

It reminded me of the French history parts of Les Miserables that were painful to get through.)Other things that caught my attention were:-The author does better than most male authors at describing and empowering women. I'm curious to read more Swedish novels now to see if that's a cultural thing or just a Stieg Larsson thing.-I like that the characters get to sleep a lot. Most fiction seems to leave out basic human needs, but he prioritizes sleep like I do. ;)-I always think it's ridiculous how every person in novels has a libido through the roof. No exception with these books.

There are many mysteries to be sovled, many characters -some appealing, some interesting, some good and some bad, a few sketchily presented and rather underused. There are constantly unexpected developments and surprises butalso clues that help the attentive reader to anticipate. The plot and characters are generally believable, with few exceptions: the shooting of Lisbeth in the head and her subsequent miraculous recovery; the Blomkvist character and his automatic appeal to women; and above all the happy ending with all baddies duly punished and the goodies rewared or justified.

81,369496744,07/15/2012,5.0,"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The Girl who Played with Fire, and The Girl who Kicked the Hornets Nest all make-up the trilogy that is deemed ""The Millennium Series"" by Steig Larsson. I've read all three books and I've seen the first film based on The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. It has taken me quite some time to sit down and write this review for two reasons: 1) I wanted to write it on the entire trilogy, although now I'm not sure why I wanted to do that and 2) I find it difficult to actually put in words the genius of the stories Steig Larsson wrote. Yes, genius.Nowhere in literature have I met a character I enjoyed reading about as much as I enjoyed Lisbeth Salander, the protagonist and awesome kick-ass main character of the Millennium series. I want to be her, not all of her because let's face it, she's down-right crazy sometimes, but I find myself drawn to her character in a connective way; I want her to be real and alive and hacking into computers for me because I'm important enough for her to care about. The depth of feeling and emotion with which Steig Larsson portrays her is truly amazing. You love her, you hate her, you feel apathy, empathy, and sympathy for her sometimes on the same page. You definitely don't want to piss her off. There's a part of me that's wants to have that kind of power, I think everyone does (don't lie to yourself!), and living it through a book character is the closest most of us will ever come.The main champion of Lisbeth is Mikael Blomkvist (who she often views as the antagonist, but he's not), a brilliant journalist. He finds himself in situation after situation above and beyond the scope of mundane news, and at the center of each tryst is Lisbeth Salander. She is either the hero or the victim, depending on which book you read. I openly admit to having a literary crush on Mikael Blomkvist. And it surely didn't hurt when they cast Daniel Craig in the role for the film.The books read very technically. However, Steig Larsson was a technical writer for a magazine in Sweden, where most of the books take place, called EXPO. He wrote this series because at 15 years old, he witnessed a gang-rape of a girl he knew named Lisbeth and spent most of his life haunted by guilt because he did nothing to save her. This book pays homage to this girl, and this is evident by the strength he gives Lisbeth throughout the novels. She is also a victim of rape. But again, do not piss this girl off - there will be absolute hell to pay.In book one, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, we meet Lisbeth and Mikael. Mikael is in trouble over a libel lawsuit and is found guilty. In order to escape his life, he takes an assignment abroad for the Vanger family to write a memoir, but everything is not as it seems. Henry Vanger has really hired him because of his astute ability to uncover details others miss and he wants to solve a cold-case murder. This is where Lisbeth enters the story - she becomes his researcher, because she is the best. But, there are strings to cut in getting her help. First off, she is under government sanctioned legal guardianship because she's been declared mentally incompetent and dangerous. Her guardian, Holger Palmgren, suffers from a stroke and unfortunately Lisbeth's care is entrusted to a real prick, Nils Bjurman. But don't worry - she takes good care of him. Through a series of twists and turns, Lisbeth and Mikael form an unbreakable bond, at least for Lisbeth who for the first time in a long time, allows herself to become close to a man. Sadly, Mikael is a bit of ladies man and her heart is shattered.In book two, The Girl who Played with Fire, we learn more about Lisbeth's life before she met Mikael Blomkvist. The book opens with a disturbing kidnapping scene from Lisbeth's perspective and through her eyes we see visions of her throwing a milk carton of gasoline into a car and setting it on fire. This plays over and over in her mind. While she is financially stable and quite aloof now, thanks to some business in book one, she can't shake the revenge she feels necessary to take upon the man that ruined her life - her father. Blomkvist finds himself involved in another high profile case with two new friends, but when he finds them murdered in cold blood one night and the police list Lisbeth Salander as their prime suspect, their lives are intertwined again. It's always a life or death situation with these two, but then again, that's what keeps you turning page well into the night. It is Blomkvist's attention to the little things as a journalist that becomes key in saving Lisbeth Salander's life. But, it's only fair - she saved his life in book one.In the final book, The Girl who Kicked the Hornet's Nest, the reader is drawn in immediately to the slow and painful recovery of Lisbeth Salander. We begin in a hospital, where Lisbeth's life hangs in the balance and all I kept thinking as I was reading this book was ""Don't you dare kill this girl - don't you dare!"" I can't tell you if I'm angry at the author or not - you'll have to read and find out. However, I can say that in the final book, every person that has ever cared about the very difficult and troubled Lisbeth Salander comes out of the wood-works to try and save her, and to clear her name. It's a tribute to the value of respecting another human being and the ultimate fight for justice in a corrupt and cruel world. The plot is tricky and you really have to READ this book, little things make a big difference.This is not a series to read for the faint of heart or the lazy of mind. It takes a keen eye and interest in the characters and the story to continue on to each destination. This is a grown-up book, and people that lack life experience I believe will have difficulty following the story line. Larsson was somewhat criticized for his overly intricate plot, yet he did not live to hear these comments. He suffered a heart attack and died in 2004.

85,305493466,04/02/2012,4.0,"Trilogy Themes and How They Relate to Our Society. (Spoilers)First off, I want to mention that I ordered the trilogy kindle pack, so my impression of this series is fluid from book to book. You’ll notice in my examples that they are taken from all three books, not just the first one.There are a number of themes running throughout this series. The original title to this book was ""Men Who Hate Women."" Indeed, the author does a very good job of acknowledging the varying degrees of misogyny that are pervasive throughout our society. The most obvious example, of course, is the rape scene. The more subtle examples are the ways in which many men react to women of power. Some examples would be the interactions between Faste and Modir, or between Berger and Holm. It's a very cynical view, but not altogether inaccurate.Having made that point, it may be counter-intuitive for some to recognize that Larssen also acknowledges that women can be equal sexually. One of the things I found refreshing in this book is how the author treated sex. I'm not talking about the instances where it was a tool or a weapon. I'm referring to the situation between Berger and Blomquist, or any of the other women he ends up getting with. He acknowledges them as sexual equals with their own needs and desires, and trusts that they are adult enough to handle the situation in a way that is right for them. These women are sexually liberated in the best sense.Larsson also addresses capitalism and it's role in our society. There are a couple of instances that I want to note in particular. After the Wennerstrom affair has been revealed, the Stockholm Stock Exchange was in freefall. Blomqvist was being interviewed and asked what the Millenium's responsibility was in regards to the fact Sweden's economy was going to crash. Blomqvist makes a point of distinguishing the difference between the economy and the stock market. ""The Swedish economy is the sum of all the goods and services that are produced in this country every day."" He goes on to give examples of Ericsson telephones, Volvos, shipments, etc. and says that they are just as strong or weak as before the big news hit. Coming from America, I saw huge parallels between this and America's relationship between the economy and the stock market.Our society has gotten to the point where it values the investment into things more than the things themselves. That's how an investment banker can make a boatload of money, but the guy working 40hours is barely scraping by. The value of work, in the purest sense of the form, has decreased. What Blomqvist does in this interview is call the speculators out on their game. He calls them fantasies in which people from one hour to the next decide that this or that company is worth so many billions; which, in the end doesn't have anything to do with the reality and true value of the product.There is another example in the series that talks about stock ownership and the responsibilities of a company. Berger has become the editor for SMP and is facing down a board that is wanting to make drastic cuts to the budget. She is already in a position where she doesn't have enough reporters to do the job and knows that if she cuts any more of the staff, the newspaper will fail. However, the board of directors have recently given themselves HUGE bonuses and pay raises, and they claim these cuts are necessary to improve their value of the stock for their shareholders. Berger says, ""Ownership implies responsibility. As you yourself pointed out, capitalism is what matters here. SMP's owners want to make a profit. But it's the market that decides whether you make a profit or take a loss. By your reasoning, you want the rules of capitalism to apply solely to the employees of SMP, while you and the stockholders would be exempt.""Man, does this sound familiar, or what? How many CEO's received millions of dollars in bonuses while the company filed for bankruptcy in 2008-2009? How many CEO's ran a company into the ground and then floated away on their golden parachute,only to land into another CEO position at another company? I really appreciated the message that Berger was relaying. True capitalism means you have a responsibility to make sure the company succeeds. It's about being BETTER than your competitors and being able to attract business from the market/ consumers. It's not about cannibalizing a company to the point that it starves to death.Another point that really spoke to me was how Blomqvist addressed the media. He said that journalists have a responsibility to report the truth and ferret out the facts, but more often than not, they just take the soundbite that's fed to them and pass it along. In essence, they've become bullhorns for bullshit. This has come about because it's the very companies that journalists are supposed to be reporting on that owns the their media company. Honest journalism can't occur when the journalists are working for the hand that feeds them. Again, it reminded me of the state of affairs here in the States. We have been experiencing a consolidation of media companies who are all owned under one umbrella. How can we have accurate journalism when the fox (news) is guarding the hen house?Overall, this trilogy was amazing. I loved Salander as a character. Her story is captivating. It's definitely a case where you're rooting for the under-dog and I appreciate how Larsson does a good job of tying up all the loose ends. However, more than the main storyline, I really enjoyed the subtext and broader themes that Larsson tackles throughout the series. I found it particularly relevant considering the recent events in our global society.",0,0.9983,0.044,0.827,0.129,0.52934842141985,POSITIVE,0.981

208,110193631,07/05/2010,4.0,"*** Very mild spoilers ahead ***I saw the movie first and then, realizing finally that there was actually an interesting plot, I had to get my hands on the book. And like so many others, I literally could not put the books down, reading whenever I had a spare moment, and sometimes even when I did not. The first two books seemed to me more fast paced and more gripping, while the third book's pace slowed and was bogged down by less riveting material.Larsson was not a great writer, but he is certainly a great story-teller, and his characters, especially Lisbeth, are multi-faceted, engaging and believable. He does not write exceptionally intricate plots, but the plots in the trilogy are nonetheless thrilling and entertaining.The first book concentrates more on a mystery involving a murdered girl, whose body was never found, and the relationship between the two main characters, Lisbeth, the brilliant young hacker who probably has Asperger's, and Mikael, the investigative journalist behind the (fictional) Swedish magazine Millennium. Very little is told in the first book about Lisbeth, but much is alluded to. More concentration is put into the mystery, which is at times clunky and inexplicable (such as why a murderer who has done such a good job at hiding himself for so many years would decide to leave a ""calling card"" on the door step of the investigator who is getting close to solving the mystery. Now he know that you know he is close, and he knows that you must be nearby, and when you're on a frickin island, that kind of narrows things down a bit.) The movie, strangely enough, does a much better job at trimming down the details and fashioning it into a tighter and faster plot.The second book starts with another expose by Millennium, but one that is inexplicably tied to Lisbeth, who has now broken contact with Mikael and fled the country. After a series of murders, one of which is easily tied to her, she is accused of all the murders. Mikael quickly comes to her defense and does what he does best - investigates the mystery, which only gets him into the heart of Lisbeth's life story. She, meanwhile, is doing her own research into the matter. Their paths cross again, albeit briefly and at the very end.The third book feels more like the continuation of the second, for instead of presenting a new mystery, it continues to focus on Lisbeth's story. This time she is awaiting trial for murder. Most of this book is bogged down with dull details of trying to prove all the things learned in the second book and then presenting them yet again at the trial, which consequently lacks much emotional punch since it really can add little to the tale.Larsson sadly died after delivering these three books to his publisher. Had he the benefit of time and an editor, I think these three books, and probably the supposed 7 others he had planned for the series, would have been spectacular. Instead, they tend to repetition and insignificant details (he is especially focused on when characters go to sleep and when they wake, and how much sleep they had, and exactly what kind of crap food they scarfed down when awake.) The American titles take away from the main theme he was going towards, which is much more accessible when one learns the less stylistic Swedish title of the first book - Men Who Hate Women. All three books deal with this - from murder to rape to domestic abuse to prostitution and so on. To counter this, his heroes and heroines all share similar noble qualities. The good men are all caring and sensitive to the women in their lives, even if they have faults that might unintentionally hurt the women in their lives (Mikael's biggest downfall is that he is ridiculously attractive and women are always breaking down his door to sleep with him - which he readily succumbs to). The women on the other hand are all either strong, smart, or a combination of the two, and if they're not, well, then they're probably the victims. There is very little middle ground - the good characters are good, the bad are bad - and this lends an allegoric feel to his books, coupled with the strong themes of men who hate women. For all their weaknesses, I wholeheartedly recommend them, but with a disclaimer for those who are sensitive to violence, specifically to violence against women. Details are not spared and Larsson's ability to bring the written word to life is definitely true even at the most graphic parts of the books.

209,1274215163,05/07/2015,4.0,"Authors who are only published posthumously rarely get the attention they deserve', or any attention at all. Fortunately, such is not the case with the late Stieg Larsson's bestselling Millennium trilogy -- it starts off slow, and soon winds itself into a tight knot of tautly-written thriller and mystery elements. It's raw, bleak, intensely disturbing noir.In ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo,"" take-no-prisoners journalist Mikael Blomkvist has just lost his reputation, his savings and his freedom (hello, jail sentence!) after a nasty libel suit from an executive named Wennerström.Then he's unexpectedly contacted by aged industrialist Henrik Vanger, to discover what happened to the guy's grandniece. He's offering evidence on Wennerström, so Mikael has no choice but to accept -- and as he investigates the sinister Vanger family, he joins forces with Lisbeth Salander, an eccentric, abused computer hacker. And as Mikael unearths the clues to Harriet's disappearance, he also finds some skeletons long kept buried.""The Girl Who Played With Fire"" finds Mikael investigating sex trafficking in his own country, and young girls who are sold into it. Unknown to him, Lisbeth is keeping very close tabs on his work -- especially since she was abused as a child, and now plots revenge on the sex traffickers. But when she's accused of murder and ends up on the run, Mikael must discover what lies at the core of these crimes...""The Girl Who Kicked The Hornets' Nest"" takes place directly after the second book. Lisbeth has been shot in the head, her malevolent dad Zalachenko is in the same hospital, and some nasty government forces want her locked away, as she was as a child. Her only hope lies in Mikael, who must unravel a government conspiracy formed around the young hacker...Finally, ""On Stieg Larsson"" is a solid accompaniment to this trilogy -- it's a nonfiction book that compiles four essays about him along with his email exchanges with his editor. Reading his own viewpoints on his characters and books really shines a spotlight on different facets of their stories, and why he wrote them the way he did.Larsson's books are a unique blend of old and new -- he takes the usual mystery/thriller tropes (locked room mystery, government conspiracies) and enfolds it in a ruthless, blistering look at modern Swedish society and sexual aggression. It's a dark, dangerous, unfair world where the truth is quashed, powerful forces conspire against individuals, and women are treated horribly -- usually shown via the eccentric, punky ""girl with the dragon tattoo.""His prose is rather bleak and often quite gritty, and a certain brand of understated passion shines through -- the kind that feels the need to express itself even though it takes place in fiction. And while most of the first book focuses in Mikael, in the second and third Larssen's style splits in half -- one half is the more staid, ordinary perspective of Mikael and others, and the other half is the wild nihilism of Lisbeth (""If death was the black emptiness from which she had just woken up, then death was nothing to worry about. She would hardly notice the difference"").Mikael and Salander make an intriguing odd couple. He starts world-weary and demoralized that he seems to care about nothing, but regains his passion for the truth; the only downside is that he's a bit Marty Stuish, since all women seem to adore him. And Salander is a mass of hurts and quirks -- she's a vibrant, wild genius who lashes out at those who hurt women, and has been constantly tortured by those around her since childhood (even as an adult, she's forced to have a legal guardian).Take your average thriller/mysteries, smother them in disillusioned, morally-bankrupt noir... and you'll have something like the Millennium Trilogy.

212,1871028475,01/08/2017,5.0,"In fact this time it was not one but three books; known as the millenium trilogy I resisted reading these books for one reason only; everybody else was reading them and raving about them. Usually to me that is a declaration of a book as not readable and junk. I submit the Da Vinci Code as evidence. What a terrible book with the most stupid ending ever that was. My conclusions when I finally gave in and read it. I am happy to report that in the case of this trilogy the whole world was right. They are fantastic.I have something of a thing about Nordic crime books. When I grew up the Sjowall and Wahloo Martin Beck books had been converted to radio drama and I listened to them late at nigh falling asleep to them. I liked the down to earth, the gruff, the fact that the detectives are real people, not glammed up, bombastic slippery, gun happy eels you often find in this genre. The people feel real, the people have faults, bad habits and even the heroes are prone to make bad decisions on occasion. The have a scratch and a dent here and there. The Milenium trilogy has that gruff and sense of reality. Nothing is obvious from the start. Yet is at the same time clearly laid out for the reader. The outcome is not a surprise, but makes sense. It is kinda handy to have a basic knowledge of Swedish society, geography, politics, and position within Europe but not a requirement. It does help to understand some background and the people better and also knowing the Pippi books is beneficial. Knowing Pippi adds depth to the story in a very funny way.The two main characters are a strange combination of people, but it works. There is a set of characters surrounding it that is constant but these two are the real centre pieces. Lisbeth slowly takes over the primary role from Mikael. Lisbeth is a strange creature, but the reason why becomes clear. I am quite taken with her survival instincts. The story unfolds in a way that seems too weird to be true, yet something rings as possible. No matter what it is fun to read though. It is clear that Stieg Larsson wrote the books in a way that allowed for a continuation of the series. Unfortunately he never will write another one, he died even before publication. There is a lot of controversy surrounding what happened after his death with regards to his GF and his inheritance. A shame really.Now do I want to see the movies? My first thought is ""oh yes"" followed by ""no way"". There are very few movies of books I liked that stood up to the books. You develop your own thoughts and faces with the people in the book. The surrounds in the book are yours, not the cinematographers. The reader becomes an intricate part of the lives of the characters and your own thought and experience are part of the the story and its interpretation.No matter what at least some of that is lost in a movie and why I almost always prefer the book.I'd want to see only the Swedish ones, not the American remake. The latter is primarily based experience of American remakes of movies and series. Quite frankly none of them ever lived up to the original IMO (three man and a baby, men behaving badly, what not to wear etc etc). I am not even going there therefore. I also have some opinions about the US casting that I do not find befitting with my thoughts on the books., so I am staying away from it.Since then I have seen the Swedish version Noomi Repace is a worthy Lisbeth - saw the American Trailer - glad I did not watch that one Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara just ain't cutting it IMO.",0,0.674,0.099,0.791,0.11,0.5655382395382395,POSITIVE,0.9471

The trilogy is an international sensation that will grab you and keep you “reading with eyes wide open” (San Francisco Chronicle). “[It] is intricately plotted, lavishly detailed but written with a breakneck pace and verve” (The Independent, U.K.), but “be warned: the trilogy is seriously addictive.” (The Guardian, U.K.).“Believe the hype . . .

And so will you.”—USA Today“Larsson has bottled lightning.”—Los Angeles TimesThe Girl with the Dragon TattooHarriet Vanger, a scion of one of Sweden’s wealthiest families disappeared without a trace more than forty years ago. All these years later, her aged uncle continues to try to discover what happened to her. He hires Mikael Blomkvist, a journalist recently sidelined by a libel conviction, to investigate. Blomkvist is aided by the pierced and tattooed computer prodigy Lisbeth Salander. Together they tap into a vein of unfathomable iniquity and astonishing corruption on their way to discovering the truth of Harriet Vanger’s fate.The Girl Who Played with FireMikael Blomkvist, now the crusading publisher of the magazine Millennium, has decided to run a story that will expose an extensive sex trafficking operation. On the eve of its publication, the two reporters responsible for the article are murdered, and the fingerprints found on the murder weapon belong to his friend Lisbeth Salander. Blomkvist, convinced of Salander’s innocence, plunges into an investigation of the murders. Meanwhile, Salander herself is drawn into a murderous game of cat and mouse, which forces her to face her dark past.The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet’s NestLisbeth Salander lies in critical condition, a bullet wound to her head, in the intensive care unit of a Swedish city hospital. She’s fighting for her life in more ways than one: if and when she recovers, she’ll be taken back to Stockholm to stand trial for three murders. With the help of Mikael Blomkvist, she will not only have to prove her innocence, but also identify and denounce those in authority who have allowed the vulnerable, like herself, to suffer abuse and violence. On her own, she will plot revenge—against the man who tried to kill her, and against the corrupt government institutions that very nearly destroyed her life.“Unique and fascinating . . .

216,953397117,05/31/2014,5.0,"3 books written by Stieg Larsson make up this trilogy The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, The Girl Who Played With Fire and The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet’s Nest. I think this is the first time I have seen the films first before reading the books then found the books far more satisfying. Nothing wrong with the films but the books had me on the edge from the first part of the story and of course the story carries over the 3 books. When it came to the last book all 746 pages of it I didn’t want to put the book down and seeing as I read most of it when going to bed it was often the early hours before I forced myself to put the bookmark in and get to sleep. The story is now a familiar one of the girl with extraordinary talents in the computer world but no social skills whatsoever. But this was because Lisbeth Salander had been abused one way or another for most of her life and most of her abusers were men and so she came to hate men who hated women. But she was also very good as a researcher which got her a job at Milton Security who’s boss, Dragan Armansky was one of the very few people whom actually like Lisbeth whom in return had some trust in him.When industrialist Henrik Vanger wanted someone to investigate the disappearance and possible murder of his brother’s granddaughter Harriet he chose a magazine reporter who had just lost a very costly libel action against one of Vanger’s adversaries for whom he had no love. The reporter was Mikael Blomkvist and before inviting him to visit he had Milton Security do a background check on Blomkvist and the person who did a very thorough job was Lisbeth Salander. So good was the report that when Blomkvist agreed to find Harriet he chose Salander as his helper which lead to the long association over 3 books. What started out as a mystery novel ended up being a kind of a spy novel by the end of the three books and whichever genre it is regarded as it’s still a cracking good story overall. Lots of detail and having never been to Sweden the location detail was lost on me but none the less it never distracted from the impact of the story. We follow the story from the disappearance of Harriet Vanger and the Nazi skeletons in the Vanger family to a ruthless gang of crooks who dealt with the supply of prostitutes that being girls of 16 years old brought from the Baltics with the promise of jobs and a better life only to end up selling their bodies against their wishes.Along the way Blomkvist and Salander become lovers then went their separate ways before a series of events brought them together again after Lisbeth was wanted for the murder or the attempted murder of 3 men. One of these men was a former Russian defector who also happened to be a member of this gang dealing with the 16 year old girls, many who were used by men in positions of power, something both Blomkvist and not least Salander wanted to expose especially after 2 reporters who were doing just that were murdered. A great set of books where you cannot just read the first one, it’s a must to read all three, you will not be disappointed.",0,0.2682,0.111,0.767,0.122,0.4876570048309178,POSITIVE,0.9901
217,1355364417,08/05/2015,5.0,"BOOK #1- The thriller/mystery/suspense is not a genre I read normally. However, after watching the international subtitled series, I had to read these books!Like others said, the book does start slow, but stick with this one because it does get good. Really good. Besides the slow beginning, I did get a bit lost in the Vanger family lineage cause there are way too many of them. But as the story goes along it gets easier to remember who is who. The last thing I didn't care for was the business & financial journalism. It is more boring than the beginning of this book.What I loved & makes this book so rich is the various little elements added to the main mystery of Harriett. There's the author trying to give you a sense of who Lisbeth is and what makes her this way. She's a very interesting & curious character. And as Blomkvist works on the Vanger family autobiography (were everyone is a suspect), the 1940's history and the lies to hide damaging family secrets keeps me going, ""Who done it?""There is extreme physical violence & sexual violence, but nothing that a reader of fantasy fighting or zombie killing couldn't handle. But it is definitely not a book for minors!The ending was satisfying & not what I expected either. I really liked it and have picked up the 2nd book in the trilogy right away! I'm excited what Stieg Larsson has in store for Lisbeth & Blomkvist for the remainder of the series!BOOK #2- Like the 1st book, this one starts out slow & boring discussing a lot about mathmatics. However, in my opinion this book was better than the 1st, which is rare. Stieg Larsson gives us a lot more about Lizbeth; her childhood, why her behavior is so bizarre & violent, & her moral code. The author picks up the loose ends left in The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo & delivers another journalist driven suspense thriller. These books are absolutely brilliant & I'm moving right into the 3rd one. My only other complaint is I notice more inconsistencies in the subtitled TV series than I did in the first one, but they're still really good too.BOOK #3- I loved this book! It was so rewarding to find those who deserve it to get their comeuppance. The main plot in this book, Lisbeth being a victim of the Swedish government, is what I felt The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,/i> was forshadowing too. The author does a great job of tying up all the loose ends, with the exception of Lisbeth's criminal hacker activities. I'm curious if this will get her in trouble futher on in her life?

220,149263117,02/19/2011,5.0,"Some spoilers from the previous two books may arise. I'll try to keep it basic. In any event, this book was fantastic. The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest is the final book in the Millennium ""Trilogy"" and it delivers solidly in every conceivable way. Following immediately after the events of TGWPWF, this book picks up with Lisbeth in the hospital from the resulting fallout of her previous actions. Mikael has his hands full with a typically idiot police officer. They both soon realize that things are about to get pretty crazy. The cause for all of this mess: Alexander Zalachenko. And at the root of that: Lisbeth Salander herself. A magnificent conspiracy is soon revealed, the beginnings of which we saw in the previous book. While there are many pieces of information that the reader is treated to throughout the book, much of Mikael and Lisbeth's endgame is kept a closely, and satisfyingly, guarded secret until the moment is right. Lisbeth is in a bit of trouble, and some pretty excellent people come to the rescue. There are some things which seem inconsistently unnecessary, like the lengthy sections about Berger and her issues, but it all comes together nicely in the end. Overall, Lisbeth is back and just as good as ever. Mikael is still in crusading journalist mode, this time his focus is more on Lisbeth though. The story never stopped being interesting and I was constantly compelled to keep reading and find out what would happen next. Now that this book is over, all I can say is this: I want more Lisbeth.  Final Judgement: Stieg Larsson's ""final"" book is excellent and well paced. After coming this far with Lisbeth and Mikael, the reader should feel immensely satisfied with the events that occur. Larsson has written an enduring story that many people will likely visit again and again.  On a side note:  It has come to my intention that Larsson was halfway through a fourth book before his untimely death, and that overall he intended to write ten complete books in the Millennium series. That said, I find it extremely unfortunate that he passed on before he could finish what would likely have been seven more extremely satisfying and engaging novels focused around one of my new favorite characters. Rumours of a fourth book being finished are currently waiting on a legal issue that may never be resolved. So, for the time being, it seems best to accept The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest as the final book and mourn the this is the true ending of our time with Lisbeth Salander.

It is quite slow in places but that I feel that it helps to immerse the reader in the investigation and the frustration the characters feel.The first book, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, is really a book within itself--probably why it was made into a movie--and only connects to the other two books through the characters.The second book is much more mysterious and Lisbeth Salander, ""the girl"", is absent after murders which the police believed to be her doing. I thought this was really well done by Larsson. I remember wondering what had really happened and built the suspense.The third book is definately the longest and the most drawn out. Although it seems to be needed because the story had to be summed up. There are some believable twists. Studying journalism, I found the way that Millenium magazine, the media and the relationship between journalists and police are well presented and so interesting. Reading about how much research that the police and Blomkvist did makes me feel inadequate and inspired at the same time. I really wish that there was a magazine like Millenium in Australia.Another thing I found interesting was that the main characters do not really draw sympathy from me at all. To be honest I found Blomkvist to be annoying and unreliable (not as a narrator, just as a person). He continually sleeps with random women and although that is part of his character, gets a little annoying. I mean, maybe its because I think of his as looking the way he does in the movie--not very attractive at all. Also Salander is so frustrating with her stubborness, but this is lessened when she directly tells the reader her thoughts and actions. Women in the novel are probably the most likable characters in the novel. The whole novel could definately viewed in an arguments about gender. I do understand this in a way because there is an investigation about sex trafficking.Anyway, I liked it.

One might take this to mean a boring opening but not so. Mounting anticipation creates a highly enjoyable sense of unspoken tension and a strong desire to keep reading. Then the book hits a turning point and everything starts to move faster and faster. There are ups and downs and plenty of turns. It gets dark too. There are many a moment in which the only response to events seems to be, ""Did that really just happen?"" Finally, after quite the trip, the pace slows as the story pulls into the station to wrap up the details. All in all a highly enjoyable read although certainly not for the faint of heart.

There is a similar layout to the plot events as well. What is more satisfying that the first book is that much is revealed of the girl's history. Consequently, there is much less focus on the journalist Blomkvist. The only disappointment was that about the biggest twist in the tale was evident about 150 pages before it was revealed, but all in all it was a superb read. As with the first, the options for sequels are nigh infinite.The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest:Once again Larsson's writing style favors a gradual build up followed by a sudden rush of events. However, in this case the action was much more drawn out. At times it read more like a James Bond novel than its predecessors but this wasn't wholly a bad thing. Unfortunately he never got around to finishing his work on the fourth book before he died and given the way the book ends and the way the ending is written might hint at being changed once it was evident no fourth book would ever be finished.

A confusion of how to explain the emotions attached to these books and this author. The story is certainly engaging -- suspenseful and gripping. Yet it is hard to praise the books unconditionally, for there is a definite aloofness of character, a peculiar awkwardness of construction. It's hard, of course, to know how much of this is due to the mediation of translators, rather than authorial intent, but even giving Larsson the benefit of the doubt, it is too consistent a problem to be easily brushed aside. I think someone pinpointed the problem for me recently, when she described it as a book that ""tells"" rather than ""shows."" As cliched as that description is (and I teach English, so believe me, I know), I think she's right. These are books that, while they layer on fact upon fact about the characters, rarely, if ever, show you the inside of their souls. Despite three books, and hundreds of pages, you never actually know these people, especially the heroine. Rather, you are held at arms' length, watching, but never fully understanding -- never participating. But while this was intended as a critique by the person who mentioned it to me, I'm not convinced that it's not exactly as it should be. After all, it is a story about knowledge -- its power and its limitations. All the characters in the books are, in their own ways, fact finders, and they use their knowledge as a weapon and a shield. They gather mountains of information about each other, yet that information is never quite enough to bridge the gaps between them. In fact, I'm hard pressed to think of a story in which the characters know each other less. Information does not equal true encounter, as both the content and the style of Larsson's books drive home. No matter how much we are told about the girl with the dragon tattoo, she remains an enigma, a mystery we'll never fully crack. But that, I think, may be the whole point.

226,309554522,04/09/2012,2.0,"The male bashing and Narcissism in this series are atrocious and abundant. Those are the main reasons I gave the series only 2 stars. I'll write more on this later in the review. I did enjoy the action and the characters, and the way Larsson splits the scenery and plots. The characters are weird, and that is always enjoyable to read. Lisbeth, the girl with the dragon tatoo, is very unsocial, and she has a strong sense of retribution and incredible hacking skills. Blomkvist, the protagonist, is a journalist, through whom Larsson, himself a journalist of similar specialties, was able to express Narcissism. Berger loves her bisexual husband and she has an ongoing affair with Blomkvist. There are usually 3 plots going on, and Larsson uses the technique of cutting up the action and scenery. For example, several pages will be about plot 1 in one part of Sweden or Stockholm. He will then start another section where the action takes place in another part of the city or country. This makes the book more interesting to read, but you have to keep reading in a timely manner, or you forget the details.The lack of editing is obvious. He uses Stockholm street names so abundantly, as if the reader should be totally familiar with those streets. The train of thought of many characters in several scenes is so logical and so presumptuous that it seems absurd that a human could arrive so easily at the correct conclusions. Larsson's Narcissism is obvious. The protagonist, like Larsson, is middle-aged and out of shape, yet he is found to be irresistably attractive by beautiful women. Despite the above issues, I would have given the trilogy 4 out of 5 stars because of the enjoyable aspects, like plot splitting. But I can give it only 2 stars because of the male bashing. Every man except the protagonist (Blomkvist) is either a buffoon who is incompetent at his job and who makes great mistakes, or he is a terrible, violent jerk, or he is a harmless senior.

228,115197725,08/04/2010,5.0,"For me, reading a good trilogy or series (Harry Potter, Sookie Stackhouse, Hunger Games, etc.) is more gratifying than reading a lonely, single book. Especially when you have to wait for the second, third, forth, SEVENTH book to come out because the anticipation and want have you appreciating each book more than you would have if the story would have been bound together in a single book. Plus it makes them easier to carry around. Can you imagine ONE HARRY BOOK?? Impossible to hold unless you are a kindle, ipad, etc. which I am not. The first book in The Millennium Trilogy, Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, was a bit slow at first due to too many characters and details but once I got to the middle I could not put it down. I would make up a stories about why I was busy at night but I was really spending my evenings with Lisbeth. For some reason the excuse, ""Sorry, I can't go to dinner tonight because I am reading"" isn't accepted by a lot of people but ""Sorry, I am hungover"" is??? Why is this??? Sorry, I digress. I finished the first book while I was in Asian and I didn't have the second book so I had to wait. Torture.The second book, The Girl Who Played With Fire, was just as good as the first, if not better because there are no slow parts or 300 pages of character building. The story just IS and it IS good.Then I had to wait for the third book, The Girl Who Kicked The Hornets Nest. Worth the wait. I enjoyed the ending except the cliche relationship between ... if you read it you will see what I am talking about. If you have not read these books, I would say it is a must simply for entertainment value. Also, go see the movies. The Swedish movies...with subtitles.

I am fascinated by genealogy and was highly entertained by the family history woven into the novel. At the same time, I really enjoyed the socio-political background and commentary. This is just a really well-crafted piece of crime fiction.2. The Girl Who Played With Fire - For me, this is the weakest link of the Millennium Trilogy. Though it is entertaining it is a bit far-fetched. There are a lot of convenient connections linking Salander and Blomkvist with high-level political goings on. To me, it just seemed this book required more suspension of disbelief.3. The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest - This is a wonderful conclusion to the Millennium Trilogy. The plot is more grounded than the second book. It's a believable political thriller with a procedural courtroom drama that I really enjoyed. Salander shines as an anti-hero and the book seems to bring full circle the socio-political commentary that began in the first installment.4. On Stieg Larsson - This is a brief collection of essays by people who knew and worked with the reclusive Larsson. I appreciated the insights into the mind behind Millennium, especially John-Henri Holmberg's comments on Larsson's writing style. There were several times when reading the trilogy that I felt the translation from Swedish to English might not be as eloquent as the original text. In fact, I think this was just Larsson's journalistic prose style. My review of five stars is an average for the whole boxed set.

The introduction to the characters was executed perfectly in this book which could have been a lone book detailing the investigations of a journalist and a computer hacker into the disappearance of a teenager 40 yrs prior to the investigation. This it is not though and I am so pleased, what may seem bizarre and unnecessary in this novel becomes incredibly relevant in the later two books.There are a number of scenes throughout the series that made me question why they were included, the unfortunate and very violent rape of Lisbeth Salander in the first book being one of them. When reading it I thought it seemed completely irrelevant to the story and was unnecessary and gratuitous violence for the sake of nothing other than creating shock to the reader. When it later became clear how Bjurman is linked to a larger conspiracy in Lisbeth's past it becomes incredibly relevant and in some aspects even more distressing than the initial incident would portray.The second and third books in the series are laced with conspiracy and intrigue and the horror the story unveils is utterly shocking.

There are some obvious advantages to doing this: You save a couple of dollars, and everything is available to search if you want to refresh your memory about something you read 1,000 pages ago. More importantly, I can’t see reading “The Girl Who Played with Fire” and “The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet’s Nest” on their own or out of sequence.The books are well worth reading if you’re into crime/mystery stories. The writing is good (with the reservations noted below), and the characterization, personal relationships, action, and plot twists are more than enough to hold your attention for the time it takes to read the equivalent of 2,200 paperback pages.Some things you should know before starting out:The books were written in Swedish. The translation is surprisingly good, but there are times you’ll vow to only read books in English (or whatever language you claim as your mother tongue).Swedish surnames are hard to pronounce (especially if you’re not familiar with the three extra letters in the Swedish alphabet).Swedish place names and street names are longer and harder to pronounce than Swedish surnames.You will read more about the Swedish police and intelligence services than you ever wanted to.The girl with the dragon tattoo is the main character in the books, but not by much.Sweden is not just a bunch of tall, blonde, decent, morose Nordic types a la Bergman. Except for the unpronounceable names, it sounds very much like the United States.

It was exciting, fast-paced and doesn't let you put the book down once the story is underway. I've spent a number of sleepless nights devouring the books. Stieg Larsson has given us one of the most original and unique female protagonist that I've read about in a long, long time. It was refreshing to read about this badass young woman who doesn't conform to society's standards or normalcy. She's strong, intelligent, independent and admirable. How she copes with the injustices done to her and all the childhood trauma she had been through is realistic and heartbreaking. Her resolve to serve retribution to those who abused her rights is impressive and makes you cheer for her till the end. Her inability to interact with people and form healthy relationships makes you wanna hug her at times.However, I felt as though the books were excessively detailed. Where on one hand, detailing can give the reader the ability to actually live in the story, a little too much can be annoying. We didn't need to know about the entire life story of every new character introduced. There were so many police officers and detectives throughout the book and their personal lives and where they served in the past was pretty irrelevant and boring to read about. Also, some parts of the story were so absurd that I scoffed out loud. A bullet to the brain and such a quick and complete recovery? Digging through a grave after being shot twice? COME ON!!! And only Blomkvist can manage to not get shot even once when a hired hitman tries to kill him with a sub-machine gun, standing only inches away from him.Nonetheless, I enjoyed the trilogy immensely and was sad when it ended.

Despite these people being so very much different from me, their actions generally all made sense when thought through their perspective. I generally make more of a deal about good novels having that quality than most people since that is always the most difficult thing for me when I try to write things.The only thing I might have found contrived is the plot of the books (especially the second and third) and the fact that Mikael and Lisbeth always manage to be in the middle of the most ridiculous setups, etc. but if I allow that concession, I recall thinking that the characters were stupid less than I usually do when reading such mystery/thriller type plots.One last thing, the translation was fantastic. While I guess I'm just assuming that the content was preserved, as far as readability, there was absolutely no clumsiness at all, puns were made to work, etc. etc. which generally made me forget that it wasn't orginally in English, which I consider to be an important quality for translations, although the preservation of Swedish names/cities/etc. continued to make me want to learn/know Swedish, as is always the case when I come across other languages.P.S.

Journalists don't always have the luxury of paring down their prose in the way that fiction writers do. Whatever information they've uncovered today, be it the fact that Mr. X worked for Texaco in 1987 or Ms. Y has a penchant for blue suede shoes, it could all be relevant tomorrow. Therefore, it's all worth publishing.The difference, and why we don't notice it as much, is in the presentation: an average story covers 600 to 800 words, and if more information is uncovered, it comes out tomorrow, not as an addition to today's story. There's lots of information, but it's broken up into smaller chunks, and therefore the extra is more digestible.Larsson takes this concept of journalistic provision of information and writes in this style. In some cases (e.g., the first 100 pages of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo), maybe it's hard to get through. But the bottom line is that Larsson did something quite clever with the concept of journalism, morphing it into this meta-style of journalistic fiction. It's the reader's job to uncover which bits of extraneous information are important, as if the reader is him/herself an investigator.In this case, if we can manage through the slow start of #1, I think these books are an excellent read.

I felt as though none of the characters are particularly likeable, but that made me focus just on the tale being told. I rooted for the good guys because they wanted to stop bad things being done by bad people, not because I liked the good guys. That was refreshing. Some characterisation feels a bit thin, ""x is a nasty because someone has to be"" so you wonder why they take the choices they do, at the time they choose to. For the most part there are well built or suitably brief set ups behind characters so you see their reasoning. The sexual (oft commented) elements didn't bother me, but I was left with the feeling that most people in Sweden are in odd relationships, bisexual or wholly deviant. I think there were almost too many ''unusual"" relationships and preferences to be believable (and in my circle of mates, I know a fair few unconventional types) which made me roll my eyes a bit at what seemed like a soap box being dragged out.Overall though I ripped through to find out what happens next, and to see what comeuppance's happened to the baddies, which is what you want to be driven by in this kind of book.",0,0.8897,0.078,0.796,0.125,0.5597338935574229,POSITIVE,0.6831

She’s also antisocial, standoffish, and downright violent, and I think it was wise of Larsson to not use her for a protagonist. Mikael, our protagonist, is mellower and patient. He as a calming influence on Salander and the two eventually trust each other with their lives. He was a smart choice to hold the main point of view, and even though I love gritty characters and would have embraced Salander as a protagonist, it was a joy to see her from others’ perspectives. That’s when she truly comes alive for me.The plot was incredibly convoluted and detailed. I could never anticipate what was going to happen from one moment to the next. The suspense was killer. One of the things I like the most about thrillers is that the antagonists are diabolical and deeply fucked up.

245,967807943,06/15/2014,5.0,"A quirky soul, I don`t generally go for authors on the bestseller list. There are two exceptions now, John le Carre and Stieg Larsson. In both cases for the same reasons. They both portray flawed, complex, maddeningly human three-dimensional characters who stay believable even when they are walking way, way on the wild side, just as much as when they are grocery shopping or vacuuming their living rooms. And they both have immensely satisfying, thrilling, onion-layered plots - part political thriller, part psychological thriller, and part detective story, with superbly targeted yet disciplined satire. There is nothing formulaic about either of them. The character of Lisbeth Salander, and her extraordinary predicament, is a tour de force of modern fiction, and Larssen is clearly as knowledgeable about the darker sides of power-broking as le Carre is. We can only speculate wistfully about what Larsson might have gone on to write if he had lived to be in his eighties, as le Carre has done. And, since we`re supposed to be opposed to sexism, as the full meaning of Salander`s byzantine odyssey unfolds, Larsson also turns out to be a damn good women`s writer.

True to Swedish progressivism there is also a pervasive feminist element to the books.I was drawn to this series as after being bogged down with a few books that were difficult to get through. Unfortunately, the first half of the first book of this series is a bit tedious and unenchanting. That's the price to pay for setting up the story and characters, I suppose. If this was a solo book I would object, but once one clears this hurdle the rest of the series is hard to put down.The writing style was very spartan and detail oriented, which seems appropriate for a crime novel. At times the detail was a bit extreme, such as detailing the exact specifications of a computer (which really dates the books, by the way). There are no attempts to be clever, just the communication of facts.I'm suspicious of super popular contemporary fiction, but this series is definitely worthwhile if you want a gripping, fun story. Granted, dark and sadistic pop up occasionally in these books, so 'fun' may not resonate with everyone. Also, the many of the street/city/character names are difficult to pronounce.

When the action starts, it's pretty interesting and comes down like an avalanche until the book's conclusion. This makes the ending of each book thrilling, however it creates an abrupt change in pacing compared to the beginning of each book which detracts from the work (why did I have to read so much buildup?).There's references to brand names, minor details, and pseudo--computer-hacking stuff which come off as strange which could be removed, but it doesn't come up enough to be a real issue for me. Maybe it's a translation thing?The middle book is the low point of the trilogy, I think because for the most part, the titular Girl acts alone, in parallel with the other protagonist, with minimal interaction between the two. The most interesting part of the book is how the Girl interacts with people, so that whole bit is lost. I think you can get by skipping the middle book, as the events are improbable but straightforward.That said, the action (end third) of each book takes on a different feel across the series, so all the books are worth reading.In the end, my major issue is that each book has a clear divide between plot set-up and plot action, breaking up each of the books and messing with the flow.Dragon Tattoo: 4 | Played with Fire: 3 | Hornet's Nest: 4",0,0.885,0.051,0.845,0.104,0.3705065359477124,NEGATIVE,0.9546

Also, pertaining to those codes, in the movie they were written in a Bible and in the book they were written in a diary/planner.Another interesting fact between the book and the movie was the fling Mikael had with Cecelia Vanger.
