After reading this most engaging novel, I felt compelled to read all of Keyes' other books, most of which were wonderful as well. This one remains my favorite of hers, however. I think it is several steps above the chick-lit category. The story is both hysterically funny and extremely poignant. I loved getting to know the Walsh sisters and bits and pieces of their various stories, so I was delighted to learn that there were other books that had different Walsh sisters as the main character.I like how Anna's story is revealed a little bit at a time, and the intermittent flashbacks that help us learn about her relationship to Aiden.

Keyes was on point in this book, Anna was heartbreakingly familiar. When I realized where her story was heading I was a bit angry, as I was already in love with Anna and Andy as a couple...how could Keyes do this to me. It was the delicate way that Keyes wove Annas story that made me keep reading through my anger =) I love how in each of these story about this family, one sisters life story, or segment of their life, is explored, and then you kind of get updates in the following sisters story. It's a nice way for the stories to continue. I'm trying not to give too much away, mostly cause I know Laura has this marked as to read. There were many moments in the books where I just paused and was wowed by Keyes ability to turn a phrase, or make a moment so recognizable and emotional. One of my favorite quotes (cause I have felt this way before) is""Funnily enough, I wasn't that keen on butterflies. It was a hard thing to admit because everyone loves butterflies and not liking them is akin to saying you don't like Michael Palin, or dolphins or strawberries. But to me, butterflies were slightly sneaky; all they were were moths in embroidered jackets. And, yes, moths were creepy and their flapping wings made a nasty papery sound-but at least they were honest; they were brown, they were dull, they were stupid (flying into flames at the drop of a hat).

The writing isn't bad, although the plot is a bit strange. My main complaint about this novel is that, for my money, except for a few small flashbacks that fill in the missing years between books, this novel has NOTHING to do with the Anna we meet in the other books. Pretty much all of the Anna, the pretty, somewhat diaphanous hippie we meet in the other books-- is explained away in a few pages, which sum up a whirlwind of her life and dismiss every other instance of her in the series. I felt discomfited by this fact, especially since I felt that the actions of the character in this novel were not in tune with those which would have been taken by the character I knew. All in all, I felt if Keyes felt she needed to write this book, it should have been written as a stand-alone; I didn't feel the plot was well-served by being compressed into a standing character structure that really did not allow for the interplay between the characters here.

However, after a while, not only did it start to drag on, it also started to resemble a mess...a mildly intriguing mess, but a mess none the less. Now, I don't need much from a chick-lit to be happy, but in Anybody Out There, I just needed more.The Good: Part 1. Part 1 of Anybody Out There was the best out of the three parts in this book. The family dynamics, which was my favorite part of Anybody Out There, were more prominent in the first part and were only alluded to in the last two parts. Another good thing was the twist. I definitely did not see that coming, particularly because I thought this was going to be a breezy, easy, funny chick-lit. Definite points for the twist.The Okay: Part 3. Part 3, where everything was coming together, was not as good as Part 1, but way better than Part 2. Jacqui's side plot was funny enough that it kept me interested in Anybody Out There. As unplausible as it was, I was also mildly satisfied with the ending. Although, that could have been because I just wanted the book to be over.The Bad: Part 2. I don't know how something involving mediums could've been so flippin' boring. Part 2 just dragged on and on. Oh, and Helen's emails...also dragged on and on. I found Helen to be funny and interesting at first, but after those emails, I was so incredibly bored with her character. That side plot was just pointless. Another bad thing about Anybody Out There was the numerous side plots. You had the mediums, you had the husband turmoil, the job turmoil, the ex-girlfriend turmoil, and a couple more turmoils that I don't feel like elaborating on. This book just had way too much going on. Oh, and it also stopped being funny at one point. So, overall, I found Anybody Out There to be a dud.

48,191941590,07/29/2011,5.0,"This is my favorite of all the Walsh sisters books. I love Anna, she is my favorite sister, and I was so moved by her story. Having read this one first sort of ruined the others, although I loved them too, as I knew what would happen in the end for each sister in her relationships. This was a heartbreaking tale, filled with laughter and tears (A LOT of tears!) and HUGE twists and turns that are hardly expected. Although everyone reading the series should start with Watermelon, then read Rachel's Holiday, then Angels, and finally Anybody Out There?, you should start TODAY so you can get to this one ASAP.Anna is the fourth sister in the Walsh family. She has three older sisters: Claire (Watermelon), Maggie (Angels), and Rachel (Rachel's Holiday), as well as a younger sister, Helen. Anna is the flaky sister, she did a lot of drugs when she was in her teens and twenties, but stopped when Rachel went to rehab. She is known for wearing fringy skirts, going out for milk and coming home months later, and generally being a free-spirited, if not naive, young woman. At the start of Anybody Out There?, Anna wakes up in Dublin, in her parents home, bruised and broken, and seemingly having no idea how it happened. The last thing she knew, she was in New York, working for a cosmetics company. Then everything changes.This book was heavy and sad. It has very funny parts, and the language used by Anna and her friend is hilarious. Like other books I've reviewed, I read other reviews and found them to be misguided. The change in Anna happens in Rachel's Holiday, and continues in Angels. She grows up. She gets a job. She starts on the right path. That has already been built for us in previous stories. Rachel's rehab gets Anna on the straight and narrow. There were also criticisms of Anna and Aiden as a couple, and their lovey-ness being a symptom of their relationship being relatively new. I disagree with this - sometimes people meet, they fall in love, and they remain absolutely enamored with each other for the duration of their lives. It is not out of the question, and it's something that every woman dreams about. Just because this fictional character has it, doesn't mean it's to be disparaged.. Otherwise, this book really piqued my interest in the Walsh family. I found them fun and funny, and I wanted to know more. Each woman grows differently. She makes choices, she lives both with the consequences and through them. Each heroine is likable, each is unique, and you want to know more about them. My heart broke for Anna, and although you KNEW there would be twists, I did not find them to be at all predictable - and I am usually VERY good at predicting the twists and outcomes of books. Finally, the blurb on the book talks about amnesia, of which there is NONE. Anna may not remember what happened, but it's more likely that she knows and has blocked it out. I actually had this book on my shelf for at least a year, and did not read it because I'm pretty tired of amnesia stories. This phrase is not a reason to skip this book as I did for so long!!Anna's story is TRULY one of despair and of hope. I can't wait to read Helen's story, and I'm waiting for Marian Keyes to write about Mammy Walsh, too!!!I highly recommend this book, but only AFTER the three others in the series have been read!",0,0.9956,0.057,0.802,0.141,0.582314639905549,POSITIVE,0.998

I generally hate chick-lit (well, apart from Sophie Kinsella's books) but Marian Keyes always manages to add a difficult subject (drug addiction, domestic abuse, rape) and deal with it sensitively and intelligently while also being hilarious.Anybody Out There? tells the story of one of the younger Walsh siblings (we've met them before in Watermelon, Rachel's Holiday and Angels), Anna. I always particularly love the stories about the Walshes as you really get to know them throughout the series and the characters feel so real to me (I know that sounds a trite thing to say but they remind me of my mum's family!).When we've come across Anna in the earlier novels about her older sisters she's a bit of an f-up, but in Anybody Out There? we find that she's pulled herself together and is married and living in New York where she has The Best Job in the World. At the start of the book though she's back in Ireland recovering from a horrible accident in her parent's best living room and desperately trying to get in touch with her husband who won't return her calls. Although you'll probably figure out what's coming before it's revealed, there is one twist that will come as a shock, and knowing what's coming doesn't make it any less emotional when Anna finally begins to come to terms with what's happened. I don't want to give too much away here, but suffice to say you'll probably fall in love with Aiden along with Anna (the story of how they met and married is told throughout the book in flashback form) and find yourself a little bit heartbroken as well. A really brilliant book that I strongly recommend to everyone, even if they don't normally go for chick-lit. Oh, and one more thing.

Now, I very much went into this book with eyes wide open; I assumed it was chick lit-y and as such, was not expecting to be bowled over with literary magnificence. But even so, with managed expectations, this story was really grating on my nerves and although there were definitely times when I was choked up and my stomach was in knots, there were MORE times when I was like “OH MY GOD WAKE UP AND GET ON WITH IT!” Now, there are several points when the story takes an unforeseen turn and I’d be lying if I said those points didn’t really hold my interest (ie, when she figures out what happens to her husband, secret part to husband’s life is revealed, etc.) But these story benders are few and far between and you have to trudge through pages and pages of trite dialogue and predictable narrative to get to them which, like I said, did a number on my nerves.

She said that they were the sort of books that make you laugh and make you cry, and really, what more could you want from any book? ‘Anybody Out There’ is certainly an engaging mixture of humour and pathos and gave me a lump in the throat more than once. It tells the story of Anna Walsh, who has been in some kind of terrible accident, and is recuperating on her parents’ couch in Dublin. But Anna is desperate to speak to a man named Aiden and so returns to New York to find him. There’s a vast cast of eccentric characters, some odd and some funny moments, and a dark and serious streak I was not expecting. Marian Keyes is not afraid to grapple with themes of grief, depression, loneliness, and pain, even as she mocks the shallowness of the beauty industry and throws in some slapstick humour.

115,2908652033,08/10/2019,4.0,"I do love Marian Keyes. She's one of those authors who's taken the most painful parts of her life and used them to drive some fantastic writing--books that make us laugh, cry, and think. The reading trifecta.This is the fourth of five Walsh sister novels, and unfortunately for me, the last one for me to read (I'm going to reread the last one anyway, but I've read it before). I will miss the Walsh sisters. So this one is Anna's story, and boy does she have one. At the beginning of the novel, she's recuperating from health problems at home in Dublin with her family, but she misses her husband, Aiden, and wants to get back to her home in New York. While the chaos that comes with a family of five daughters, an overwhelmed father, and a bit of a whackadoodle mammy swirls around her, Anna is melancholy, wanting only to return to New York. Keyes takes her time (I've seen some reviewers say many of her books are too long, but I'm happy to have more time in her worlds), slowly watching Anna's memories reveal how she landed home in Dublin, and carefully letting the reader see how her past affects where she'll go next. Interestingly, she does this by staying in the present, in Anna's head, watching her thoughts as they happen, letter them drive her emotions and behaviors, and inevitably, helping us understand Anna by being with her instead of showing her to us. Keyes won't be hurried, and the end result is that we really know who Anna is, how she feels, and that even those with emotional issues (temporary or otherwise) can be okay. And we laughed with her and her family at the same time. (Her family, by the way, especially Mammy, is hilarious). I had one SMALL issue with this one. The Anna we meet here is not quite the same Anna that we've met in previous books. The Anna described in Claire, Rachel, and Maggie's stories is a little different, more carefree and spontaneous, perhaps flighty. I'd been looking forward to finding out just what was in that girl's head. But this novel takes place about 15 years after the first Walsh sister novel (Watermelon, Claire's story), and so as in real life, she's changed a bit. Anna even explains this a little, saying she used to be something of a space cadet, but she's changed as she got older. Since the differences aren't ignored, I can be okay with it, but I really did want to know what Anna was thinking back then.Great novel for those who enjoy watching women come out from their pain, mental health issues, difficult circumstances of all kinds and find a way to be happy, especially when they really want to experience it by knowing the characters well yet be encouraged to find humor at the same time. NOT for anyone who is impatient to see the end of that process come too fast.",0,0.985,0.06,0.815,0.125,0.4772865013774104,POSITIVE,0.9948

However, I will tell you the book has three (3) parts. The first part was outstanding. It held my interest and I couldn't wait to find out what was happening. All is a little vague, initially. Then by the end of the first part, you understand what has occurred.Part 2 of the story, to me, felt a bit boring and it dragged on, because at this point, all I could concentrate on was the constant crying I was doing. Yes, I was obviously invested enough in the characters to feel this strong emotion. While I did plenty of out-loud laughing, it was also the same with the crying.Part 3 of the story was better than part 2, but still not as outstanding as the first part, but it was good. There were a lot of emails from home that I could've done without, and it wouldn't have hurt the length of the book. It is a long one.There is somewhat of a satisfying ending in my eyes; not the kind of ending I would like, but it ended on a happier note than it could have, I suppose.Yes, it's a good story; yes, the novel is well-written; yes it will make you laugh, but it will also make you cry unless you are a strong person who can sit there and say ""Eh, it's only a fiction story."" This I cannot do. Maybe I'm not as strong as some, or maybe Marian Keyes is just that good at writing.I gave it five stars because I feel it deserves it especially for those that like these kinds of funny and teary-eyed stories. Personally, It left me feeling depressed. I'm spending the rest of my evening feeling drained and that's not how I like to spend my evenings. I don't mind crying and of course I love to laugh, but I don't want to feel emotionally distraught after reading a book.

I mean, of course people can have their own opinions and this kind of book isn't for everyone. If you're looking for 'em there are plenty reasons why a person might not like it or finish it. I get that. The sense of humor isn't for everyone. Some people might not like the swearing or the sex stuff. For some people it might be just too sad.

I'll tell you - they do anything and everything they can to try and make it better quicker. Of course the woman wants to go to a physic. Like I say, she'd do anything to get rid of the pain. Despite how illogical and strange it may seem to herself and others. Also, this is Anna Walsh of the other Walsh books so I don't get why people are surprised that she reverted back to the spiritualistic Anna we all got to know.

She met and married Aidan then he got hit by a car to save her life (thus why she's injured) and he died. This is all revealed little by little throughout the book and you really get to watch their relationship grow through her memories. In the present, she's trying to go to different mediums and psychics to be able to talk to him but none are ever successful. We find out that he had a child that he conceived with his long time girlfriend shortly before he and Anna met. He found out about the kid the week he died and was going to tell Anna that night. Anna is really angry and bitter, but then she realizes that this kid is all she has left of him and in a weird way her and the ex become friends and she enjoys the kid. During the story, she starts going to grief counseling and meets a guy there. He lost his wife and they become friends because they have a shared understanding. In the very end of the book, Aiden comes to Anna and tells her its all okay and he loves her very much but wants her to move on. She will be happy with another man and its one she already knows.

However, this was never my favorite one of hers and I can't quite put my finger on it. Anyway, my tastes have changed over the years (no reflection upon the quality of literature) and I tend to go through phases in what I read, so I figured I'd try to clean out my bookshelves in order to make room for new books I've been forbidding myself to buy since we have no space for them. I therefore decided to pick this book up again in order to decide wether to put it in the ""keep"" or ""give away"" pile. It is one of Marian Keyes sadder books in my opinion. She usually has a nice way of making serious subjects or happenings into a ""feel-good novel"", yet this one left me feeling sad throughout. Many of the main characters are rather annoying and strange, even though I usually like strange, but it felt rather superficial, especially the parts concerning the main character's job. The first time I read it, I also felt that the main character's relationship with her husband seemed a bit unrealistic and annoying at times, but now that I am married I quite enjoyed that, even if it was ""layed on rather thickly"". Additionally, I struggled with the ""plot twist"" which happens in probably the first third of the book. I felt that both times I read the book I saw this twist coming and was a bit frustrated with this first third of the book.It is still a nice, easy read, but not her best work in my (humble) opinion.

One thing I disliked is that the author seemed to have completely reinvented Anna’s character in this books. She was nothing like her character in the previous three novels. This was disappointing. The former Anna was unique, this Anna pretty much had the same narrative voice as the other sisters before her. The plot was interesting but the book felt like it dragged and I believe a lot could have parsed down without sacrificing main points on the story. There’s a twist toward the end that reveals a secret but I felt like the book didn’t need it and Anna’s reaction to the secret just didn’t make much sense to me. On the positive side, Marian Keyes’ humorous writing is still on point and that’s what makes me keep reading her novels. She also has a splendid way of making a book funny and heartbreaking at the same time, which is especially evident in this book. That’s not an easy thing to accomplish, but I could tell from reading Watermelon that she has a gift for it. I think this series really started out strong with the first two books, but the last two have been kind of a letdown. I’m keeping my fingers crossed that the last book will redeem the series.
