2,275026397,02/09/2012,2.0,"First off, I want to commend the art team on this book: great text layout, gorgeous pictures, and excellent paper. But beyond the visual appeal, I'm at a loss for praise.Granted, as an intermediate level cook, it doesn't look like I'm the target audience for his Food Revolution campaign, but I was bewildered to find recipes for things like plain oatmeal, boiled eggs, smoothies, and white rice. I know he's assuming only a passing familiarity with the stove, but many of these ""recipes"" can be found on the sides of packages. And the vast majority of the other recipes are lackluster -- salads, various grilled/roasted meats, omelets, vegetables with herbs & butter, sauces for ice-cream. The only interesting dishes were in the curries section, and for that I'd be better served by a Madhur Jaffrey cookbook.I was also surprised to find many recipes required fairly premium items like filet mignon, sun-dried tomatoes, jarred roasted red peppers, and cr√®me fraiche. By no means were ALL the recipes so posh, but for a book that touts ""simple, affordable meals"", they seemed fairly out of place.Overall, the cookbook delivers basic variations on basic themes which, frankly, left me bored and uninspired. Beginner cooks might find some value in the visuals, but for comprehensive lessons in technique (and excellent recipes to boot) I would steer them towards Mark Bittman's How to Cook Everything: Simple Recipes for Great Food.",5,0.9733,0.059,0.799,0.142,0.573440065681445,NEGATIVE,1.0

I'm from West Virginia and it was filmed about 3 hours away from me in Huntington, WV. I loved the tv series and everything he had to say about nutrition, so I couldn't resist supporting Jamie and attempting to make my life more healthy.I easily found all of the ingredients from the recipes I've cooked at my local Kroger. It seemed a little expensive when I went shopping, but each recipe seems to last for days. I actually started cutting them in half since I only feed my boyfriend and myself. Jamie added a lot of pictures of the cooking process for every recipe. That was extremely helpful. I hadn't cooked with a lot of the vegetables he uses, so they often looked very strange (almost disgusting). But his photographs showed me I was doing everything correctly and that his looked just as strange. It was also nice to see the sizes he would ""chop"" ""slice"" and ""cut"" things into.There were so many great recipes, and I haven't even cooked everything in it yet. My favorite: Pot-Roast Meatloaf. I've made it many times. First for myself, then for family dinners and potlucks.I also loved the chapter on Indian food. My favorite type of food is Indian. Jamie made the recipes so easy and still filled with all those Indian flavors.",5,0.9859,0.035,0.819,0.146,0.5843827160493829,POSITIVE,0.9999
4,80184282,12/07/2009,5.0,"Absolutely outstanding. This is now my favorite cookbook, and I'll be buying it if I don't receive it for Christmas. So far I've made the meatballs, banana oatmeal, scrambled eggs, and chickan tikka masala curry. The one time I tried to make meatballs before this recipe, I overcooked them and they fell apart in the pasta. Following the directions from this book, my meatballs became fragrant with rosemary and held together well. My husband loved them. The oatmeal was delicious, and the scrambled eggs recipe yielded perfect scrambled eggs. Actually, I've always always overcooked my eggs and my husband never really liked them, so he was thrilled with the results this time around. I was hesitant to try making curry, because I doubted I could make it as good as the kind we get as take-out, but it was also perfect. I think the cilantro/yogurt/almond toppings really helped to make it so yummy. There are colorful photos for EVERY recipe, usually at least several of the process, which I appreciated so much. The recipes do rely heavily on fresh herbs, but I was able to find a lot of things out of the book that I could make on a tight grocery budget, with some small substitutions (plain eggs instead of cage-free/organic, etc).",5,0.9864,0.021,0.812,0.167,0.555952380952381,POSITIVE,1.0
5,120303058,09/06/2010,5.0,"I started reading several books last week, most of them novels, but the book that got me the most excited was‚Äìof all things‚Äìa cookbook. I decided to order this book from the library after watching a couple episodes of ‚ÄúJamie Oliver‚Äôs Food Revolution,‚Äù a show where the British chef comes to the American South and tries to reform the disgusting eating habits of the unhealthiest town in the world. Jamie Oliver reveals and rebukes the greasy, processed food that Americans eat, trying to turn over a new leaf in the school lunch program at a public elementary school.After waiting more than two months for my hold request to be fulfilled (as the 24th person in line at the library), I finally picked up my copy of the cookbook, Jamie‚Äôs Food Revolution: Rediscover How to Cook Simple, Delicious, Affordable Meals. Cookbooks aren‚Äôt generally a ‚Äúread-it-from-cover-to-cover‚Äù item, but I found that this was one cookbook I couldn‚Äôt put down. Jamie begins by telling the novice chef what tools every good kitchen should contain and what ingredients every pantry should be stocked with. (I made some notes on the latter for my next trip to Winco.) Then he launches into the recipes.The first section listed off a handful of twenty minute meals for people who are short on time. With names like ‚ÄúShrimp and Avacado with an Old-School Marie Rose Sauce,‚Äù I found that they did indeed look simple and delicious, though maybe not quite as affordable as our usual fare. The next section of the book was even more intriguing: ‚ÄúQuick Pasta.‚Äù The pasta dishes I usually make are a last-ditch resort born of empty cupboards and small imagination. Jamie offers exciting dishes like ‚ÄúBroccoli and Pesto Tagliatelle,‚Äù containing only a handful of ingredients but looking mouthwateringly delicious in the full color pictures.The book proceeded with ‚ÄúTasty Stir-Fries‚Äù and ‚ÄúEasy Curries.‚Äù I resolved then and there that I was going to make a curry that week, something I had never before attempted. A few days later I produced a passable ‚ÄúChicken Tikka Masala,‚Äù with a lovely sauce and decent chicken (that would probably have been more tender if my stovetop had a more even heat).The next section contained recipes for salads. This exemplified what I love about Jamie Oliver‚Äôs book‚Äìversatility. In the salad section, he tries to teach you general rules so that you can whip up your own salad creation. The full-color chart on page 119 has six rows of ‚Äúkinds‚Äù of ingredients: soft, crunchy, herby, veggies, cheese, and toppings. Each of the rows contains four items; for instance, the ‚Äúherby‚Äù row has mint, basil, italian parsley, and arugula. All you need to do is pick one ingredient from each row to come up with an awesome salad! There are literally hundreds of combinations to choose from.The second recipe that I cooked from this book was the ‚ÄúBeef and Ale Stew,‚Äù and I must say that it turned out divine! The portions for most of the main dishes are for 4-6 servings, so we have half of the stew in the freezer waiting for another day. Yesterday, I was sorely tempted to take it out and heat it up for lunch, but I resisted‚Äìknowing, that someday soon, I would want to put a delicious dinner on the table without doing any work.I highly recommend this cookbook to beginner and expert chefs alike. I like it so much that I ordered my own copy from Amazon.com. It should get here later this week.",3,0.9974,0.011,0.862,0.127,0.4740674880674881,POSITIVE,0.716

Also, while the book is generally good about giving pictures of how to perform some of the more uncommon culinary techniques (like butterflying), the fact of the matter is that I wouldn't have someone try a recipe (or even look at a recipe) that involves butterflying until they'd figured out cutting, chopping, dicing and mincing. Butterflying requires dexterity and a really sharp knife, and if you don't have those (and I'd frankly expect most people to not have those), then it's not something your average reader (who Jamie claims he's shooting for) should be trying to do.That said, the very first chapter of the book, where Jamie gives a list of (to use Alton Brown's terminology) useful and necessary hardware for your kitchen is incredibly useful and valuable.

In the introduction, he says a few words about the Ministry of Food in Britain during WWII. I‚Äôll let you all read it but, essentially, it was a government department set up to provide citizens with nutritious meals with their given rations and home gardens. Since that time Britain and America has moved away from the institution of home as hearth. Our hectic lives push us away from the common ground of mealtime. Working long hours far from our homes, extracurricular activities like travel sports demanding ever more time on the road or at practice, both parents working or single-parenthood all serve to separate us from our families, loved ones and our kitchens.

If you don't but have a metal colander, add water about half way up a saucepan that will hold it. Put water on high heat to boil. Trim the ends off the broccolini. (I used broccoli because it's what I had, cut to florets). Drain water chestnuts in a colander or through the steamer basket. Add washed sugar snap peas. Lay the salmon fillets, skin side down, on top of them, then scatter the broccoli over. Cover the colander with aluminum foil and scrunch tightly around the edges to seal the steam in.To cook your salmon and make your dressing:Put the colander or steamer basket (with lid) over your pan of boiling water and let it steam for 8 to 10 minutes. While that's happening, peel and grate the ginger and half the clove of garlic into a small bowl. Finely slice your chile (I used a serrano pepper, because it's what I could get) and scallion and add them to the bowl with the soy sauce and olive oil. Squeeze the juice from half a lemon into the bowl. Mix together with a spoon and set aside. After your salmon and vegetables have been steaming for 8 minutes, peel back the foil to check the fish it cooked through, it should flake apart.To serve your salmon:Divide the salmon, water chestnuts, and veggies between your plates or bowls. Give the dressing a quick stir and drizzle it over. Serve with the remaining lemon half, cut into wedges, for squeezing over.Oliver also suggests using cod in place of the salmon and asparagus or asparagus, peas, and greens in place of the broccoli and snap peas.

I've watched him on cooking shows and on his series ""Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution,"" so I know that he had a lot to offer regarding cooking techniques as well as fantastic ways to motivate people. So when I discovered this book at our local library, I just knew I needed to read it! Many of his recipes are a bit more complicated than I normally cook, but a lot of others follow along the same lines as what I do already. So I found some challenges and a nice reassurance that I'm already headed in the right direction as far as trying to feed my family home-cooked, nourishing and healthy meals. Since he is English, it makes sense that a lot of his recipes have a British flavor (or should I say flavour?) This is good for me, but in our family, I have to accommodate different preferences. So I expect that I will try a few of my favorite recipes (especially when I'm cooking for myself) and a few of the ones I think our family will be open to trying and hope that they approve. I made a family favorite last night - the Thai Green Curry (with a few modifications, like using a bit of curry paste, since it is difficult to get lemongrass and kaffir lime leaves). I also made it with pork rather than shrimp, but we like it with just about any meat (chicken, tofu, etc.) I liked the vegetables that he added (I've never made it with asparagus and snow peas before, but with fresh Spring asparagus, it was fantastic!) and I appreciated his tips, since I'm always trying to make the sauce taste more like what we've eaten in Thailand! Overall, I like his approach to this book. I love the idea that by passing down recipes to one another, we can create a world of cooks, rather than a world of fast-food eaters. If nothing else, I hope to teach our girls that cooking homemade meals is simple and worth the effort. I agree that the times mentioned on the recipes might be a bit optimistic, especially for a novice cook.

The book is British and therefore contains a lot of recipes for fish and lamb, which are somewhat harder to come by in rural Alberta. I have made the sweet 'n' sour pork, and the chicken stew and will be making them again. Also, probably the chicken fajitas. I also tried the macaroni and cauliflower cheese bake and pan-fried glazed pork chops with limited success. There are just two complaints with this book. 1) There is not enough vegetable dishes. Depending on your point of view this is or is not a problem. This book was definitely made for carnivores. 2) The recipe instructions are written as one paragraph.

In short, I find that the food tastes great, comes together easily, and is not too fussy.I am an experienced cook but find this book very inspiring (and beautiful). I love the section on salads and how he does this ""evolution"" thing to show how you can change a salad by adding to it. It's a simple way to make people think of how they can add something to a dish to change it up just enough. I also like how at the end of recipes, he'll often give another way to mix it up. It keeps the food from feeling boring.While experienced cooks might naturally add or subtract things from recipes, this book is aimed at beginners. My husband is one of those beginner cooks, and he is using this book to learn to cook. I have not been helping at all (he kicks me out of the kitchen), and everything he's made has turned out great! He has gotten especially good at the Asian Chicken Noodle Broth, and in true Jamie Oliver fashion, he's started experimenting with what he wants to add to it.Similarly, while others might be annoyed by measurements like ""a few handfuls of spinach,"" I like it. I think it shows cooks that they aren't beholden to the particulars of a recipe. I think this helps people learn to cook for their tastes, and to get a feel for cooking.Finally, I don't dig fussy recipes that much. I live in a metro area and I find the ingredients easy to find at a typical grocery store. I don't need to go to Whole Foods or anything like that. He is big on using fresh veg and lots of fresh herbs, and your knives will get a workout.Solid, tasty, fresh food in a beautiful cookbook with recipes that are easy to follow?

I often times would get intimidated by recipes that had complex ingredients or instructions, but Jamie understood these struggles and purposely made them easy for all of us. One of the my favorite tips that Jamie shared that I love and still do today (ten years later), is add sliced chili into my spaghetti/pasta for that extra spicy kick.

223,741874952,10/15/2013,4.0,"In the introduction to Jamie Oliver‚Äôs latest cookbook Jamie's Food Revolution: Rediscover How to Cook Simple, Delicious, Affordable Meals, Oliver lays out his plan to get people cooking again by having them master at least one recipe from each of the fourteen chapters in the book. This is being called the ‚ÄúPass it on Movement,‚Äù and it is the young chef‚Äôs hope that it will get Americans back in the kitchen and cooking healthy food. The introduction even ends with a pledge that Oliver encourages his readers to sign; it‚Äôs sort of a promissory note intended to guilt budding cooks into actually passing on their new culinary knowledge to the uninitiated.Jamie's Food Revolution begins with a chapter on ‚ÄúEssentials,‚Äù which is basically a list of kitchen equipment and pantry items recommended by Oliver for aspiring cooks. I‚Äôm a serious home cook; I cook dinner at least six times a week and make most things from scratch, but Oliver‚Äôs lists intimidated the hell out of me. The chef‚Äôs intended audience for this book is the culinary challenged, those who‚Äôve been relying on fast and/or convenient foods to get them through their days. Recommending that these people invest in over thirty kitchen tools and gadgets in order to be ‚Äúwell-rounded, efficient cooks‚Äù can make them feel overwhelmed. Admittedly, many people have cutting boards, can openers, and box graters, but asking a new cook to invest in a food processor, food scales, chef‚Äôs knives, and other tools may be asking too much. The list of pantry items is also large; it features seventy-five items. Though I can attest to the usefulness of having these ingredients on hand for quick and delicious meals, it may alienate his core audience. Trying to convince an inexperienced cook they need five different oils is crazy, but I almost have to commend Oliver for trying.One of the biggest selling points of Jamie's Food Revolution is its affordable meals, but many of the recipes included feature expensive ingredients. For example, the first recipe calls for two filet mignon steaks, while others require leg of lamb, salmon, fresh tuna, and other meats and seafood. To me, this is just another example of a celebrity chef being out of touch with reality. This is only compounded by the fact that Oliver requests that everything be market fresh, organic, and free-range. The book includes photos and quotes by blue collar folks; all of them attesting to how these recipes changed their way of eating. Truth be told, teachers, single moms, and doormen can‚Äôt afford to feast on filet mignon, seafood paella, and roast lamb. I‚Äôd love it if everyone could eat organically and purchase produce directly from farmers, but it‚Äôs not realistic given the price range and availability of these items in most areas.One chapter that really fits the bill for affordable cuisine is ‚ÄúHomely Ground Beef.‚Äù Here we learn to make meatballs (moist and delicious), Bolognese sauce (rich and comforting), and chili con carne, which wasn‚Äôt authentic, but quick, simple, and tasty nonetheless.Enough with the criticism, let‚Äôs get to the good stuff: the food. Oliver, a recent recipient of the 2010 Technology, Entertainment, Design foundation prize, knows his stuff. Indian food has always been a mystery to me; it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve always been intimidated by and terrified to cook. Thanks to Oliver, that‚Äôs no longer the case. The chef provides recipes for five different curry pastes, revealing the secrets behind korma, jalfrezi, Rogan josh, tikka masala, and vindaloo. The first things I tackled were Oliver‚Äôs recipes for chicken tikka masala (spicy, curried chicken), aloo gobhi (curried potato and cauliflower), and light and fluffy cilantro lime rice. Except for a substitution for the chicken tikka (I didn‚Äôt have boneless, skinless chicken, so I used chicken legs), everything turned out beautifully and at the end of the meal I truly felt as if I‚Äôd conquered a fear.I owe a lot to Jamie Oliver. When I dropped out of college, I‚Äôd spend my days babysitting and watching his BBC show The Naked Chef, which I credit to helping me learn how to cook. Now that he‚Äôs revealed the secrets of Indian curry pastes to me, I‚Äôm forever grateful. I‚Äôm sure other home cooks will be just as thrilled with what the British chef has to offer.Review by Tina Vasquez",0,0.9948,0.045,0.839,0.116,0.5299506049506049,NEGATIVE,0.9994
