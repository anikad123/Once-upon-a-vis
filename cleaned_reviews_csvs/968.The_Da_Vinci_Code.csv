0,765943,04/17/2007,5.0,"most of us have heard of this controverisal book. it takes an open minded person to read this and to remember it is just fiction. but it brings up a lot of important questions about the Christian church, and the loss of paganism and the respect of the Goddess or the Woman. I don't care if I am the only one who likes this book. it is my own truth, and i will think what i want to think. Dan Brown didn't LEAD me or anyone else. he OPENED our minds. simply and importantly...he was just a catalyst for different thinking. that is a good thing...poorly written or not.if you finish the book you will notice that Dan Brown even makes it clear to readers through his characters words, that he doesn't want to destroy christianity because it has done so much good for so many people, and if it works for them, let's let them continue to do what works for them. but find your own path. if you were or are a Christian ask yourself about the topics in this book. They are so eye opening. Jesus having a baby? totally possible...never thought of it before. never thought of it. is it true? who knows. Things like this are happening all the time today...Weapons of Mass destruction in Iraq? sound familiar? Maybe the church repressed information LIKE this because it was a threat to the church. totally possible. The catholic church creating the biblical canon with a political agenda to wipe out paganism? actually this seems to be a fact. women being oppressed due to the fear of religous zealot men in power losing their power...never looked at it that way. but this seems to be a fact too. is it helpful in broadening my perspective of the fact that christianity is just a religion made by fallible people. it sure is. does it open my mind to other faiths like paganism, judiasm, islam, bhuddism, and want to take the truths from all of them, and then THINK FOR MYSELF and figure out my own truth. it sure does...and that is what this book has probably done for many other people. why do you think Dan Brown's book was on the bestseller list for so long...and became a movie...obviously it was doing some good.",810,0.9888,0.077,0.757,0.166,0.5357266865079365,NEGATIVE,0.9846

2,3181304,07/17/2007,1.0,"This is a pretty formulaic page turner, a fun quick read. Written at about the level of the average Nancy Drew mystery, it is best appreciated at that level. As far as the content, there are howlers on virtually every page (starting with the hero who looks like ""Harrison Ford in Harris tweed"" and is a ""Professor of Religious Symbology at Harvard"" -- good work if you can find it). You have to ignore very pulpy, cheesy writing to enjoy this romantic thriller.Intended as a book that a dedicated reader could finish in a day, or something you take to the beach and casually finish in a weekend, The Da Vinci Code makes for a reasonable airline novel, so much so that it is often a bit clunky in its desire to ensure that no intellectual effort on the reader's part will be required. Here's a recurring example in this novel: a bit of unfamiliar terminology, say ""crux gemmata"" (jeweled cross) will will be explained on page N, then on page N+1, a character will finger his jeweled cross and explain, ""Oh, yes -- this is a crux gemmata."" I've read dinner menus that were more demanding on the reader. My wife and I both read about a third of it in a day, sharing the same copy, and that's a full work day plus taking care of kids, bedtime, etc. That's also a kind of virtue, I guess -- it's fast and peppy.As far as history goes, Dan Brown apparently thinks that ""most historians"" give credence to the hoary forgeries and frauds promoted in sensationalist best-sellers like Holy Blood, Holy Grail. This author gets the best of both worlds: simultaneously claiming that ""it's just fiction,"" while introducing the novel with claims that the historical record contained within is ""fact."" That claim is ridiculous. To pluck a random example, he spends some time talking about the Council of Nicaea, and incorrectly summarizes it as the origin of the doctrine of Christ's divinity by Constantine. He ignores the Arian controversy out of which it arose, which is like trying to explain the Treaty of Versailles without mentioning World War I. He ignores the documented fact, agreed upon even by the cheerleaders of the gnostics that he is sympathetic to, that the earliest gnostic doctrines held that Christ was *purely* God, and not really man -- the very reverse of the doctrine that serves as the linchpin of his novel's intellectual base (such as it is). This is a bad novel for weak or misinformed Christians, but anyone familiar with history should spot the train wreck of Brown's ideas a mile off.Oh yes, and in Brown's world, Opus Dei has shadowy assassin ""monks"" (in real life, Opus Dei is not a monastic order -- there are no Opus Dei monks, let alone trained assassins), and the Catholic Church has been promulgating known lies as its central dogmas, promotes violence throughout the world, and has been retarding the progress of science and knowledge for 2 millennia. Brown leaves the reader with the impression that this, too, is a matter of settled historical record. Oh, but then again, it's just fiction. Except when it's not.In general, if you're looking for a heady thriller wrapped around Christian arcana, I'd recommend Umberto Eco's excellent The Name of the Rose, not this dumbed down, by-the-numbers novel.",318,0.9898,0.06,0.788,0.152,0.4570230607966457,NEGATIVE,0.9752

4,1194579,05/13/2007,1.0,"A thriller devoid of pacing or exciting language. A mystery devoid of clues, foreshadowing, or facts. A tell-all of half-truths based upon a forged document written by a schizophrenic conman. A character-driven modern novel devoid of character. The second draft of Angels and Demons. Page-turning action thanks to the literary equivalent of pulling out at the moment of orgasm. A spiritual awakening built on new-age conspiracy theory. This book is many things, and none of them good, new, or interesting. However, it is an excellent litmus test for idealistic delusion.Upon the first reading, I must admit I found it a bit interesting, but then I turned the final page, and there was no bibliography. No explanation of how the author became familiar with all the concepts he claimed to 'faithfully portray'. He wrote this book and pretended it was a history book, and then refused to support it in any way. And any history you can't check up on is a bad one. He's no better than James Frey. In fact, he may be worse, since I know people who base their religious beliefs on this book, whereas Frey's only crime was wishing he was Scarface. And really, what macho thirtysomething male doesn't?Brown had good reasons for hiding his sources: they were forged by con-man Pierre Plantard and snuck into the Bibliotheque National in Paris back in the seventies. And it's not like Plantard got away with it, either--the whole 'Priory of Sion' thing was debunked thirty years before this book was even written.The artistic 'iconography' that figures heavily into the mystery is also completely made-up, and was declared ludicrous by an art history professor of my acquaintance. There are a lot of well-known symbols and allusions in classic art, but none of them resemble Brown's claims. The whole hinge on which the plot turns--the notion that an inverted triangle is automatically symbolic of women--makes about as much sense as declaring that the use of the swastika by 3rd century, BC Buddhists was proof that they were fascists.The rest of Brown's book is filled with the sort of cliched religious conspiracies you get from your first year as a theology student. Not only that, but these conspiracies were already explored by better writers in 'Foucault's Pendulum' and the 'Illuminatus! Trilogy'.Well, I've already done more legitimate historical research on this review than Brown did in his whole book, so I guess I'll call it a day.",235,-0.9005,0.092,0.833,0.076,0.4258234519104083,NEGATIVE,1.0

So post Hype-a-ganza, I finally got around to reading this popular, polarizing, pop culture icon and thought it was….drum roll……………………FINE(sigh). It was a solid read with a slight lean towards the “eh” side of MEH and few moments of genuine “that’s neat.” I don’t see all the love and I don’t see all the rage. Other than the obvious religious flavor of the content, it reminded me of your typical page-turning, popcorn beach read and I thought it accomplished its goal in decent, if unremarkable, fashion. Now I have a strict “don’t ask, don’t tell, don’t mock, don’t preach” approach when it comes to religiousness so I am going to ignore the bird-flipping Vatican bash aspects of the story, though I can certainly see people on both sides of the fence having “epic rah rah” or “epic fail” reactions and I respect that. For me, it didn’t move my needle much in either direction beyond my fondness for the “big hidden history mystery” which is something I generally really enjoy. The plot of this one has been talked to death and beyond so rather than adding one more jelly bean to the jar, I thought I would just run down a few likes and dislikes about the story and leave it at that. 
TURN ONS
1. Conspiracy theories: are just fully fun and I am a major sucker for plots concerning “shadow” histories and secret people doing secret things behind secret doors for reasons that are SHHHHHHH. I love a good conspiracy. Find me a rumor involving  Kim Kardashian being a Bilderberger and using a secret banking pipeline running from Area 51 through Microsoft to the Saudi Royal Family and laundering vast monies to be used to coordinate the sale of Boise, Idaho to a mysterious consortium headed by  Jay Z and Justin Bieber who will then turn the city into a giant quasi-government facility used for the testing of alien “cloning” technology………….and I am glued to my seat and ONE HAPPY FELLA. 2. Knights Templar: As much as I love conspiracies in general, when you throw the Knights Templar into the mix, it’s gonna perk me up better than a latte enema. I am always in favor of having them show up as a lynch pin to any massive global plot. The Knights Templar are like caramel on ice cream and just make a good conspiracy better. I had a lot of fun with the rehash of the Templar’s place in the center of EVERYTHING. 3. Symbology, Da Vinci and the Holy Grail (the IDEA): I thought the major plot components themselves were interesting and I enjoyed following the hidden clues, messages, riddles and the tie in to all of the famous historical artifacts. It was fun. I also liked the “historical significance” of the search (i.e., the “big reveal”) and the implications to the world if revealed. 
TURN OFFS
1. Symbology, Da Vinci and the Holy Grail (the EXECUTION): As much as I enjoyed the plot concept, the execution of the story was often frustrating and occasionally insulting. I’m not talking about the clunky, “serviceable at best” prose as that’s gotten enough play without my squirting lighter fluid on the bonfire. My issue is more with Dan feeling the need to “spoon feed” me details about his “oh so clever plot” so that my economy-sized brain could grasp it. 

For example, there would be a “reveal” that I thought was interesting….and then Dan would exhaust me with explaining EXACTLY what that meant and EXACTLY what the implications were and make sure I knew EXACTLY what he had told me. I get it Mr. Brown, heard you the first time. 2. THRILLer killing amounts of PLOD: For a page turning, actiony thriller, there was just too much sideways movement of the plot and some really unnecessary amounts of plod to the narrative. Part of this has to do with the excessive “hand holding” Dan does with his audience mentioned above. However, there are also WAY too much time spent slowing down to take a look around and where we are and where we’ve been. I started getting the impression that Brown was trying to hit a particular page count for the book and didn’t have anything but filler to loan the pages with. This is never a good thing for this kind of story. 3. The End: Not a big fan of the final resolution of the story and I found it very un climaxy and a bit of a let down. Once we have the big reveal, very little new information ever really got added to the picture and I felt like my curiosity should have been stroked a few more times than it was in the home stretch. This lack of satisfying climax left me with a serious case of “blue brain.” Still, overall, this was a good, serviceable mystery-thriller that seems tailor-made for a warm afternoon on the sand. It isn’t great literature, or even good literature, but it is a good thriller, a good concept and, for the most part, fun. It seems to accomplish pretty much exactly what it set out to do. 2.5 to 3.0 stars.",213,0.9968,0.047,0.829,0.124,0.4736566039663388,NEGATIVE,0.9818
6,258114122,01/07/2012,5.0,"5 stars to Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code. Most folks have seen the movie and probably not read the book. What a loss for them! That said, I know a lot of people don't enjoy Brown's books, believing he is too commercialized and over-exaggerated in his style. While I can understand why someone may think that, I don't agree. I love the complexity of the story, the reality and the fiction, the test of character strength, the puzzles, the different view points. It completely absorbs me... so I fall into the category of those who love him and this style of writing, even if others think his writing isn't fantastic. Doesn't mean I don't love the more classic and richly written novels where it's the imagery and the words that win out, too.I had never heard of Dan Brown in his early years. I heard about the movie being made of the book and how it was coming out relatively soon. I looked it up and saw it had the ""treasure-hunter"" thrill appeal and decided to read the book before the movie could come out and warp my interpretation. So glad I did!It's addicting. Growing up Catholic, I knew most of the religious detail, but once it weaved it art, literature, history and philosophy, I was just enamored with the story. Could it really be true? Maybe I'm related to Adam and Eve too! Ok, let's not get too crazy...Magnificent story-telling. Quick adventure. Beautiful scenes and images. Brown exhibit's intensely good control weaving back and forth between each of the plots, sub-plots and mini-plots. It's as realistic of a treasure hunt as one can get if you are not an adventurer, archaeologist or exhibition-junkie.But what took it to the next level for me was the amount of detail included for every component. It's the intricate of the intricate, relying on pure puzzles to move the story forward. Each new puzzle creates its own spark of drama directing readers to challenge what they do and do not know about Jesus, Mary Magdalene, languages, culture, locations, etc.It hits so many different waves of appeal that I felt it was at the top of its game. And it probably only edged out Angels & Demons because of how tight this story was.

Everything was already on the table, many authors had dealt with the different ideas Brown is mixing together, and finding and recombining conspiracy theories isn´t that complicated. It´s the mix of different topics that interest many people stirred together that make it entertaining for the ones who like art or thrillers, for atheists and religious people, for the ones interested in plot or characterization, it´s just difficult to find someone who would immediately say that she/he isn´t interested in one of the plot vehicles. It doesn´t just relativizes general history, but religious and political history in a way that makes it a prime example of the fact that history and holy texts are written by the winners. Widening the range, questioning the status quo, and making people skeptical regarding omniscience, commandments, and whatever is something of huge importance and Brown did more than Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens combined and multiplied could have done in centuries by reaching so many people and making them think about the legitimation of any kind of belief.Imagine many people would start writing fanfiction like that about different religious texts, expanding universes with new and alternative prophets, letting the whole thing collapse into a parody of itself within years.I tend to equate religious, economic, and political science texts for the simple reason that, as soon as there is one more truth, or in hard science, formulas and equations, the others or even the own one must the wrong.

This was... well, not disappointing, but quite repetitive after reader Angels & Demons. I felt like I should've just read this first instead of trying to work my way through the series from first book in release order.
""I would not wish a British chef on anyone except the French tax collectors.""
It's not that the book was bad, but everything came out like it's the same story as the first using a different core element. While everything good about the first book, the pace, the suspense, the twists are stil here, I don't think there is a ton of novelty here other than some detailed and immersive code-breaking. Even the character setup was quite similar to Angels & Demons, with only a couple of minor changes. But as far as pure entertainment is concerned, Brown does deliver well. Not to mention the improved inclination towards humor, which was a welcoming change. What's not so welcoming is the author's continuous use of a second language for conversations.

This book seems to have changed the minds of many Catholics (my grandfather included) and Protestants alike. Granted, there have long been rumors of secret societies and organizations within the Roman Catholic Church, and historical cover-ups are rampant throughout civilization. HOWEVER,The book is crap. It's not at all well written. Brown seems to feel that in order to impress the mystery of the supposed Holy Grail conspiracy upon his readers, he must be repetitive and condescending. It almost seems that the whole purpose of the book is to tell the world how much Brown knows about obscure art history and symbology, and that he is willing to explain it to the teeming masses of uniformed Christendom. His constant use of cliff-hanger chapter endings (almost every chapter) makes the novel read like it was originally intended as a serial publication. Much of Brown's story hinges upon the loss of the Sacred Feminine, and yet his main female character (a cryptologist for the French police) is constantly having to be led clue by clue to obvious conclusions by her quicker, more worldly, male counterparts.I might have put some stock into Brown's ""history,"" he writes with conviction, if not much style. I may even have looked into some of his sources on my own. Today, though, Brown completely lost any stock I would have put into his actual knowledge. He referred, multiple times, to Jesus Christ as the Immaculate Conception. As every half-informed Catholic knows, Mary was the Immaculate Conception (conceived without sin), Jesus was the Miraculous Conception (conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit).How this novel came to be as popular as it is, I can understand. Everyone today is dying to get to the big TRUTH, something which can never be done in religion. Faith is by definition something that is unsubstantiated, we must just believe. What I can't understand is how people can believe this absolute drivel. ",139,0.5514,0.047,0.895,0.057,0.4083333333333333,NEGATIVE,1.0
16,16111782,02/22/2008,5.0,"For the most part, it seems that people either passionately love this book or they passionately hate it. I happen to be one of the former. For my part, I don't see the book so much as an indictment of the Catholic Church in particular but of religious extremism and religion interfering in political process in general. The unwarranted political control granted to extreme religious organizations like the CBN is an issue that we will be forced to address one way or the other. To my eye, our political process has been poisoned by it and the danger of theocracy is quite real. Furthermore, Brown's indictment of the Church for removing or suppressing feminine divinity figures is justified and needs a much closer look. Women do not have enough of a role in religion, religious practice, heroic myths, and creation myths, nor are they portrayed as divinity figures enough. In short, our religious systems and institutions lack balance and have a bias to suppress issues, stories, and roles that empower women to live as equals to men. Finally, Brown wrote his story simplistically, in my view, to spread his tale to as broad an audience as possible. Though it is not as pristine a narrative as, say, Umberto Eco, the message it conveys is one that needs to be heard. More obscure books on the matter are not as accessible as Da Vinci Code and if someone were to write an accessible book of genius on this subject, I would give him/her all due praise. In the meantime, Dan Brown is telling a story that needs to be told. It is one that has been kept quiet and in the dark for far too long.",128,0.9648,0.062,0.812,0.125,0.4345394736842106,NEGATIVE,0.9757
17,2003776928,06/29/2017,4.0,"Every summer I tend to enjoy reading action and adventure thrillers. The genre seems perfect for the hot weather outside as all of the action builds to a heated crescendo. Last week I participated in a diary called the Pepys Project in one of the groups I am part of, the reading for pleasure book club. The diarist relays pertinent literary information on a daily basis to ones peers. It happened that author Dan Brown celebrated a birthday last week, and as I had never read his best selling DaVinci Code, the diary reminded me that the summer was a good as time as any to partake in this thriller. World renowned Harvard professor Robert Langdon is in Paris to deliver a lecture about his latest findings in cryptic symbology. As Langdon addresses his speech, nearby at the Louvre museum an albino monk on orders from his teacher brutally murders curator Jacques Sauniere. These two events are not mere coincidence as Sauniere had been planning on meeting with Langdon later in the evening. As he lay dying, Sauniere penned cryptic codes to both Langdon and his granddaughter Sophie Neveu. It would be up to the pair to crack these mysteries before the church uncovered the secrets that Sauniere had worked his entire life to guard. Once Langdon and Neveu meet up, together they discover that Sauniere had been the grand master of the Priory of Sion, an ancient society which believed in an alternate true history of Christianity. Sauniere left the duo a trail of clues to find the true resting place of the holy grail, that is before Catholic fanatical sect Opus Dei beats them to it and destroys the information. Through a intricate web of surveillance and bribes, however, Paris of chief police Bezu Fache believes that Langdon and Neveu to be guilty of Sauniere's murder. Ensuing, is a race through Paris and London to ensure that the grail and its secrets do not fall into the wrong hands. Brown details centuries of religious symbols and information as he has Langdon and Neveu quest to keep the Priory's secrets safe. Along the way they meet a number of characters, never knowing if one is friend, foe, or double agent. As a result, the action is fast paced, intriguing, and even brain exercising as I thought alongside the pair to crack open the codes that Sauniere left for them. In a structure of short chapters and changing points of view, Brown created a story that grew more thrilling as it went on. This created for an entertaining denouement which read quickly to the end. While it remains to be seen if the mysteries outlined in The DaVinci Code are fact, fiction, or somewhere in between, Dan Brown has created a fun concept that makes for thrilling summer reading. The novel grew to be an international best seller and later made into a movie starring Tom Hanks. Even though movies are usually not as good as their novel counterparts, Brown's thriller should translate well onto screen as it is all action. The Pepys Project lead me to a summer reading adventure, which I rate 3.75 stars. I look forward to Dan Brown's next installment starring Robert Langdon.

20,9224533,11/17/2007,1.0,"This book, and everything written by Dan Brown (to varying degrees), represent much of what I most dislike about pop literature. First of all, Mr. Brown, despite teaching English at Amherst College, is a bad writer. This is not to say that I am a good writer. But I recognize a person who can't ""show"" you vivid scenes, he has to ""tell you"". Various characters wear expensive clothes. How do we know? The text says they're expensive. How do we know Mr. Langdon is brilliant? The text makes no bones about telling us. Langdon is also famous. Blah.Furthermore, Mr. Brown's books are ridiculously formulaic. Every single ""thriller"" that he has written to date begins with the murder of a key character at the hands of a shadowy and ""terrifying"" assassin individual/group. This group is controlled by a larger group with dubious intentions that generally have to do with world domination. The protagonist is introduced as an ""expert"" whose credentials relate to the matter at hand, and who takes the job of hunting down the bad guys. He enlists the aid of an extremely avuncular, wise, benevolent helper. This person provides assistance as the protagonist (with a love interest) finds clues to the murder, attempts to find the bad guys, is pursued by the assassin(s), all while TIME IS RUNNING OUT. The avuncular father figure turns out to be pulling the strings of the assassins, is behind the original killing, and provides a forgettable monologue at the end where he pleas for understanding. But our hero takes him down. The end. I'm sorry if I just ruined all Dan Brown's books for you. Finally, Mr. Brown likes to write about what he sees as religious conflicts. These conflicts take place between believers and non-. Unfortunately, he proves unable to adequately and convincingly describe these conflicts, because he reveals a striking inability to understand why people believe, in the first place. His highly religious characters therefore invariably turn out to be crazed nutjobs. I don't like stories that exploit religion for entertainment, and then use the attention that they draw to this entertainment to subtly undermine the reasons for faith. But by all means, read the Da Vinci Code. People say it's smart. Others describe it as a fast-paced thriller with historical and theological implications.

A desperate race through the cathedrals and castles of Europe. An astonishing truth concealed for centuries . . . unveiled at last.While in Paris, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is awakened by a phone call in the dead of the night. The elderly curator of the Louvre has been murdered inside the museum, his body covered in baffling symbols. As Langdon and gifted French cryptologist Sophie Neveu sort through the bizarre riddles, they are stunned to discover a trail of clues hidden in the works of Leonardo da Vinci—clues visible for all to see and yet ingeniously disguised by the painter.Even more startling, the late curator was involved in the Priory of Sion—a secret society whose members included Sir Isaac Newton, Victor Hugo, and Da Vinci—and he guarded a breathtaking historical secret. Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the labyrinthine puzzle—while avoiding the faceless adversary who shadows their every move—the explosive, ancient truth will be lost forever. My Review: Not one word. I mean it. Not ONE WORD of criticism for this book's three-star rating. It is not Literature, it is not even particularly well-written farb, but it is undeniably a page-turning rip-snorting adventure story that pokes fun at christian religion. Therefore it is A-Okay with me.Snobs: It's not about you. It's about normal people getting their entertainment from a book for once, instead of a TV or a gaming console. Why are you bitching? Who said you had to read it?Lovers: It's not about how much you love it. I didn't love it. I read the whole thing in a sitting and I wasn't about to get up until it was done, and that's saying a lot for someone whose life list of books read includes the snooty people's snootiest books. So yeah, three-star review is a huge vote of confidence from this source.Religious christians: What in the hell are you doing reading my reviews?! Are you daft? I won't be saying anything nice about your imaginary friend any time soon. Pass on!Environmentalists: Yes, the entirety of Siberia was deforested to print the book in its zillions. I feel bad about that too. Tell you what: Get out there and make hemp paper (better for the environment, plus a smokeable side product!) on a commercial scale. Books will go down in price, forests will be saved, and the mellow quotient of the world will go up. Win-win-win!Normal people: You've all read the book by now, right? If not, go to a used bookstore (Brown's rich enough) and pick a few up. It's a lot of fun.

That's one of the hallmarks of poor writing.Even if I were not a practicing pagan, I would find it stretching credibility that every single item the characters run across is a symbol of goddess worship. Five pointed star? Goddess worship. Chalice? Goddess worship. Porcelain toilet bowl? Goddess worship. Pilot ball point pen? Goddess worship. You get the general idea. Not only is every item part of the mythology of the divine feminine, but every number is also part of the divine feminine. Hello? Is a cigar NEVER just a cigar? And some of the claims of symbolism are just plain wrong, as the editor would have found out if he'd bothered to do some fact checking. Remember those military chevrons that, because of the way they were pointed, represented the female divine and those poor slobs of soldiers had been running around all these countless centuries with goddess symbols flaunted on their uniforms without knowing it? The only problem with that premise is that the chevrons facing in their current direction is relatively recent - according to my military historian husband, they faced the OPPOSITE direction for quite some time before being reversed (for what reason, I have no idea...unless the generals all got together and decided they didn't have quite enough goddess symbols on their uniforms and needed it fixed post haste).My theology professor ended up traveling around the country giving talks about this book to thousands of interested people. He loves the book if only because he's now giving pretty much the same information that he used to give to dozing freshman and sophomores to packed theaters of interested listeners.

27,971092827,06/18/2014,5.0,"I am utterly stupefied by this masterpiece and Dan Brown's ability to blur the lines between the real and the fictional, as he did in the first book in the Robert Langdon series. It's a mouthwatering book, always keeping you on the edge, from page one up until the last page I could hear my own heart beating because of the thrill. I had found the first book extraordinary when I read it three months ago and I'm so glad I finally read it, especially after all those years of reading the controversial reviews regarding this book, which is so full of cryptic messages and honestly is amazing to see how our two protagonists decipher those messages, ultimately leading to the truth. To my view, this one far exceeded the first book of the series. The formula was almost the same, although now we didn't have the illuminati, it was a sole man, not an entire organization ready to take down an entire city. I really really love how Brown took real events, real symbols etc and wove them into such an intricate story about a secret that could change everyone's beliefs, change the entire world as we know it. Take Da Vinci's most famous painting to kick off your story nicely and artistically, add a secret organization protecting a powerful secret, add some lies and deceit and lots of intrigue and yes that's the formula to creating an incredible book. But it takes a masterful author to create an incredible book such as this one.I won't start talking about the protagonists because I'm never gonna stop babbling about their awesomeness. Langdon just rose on the scale of my list of the most brilliant characters, meanwhile I loved Sophie Neveau as the companion of Robert. They fit amazingly good together, always filling the blanks together and assisting each other when they hit an insurmountable cryptic message which neither thought they could decode.I am in awe by Brown's amazing mind. The way he writes, all those details of real, existing history and art, all mixed together... He must be a genius, and he must have done one hell of a research before writing this.

The fact is, I... er... I... I'm sorry, this is rather difficult for me... I once, ah, I once wrote a letter to a national newspaper supporting Dan Brown's book. And had it published. OK, I've said it, and now I feel better. (Wipes sweat from forehead). I tried to find the offending item just now on Google, but it looks as though well-meaning people have done their best to hide the evidence. I'd really like to thank them for that. Anyway, if you search on my name and ""Da Vinci Code"" or ""Dan Brown"", you'll find pointers to it, though I've so far been unable to retrieve the actual text.As far as I can recall, the background was roughly as follows. A columnist in the Independent, Christina Patterson, had written an article in which she dismissively attacked The Da Vinci Code, and cited a recent interview with the author. Mr Brown had been asked why he thought his book was a success, and had said something about how he believed that what people liked was books with ""puzzles and treasure hunts"". Patterson remarked with evident contempt that there were no puzzles and treasure hunts in, if I'm remembering correctly, Shakespeare, Dickens or Tolstoy.Well... I'm a big fan of due process. I thought Saddam Hussein was a monster who deserved death fifty times over; but I opposed the Iraq War on the grounds that virtually the only bad thing he hadn't done was to harbor secret weapons of mass destruction, which was the ostensible reason for invading his country. My feelings about Dan Brown were similar. So the letter pointed out that Ms. Patterson was just cherry-picking her authors. As far as I was aware, she was quite correct in saying that Shakespeare, Dickens and Tolstoy didn't do puzzles and treasure-hunts; but if she'd wanted to argue the contrary position, she could just as easily have cited Lewis Carroll, James Joyce and Vladimir Nabokov. The real problem with Dan Brown was not the subject matter, but the quality of the writing.Sigh. I thought I'd better come clean.

**3.5 stars**“History is always written by the winners. When two cultures clash, the loser is obliterated, and the winner writes the history books-books which glorify their own cause and disparage the conquered foe. As Napoleon once said, 'What is history, but a fable agreed upon?”
Dan Brown has written quite a few books over the years, and I know the years are past when he was my favorite author (probably for being amongst the selected handful I had read)…but this one still has a place quite close to my heart. I can’t think of a more definitive reason, except that I had read it in one sitting 😊😊It’s a bit impossible to remember now how many people had recommended me the book, practically everybody I guess, including my parents, history teacher and classmates. However only after I had it finished, I came to know they all did so mainly after watching the movie… I suppose it was like being a bit crestfallen, anyway back to the novel.Now, if I think of it, the pattern in which Brown had begun his time-congested tale is one that can be masqueraded with such ease, in fact, I found a few striking similarities in his storytelling with a particular novel by Sidney Sheldon, which of course Dan Brown has had revered to as his inspiration in multiple interviews. I don’t think anyone who has read the popular thrillers of these sub-genre will have any trouble in empathizing the multiple perspective narrative with others…it’s not my intention to spoil the fun but even at this moment right next to me sits a trilogy by a popular Indian author, 2 of which can be easily viewed as ‘inspirations’ of Da Vinci Code.If you even turn a blind eye to the obviously less significant thriller part and look at the historical significance, undoubtedly that’s the part where the novel does excel. So much so, it managed to create a huge number of fanatics (including myself at the earliest stage) who start picking up every novel or historical work in which this context has been confabulated, if not at least regarded. I haven’t read all of Robert Langdon novels, to be honest. But from what I have, this one does stand out as my favorite, mostly due to the reason that it worked as an inspiration to get me through books I wouldn’t have otherwise. But I do find the character of the protagonist seriously underutilized; I gave up on him after trying to connect through three of his adventures.On a note of recommendation, I don’t think anyone who’s reading this review hasn’t done one of the 2: watch or read. But if you’re still out there with neither, you definitely can choose the novel. Be just a bit cautious of the cons., but be absolutely sure of its historical authenticity. 
“Every faith in the world is based on fabrication. That is the definition of faith―acceptance of that which we imagine to be true, that which we cannot prove. Every religion describes God through metaphor, allegory, and exaggeration, from the early Egyptians through modern Sunday school. Metaphors are a way to help our minds process the unprocessible. The problems arise when we begin to believe literally in our own metaphors.Should we wave a flag and tell the Buddhists that we have proof the Buddha did not come from a lotus blossom? Or that Jesus was not born of a literal virgin birth? Those who truly understand their faiths understand the stories are metaphorical.”

That is that I have seen the film first before reading the book. Let me explain...Although this book is very well written and obviously extensively researched, I find that because I have already watched the film and there really aren't any surprises for me in all the back stories of things and characters mentioned in the book that it is more daunting to read then it is fascinating as probably was the original intention.I also feel like having watched the film first and enjoying such a fast-paced story that the book just seems long to read. I know what's coming even with the settle differences between the book and the film and I guess I am wanting more of that fast-paced that I get in the film when unfortunately I don't feel like I'm getting it from the book. Dan Brown writes his chapters to be very short and I believe that he does this in order to add to the thrill and the pace of the book but unfortunately it did not work on me.I really just think that watching the film first has ruined the book for me which is very very unfortunate because this is obviously a very good book that a lot of people have enjoyed but because the movie is so dear to my heart I feel like the book just doesn't stack up to it.

This is one of the best and most amazing novels I've ever read!When I finished it at almost 3 am, I couldn't sleep.From the instant the book starts, Dan Brown immediately grabs the readers attention, grabbing them by the throat and making them read on right until the end!I like conspiracy theories, so the whole basis of the book was interesting.Obviously most of what is in the book is fiction, but Brown's story telling makes you think it's real. I thought his use of real places, people and events in what is a fictional story was very clever.If you're into mystery/suspense genre, history or secret societies, I recommend this.If you are a devout Christian, I don't think I'd recommend this book.",43,0.8952,0.016,0.88,0.103,0.4680272108843537,POSITIVE,0.9998
37,159257545,04/06/2011,1.0,"I didn't realize I never bothered with a review for this; I'm cranky today, so now seems like a good time. The only good thing about having read this (probably ten years ago) was that I did not pay for it. The woman I was working for at the time forced me to read it; she had read it and thought it was wonderful, and since I had some kind of reputation as a reader she wanted (demanded, actually) my opinion. I gave it to her. I don't really think that has anything to do with the fact that I didn't work for her much longer. I really did hate this book. I hated this book before I knew it was cool to hate it. The writing was mediocre – that's not why I hated it, though it made (makes) me sick that something that led the best-seller list for approximately a hundred and sixty-three years was so bad. I don't generally go for international suspense thriller type things – that's not why I hated it either. I was raised Catholic, and this was an absurd view of a conspiracy-laden church that was so dumb as to be offensive – but that – the Vatican's opinion aside – is still not why I hated it. The reason I got that blue-laser-beam duck-and-cover light in my eyes when I read this was that it completely and totally screwed with art history. I kick myself once in a while that I deleted the web page I put up at the time outlining and illustrating the things Dan Brown simply got wrong about the paintings and artists he pretended to know so much about. There was a lot of stuff up there. I'm no expert; I went to art school, though, and the best teacher I ever had in any subject happened to be the one who taught History of Western Art. It offended me on her behalf that there was so much garbage spewed out in this book. Someone defensively said to me once that at least it was bringing attention to Da Vinci and art and the Louvre and … stuff. To me that's like saying an A-list celebrity benefits from the attention of paparazzi. There's a strong similarity: if all a person goes by is the sordid and erroneous crap spoon-fed to them by such authorities as Dan Brown or the National Enquirer, they would be better off remaining completely ignorant.

39,73388712,10/04/2009,2.0,"This wasn’t nearly as awful as I had feared. I had lots of reasons to believe this would be pretty awful, but actually, the story moved along nicely and there was enough to the story to sustain my interest nearly up until the end – in much the same way that any good murder mystery sustains interest. This isn’t the best murder mystery novel I’ve ever read – but it is not a terrible one either.Having said that it might seem a little strange that I’ll spend virtually all of this review talking about the things I didn’t like about the book. Oh well, if being ‘a little strange’ is all I get accused of I can say with confidence that I have been accused of much worse.It does not take long for the book to do something I think is nearly unforgivable in any book. I’ll quote the first time this happens in full:Saunière held up his hands in defense. ""Wait,"" he said slowly. ""I will tell you what you need to know."" The curator spoke his next words carefully. The lie he told was one he had rehearsed many times... each time praying he would never have to use it.Needless to say, the lie told here is somewhat important to the plot and we only find out more about it later in the book.This quote is from the very start of the book, a mere thirteen paragraphs in. This sort of writing happens early and then repeats for much of the rest of the book. This sort of writing really annoys me.When you read a book there are a number of people who you find are talking to you. There is the voice of the book itself (the narrator), there is often the person whose story this voice is telling you, there are other relatively incidental characters who chime in now and again and, of course, there is the author. Now, each of these people know a bit more or a bit less about what is actually going on in the story. And that’s okay, that’s also the way life works. But you might notice that I’ve made a distinction between the narrator of the story and the author. Obviously, there are times when this distinction if absolutely necessary – for example, where it is necessary to tell a story where the narrator of the story (the voice doing the talking) can’t in anyway be considered the same person as the author. In The Catcher in the Rye, for example, it is obviously a character, Holden Caulfield, who is supposed to be doing the talking – but no one would argue that Holden is Salinger. Holden is clearly a creation of Salinger’s and for the book to make sense it is important to keep that distinction clear. But behind the voice of Holden, if you listen carefully enough, you will hear the whispering voice of Salinger.In this book that might seem to be a less important distinction to make. This is because the text is written in what is called ‘omniscient narration’. In this book the narrator is a kind of God and he can see into the hearts of all of the characters in ways we lesser mortals can never do in the real world. When he says that a character is happy or confused or lustful – then there is no possibility that that character can be anything else. If the Christian God really is interested in giving us free will, then an author of a piece of omniscient narration has even more power than God. But even so, I think it is important to be able to distinguish between the author of a book and the omniscient narrator within the book – even in cases where they would seem to be very closely aligned. Let’s go back to the quote above and why it does something that really annoys me. When I read a mystery story I want the mystery to be intrinsic to the story. The writer should know where the story is going, but I don’t need the narrator to necessarily know. All the same, I do need to be able to trust the narrator. I want to trust that the narrator will tell me something like the truth (or not, but in a way that can be fun for me to see where the narrator is distorting the truth), but I really don’t want the narrator to mess me about. I want the voice of the book to tell me stuff that the voice knows and to be clear with me about that.So, in the quote above where Saunière tells his captor what he knows BUT WE ARE NOT TOLD what he says, there can be only one reason for this – the narrator has decided that telling us what is being said at this point in the story will somehow spoil the mystery. And, to me, that is the weakest form of mystery story telling. To me, the mystery should be in the story itself, something deeply embedded in the very nature of the story and how the story needs to be told. In this case it is as if the narrator is saying, “I’ll explain to you what gets said here in my own good time”. And look, that would be fine, except that a mystery that needs the narrator to effectively tell the reader that they are keeping something secret from them to create the mystery is, to quote my daughters, a bit lame. Actually, there can be two reasons for this kind of secret keeping, the other is more likely in this case – it is to ‘heighten suspense’. This is a very dangerous game for a writer to play. Suspense that is artificially created, not by the story, but by how the story is told can quickly become very irritating.The distinction between the writer and the narrator is perhaps best shown by this little piece of self-congratulation in the book.  ""A brilliant ten-digit code that Saunière would never forget."" Now, think about what is actually being said here. The narrator has explained a code that was created by one of the characters called Saunière – all well and good – except, of course, we all know that really Dan Brown actually created the code. The code’s brilliance is that it links in with some mathematics that is seen as somewhat important to the plot (Fibonacci sequences). But behind the voice of the narrator congratulating Saunière on his brilliance is the author who came up with this plotting point in the first place. So hearing the narrator say how brilliant Saunière has been is really nothing more than the writer saying how terribly clever he thinks he has been in coming up with this idea in the first place. If you are thinking of writing a novel, avoiding this sort of self-congratulation would be one of my main pieces of advice.This is a work of fiction, and so I guess it makes little sense to criticise it for the historical or factual inaccuracy of large slabs of its subject matter – nevertheless, I prefer my fiction to be in the story, rather than in what are presented as historical facts. The one that annoyed me the most was this bit about the Mona Lisa: Langdon nodded. ""Gentlemen, not only does the face of Mona Lisa look androgynous, but her name is an anagram of the divine union of male and female. And that, my friends, is Da Vinci's little secret, and the reason for Mona Lisa's knowing smile.""Effectively we are told that Da Vinci was very clever in naming the painting because it fits nicely with one of the main themes of this book, the union of the male and female. The only problem is that Da Vinci never called the painting the Mona Lisa. As my mate Wiki points out:The painting's title stems from a description by Giorgio Vasari in his biography of Leonardo da Vinci published in 1550, 31 years after the artist's death.There are other historical inversions of this kind in the book, but my personal favourite is the fact that Catholicism is held up to scorn for its rejection of the ‘sacred feminine’. But of all of the Christian sects, I would have thought the Catholic Church, with its idolatry of Mary, the mother of God, would be the least deserving of this charge. The other Christian Churches seem to refer to ‘the Mother Church’ as the ‘Cult of Mary’. I would have thought the Catholic Church would have been a much more difficult target for the charge of rejection of the female than any of the Protestant Churches as they are purely interested in male divine beings with no mediation of the feminine possible or permissible at all.I don’t think I’ve included any spoilers in this review, although that might depend somewhat on what you want to read this book for – I don’t think I’ve said anything that would destroy a reading of the book as a murder mystery, which is where I believe this book works best. I mean, as philosophy it is nonsense, as theology it is a smile on a doll and as Symbology (even if that is a ‘discipline’ Dan Brown made up all by himself) it is pretty shallow stuff. The bit at the end where Langdon needed the Star of David explained to him really did make the premise that Langdon is an expert in this field ring somewhat hollow. It may be that I am the last person in the world to have read this book – as such the whole question of spoilers is somewhat academic. All the same, if you have not read it already I need to stress that it is not nearly as bad as people make it out to be. Sure, some of the writing will make you cringe, but at least the story moves along at a decent clip – and of what is pretty well trash, there is little more you can ask than that.Oh, and by the way, I like to collect ‘best first lines in novels’ – Calvino’s If On a Winter's Night a Traveler comes close to the best, but Jolley’s Miss Peabody's Inheritance has a good first sentence as does Carey’s Bliss. But this book has given me a new hobby, that is in finding the worst last line of a book.

51,26773923,07/09/2008,1.0,"If for some reason you haven’t heard of the Da Vinci Code before now, I have no help for you. I live under a fairly substantive rock, and even I had heard of this book to death. I had even attempted to read it once or twice, during my stint at Waldenbooks, but couldn’t really get into it. So I gave up, and decided to relegate it to the same place as Titanic and Forrest Gump—works of popular culture that I have no interest in, and therefore, will not partake of. But in a testament to the power of the feminine wile, SV convinced me to read it, and so, at the suggestion of Professor Mortis, borrowed a copy from my local library before setting out for the Thanksgiving holiday (Thanks to PG and Laurion for their lending offers, though I did not take them up on it.).So what did I think of this incredibly popular, highly controversial work that sold literally millions of copies, spawned a movie, and produced comments from the Vatican itself? In a word, it’s bad. Other appropriate single words might be awful, atrocious, terrible, or abominable. Other similar synonyms can be found here.The Da Vinci Code is a combination of bad writing, shoddy history, poor plotting, and unconvincing characters that blends together to form a barely readable work. The fact that anyone took this work seriously in any capacity is amazing to me. The characters are flat, boring, and none of them exceed two dimensions at best. The “history” is so riddled with holes as to be completely unbelievable to the semi-alert observer (my favorite part is the explanation of how the Church’s desire to destroy the “sacred feminine” is responsible for Orthodox Jews and devout Muslims barring women from certain rites.). And finally, the plot just makes no damn sense. Even the much vaunted puzzles are fairly trite, and usually explained so quickly that it’s barely worth thinking about. The final puzzle that the main character is faced with is so mind-bogglingly obvious that anyone who knows how to draw a Mogen David (Star of David) can figure it out instantly.So the question for me became this: given how awful this book is, why the hell is it so popular? I can offer the following explanations/observations.First off, Brown employs a clever (and I use the term loosely) narrative structure in which he ends every single chapter on a cliffhanger. This forces the reader to continue reading, hoping to reach a payoff or stopping point that is never quite realized. Thus the reader keeps going to the next chapter, hoping to finally hit a point where the story will relax, only to discover that the story never really relaxes. It just plods relentlessly forward, like the Terminator chasing Sarah Connor with a SuDoKu puzzle.In a similar vein, Brown keeps his chapters short. In fact, I’ve read verse poetry that was longer than some of the chapters in this book (and considerably better written). This helps the reader feel as though they are making progress, because they’re suddenly on Chapter 44, and can reach Chapter 50 with only a few extra minutes of reading. Hooray for the short attention span.Likewise, Brown taps into some popular political and historical fallacies that are guaranteed to make him well-liked. Namely that the Catholic Church is an evil conspiracy (Christianity is one of the few religions it’s still ok to hate in this day and age, after all) and the notion that ancient Europeans were all ecologically conscious, goddess-worshipping pacifists until the evil patriarchy destroyed their edenic culture. And hey, both of those are popular, if totally un-nuanced and historically questionable viewpoints, but shoddy history is always popular with the masses. The popularity of this book is proof enough.Knowing that I’m one of the last people in the United States to have read this book, I can hardly imagine my recommendation can save anyone at this point, but on the off hand chance it can—don’t read this book. It’s a waste of time. At the very least, take it out of the library so you don’t put more money into the pocket of an author of questionable talent. There’s much better writers in this world.",33,0.9826,0.119,0.727,0.155,0.5369184430027805,NEGATIVE,1.0

53,415878287,09/16/2012,2.0,"Where I got the book: I downloaded the audiobook on my Audible subscription back when The Da Vinci Code was a Big Thing, so I suppose I have to admit I technically bought it. A Bad Book Buddy Read with Crystal Starr Light.Plot: The Divine Feminine, mystical messages, the Knights Templar, Opus Dei, secret societies, coded paintings, you name it - Dan Brown packs a Discovery Channel-load of what he gets one of his characters to call ""pop schlock"" around a puzzle to be solved by granite-jawed Harvard Professor of Symbology (still makes me laugh every time I think about it) Robert Langdon, a tweedy brainiac, and French police cryptologist Sophie Neveu, who is touted as brilliant but who spends most of the time playing second fiddle to Langdon's encyclopedic knowledge as they run around Europe (in about a 48-hour time period, I believe) being chased by the Evil Catholic Church, the French police, and assorted other baddies. This Europe-wide clue chase has been set in train by Sophie's grandfather who, while being murdered, somehow manages to set up a ridiculously elaborate trail to lead our heroes to the Big Secret.Confused? Remember the movie, where Tom Hanks spends 99% of the time with a puzzled frown on his face and the dumbest hairstyle I have EVER seen him wear?[image error]That frown is reflected on my face as I try to figure out how in the world this novel got to be so popular. I think the answer lies in the fact that if you just give up on any attempt to analyze what DB is positing, don't worry about the writing and just go with the flow, you get a page-turner that hurtles you toward the point where you are mercifully done with the book. That's what that second star is for. And there are tons of people who love all that esoteric-mystery stuff, plus the book came to the attention of a certain type of Christian who is very easy to bait into perceiving any criticism of any aspect of Christianity as A HUGE THREAT, and the resulting kerfuffle must have had DB's publicist offering up heartfelt prayers of thanksgiving.Nope, I'm still puzzled. On my second time around I really paid attention to the writing, and came to the conclusion that The Da Vinci Code is a truly execrable piece of prose that manages to include just about every mistake wannabe novelists are told to avoid. I particularly love the way you're in the middle of an exciting chase-around and then the action suddenly GRINDS TO A HALT while Langdon launches into yet another of his explanations. And the bits where DB was obviously writing with a map of Paris and a guidebook at his elbow, so that you get turn-by-turn street nav and a guided tour of wherever they happen to be, down to the exact dimensions of the room.And can you say plot illogicalities? And what about the Moving Body Parts (""Langdon's eyes followed her arm to the structure ahead"")? And DB's cringeworthily bad understanding of British, well, everything, as personified in Sir Lee Tebing ('twas an audiobook so the spelling may be wrong, I personally like Surly T-Bing). The other characters, even those who should have known, kept calling him Sir Tebing (it should be Sir Lee) and even, at one glorious moment, ""your knightship"". And he put clotted cream in his tea... please see this discussion so I don't have to go over it again. Last but definitely not least, there was supposed to be some sexual attraction between Langdon and Neveu but any time DB went there it was as awkward as watching your brother come on to your BFF. There's something eerily virginal about Langdon which, I swear, manages to communicate itself to Hanks. Never have I seen the Tom look less attractive.This is definitely not the best book to listen to as an audiobook unless you are very, very masochistic. The narrator has to do huge chunks of the story in a French accent and then there's Lee Tebing, who got a ludicrously overblown stage British heehaw voice in my version. Then there was the pronunciation of Louvre as LOOV and Tuileries as TOOLERIES but you know, I've got to hand it to this guy - to wade through a reading of this scab on the body literary must be quite the endurance test.As a Bad Book read, it's superb. I had to stop about every two minutes in some chapters because there were just so, so many things wrong with this book. See here for the full roundup. I did, however, fall asleep in a couple of places, as I have done EVERY TIME I have attempted to watch the movie.Finding the Hanks images has been about the only thing that's kept me going through this review.

55,414280464,09/14/2012,2.0,"""...if I agree to publish an idea like this...it'll kill your reputation. You're a Harvard historian, for God's sake, not a popshlockmiester looking for a quick buck.""""Renowned Symbologist"" Robert Langdon was supposed to meet Jacques Sonier one night; instead, he gets called to the Louvre, the scene of Sonier's horrific death. Langdon spots clues to Sonier's murderer everywhere, which makes the French police officer, Fache, immediately think that Langdon is the murderer. Fortunately, sexy Sophie intervenes to shunt Langdon away. And then they are off, trying to avoid being arrested, trying to find the ""Grail"", and trying to discover who killed Sonier.NOTE 1: My French is atrocious; expect misspellings everywhere.NOTE 2: Light spoilers to follow.This book has been quite controversial. A lot of Christian and Catholic churches have been up in arms about the claims Dan Brown makes in this book--namely how Jesus married Mary Magdalene and how the Church will stop at nothing to try to conceal this ""horrific and world-altering"" religious conspiracy.Let's get this out right off the bat: I don't know if Jesus was married. Tradition has it that he was not, but since I wasn't there, I can't say for certain. All I know is that, if I learned Jesus was in fact married, I would probably be surprised, but I'm not going to suddenly abandon my faith just because of Jesus' relationship status. And while this may create a bit of controversy if it ever does appear to be true (I think there was a recent article that gave more evidence to this), I think a lot of people are just going to believe that it's all a bunch of lies. Good grief, stop making mountains out of molehills.""Controversial"" non-controversy aside, this was an absolutely unintentionally hilarious book. Characterization is astonishingly bad, the pacing is dull, the clues somehow end up between too easy and too difficult, the mystery is snooze-worthy, and the narrator's over-the-top French accent sent me into gales of laughter.Our main characters are Gary Stu and Mary Sue--I mean, Robert Langdon and Sophie Noveau. Langdon is one of the most boring male protagonists I've had to read in recent history. I love how he supposedly looks so ""bookish"", with descriptions like this:""His usually sharp blue eyes looked hazy and drawn tonight. A dark stubble was shrouding his strong jaw and dimpled chin. Around his temples, the grey highlights were advancing, making their way deeper into his thicket of coarse black hair. Although his female colleagues insisted the grey only accentuated his bookish appeal, Langdon knew better.""George Clooney anyone?It was painful how every character had to clamor on and on about his ""accomplishments"" and how ""intriguing"" he is, or how the ladies' panties get all wet when he enters a room. If this is not male fantasy, I don't know what is.The weird thing is, when it comes to actually solving the clues/mystery, Langdon is a moron. He spends so long talking about history, symbols, sacred feminine (I got a load on this one...), but he seems severely stumped when trying to solve a few clues. The worst was the mirror-image English. Do you seriously mean to tell me an American can't recognize mirror-image English? I, a measly engineer, experimented with reading mirror-image English and had no problems.Meanwhile we have the set of boobs, Sophie. Don't expect her to have a personality or purpose besides being a set of boobs to get captured. I think Sophie is held at gunpoint 800 times in this book. She is even dumber than Langdon, despite being a talented cryptographer. She cannot solve any of the puzzles on her own, even though her OWN GRANDFATHER WROTE THEM.The rest of the cast was goofy and 1-dimensional. Fache might as well twirl a mustache for all the good he does. I had no clue what Arringarosa's purpose in the story was. Silas' Sally Sob Story was so overwrought and cliche, I was laughing at his self-flagellation. And Teabing...good God, Teabing. I have no idea how to classify Teabing. Other than I kept imagining Sir Elton John, and I'm not sure that was the ""characterization"" Brown was going for.But you know, a lot of thrillers are more about the puzzles and mystery and action than the characters. I can buy that. But you also know what? The puzzles, mystery, and action are horrible. The puzzles tend to be the same type over and over and over again. They also seem to somehow be way too complicated (such as translating one word into Greek, doing an anagram, then translating to English???) and way too easy at the same time. There really is no mystery; there are so few characters, that it's pretty obvious who the Teacher is about halfway through the book. And the action? PAH! None, or very, very sparse. Most of the book is long, boring talking scenes where Teabing and Langdon try to out-Wikipedia each other. I'd rather go to Wikipedia and read THAT then read the mangled facts here.The other thing that drove me bonkers was how EVERYTHING, from Walt Disney to Sir Isaac Newton, from playing cards to the Mona Lisa, was about the Sacred Feminism. I don't doubt that the Sacred Feminism had its influence, but come on! It's like Brown randomly threw in artwork or famous people to be a part of his stupid conspiracy theory. It was so bad, I started throwing this guy around my status updates:And the narrator! Good grief! A Geoffrey Harding narrated my copy, and he had the worst accents I've heard in a long time. Sophie sounded like a moron; the French sounded so ridiculous, I had to stop the iPod to laugh. And Harding reads everything in this movie trailer voice that makes the book seem so much more important than it is.The best thing about this book was reading it along with my Goodreads friend. I loved how she would bring up stuff I totally missed or how we would virtual laugh over Dan Brown's ridiculous scenarios.If you want a smart, intelligent read, don't go here.

56,18611979,03/25/2008,1.0,"I freely admit that my disdain for The Da Vinci Code is my own personal backlash over its popularity. Dan Brown isn't a terrible writer, despite facing that charge from many experienced readers. He has a likable style, and he drives the pace of the book relentlessly, which is exactly what one would want from a pulpy adventure that one can take to the beach. Likewise, the charge that The Da Vinci Code is somehow a failure because it is in any way inaccurate or unbelievable is unfair. The story is fiction, after all, and one should expect to have his/her credulity stretched, especially when reading pulp that is written with the screen in mind (as The Da Vinci Code surely was).I even enjoyed the Sunday afternoon it took me to read The Da Vinci Code. It was an absolute waste of time and exactly what I wanted to be doing, sitting on a comfy sofa, drinking tea and reading about self-flagellating albino monks (and other fun things).I've given many books that are just as good as The Da Vinci Code and even some that are worse three stars, and I meant every star. The truth is that on its own merits, I'd have given The Da Vinci Code a similar rating if not for a repeated experience that led to my backlash.At the beginning of every semester, in a bid to get to know my students better, I play a memory game wherein the students provide me with their favourite things (books, food, music) and some personal details (people they hate, people they love, things they are proud of), then I connect something about them, something that stands out for me, with their name. It is a good start in getting to know the students, but it has also led to my hatred for Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code.A good half of the students that enter my courses declare that they don't have favourite books, and/or they've only ever read three books in their lives -- two involuntary (both assigned by an English teacher, and always seeming to include To Kill a Mockingbird) and one voluntary (The Da Vinci Code). What pisses me off most is that even if these people liked The Da Vinci Code, Brown's novel didn't spur them on to read more. They read the The Da Vinci Code, enjoyed it or didn't, then went back to their reading apathy. Moreover, if I could convince people to read one book voluntarily, one book for their pleasure, it would not be ANY cheesy, pulpy, low grade adventure story. It's like pouring a glass of $9 dollar wine for a person who is trying wine for the first time. They may enjoy the glass, but they're not going to choose wine as their alcohol of choice based on Fortant de France. And for that reason, I hate The Da Vinci Code. It is the cheap wine that keeps people away from the joy of good wine, and while I admit that it is the fault of popular culture rather than Dan Brown, each reader I find who stops at The Da Vinci Code makes me hate the book a little bit more.",31,0.9728,0.082,0.782,0.136,0.5823375262054507,NEGATIVE,0.9998

59,2837429144,05/28/2019,1.0,"Ladies and gentlemen I am before the more complicated review that I have to write, and quite possibly will generate the rejection of much of the Goodreads community. First of all, I apologize to everyone who put him like to my review, thinking that he would him the book of the ""Da Vinci Code"" a good note. I must admit, that you underestimate to the ""Da Vinci Code"" thought that a book was very bad, and have come to realize that it is one of the worst books I've ever read. Of course my relationship with this book began long ago, when this book getting hits and had success without any reason. . Everyone seemed to feel fascinated by this book. As I knew, that this book was bad I did know, but I found the misunderstanding of people, who want more my friends. That even though I well informed, despite not having read told me that the book was great, when I retorted them telling them of the numerous historical errors told me, but you have tests, although I would have had them no one would have believed me. This is the first phase the second began when I arrived at Goodreads. I thought that this book would be a short-lived, and would soon be forgotten, but me. So, that most hurt me by misfortune was that large number of Catholic and Christian users put him four, and five star. This review there is to be understood only as a criticism only this book, but certain literary phenomena praised by the public, or which are backed by lobbyists, which we will call the new world order. Is very difficult, which I can understand these people (I apologize to those people who asked me friendship and who does not accept, know now because he does not accept them as friends on Goodreads. Anyway, do not reject their friendship, just not accept them as friends, but, although did not accept them as friends for that reason can follow me, and also write me whenever they want. I will reply to them always with respect, and affection). In this case as the criticism can be long (my intention is to not pass six pages, but I don't think you get it, I will just share links of unknown writers). As a user told me I know that I have all lost, that the books of Dan Brown have triumphed, and has earned a lot of money. If people have not paid attention to the wise words of Anthony Esolen, Amy Welborn, Carl E. Olson, Sandra Miesel, and Michael Coren much less it will lend me a unknown user of goodreads, but as G.K. Chesterton says ""there is nothing closer to paradise to win a battle that was believed lost"". I do several things first thing is to thank a person who I play, it gave it is true, that she is a fan of this book, and unfortunately not going to like anything that I'm going to say about the book. I hope that you will forgive me for what I say. That which is not worth me the excuse that has been given, that it is true that the book is bad, but intrigue is very good. It has not affected my faith (congratulations, but to others, if occurred them), what he says is a lie, but it also says them. Gentlemen I believe, that is the truth with touch without offending anyone. To me I'm not worth the slogan of the daughter of Fu Manchu ""of telling me lies, but tell them to me with sweetness"" I would recommend them to read a story by g. k. Chesterton ""Curse of the golden cross"" because it is the key to everything. Summary it is the story of a murderer, who wants to become a relic, and is disguised as priest and tells a story based on newspapers and novels. That, is what makes Dan Brown guided by the ideology of the new world order, it is inoculated into the reader the politically correct. The first scene of the book shows how bad writing that is. There are times when you do not know, where are each character, and you lose. That, drive very few characters (Langdon, Sophie Neveu, Sauniere, Bezu Fache, Vernet, Silas, Aringarosa, Remy, the editor of Langdon, Remy, Sir Leigh Teabing, and some more police, and still doesn't move them.) The action scenes are very badly written, so that they seem to have died, and then come back, nor I have the temporal structure of the book is very clear to me. The action scenes are very badly written, so that they seem to have died, and then come back, nor I have the temporal structure of the book is very clear to me. A character is in a place, and in some pages will appear in another scenario) I am not a fan of Opus Dei, but it is that Brown says a number of untruths, which, if I ever doubt entered as cash, and read this novel would no doubt enter. None of that tells Mr Brown is new. His sympathetic albino (Silas). It seems to have come out of ""The monk"" M.G. Lewis. He drinks deeply anti-Catholic books, like good descendant of the Mayflower pioneers. Attacks on Opus Dei are not new, other writers anti-Catholic as Sue in ""The wandering Jew"", the own Stendhal ""Red and black"" in Spain we have the case of ""A.M.D.G."" have already seen how these books were used to attack the Jesuits. Opus Dei has already suffered attacks on its inception in a play inspired in ""The Tartuffe"" was an attack on Opus Dei. The own Morris West in his penultimate novel ""Eminence"" part of the plot was to blame the crimes of the dictatorship of Videla Opus Dei. Criticism as excess money, or that they favor among them are more legitimate, but I am in profound disagreement with Mr Brown, they used mescaline, to cause hallucinations, using hair to whip himself (I doubt, that someone use them), and that they bought the acquiescence of the Vatican, and also deeply at odds with the subject of women. There is no regular order of Opus Dei. Another thing, they are not terrorist, and you too has raised the level of influence in the Vatican. As to brainwash other groups I can think of things like the Nmivix that sect, who kidnap women, and prostituted them covered by Hollywood (in fact I am a lover of film, but not the current ideology of Hollywood. We saw in the 1950s, it fell into the McCathysm. It was somewhat contentious, but logical, considering that this ideology has killed 100 million people and is still killing. . The paradox is that we have gone to the extreme opposite in such a way is that if you're not on the left you can do movies, and have seen their bullying recently when Disney which you talked about in his novel, and Netflix threatening mafia way not roll in Georgi a, and Alabama but withdraw their pro-life bills. Mr Brown seemed to me, what he said the Disney was stupid, but seeing as it is attacking what has filled you with money the family unfortunately I assume, that at that point he was right. True, if in the dialogue that Bezu Fache and Langdon have speaking of as misrepresents Hollywood reality why it has allowed them to adapt her novels? Let us be honest Hollywood only makes movies for half of the population, and one feels now when he leaves a room of cinema as John Smith ""The Brave new world""), and as soon as that may be Catholic terrorists again returns to wrong religion. Or the anvil which is the most extreme is terrorist). Another thing that has displeased me book is Mr Robert Langdon, certainly seems a conceited playboy, and with excess of libido (said that he was inspired by Indiana Jones, but Dr. Jones starts skeptical, and at the end just believing). One of the scenes that has most displeased me book is during the investigation. It is the intelligent who is Robert Langdon, and the fool who is the Catholic Bezu Fache is a mixture of bad of Watson-Closseau, to show the ignorant, and stupid, that we are Catholics. Saunieré leaves a message and already Fache this thinks Langdon is guilty, lousy method of detection. Note that does not know you, how the police. Sometimes the author echoes its provincialism, and their ingrained prejudices, as when in page 29 accused the French of being sexist. I see, that you don't know French women, who are the most liberal of the Earth. Mr Brown, who do not agree as the Me Too, unlike us does not convert the French male chauvinists, but a people with common sense, who rejects the NOM. It is not that he is a very religious people. In fact, since the third Republic France is a secular country, but perhaps because they have seen the ears with may 68 Wolf, now is they have transgressed (However, today the most interesting countries of this decrepit Europe are Hungary, and Poland). Page 52, Mr Brown shows his perfect ignorance, that thing most improper of which may be one of the best universities, as Harvard (where you studied. Certainly, to universities or general studies were created by the sexist Catholic Church) Easter Seals have nothing to do with the Ku Klux Klan. Then you sell us the image of the goddesses, I recommend to read another account of the great ""The eye of Apollo"" Chesty. The recently deceased Gene Wolfe understood better than you paganism and in one sentence of his novel ""A soldier of the mist"" captured its essence. If you knew something of paganism, he would know that in reality to the priestess of Astarte and Istar should exercise sacred prostitution. That is what you want our women to become prostitutes. Mr Brown Christianity ended with paganism, as the official religion, but my view did more harm authors as Carneaces Democritus, Epicurus, Aristofenes, Lucretius, Catullus, who laughed at the gods, in such a way, that already the people did not believe in them. Despite the attempt, that made Augusto reform Customs failed, and until the second century they had to prove certain philosophies as stoicism. The problem is that we try to imitate bad paganism and not to the virtuous as of Cornuto, Epictetus, Traseas, Iamblichus. If you read the Iliad, you will notice that the behavior of the gods gives embarrassment. These gods do not deserve to be worshipped. But yet I prefer to the virtuous Pagan, which, to the skeptical pagano, who no longer believe in their gods. Neither ran so they should have recourse to solar deities, that associated as the imperial cult, but of course, if fall emperors, as the imperial authority weakens. Let us be sincere Mr Brown. Today is recalled to Rome, and the Roman Empire because Christians, since those citadels preserved his legacy, and saved texts. Own Chateaubriand in 'The genius of Christianity' shows the superiority in the art of Catholic art against the pagan https://www.goodreads.com/series/1129... as Leonard Da Vinci I disagree with you and Mr Isaacson. I do not deny his homosexuality, but I doubt that as much as the Renaissance is anthropocentric, you worship nature, and rise the classic, yet was still Christian. So Leonard Da Vinci could not be the creator of the Priory of Sion, which is of the Decade of the 50s of the last century. Here we have the real Leonardo. Oh, by the way, that cupcake is not Madeleine, but San Juan Evangelista, and if you don't believe me look at the San Juan Bautista https://www.religionenlibertad.com/cu... The Sacre Couer, is not exotic, but neoclassical style in particular influenced by Byzantine architecture, which influenced Islamic art. On page 158, the Inquisition did not write El Maellus Maleficarum, but two German Dominicans were Kramer and Spranger. It must be said, in Germany there was no Inquisition since in 1236 Bishop Conrad of Marburg was killed. The paradox is that, in Spain, and in Italy where if had Inquisition, despite literature, there was almost no processes of witchcraft, and in countries, where there was who had more processes (not to mention that at the end were Protestants who ultimately burned more Witches). Would recommend you this book ""Brief history of the Inquisition"" of José Ignacio de la Torre https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2... because unlike you, I do not recommend to psychologists and UFOlogists, but historians of truth. By the way, that the Inquisitor, who instructed the process of Zugarramurdi Alonso Salazar and cold. He came to admit, that he did not believe in witchcraft, so the Inquisition, almost not pursued witches, and was a guarantee for a process and a fair. By the way, read a history of the crusades in conditions (here I recommend some historians, Steven Weidenkopf, Thomas F. Madden, Jonathan Riley Smith, Ashbridge and Stephen Runciman, because if not I'm going to think, that Sir Leigh Teabing, and his Robert Langdon them) they gave the Chair in a raffle. Godfrey was not King of Jerusalem, but defender of the Holy Sepulchre. Oh and the Latin King of the second Crusade was not Baldwin II, but his grandson Baldwin III. In addition, I, I'm a big fan of the Crusades, I always thought in my ignorance, that they were to free the Holy places of the Turks, and to defend our Byzantine brothers, and not to protect the memory of the Magdalena. In addition, to me, I love how you change responsibilities Felipe IV and Pepin of Heristal finished with the Templars, and Dagoberto is killed, and make that the Church supports them, and you think that it is the Church who does it. But, how it will help the Church with a King, who contract to a villain, for slapping Pope Bonifacio VIII?) Pope Clement V wasn't inductor, a puppet named by King Felipe IV for their purposes. Oh also the Popes in France were at that time, and not in Rome. As for the Pope, already Zevaco invented that, and Katherine Neville was ahead of you with the cupcake in his novel ""The magic circle"". In terms of the divinity of Christ all the fathers of the Church Saint Ignatius of Antioch, Tatian, Saint Clement of Alexandria, origins, and Tertullian defended it. Therefore, it wasn't a Constantine caprichito, and what was decided in Nicea, is not whether Christ was God or not. In that were agreement all Catholics and Arians, but if Christ was the son of God, or not. No one doubted his divinity, and the books were already determined. The Gospels of Philip and Mary, you cite, on the contrary, apart from very misogynist. Since they make cupcake man. As for the idea that Christ is not God, I will paraphrase C.S Lewis ' call you crazy, blasphemous, or you kneel, and worship him as a God, but not to consider a teacher of morality, because that is what is not "" . Those ideas, apart from that are labels, like the world. Renan, had already proposed it and Gnosticism Anatole France. Precisely the reason, why those books were discarded was due to that they wrote in late, and also instead of emphasizing the humanity of Christ, enhanced his divinity. What the spouse of Christ, already occurred to the great, although a little unorthodox Anthony Burgess and not married to Christ, cupcake, but with such a Sarah, that Sir Leigh Teabing became his daughter. As for what's the lineage Benjamite is telling me, that Madeleine is a descendant of King Saul. I see it, difficult, since except for Mefibal all descendants of Saul were killed. In addition, without sin, you snob, and classist. We live in a democracy, who cares which one is son of King. But, what a coincidence that the descendants of the Magalen praises, and emparenten with the lineage of the Merovingians, just highlight Merovech, Clovis, Chlothar. By the way, that they were known for their religiosity, and not worship the great goddess. That leave it to Robert Graves. It was also the last King Chilperic II. Please read this book ""Stories of the Merovingian times"" https://www.iberlibro.com/buscar-libr... by the way, you will know which was on the verge of going to pique that dynasty, by a civil war between two women, Fradegunda, and Brunequilda. Thus I could not it as an example of how wonderful female. By the way, feels that we are like the bonobo, and that here everything arranged with sex. Man is a social animal capable of controlling his emotions. The Church does not pursue sex, they condemned the abuse, or lack of it, many heresies were banned by condemning it. The Miss Neveu sees his Grandpa behaving as a satyr, but be lenient with him, because it serves to the goddess, and the eternal feminine. Mr Brown, will pay for treatment to people who suffer venereal diseases with the benefits of his novels? Because you said them, you have to imitate Tom Cruise in Eyes Wide Shut. Everything has a risk, and it does not seem right that you us to convert in a satyrs and nymphs. Also have seen the negative effects of pornography, and as it is destroying families? I know what I mean, because I suffer this addiction. By the way, even if you consider it a trickery, don't think, that this rather than congratulate Neveu, not have nor idea of theology, and more when you passed by the mouth of his characters quoting Bible verses. Now let's get to what less I liked the final part which has seemed so cowardly as the inheritance of the wind. At the end is getting into my church policy, and makes what the NWO wants. That is, the progressive to become. It is sad, but in my opinion it is sad, that the alleged villain Aringarosa is right. The keys of the faithful have been due to modernism, and progressive trends. Much of the paedophilia scandals have since little suitable for that Ministry, the famous levada walks people have gotten thanks to the Liberals. What I say is false, you look at the case of the Anglican Church. He did everything that requests that the Catholic, and is now a relic. In addition, those people loves very much power, very little belief in God, and I don't have a church dominated by the new world order. No more interference from the secular power in the Church please. No sincere Catholic goal on its lists referring to Pope, Bernini, and William Shakespeare. This It is as in ""Cold fire"" as Holly Thorne, that chance that all geniuses of mankind were the Priories, also Christian Newton, I tell him, that he did not believe in the eternal feminine. It is not necessary to be the Club Bilderberg, Freemasonry, nor the Skulls and Bones there are more cults, but only the wealthiest people. The real conspiracy is that cupcake is married to Jesus, and our Church has lied to us, but a group of plutocrats use to this gentleman, to submit to its control, and change the domain of our Church by nothing benign tyranny of some Gates, Soros, Rockefeller, Ford, plutocrats that chance, that those are the ones who dominate the world, and no one attacks them. Precisely, I do not think that the worst book of Mr Brown is this. In ""Angels & demons"" prequel it this, I said, that the Church could exist, provided that the NOM be progressive. In ""Inferno"" shows us the requests of the plutocrats. Not to have children, because if not shall the world.. Instead of opening the dead would have been more useful, as the journalist Pablo J. Ginés holds a Marshall plan for the countries of the third world already in 'Origin' commitment to atheism. Unfortunately I think, that his following novels will try to make to humanity (my friend Alfonseca and I talk a lot of the Antichrist. I believe that a person, and he will be an ideology, his theory is true. This would be the Antichrist. The solution is not to ban books like these, nor burn them, but read good books, or do not wish Mr Brown the fate of Salman Rhusdie. This it was talking to Manny and Madeleine people who has free will, not should be banned anything but against bad books I recommend to read good books. In a post I'll recommend some, but they are the di in my review of ""King receives"" who want to can order me the complete list https://www.goodreads.com/review/show... ).

61,261762342,10/21/2020,3.0,"This can be okay if:- you treat it as a fantasy-universe setting in which a bunch of cryptohistory and other half-arsed research is true - and ignore frustrating and irresponsible author interviews about the novel being based in historical fact;- you like big dumb action movies, and therefore you are capable of getting some enjoyment out of mediocre thrillers as long as there are plenty of action and chase scenes;- you assume that the publishers weren't going to spend much on editing, because in 2003, Dan Brown's books had sold fewer than 10 000 copies each (according to Wikipedia); editors working on behalf of big publishers are expensive, and this novel would need many hours of work. There are so many articles about The Da Vinci Code, I couldn't now locate info about the publishers' expectations of it pre-release. Another possibility is that it had so much publicity baked in from the start that, regardless of criticism, it was bound to succeed with the sort of readers who literally buy into that, rather like American Dirt on a smaller scale in 2020. But if they were putting big money into it from the start, why not more editing?There is plenty that could be improved in line-editing without even changing the story, bothering about academic inaccuracies, and there would be no need to make the book any less accessible in doing so. As it is, the narrative is confused about accessibility: it informs the reader what the Champs-Élysées is in the middle of a car chase; it sometimes, though not always, has academically brilliant characters take ages over simple points or be shocked by common ideas; yet it also uses, unglossed, specialist architectural terms, despite being written at a time when there weren't e-readers with built-in dictionaries.I am not interested in Templar conspiracy type stuff, and I so was bored around the middle of the book, where characters were sitting around having lengthy conversations about the Grail and so forth. However much of the rest of the time there was such a lot happening that the subject in hand was of secondary importance. Quite a lot of thriller sequences were reasonably-enough written and/or sufficiently eventful that they distracted me from a the sense that this story should be something I was reading in a Word document whilst tracking changes, not for leisure and no pay. Though the general allusions to history and old buildings, however ropey, probably helped my enjoyment a bit. The contrast of these with the early 00s technology also made me realise how much I'd rather read a thriller or adventure in a pre-21st century setting.There is plenty of unintentional absurdity in it - and a surprising degree of clumsiness about upper-class Brits, but then you can read it as a fantasy universe in which 'Sir Leigh Teabing' is a remotely plausible name, and where even academics, never mind any people other than elderly Tory matrons, are impressed that someone had been a Royal Historian. (Caps seem to be imply this was a royal household appointment.) The level of class deference to and among British characters is IME exaggerated, a perennial mistake of contemporary American Anglophiles. But, aside from the many terrible dad-jokes (which I did not expect) there are also scenes that were surely meant to be funny, and were funny, like a car chase in a Smart, and, when a bank van is stopped, a wonderfully audacious conversation that made me hoot with laughter. I had accidentally seen a spoiler on Wikipedia when I was about halfway through the book. I actually became convinced for a while that the spoiler was wrong, which says something in favour of the creation of suspense in the book - even if too much of that is done via the lazy route of withholding information from the reader, including when doing close third-person narrative of characters who'd know something. The plot point that made me think the spoiler was wrong did also seem to overegg the power of a technology.My ambivalence towards the book was perhaps strongest when I would be fascinated enough by some 'factoid' that I'd make a note to look it up to check, although I was trying to read as if everything in the story was made up if I didn't already know for sure was right or wrong. Certainly some of the more egregious errors are listed in the Wikipedia article Criticism of the Da Vinci Code, but things like museum air-conditioning systems aren't going to be in there.That boredom in the middle of the novel had, I thought, pushed my rating down to 2 stars. But towards the end, I was pleased and surprised by the ambiguity of having a villain whose underlying aims made sense and with which one could see a good proportion of readers agreeing - and that the ending subverted my expectations of a book with writing like this, and to an extent of the traditional thriller form. Its sexual politics have also aged surprisingly well. Of course most of the ways in which it situates historical goddess worship are guff, a special type of guff that even manages to ignore the patriarchal nature of Greco-Roman society, and the usual thing one would expect in lazy writing about goddess worship, Gimbutas' theory of a goddess-focused Old Europe. Instead it sees the dominance of a male god as an all-in-one wholesale introduction when Christianity became the official religion of Rome. And quotes Margaret Murray type stuff about witch-religion and millions of witches dead in early-modern persecutions.But the way in which so much of the action is instigated and many deductions made by a female character who is equally, if not more, competent than the male lead, and that she isn't sexualised, made me wonder if I was actually reading a recent rewrite for the #metoo era, and if it might have been different in the copy from 2004/5ish that I used to own. Once the lack of sexualisation might have seemed like American prudishness, in wanting the book to be read by fans of 'clean reads' (though aren't most of those Christians who'd loathe the plot?) but these days it seems surprisingly contemporary, especially in contrast with action films made around the same time. With a story about the Grail, there is a lot of scope for Arthurian allusions, and Brown doesn't do enough with that; however, this focus on adventure without sex may have something to do with the theme of purity and the Grail in Arthurian myth. Sophie is in effect a female knight of the grail. I couldn't help contrast this with The Big Sleep, a better-written mystery-thriller whose Arthurian subtext is more carefully constructed but far more traditionally masculine.Having a few female officials of a medieval secret society doesn't go as far as would now be favoured by those who argue for better representation of marginalised groups in historical fiction - of how it could have been rather than how it was, because it's fiction. But it seems like it's on the road there.The shenanigans with private jets are fun to read about, yet also come across as an indictment of the whole system of private aviation, and implicitly more in tune with recent concerns about social inequality than with the celebration of the super-rich found in pop culture of the 00s boom.Like the last couple of books I've read, this is another one I read a bit of in the early 00s but was nowhere near finishing. I have always thought that it's part of being well-informed to read bestsellers, and that was why I bought a copy of this back around 2004ish. However in recent years I've realised I don't read fast enough to read them *and* the books I care about reading, so I've never even tried with its successors, like Gone Girl. (Though The Da Vinci Code's 80m+ sales dwarf that, and almost everything recent except Harry Potter.) I had never felt good about the fact that I didn't continue with The Da Vinci Code - and that it was marked 'abandoned' - not out of choice, because of its badness but because I felt too ill to read more of it back when I last seriously tried. Though the theme, and my lack of interest in it certainly didn't help. I still found something particularly bleak and queasy about the scenes of Silas alone. I decided on The Da Vinci Code after finding that the prose in Dorothy Dunnett's The Game of Kings (another book from around 2005ish) is still rather laborious, and quite a bit of work for something that isn't an influential classic, and yet when I see the sequence of covers and titles, this old UK edition of The Da Vinci Code after Buddha Da, their similarities look like it was an obvious hop from one to the other.I had hoped that in reading The Da Vinci Code in 2020 there would be interesting points to observe about its influence - but I noticed very few. However, as I rarely read contemporary thrillers, so maybe I don't have the frame of reference. What seems most evident is the repeated line ""everyone loves a conspiracy"" - and, especially given the wide readership of this novel among people who rarely bother with books, it seems plausible to suggest that it, unfortunately, primed an audience towards the increasing popularity of conspiracy theories about high-level politics.",27,0.9969,0.077,0.802,0.122,0.4514375000000002,NEGATIVE,1.0
62,906271314,04/10/2014,5.0,"I decided to read The Da Vinci Code largely because of the storm of controversy that followed it’s release. I had never heard of Dan Brown, nor was I particularly well educated around the bible, so my decision to read this book was a little bit of a surprise one. I was not disappointed.The book follows the main protagonist Robert Langdon, a Harvard University professor of symbology. He is disturbed by the authorities in the middle of the night, having been implicated in the murder of the museum curator at the Louvre, Paris. With the assistance of police crypotographer Sophie Neveau, they embark on a quest to clear his name and find the real killer.The book itself is a fictional work, but Dan Brown has done an exhaustive amount of research into the history and development of Christianity, and the sacred ‘Holy Grail’. That said, I decided to take the book on face value as a thriller, and my decision to read it was rewarded.I’m not going to provide any spoilers in this review (the book is documented well enough to allow everyone else to do that), but what I will do is make a few observations about the book itself. The way that the story flows is seamless. The pair go from Paris, taking in London and Rome. The scenes are beautifully set placing you right in the thick of the action. The pace of the story is fast throughout, barely allowing you to pause for breath. I found the way the book was written allowed and often forced longer spells of reading that I had planned. The chapters are short, often ending with a hook, urging you to read “just one more”. The twists and turns of the plot leave you second-guessing what is going to happen next.For some, the subject matter of Christianity would put them off reading his book. As a non-Christian, I had no issue with reading this book. If you do read this book, I am certain that you will enjoy it for what it is; a well-written, past-paced thriller that will have you glued to the pages.Reviewed by Steve on www.whisperingstories.com",27,0.7548,0.051,0.88,0.069,0.3726686507936507,POSITIVE,0.9996

Anyone seeing my rating of Dan Brown's work will immediately leap to the conclusion that the rest of the books I've read are just as poorly written/reviewed/researched/organized, and that within my ""read"" shelf they can find glowing summaries of the latest chick lit and Twilight reviews that consist entirely of the word ""omg"" repeated three hundred times. In short, I am perfectly aware of how this rating makes me look. And I am aware of the many, many problems with the book that is allowing Dan Brown to spend the rest of his life rolling around naked in a pile of dollar bills. The ""research"" is poorly done, almost all of the earthshattering claims made in the story are exaggerated bullshit, the characters are mostly undeveloped and unrealstic, Robert Langdon is clearly Dan Brown in a flimsy fan-fic worthy disguise, and even the minor details in the story are...well, totally made up. Despite what Professor Langdon says, I don't think Disney's The Little Mermaid is a thinly veiled Mary Magdalene allegory, you cannot simply lift a painting off a wall in the Louvre and use it as a shield, there are only twelve disciples in The Last Supper, and the Louvre does not have bars of soap in the bathrooms that one can push a tracer into and then toss out the window. Dan Brown is a silly, silly man who would like nothing more than to be the Indiana Jones of the literary world (bitch, please) and his books deserve all the derision and terrible movie adaptations they've received so far.

So you buy them and rip the bag open and start crunching away and suddenly the salt and the oil and the mystery chemicals start working on your brain and trigger something beyond your control and before you know it, you can't stop and you keep eating and your fingers are all greasy and your face is all greasy and you have chip crumbs all over the front of your clothes and in your lap but damn if you're going to stop.

I won't even get into the total disregard for ""factual"" things that he uses in the book (such as works of Leonardo DaVinci, various church's, Opus Dei, etc) because it just isn't worth it. You want real literature with secret societies and something that you can really sink your teeth and the brain that God intended you to use, then read Umberto Eco's ""Foucault's Pendulum.""

But this was the first one, and the formula was not apparent, so it was enjoyable in a lukewarm sense despite the bad writing. I especially enjoyed the puzzles.Dan Brown deserves credit for taking the crackpot theories from Holy Blood, Holy Grail and making a passable thriller out of it.

When the airport page-turner first came out, it was a sensation and a favourite water cooler discussion. Shortly thereafter, Dan Brown was vilified by the minority of his readers who actually had previous experience finishing a novel(s). The more the general public liked Dan Brown and his tripe, the more those of notable cultural and artistic expertise pooped on his face. With each Entertainment Tonight spotlight on the ""smash hit"", the closer the literarians came to castrating Brown to halt the general decline of homo sapien intelligence. To express your love of the ""fast-paced, complex"" plot also marked you for gelding.Here is but a sampling of my favourite cherrypicked Goodreads comments on the book and/or Dan Brown:- ""bag of piss""- ""laughable enough to be incorporated into the next Indiana Jones movie""- ""$9 dollar wine""- ""I've read dinner menus that were more demanding on the reader""- ""inexcusable waste of time""- ""total crap""- ""ridiculously formulaic""- ""self-aggrandizing oh-so-clever stuffed pompous troll""- ""Whoever edited this drivel ought to be sewn in a sack with a rabid raccoon and flung into Lake Michigan""- ""He is the Brittney Spears of authors.""- ""Worst. Book.

Ok. I can't necessarily disagree with all of those comments, but you may notice my three star rating. I am a self-proclaimed (at least in an whisper) intellectual. Therein lies a conundrum. Am I a slack-jawed troglodyte? Or rather have I discovered something about Dan Brown's ignominious best-seller that all other intellectuals overlooked, thereby making me an Über-Intellectual with the potential to become Chief Über-Intellectual within my lifetime by giving five stars to Miley Cyrus' book ""Miles to Go"" after discovering its hidden meaning?No, in my humble opinion, I am neither.What I am is a guy who appreciates quality exposition, clever plots, vulnerable characters and economical prose. Yet I also somehow enjoyed the movie Glitter, with Mariah Carey, which by my definition was the worst movie I've ever seen. I enjoyed it because I had a good day, watched two movies with my future wife and laughed at the terrible dialogue. I had a positive emotional reaction to it, for reasons beyond the dreadful quality of what was on the screen. When I read The Da Vinci Code, I ignored the flashing warning light emanating from the self-proclaimed intellectual portion of my brain and embraced the troglodyte portion. I ate it like you eat an entire box of Fig Newtons: you don't think about it baby! Just do it! Regret it later. I actually did read this book while on a beach, along with the twelve other people I saw doing the same thing. I learned nothing about life and certainly and nothing about writing from this book.

81,3825722405,02/08/2021,2.0,"That was fun. Unexpectedly fun, as books sold in airport bookshops are often written for that segment of the reading public who buy books but don't, as a rule, finish reading them. I've spent years being dead certain I wouldn't like this one.Consequently, I knew roughly the basic subject and the twist and the ""controversy"" long before turning the first page. But just as The Sixth Sense is worth watching once after encountering the big reveal, The Da Vinci Code was a good quick light read all the same, with enough lesser twists and smaller surprises to keep me going. I was lent an illustrated edition which interspersed some lovely photographs of the places and art mentioned beside their first mentions in the text; this definitely helped out the reading experience.Where the project seems to have got itself into trouble (not commercially speaking, unless you count the film) is through pretensions to historicity and religious understanding. Once you accept that Brown's story is essentially set in a fantastical alt-history where a handful of medieval Europe's more absurd yet tenacious conspiracy theories turn out (gasp!) to have been true all along, you can relax about the plotline's hard-left-turn departure from fact and reasonableness and enjoy the thrill ride.As an amusement-park thriller, The Da Vinci Code is about as good as it could be. The prose is decent, the dialogue passable, the plot sequence satisfying. The puzzles and riddles are well-calculated to spark, and then gratify, the audience's leaps of intuition, which makes the solutions feel credible and the readers feel smart (always a great tactic for commercial fiction). When the veils behind the veils are finally lifted at the end, the nefarious plot-driving apparatus is disappointing, but not terribly so; and if you've enjoyed the ride so far, you're fine with it, it's nearly over. In all, a pretty decent beach read. But not worth much fuss, one way or another.Update: See also Sorina's review.P.S.

82,1267218596,04/29/2015,5.0,"This is the most stunning and mind-blowing novel I read in my life. Funny, The Da Vinci Code is the main reason why I fell in love with books; the first time I read it is when I was 12-year old, and ever since then I've been reading books with non-stopped pace. I have always been fascinated by symbols, secret societies/brotherhoods, history, conspiracies, and most importantly, Leonardo Da Vinci and the Mona Lisa, both of whom are the main source for my passion for the Renaissance arts.In the Da Vinci Code, Dan Brown has created THE most brilliant, extraordinary novel ever. He delves into history with an epic depth, and recounts it with authenticity like no other writer could.Robert Langdon is my ever beloved character in fiction. I just love how his brain works, how he unfolds the historical facts for the other characters and discovers these mysteries with heart-beating pace. I especially like that Micky Mouse watch element in the Robert Langdon series, and its importance to Langdon's character development. Not one detail in The Da Vinci Code is left unsolved or undetected, and Dan Brown leaves nothing for random. I thoroughly enjoy how Dan Brown's books are recounted within less than 24 hours, and reading those books you would feel that a lifetime have gone since starting the novel. Moreover, starting each chapter by richly describing the settings is an important aspect in Dan Brown's books in setting the reader on the right track and doubling the astonishment of the actions that are taking place.Ultimately, I would like to add that reading this masterpiece as part of my Dan Brown Marathon, and also as a celebration for my 10th anniversary of reading books, and 10th anniversary of reading The Da Vinci Code for the first time, along with having Inferno the movie released on my birthday, had my heart growing with endless nostalgia and heartwarming emotions.The easiest 5-star rating!",20,0.9963,0.006,0.798,0.196,0.5433035714285713,POSITIVE,1.0

I suppose with The Da Vinci Code Dan Brown gives you more of what you got with its predecessor Angels and Demons - for better or worse that is. Harvard professor Robert Langdon is on a business trip in Paris, when he finds out that the elderly curator of the Louvre has been brutally murdered inside his museum with a series of baffling codes next to his body. Thus Langdon and the French cryptologist Sophie Neveu begin to hunt for clues which lead them to the works of Leonardo Da Vinci and a secret far older than they could have imagined.Reading the books of this series back to back made me realise how they have been written more like standalone novels. New city, new adventure, new sidekick. You get a nice summary of what happened before, but apart from the fact that Robert Langdom seems a bit more sexually frustrated now that he has had a taste of what it could have been like not to be a bachelor we find him entirely unaffected by the gruesome things he had to witness just a year earlier. Good for him, I'd be more than traumatised. That's just a tiny thing I'm willing to overlook though, as again there is enough happening to fill the pages of this book. We're presented a fine scavenger hunt, which is fast-paced and full of twists and turns. It seems smart and well thought-through at first glance, but as soon as you start doing your own digging (or even just googling, other people have done it enough already), you will be quick to realise that the things Dan Brown is selling to you as facts prove to be simply wrong. It made me wary of everything said in this book and I'm not a big fan of conspiracy theories, which ultimately meant that I couldn't consider this book one of much quality. Dan Brown still uses cheap literary tricks to keep you reading (cliffhangers, people are not what you think they are), but they still all work - this book was indeed hard to put down. It's definitely enjoyable enough to make me recommend this to people who are general fans of thrillers and scavenger hunts. If you're looking for character studies and learning about history, stay clear. The characters all feel very one dimensional, Sophie Neveu feels like the same person as Vittoria from the previous novel and even protagonist Robert Langdon hasn't really grown or developed even an inch.It's a nice summer read, I suppose, something to keep your eyes busy and your head empty, but to me personally, it's nothing more than that.",18,0.909,0.076,0.82,0.105,0.4873511140460293,POSITIVE,0.9987

Sometimes this could be written off as making the book accessible to its intended public (e.g., to insure that his readers understand the concept of a keystone, Brown has one of his supergenius characters exclaim, ""but wait, vaulted ceilings don't *have* keys!"" as an intro to a suitable-for-third-graders explanation). Other times, it was just ridiculous and disorienting. I spent significant mental energy trying to rationalize why the supergenius characters were stealing an armored van from the swiss bank and driving it straight to their hideout when *obviously* any such van would be fitted with a tracking device and thus was a dangerous thing to leave parked right outside your ""safehouse"". In fact, I had half convinced myself that there must be some supersecret reason that I just didn't know about as to why the swiss bank wouldn't want its vans to be traceable (the system could be hacked into, necessitates getting too many outside parties involved, etc). But then it turned out that I had been right all along - the van *was* being tracked. The Supergeniuses just hadn't considered that possibility. Duh.Not every book has to be brilliant. Sometimes a nice, fun, escapist mystery novel really hits the spot. But dude, this kind of inconsistency and bad writing (and bad imagination!) just cannot be tolerated.

SQUEEEE  (hide spoiler)]I'm a big fan of mystery novels with codes and puzzles. In fact, one of the first ever series I read ( The Forbidden Stone by Tony Abbott, better than I expected! I recommend to Middle Schoolers :P ) was all about codes and history, which made me learn A LOT (and it came useful in history lessons!). The Da Vinci Code is full of the history of feminine symbolism and religion, certainly an interesting topic for me to read about. The fact that it started in Paris made me happier because I want to visit The Louvre so badly (ahahaha). Another huge interesting plot that made me continue on was the quest for The Holy Grail. Now, I have no knowledge of its history and legend and whether its mentions in the book were all facts, but it was certainly fun to explore the legend and its importance to Christianity.  THE ART : I'm such a big art & history fan/nerd, I can freak out for 2 hours upon hearing a plan to visit a big museum even though I received the news 3 days prior. Although I certainly don't have the art skills, I love appreciating the masterpieces created. The title itself already made me curious upon seeing the name Da Vinci, a genius in many areas, a creator of the famous Mona Lisa and much more, and an out-of-his-time engineer who had the idea for the modern day airplanes. Seeing how deeply his works was involved in the book made me jump in happiness. I was lucky enough to see one of his less famous pieces (though I can't remember which) during a visit to The Louvre in Abu Dhabi (I freaked out for 2 straight days).

Crazy cults, ancient history, religious symbolism, brutal murders.....it had all the elements of a great thriller. Then I poured over books and articles on the history of Christianity, the Knights Templar, the grail legend...just to see if the author's claims about it being based on truth were indeed true. In the end, it's very difficult, and mostly impossible, to glean provable truth from ancient history or religious writings.Because this book is included in the list of 100 books for The Great American Read, I decided to listen to the audio book version. I'm trying to read my way through the entire list...and since it had been 15 years since I read this one, it was time for a re-read. Because I already knew the story line from the book and watching the movie, I didn't enjoy this book so much the second time around. In the years since it was published, I have really gotten over any fascination with religious symbolism or ideology. It made it difficult for me to get into the story this time. I ended up fast-forwarding past a few hours of this 18+ hour audio book. I listened to a bit more than half of it. There is no mystery in a thriller when you know the ending already. All in all, some nice suspense and a great story. The puzzles the main characters have to solve and the treachery they face is thrilling and interesting. I doubt the author's claims that the story line is based on facts....but it isn't possible to prove or disprove any of it. Makes it pretty much a moot point. The novel in its entirety just has too much religion and Catholic Church references for me. As a former Catholic who now avoids organized religion like the plague....I'm just no longer interested. So, this really isn't the book for me anymore.But....that is only my opinion. The book is well written and quite suspenseful. I totally understand why this book is included in The Great American Read. It got millions of people reading and talking about the book -- both positive and negative. I remember being one of the millions who read this book and then read non-fiction information to see if any of the story was actually true (and watched many of the television documentaries about the subject). So, despite the fact I pretty much DNF'd it (fast forwarding past more than half of a book is really not finishing the novel), I totally agree with its inclusion on the list. And, I'm even glad that I sort of half-assed a re-read of it. It shows that I have changed as a person over the last 15 years and my interests have gone down other paths. I still love a good thriller.....but not books so full of religious symbolism and details. Just not for me.

The woman knows her shit.I mean Knows. Her. Leonardo. DaVinci. Shit.There was also this girl in my class. She sat in the front row.

And everyone who reads Dan Brown knows more than every other person knows about art history or culture or symbols or cryptology or whatever. But especially DaVinci. You see, these people, they KNOW THE CODE.Anywhoo, one morning my professor puts up a slide of (dum da dum dum) The Last Supper by Leonardo Davinci. And she is describing the painting and all those who are sitting at the table of Christ. She points to the figure to the left of Christ, you know, the feminine looking one, and says ""and this is St. John the Evangelist.""And as soon as she says that, I mean not even a nanosecond has passed since she said it, that miss blondie wannabe greek culture girl shoots her hand up in the air and without missing a beat, my favorite art history professor gets red in the face, looks right at blondie and says:""It is St. John the Evangelist, not Mary Magdalene, so you can put your hand down.

112,2497622631,09/02/2018,3.0,"This was my first time reading The Da Vinci Code, and my first Dan Brown novel. Despite having been a blockbuster in its day, the book's received more than its fair share of criticism. So I was curious to see how much of that was true, and how much might reasonably be characterized as the usual sour grapes that hits any creative work that ends up begin vastly more successful than anticipated.Initially I found the book much better written than I'd expected, which tells me I'd absorbed too many of the aforementioned criticisms. The prose is spare but very much in service to its subject matter, which often consists of providing historical context and various conspiracy theories around secret societies. The story moves briskly, and there are more than enough twists and turns to satisfy thriller readers looking for something that's more focused on the mystery rather than ghoulish violence. It's easy to see why so many people fell in love with the book, and likely enjoyed reading – and later telling their friends – about semi-exotic locations given added dashes of spicy religious or mystical details. In short, the Da Vinci code delivers on its promises.None of this makes it a perfect book, or even a great one if you're not keen on religious conspiracy thrillers. The various theories expounded become ponderous after a while, seemingly never letting up, which means the characters never really get to shine. The writing, too, became less appealing for me once I realized no one other than perhaps the albino Silas or the oh-so-British Leigh had any voice to speak of. This lack of personality was most notable with the protagonist, Robert Langdon. I'd challenge anyone to describe his voice to me as anything other than bland and didactic.My personal criticisms of the book may be largely irrelevant, however, for those seeking to be entranced by the myriad conspiracies and religious historical theories – all of which are intriguing regardless of their relative credibility. The book is meant as entertainment, not history. Despite this, Brown makes a clear and concerted effort not to wholesale manufacture any historical evidence, and I imaging that, too, endears him to his millions of fans. The Da Vinci Code isn't my cup of tea, but I can understand why so many people adored it.",14,0.9877,0.071,0.773,0.156,0.4638690476190475,NEGATIVE,0.9937
113,732969921,10/02/2013,4.0,"Even a decade after causing all its controversy, The Da Vinci Code still captivates readers with its detailed plot full of wonderful intricacies and highly entertaining suppositions Thorough research on such topics as the Templars, Leonardo Da Vinci, codes and ciphers, as well as the history of the Church bright the narrative to life and fill the plot with so many twists that the reader must hold on to better understand what is going on. No reader who takes the time to read and attempt to understand Brown’s story and the nuances of that which is factual (as well as the fiction) will leave the experience with nothing gained. That said, an open mind can lead down many pathways and leave the reader to wonder how they did not piece it all together before. A must-read for those who like their fiction served piping hot with just enough critique of the sacred to have the Vatican debunking it for fear the real truth will soon be unveiled.On a trip to Paris, Robert Langdon is called to the Louvres, where its curator has been murdered. A cryptic code left in his own blood leads French authorities to presume that Langdon is actually the killer. Paired with a cryptographer whose interest in the case is more than superficial, Langdon begins to decipher the code left in the blood, only to be chased down by the authorities as the prime suspect in the murder. Clues point to more complex codes and ciphers, as well as a deeply contentious revelation the Vatican wishes left unearthed. Langdon is not the only one trying to get to the bottom of this mystery, the Holy Grail itself, as an ultra-conservative Catholic sect, Opus Dei, sends one of its own to hunt the secrets down and destroy Langdon in the process. As the story moves along, the reader cannot help but learn all about the secret society in which Da Vinci was a member and how he used his art to communicate key points of Christianity the early Church tried to bury. While the search is sure to be mind-altering, Langdon must survive long enough to feel the euphoria.Brown uses an easy narrative to push the story forward and, as in the first book of the series, chooses to focus his attack/critique on the Greater Church, this time for burying the truth of Jesus’ personal side and his fallible nature. If that were all, the book would surely have done little more than raise eyebrows. Brown takes it to the next level by issuing a full-on attack at what the Church did and does not hide his criticism of the Vatican, whatsoever. One with an open mind must ask (though I have come to realise perhaps why he did this), why do CHURCH and VATICAN appear synonymous in the book. Why do these revelations about Christianity only mean that the Catholic Church is to blame or that Catholics ought to have ire building inside of them? Anglicans/Episcopalians, Methodists, Baptists, and many others… all fall under the umbrella, though Brown chooses not to direct anything in their direction,. I could not help but wonder why and posit that his focus on the Early Church might be an attempt to show that it all happened before the Protestant schism.Kudos, Mr. Brown on a stellar piece of work. Reading it after all the hype (a second time) allowed me to enjoy the story and see that you truly do enjoy stirring the pot, especially at a time when arch-conservatives were in the Vatican’s policy chairs (right, Cardinal Ratzenberger?)!

128,769205812,11/19/2013,2.0,"When I was a kid, I adored the Saturday morning cartoon “A Puppy Named Scooby-Doo.”

It was my favorite incarnation of Scooby Doo as it was bright, colorful, amusing and kept me wanting more. While reading Dan Brown’s “The Da Vinci Code,” I was reminded of this series , only because I was so amazed that a made-for-children animated program had more wit and mystery than this mess of a book. I started to read it went into a tizzy…what the hell was Brown guy thinking? Did millions of people worldwide truly take this poorly-researched, poorly-written junk seriously? The plot isn’t complex: Langdon Brown, Harvard professor of Cryptology, or some such nonsense, is in Paris to give a lecture and then meet with the overseer of the Louvre. But before Langdon can meet him, the art scholar is killed and Langdon is called by police to go to the Louvre to solve some puzzling clues. A mysterious young beauty, Sophie Neveu, arrives and then Langdon is soon considered the prime suspect of the murder. The two flee from police, while solving “complex” puzzles that lead to more clues.Meanwhile, Bishop Arringarosa, head of the secretive Opus Dei, (Can you say: 

)has sent his henchman, Silas, a self-flagellating, albino monk who wears brown robes and wraps barbed wire around his thigh so it constantly bleeds (because that’s the kind of guy who blends into a crowd)to make sure a secret regarding the Holy Grail—-one that could destroy the whole Christian faith—-is never revealed.  The book was obviously written with its eye on Hollywood (I haven’t yet seen the movie, and this book doesn’t inspire me to do so): Langdon is referred to looking like “Harrison Ford in Harris tweed” and Dan Brown admittedly wrote the character of Bezu Fache with actor Jean Reno in mind. I enjoy good pulp-fiction, a potboiler that leaves you on the edge of your seat, waiting to know what happens next…but this book was not that kind of read. For people with ADD tendencies like me, The Da Vinci code is split up into short chapters, which should make for easy reading. However, they usually end with nail-biting cliffhangers such as: “Now, I’ll tell you the rest of the story.” Or: “I can’t drive a stick-shift!”  Dun-Dun! Can you feel the suspense?The pacing is all wrong; the book is 450+ pages long and 90% of the action takes place over 12 hours. Perhaps my definition of a fast-paced novel is different than Brown’s: to me, it’s not one set in a short period of time, but one where a lot of action and suspense occur. Stuff happens here, but mostly it's just running: Langdon and Sophie escape from the police, they hide though out the Louvre, then drive through the streets of Paris to the countryside to meet a friend, fly to England, hide some more, and skulk their way to another museum, always fleeing from police and bad guys. All the while, there are a lot of stupid questions asked by supposed code-expert Sophie. Langdon’s long-winded explanations of facts that Sophie should be more than aware of are ham-handedly inserted to enlighten the reader. Thrown in are lots of extemporaneous, long speeches about what this work of art represents plus stupid flashbacks. For example, as they’re pursued by cops, Langdon thinks: “Hmm, this reminds me of the time I was sharing my divine knowledge with prison inmates in a speech about the ambiguous sexuality of the Mona Lisa. She’s really a tranny. That blew the their minds. I’m so smart, heh-heh.” There is another flashback where Landon describes the Fibonacci code to a class of Harvard students who are shocked and dumbfounded that such a series exists in nature. Really? A 15 year-old-stoner who's watched Darren Aranofsky’s misnamed “Pi” knows the relevance of this basic sequence!There are plenty of other silly ideas, such as Langdon stating that the Greeks used Eros as an anagram for rose. But this makes no sense because “Eros” is Greek and “rose” is English or French. In Greek, rose is ""rhodon"" or ""rodon."" Brown claims there is a disembodied hand holding a knife at Jesus’s back in The Last Supper and although in every version I’ve seen, it’s Peter who is holding the knife. (Ok, some art historians claim that it was added in a restoration of Leonardo’s work, as Leonardo was such a master of the human form that it makes little sense to have Peter in such an awkward, unnatural pose.) But Brown is no religious historian either; his “facts” should in no way be taken as such. He’s an average pulp writer trying to make a controversial book and sell copies, and by hitting those divisive notes he shows himself to be a better salesman/promoter than author. I soon realized to take Brown’s errors with a grain of salt as I had a huge epiphany about halfway through this book. In a startling revelation, Langdon points to his Mickey Mouse watch and discloses that Walt Disney, like numerous notable historical figures, was one of the keepers the Holy Grail’s secret. Many of his films were filled with hidden “Easter Eggs,” such as the “The Little Mermaid” where Ariel’s red hair makes her a perfect match for Mary Magdalene…And I finally got it, slapped myself on the forehead, and exclaimed, “D’oh!”Dan Brown is screwing with the reader and had a jolly old time laughing his way to the bank. Like the—ahem—History Channel’s program “Ancient Aliens,” he throws so much crap and conjecture that some might figure, well, even if 1% of what’s said is true, then this changes 
everything!
 We are through the looking glass, people!Dan is both a hack and a genius! What’s more he made himself known as a “preeminent” author and made a ton of cash!Thankfully, I got this e-book for free.As long as I’m entertained, I can tolerate a silly plot. For me, the Da Vinci Code started out as horrible, then mildly irritating, then unintentionally quasi-hilarious.If you want to find something amuses and skewers sacred cows, I suggest watching the South Park’s “Fantastic Easter Special” episode, which was snot-flying-from-the-nose-hysterical and revealed the Catholic Church’s true secret:  

If you want a nail-biting action-thriller, look elsewhere; as far as I’m concerned Sidney Sheldon’s reputation as “The Master Storyteller” is still safe. If you want to search religious or artistic truth, seek non-fiction, documented sources. Brown might claim his facts are so, but some simple research will show otherwise. Far from being the engaging blockbuster that I had heard, I found The Da Vinci Code to be an unremarkable let-down filled with flat characters and silly “twists.” Christians of all stripes, Gnostics, atheists, agnostics, historians, lovers of art, readers who enjoy characterization or fast-paced thrillers or even mildly entertaining books, all these people should be offended, because if you’re paying good money for an appealing story, this isn’t it. But like I said, I got it for free, so there’s that. This is a 1 ½ star for me, not sure whether to round it up or down. It was a frustrating read, but it wasn’t so boring that I hated this thing. That’s a positive, I suppose.",11,0.9959,0.072,0.804,0.124,0.5572107125678556,NEGATIVE,0.9999
129,1470175386,04/11/2019,3.0,"An English lecturer of mine once mentioned The Da Vinci Code (with a wince) in a discussion of the female experience of history and how the novel ""did a lot for women”. Never did I ever think that I’d actually agree.This was certainly not nearly as awful as I had feared. In all honesty, I was prepared for the worst but came away pleasantly surprised. The Da Vinci Code is a formulaic, yet highly readable, page turner. Brown’s scholarship is at times shaky, but he certainly has something significant to say: the destruction of matriarchy and the sacred feminine in ancient times has been pivotal in influencing the way in which we perceive women today. The conflict between Paganism and Christianity is vividly conveyed, but I must say that the novel never felt like a sincere tribute or effort to reconstruct the lost idea of the sacred feminine. Contextual background, though fascinating, is relayed through exposition so dry and repetitive, at times I felt as though I was reading propaganda. I should however give credit where it’s due: Brown’s intentions were honourable. I am astounded by how unexpectedly feminist this is - explicitly direct in its feminism, granted, but what I liked especially is how it celebrates femininity rather than condemning it in the way modern media does. Think that damaging ‘strong female character’ trope for example, where a woman must reject all modes of femininity in favour of stereotypically masculine qualities in order to render themselves allegedly equal to their male counterparts. It is refreshing to see work that gives insight into what feminism should truly be about. Whether Brown’s interpretation is particularly new or innovative is debatable, but few can dispute that it’s a good thing that these ideas have been made accessible to a wider audience.I had to sample some of Dan Brown’s supposedly and notoriously bad writing, didn’t I? Isn’t it some sort of rite of passage now? The language is certainly uninspiring, but it’s certainly not dire, either. I’ve read far, far worse in the thriller world - Ken Follett is the first that springs to mind. I like language that excites me, or even better, devours me. This did not. But it fulfils its purpose: it conveys information quickly and efficiently. Perhaps not in the most engaging way possible, but it’s serviceable. I should however pay tribute to the sections that made me wince; the descriptions are crude and rely extensively on cliche eg. a character looking into a mirror to provide a convenient avenue into a physical description. The characters themselves are vaguely archetypal, especially Langdon and his erudite appeal - but hey, am I complaining there?! I think the overall message of the novel (can you call it a message? I think so) would have been substantially stronger had the Langdon/Neveu relationship been platonic, as it was in the film adaptation. The complication of a romance was unnecessary and added little to the novel - but at least we were saved any terrible sex scenes between them… It all ties off in a convenient and sentimental ending, but I can’t deny that it was satisfying. Upon closing the book, I can’t say I was left with any overwhelming awe and yet I have a sneaking suspicion that I might be doing further research into the goddess theory in the near future - and the idea of Jesus as a feminist fills me with joy, even if it is perhaps fanciful.",16,0.9948,0.106,0.709,0.184,0.5545710350255805,POSITIVE,0.586

Very controversial and interesting you can tell how much thought went into this book for it to feel so realistic – however I did feel like this book was a little repetitive and hard to follow in places. I felt the same way about the first book in this series it might have been better with about 100-150 less pages! Some of this book felt like a ramble and I struggled not to skim! This book did manage to keep me interested right to the end though which I love – but I do think I preferred the film! Which I NEVER say! For some reason I didn’t feel so engaged with the characters in this book and I didn’t feel much for them and I didn’t care what happened to them! There is quite a lot of mystery and suspense in this book but it is diluted by this books repetitiveness which is a real shame! Overall a good book – original and thought-provoking you do start to wonder if things like this exist in hidden messages around the world. ""Men go to far greater lengths to avoid what they fear than to obtain what they desire.""""History is always written by the winners. When two cultures clash, the loser is obliterated, and the winner writes the history books-books which glorify their own cause and disparage the conquered foe.

The fact that history can come out twisted and unclear too – as a British child in school the main thing we learnt in history was the Nazi’s but never about the slaves that Britain kept. Even today we are given a clouded truth of history and I don’t think the truth will ever be completely clear!After this one I will be definitely reading something happier and less complex!

131,3977457544,05/01/2021,3.0,"It's strange how common it has been to believe that spirituality is an inherited trait. People have assumed that holiness must run in the veins of a prophet's descendants. Either the descendants should be the true leaders of the faith, or those who usurp that role must exterminate the prophet's descendants. So it has been in the history of Islam with the dispute between Sunnis and Shias, and so it is in Christian history according to Dan Brown.I personally suspect that Jesus did marry and have children, and that the later church tried to erase them from memory. Why else was everything omitted from the gospel accounts of his life between about ages 12 and his late 20s? Why else, in an age when every Jewish rabbi was expected to marry, and we have no record of any rabbi in that century who was not married, was Jesus called ""rabbi,"" and no one is recorded asking why he never married?Still, sanctity is not inherited, and it would be only a legend that his children formed a secret lineage of true holiness. Brown's action-packed exploration of this theme just shows the ongoing power of an ancient superstition -- that royalty, spirituality, and charisma are forms of inheritance that can be owned.",11,0.1431,0.052,0.901,0.047,0.4,POSITIVE,0.8342

138,1455777913,11/30/2015,1.0,"I had read reviews about this novel before reading it – the good and the bad – but I decided to ignore what other people had said and decided to discover what I thought about the book for myself, and so while reading this, I distanced myself from all other people’s opinions completely and made up my own mind about what I thought about it. I’m not one to base my opinions on what others think and I’m not one to change what I think to suit a popular opinion. This book was so painfully below average I can’t even stand it. This book has been overhyped for years now, and I’m incredibly late to the hype, but I just…all I can say, is I’m glad this reading experience is over. I actually enjoyed the start of the novel. It started off kind of interesting, leading my mind down a very particular path, showing me what kind of ride I was going to be in for, for the duration of the novel! You know what, even the middle of this book had me enjoying myself! I’ll admit, a few interesting ideas were thrown out there and I was just as interested to hear about them! But the last third of this book…was an absolute mess. This book was so poorly planned, and if Dan Brown thinks he planned this novel well, he needs to reconsider his career choices. The whole book honestly read like an overexcited child who had just discovered something but didn’t really realise what it was or what it meant or what to actually do with it, but just kept on talking on, and on, and on about it, when everyone just wanted him to SHUT THE HELL UP. The idea behind the novel obviously really intrigued me. I love looking for symbolism in art, and being a Fine Arts student, I do a lot of decoding. I went into this novel thinking that’s what I was going to get. I said to myself, ‘Oh my God! Dan Brown must have these awesome conspiracies about Da Vinci’s work and why he did what he did and there’s going to be awesome commentary on Catholicism and YES this is totally my cup of tea!!!’. Dan Brown would not be able to decode imagery if you literally circled the hidden symbols in bright red marker. He was grasping at very, very loose strings when he commented on ‘The Last Supper’, and he made very questionable guesses at the secret history of Catholicism. He didn't make any sort of genius discovery and didn't put forward any incredible ideas, so I question whether I'm reading the same book as other people...Now don’t get me wrong: I have been raised Catholic, but I love talking about the problems with the Faith, and I love books that comment on the religion and the infatuation people grow to have with it; but Dan Brown was almost so off the mark with this. I know people think his ideas are so incredibly genius, but they’re so painfully dull that it was cringe-worthy to read. This is so harsh, but the man is such a bullshit artist and he has reeled in so many people to thinking his way of thinking is so intelligent that they’ve put him on a pedestal he really doesn’t deserve. I understand that this is a work of fiction, and he is allowed to present his own ideas about his personal conspiracies, but I just feel like all the ideas were really underdeveloped and just boring to explore, and maybe my expectations for what I thought this book was going to be about were too high. My biggest problem with this book stems from the ending/the last third. ‘So much happened’ in such a short amount of time, but nothing that happened was of any substance. He threw in about 5 ‘plot twists’ – if you can call them that – and didn’t bother to explain any of them, and all the characters were so blasé about it all! The ideas were out there, and then they were done! And then the next twist happened! And then…wait, no, nothing happened after that because was anything actually solved?? Uh…nope. It turned into a completely different book at the end, and I just felt played because it was like Dan Brown faked his way to get my interest, but it didn't work out. As for the characters; I didn’t hate them, but I definitely didn’t feel any emotional connection to them and I didn’t really ever care what happened to them. The were very one-dimensional and they fell very flat to me. This book was meant to be a mysterious hunt for clues in the most extreme circumstances. Instead, I got a bad episode of Scooby Doo (this is literally offensive to Scooby Doo, because God damn I love that TV Show/Movie(s)) (I honestly can’t believe how completely shite the ‘clues’ were in this book it’s actually laughable.Words, Langdon. Fucking words. The only reason this gets 2 stars from me, is because I actually wanted to know how it ended while I was reading it, but yeah. That’s the only reason. Do not recommend this book unless you want to try it out for yourself. And if you do, make your own opinion about it!! I can understand how this book could be enjoyable to some people, it just…wasn’t for me Side note: I should’ve known that the book was going to be terrible when Dan Brown’s first clue read like this:‘O Draconian Devil,Oh Lame Saint.PS. Find Robert Langdon’I just…I actually laughed out loud at that one. It’s just so FUCKING BAD.",10,0.996,0.096,0.75,0.154,0.5415822440087146,NEGATIVE,1.0

As a writer, it is commendable how he has managed a ridiculously difficult story line, cut it into tiny chapters of a few pages each and ensured that each bit of information takes the story forward.

The latter has been murdered by Silas, an albino monk who belongs to the Opus Dei, and is following the commands of a man he knows only as the Teacher and who is in search of a ""keystone"" that can lead to the Holy Grail. On the crime scene, Langdon meets French cryptographer, Sophie Neveu, who is also Sauniere's granddaughter; it is then that he understands that before he was murdered, Sauniere wrote a message 'PS Find Robert Langdon' in his own blood. The cryptic codes and messages hidden in Sauniere's last message lead the two to a safe deposit box of the Paris branch of Depository Bank of Zurich where they find a box with the ""keystone"", but they need more help to find the Holy Grail to which it must lead. At this point, with DCPJ on their chase, they escape to the Chateau of one of Langdon's friend, Sir Leigh Teabing, who's an expert on Holy Grail and has been researching the Knights Templar and the ancient parchments for years. Teabing tells them that the Holy Grail is not a cup like many Christians have come to believe but is a tomb that contains the bones of Mary Magdalene. Teabing, who himself has been on the trail of the Holy Grail for most of his life, leads Sophie and Langdon out of France and in to London where the next clue is leading them.

And I have multiple reasons why I really disliked it, though it will be pretentious of me to deny or totally negate the occasional glimpses of nuance it provided. First and foremost, I fully understand that this is a work of fiction and its content cannot be critiqued purely from an empirical point of view, but some of the statements Dan Brown makes ranges from outrageousness to total absurdity. Brown took the non-factual prose too far, particularly around the figure of Christ, and I feel like he did not fully understand the depth of what he was writing about. Recently, I encountered an interview of 50 Cents when he was addressing the issue of Jay-Z and Kanye West calling themselves JayHova and Yeezus respectively in reference to them being gods of rap music - something he thought was ill-informed. He said he can only limit to calling himself king of rap and not God because he fully comprehends the ramifications of tampering with the spiritual world. Wow! Imagine that is 50 Cents. Brown, on the other hand, who is clearly more informed than Jay-Z and Kanye West and even 50 Cents, decided to thrive in distortion and misrepresentation. He has skillfully tried to reduce Jesus to a mere ethical teacher like Socrates and ignored or played down his divinity. If you will be patient enough to overlook the obvious religious prejudice, you will dive into a deep analysis of some of Da Vinci's famous works from the Vitruvian Man, the Last Supper, to  the Mona Lisa. The ingenuity of this man, Da Vinci, is mindboggling. I strongly believe his brilliance and creativity surpasses that of any other being to have ever graced this world, even though it took a perverse turn. Apparently,
he believed he possessed the alchemic power to turn lead into gold and even cheat God by creating an elixir to postpone death.
 I guess it's no surprise that his contemporary like Michelangelo outlived him. If there is anything this book has achieved is to increase my appetite for Leonardo Da Vinci. I'm really looking forward to devouring more of his literature. Dan Brown, on the other hand, this is the first and the last of his books that I'll ever read.

 the bad guy was, and again, I was so enthralled when I discovered who it was. Needless to say, I loved it. This book was basically like candy to me back then. I was so taken by it so to speak, I swiftly went on to read its prequel. And bam! It hit me like a freight train. Everything in Angels and Demons became so...predictable. I could even identify who the bad guy was. Though 
why
 he was the bad guy remained a mystery till the end, so much of the intrigue was gone. Never mind, I thought. Maybe another book of his would be better, I thought. And another book I tried. And another. And I was massively disappointed. You see, I'd figured it out. I'd figured out the formula. Every Dan Brown novel is the exact same thing, albeit with different themes. His characters are stock characters and his stories are linear. So without further ado, Dan Brown's recipe for a best-selling thriller:1. Take an older, well-read, good-looking, brooding, ""smart af"" professor, preferably in liberal arts and combine with a drop-dead gorgeous, jaw-dropping attractive, exquisitely beautiful, utterly breathtaking woman who's also, you know, smart and a pioneer in her field. 2. Sprinkle with some steamy scenes that may or may not involve sex. 3. Cover with cheese in the form of some romantic quotes, memories, feelings and the like.4. Blend in a well-disguised yet totally obvious villain who is doing whatever he is doing for reasons so far-fetched and yet strangely altruistic you kind of start to like him more. 5. Put it in an exotic location like Paris or Rome and bake at 325 degrees. 6. Take it out of the exotic location and serve hot.

149,772094789,11/23/2013,1.0,"By the standard of ""Angels and Demons"", this one was actually a reasonable effort. Unfortunately, this is not saying much, as I was unable to get through ""A&D""...The ""Da Vinci Code"" is an adventure novel based on the holy grail quest. The plot is linear, and its characters move from one clue to the next, until the final mystery is solved, and the book ends. To make this not entirely predictable, Brown includes several subplots and uses ""cliffhangers"" to alternate between them.A ""cliffhanger"" is a fine literary device if used sparingly. Writers have employed it successfully to draw the reader in and make sure that suspense does not ebb away. The device works, but its power is suspense, and surprise. It does not work if it is used at the end of every chapter!Meanwhile, in the main plot Brown's serial protagonist Robert Langdon hurries from clue to clue, but fails to develop personality, or depth. His character, and that of second protagonist Sophie Neveu, remain thin and undeveloped throughout the plot. And the plot itself lacks substance, too, as it exhausts itself in solving mystery after mystery, and revealing increasingly confused background stories about the clues in question. The result, I am afraid, is a plot designed to leave the reader guessing what is next, but achieving the opposite. The reader can rest comfortably in the knowledge that the solution of a current mystery will merely bring on a similar one, and that the conclusion of a current chapter will leave one of its characters in a seemingly insoluble predicament.Mysteries are evocative if the reader is unable to find sleep before seeing them resolved. Cliffhangers are nailbiting if there is a real possibility that a character may die, or come to harm. This plot has neither of these ingredients, and remains rather tedious to the end.Still. Not the worst book I have ever read - as I said, I did get through it. ",9,0.0984,0.07,0.848,0.083,0.4716845878136201,NEGATIVE,1.0

Every charity shop bookshelf has at least one copy, I've never seen one that doesn't have one. Never a dusty copy tho, I imagine some poor soul buys it and on realising their mistake, for once in their life obeys the the happy little yellow sticker ""Please bring me back for other people to enjoy!"", and it goes right back the next day. Or perhaps all charity shops have a pile of Dan Browns in their stock room just waiting to go out when the old copy starts looking depressed.When I bought my copy, it had been out less than a year, and it was already on special offer, they couldn't get rid of it fast enough, and I should have known better than to fall for it!

This is the scene where Langdon arrives at Sir Teabing's house, and Sir Teabing will not let him enter without correctly answering a question of whether he wants milk or sugar in his tea. Apparently the correct answer was in fact 'lemon'. This bit was so ridiculous it drove me crazy. Perhaps tea is a sensitive topic with me, but theres no way you can give a definitive answer without knowing what kind of tea it was. I imagine that the correct version of this scene would have been as follows:Teabing: Do I take milk or sugar in my tea?Langdon: Would that be Assam, Ceylon, Darjeeling, Earl Grey, Chamomile, Peppermint or Green Tea?TEABING IS CATAPULTED THROUGH THE AIR INTO A GIANT CHASM NEVER TO BE SEEN AGAIN.Although preferably that last bit would be Dan Brown himself, not Teabing.

If released, this secret will bring down the Catholic church, so the curator is killed by a conveniently available self-flagellating albino monk on orders from the Opus Dei. Of course, the men are handsome, the women beautiful, and the obligatory nod to new age and political correctness is included in the form of a cryptographer heroine and a half-baked ""legend of the goddess"" running theme.Worst, however, is the writing. The shallowness of the descriptions is nothing short of offending. For instance, the office of the deceased curator is described, seen through the professors' eyes, as having ""Old Master"" paintings on the wall. This same professor is supposedly so proficient in the arts that he can recognize the ""famous parquet floor"" of Louvre's Grand Galerie from a Polaroid (Polaroid? In this day and age?) when pulled out of bed at 2am.

A lot of effort went into writing THE DA VINCI CODE, which did strike me as having a solid blend of fact and fiction to make a modern day Grail quest believable. However, it is the actual prose and craft (or apparent lack thereof), including the overuse of adjectives, the scattered viewpoints (at least ten, if not more, some for apparently no reason), the heavy-handed reliance on flashbacks (even, oddly, during the climax) that take you right out of the story, as well as the weak characterizations (with my favorite being Leigh, a secondary character who felt less like cardboard than the others) that made me cringe more times than I can remember while reading a book that's been so widely read. To be sure, the beginning started out cleverly and interestingly enough with a death in the Louvre, a murder setup, and an enigmatic riddle. The plot after that is essentially a chase with various factions seeking out Robert Langdon and Sofie Neveu, who are on a quest to decode a puzzle left by Sofie's grandfather at the opening death scene. It didn't take long for the puzzles and twists to feel contrived rather than clever, with characters flipping for apparently no reason other than that Mr. Brown decided he needed them to for shock value. The writing was trite at times, with the most egregious example being the not-so-subtle pat on the head Mr. Brown gave himself for coming up with such a brilliant premise as to attack the Catholic Church.

Hi, I just spotted the differences. The similarities continue with the style, pace, atmosphere, symbolism, Catholic Church, clues to solve puzzles, and a race against time. I would advise leaving a bit of time between reading the 2 books.The book is an easy read thriller, written as if for a young adult audience. The stories make good films because the plots and storylines are great and feed our appetite for conspiracy theories and age-old vendettas stretching back over millennia. I can understand how some people love it and some hate it. For once I much prefer the films!Deliberate copy of review for Angels and Demons - well if Dan Brown can do it :).",7,0.9767,0.071,0.736,0.193,0.5112222222222222,POSITIVE,0.9997

196,49439485,03/16/2009,2.0,"""Yes,"" the balding man said as he pointed the Luger at them, ""I knew that once you found the missing pieces of the Shroud of Turin that it was only a matter of time, that you would eventually track down the companion pieces to it and end up here. This is why I allowed you into my home as a friend, to feel you out and pick your brain as I bided my time. You, the foremost scholar of ancient sexuality, and I, the world's foremost scholar of ancient garb."" ""But, this fails to explain..."" Hangdown blurted as he was cut off.""No, my good friend. It explains it all. The Church has been looking for the companion pieces to the shroud for 2,000 years. People have thought that there was only one Shroud, the one alleged to depict the image of Christ at the time of death, the one that draped his body and which became graven in his image. But the Roman Emperor Constantine knew of the incendiary nature of what was depicted on the original shroud and the companion pieces and ordered the Legions to seek out and destroy them. For the truths that they contained would destroy the fledgling Christian Church in its infancy.""And, in fact, the Legions succeeded in finding the Christ shroud and destroying it, but somehow, the companion shrouds eluded their grasp. Then, the Council of Nicaea, as part of their plan to recast the myths of the Church, cleverly created a decoy Shroud, the one we know today, the innocent innocuous shroud we've all seen ad infinitum, the one that depicts the crown of thorns and the wounds and the blood traces. When you stumbled into Claude Soiree's well-hidden collection of ancient Roman urns -- which I've been seeking for years -- I knew that you were onto the truth, for I knew the images painted on the urns corroborated the existence of the original shroud and its companions. My compadres had nearly closed in on that collection when Soiree rather inconveniently passed that collection onto his granddaughter. Once it was in her hands and you entered the picture to decipher the codes on the urns, we knew our plans had been complicated. But only temporarily. After all, what is another day or two in the expanse of 2,000 years?""""But if you knew the secret of the Shroud and the corroborating evidence of the urns, why not simply go public with what you knew, instead of all this killing and cloak and dagger?""""Ah, but you see, my good friend, knowledge is power. With the urns and the companion shrouds in hand, there was no amount the Church would pay to keep us quiet. Saying is one thing, but having the collateral in hand, that is a different matter.""""So here were are,"" Hangdown said to Sir Teabagger, lightly turning with his hands still up the air, nodding his head in a slight circle to indicate the contours of the stone vestibule, ""in the ruins of an old Roman bathhouse, built during the ancient Roman occupation of England.""""And most appropriate it is, don't you think, given what is depicted on the urns?""""But how do you know...?""""Oh, come now, Hangdown, the nature of what is on those urns and shrouds is not a secret. One can see it, if one really looks, in imagery all around us, not to mention references in the Gnostic Gospels. This passage, for instance: 'And he bathed his companions in the waters of the Red Sea, thus arousing their divinity and their spirits heavenward.' The idea of resurrection is clearly a reference to something dead arising, and what is more phallic than something limp and lifeless and dead suddenly arising into a stiff upward vertical position? The Church cleverly changed Christ's erection into Christ's resurrection.""""Da Vinci was onto the whole thing; he was gay, after all. Why do you think the artist depicted John at Jesus' right hand at the table as an effeminate man? Clearly, this was a pointed jibe at the Church and its stubborn insistence on Jesus' asexuality and on the primacy of heterosexuality. Everything on those missing shrouds and on the surviving fragments of those urns clearly points to Jesus' preference for the unspoken love.""""But the Knights Templar...""""They got wind of Constantine's and the Council of Nicaea's plans and managed to send a handful of knights just in time to save the companion shrouds, or more accurately, the longtime companion shrouds.""For 600 years the trunks containing the shrouds that had been carted off by the knights appeared to have vanished; not a trace of them appears in any records of the time. But remember, this was the Middle Ages, and very few records survive of anything, apart from what the Monks chose to preserve, and this was hardly the stuff that devout Monks were inclined to pass on, even though a good many of those cloistered holy men were equally adept at keeping both the sacred and profane, for the sake of posterity and possibly for their own prurient amusement. They were men, after all.""And that's why, somewhere around 920 A.D., an odd record was scribed -- we know its approximate age from chemical dating -- mentioning the performance of a strange and perverse passion play using shrouds from a mysterious trunk. The play took place somewhere, we believe, along the Rue Saint-Denis, which had already become a gathering place for the deviates of Paris, even at that early date. Effeminate troubadours with bangles and painted faces had stumbled upon a mysterious trunk and taken to wearing its contents. They had recognized on the shrouds images of what appeared to be the apostles of Christ, but depicted in nude and scandalous states of arousal and undress. The flamboyant troubadours, half nude and mincing as they were, whipped themselves up into a frenzy of bawdy blasphemy, wearing the shrouds and staging a passion play that shocked even some of the prostitutes and drunks. It did not take long for word of this sacrilege to reach the Pope himself, who happened to be vacationing in Avignon, even though it had not yet been made a papal city. When the nature of the garb was described to him, he knew immediately that the cloth was the long-lost companion shrouds, and that they must be seized and destroyed. Having no time to summon an army from Rome, the pope sent a conciliatory message and request to the Frankish King to mount an army immediately to seize and arrest all the godless deviates of Paris until the shrouds were procured. The Pope wanted them delivered to him personally.""A papal spy, a sort of double-agent placed slyly in the entourage of the Pope, alerted the Knights Templar who reached Paris before the Frankish army, and, being well-schooled in the happening nightspots of Paris, knew immediately where to find the troubadours and the shrouds, seizing the incrimminating cloths and whisking them off to England, where they were entrusted to the care of Robin Hood and his Merry Men, which, as it happened, was most appropriate -- for they too had a secret to keep. Many of the bathhouses in England, as you may know, sport the sign of the arrow, the male symbol of potency. We believe this stemmed -- no pun intended -- from the days of Robin Hood.""After that, the trail of the shrouds turns cold. With the death of Robin Hood and the disbanding of the Merry Men, the cloths vanished and their whereabouts again became a mystery. The Spanish Inquisition, we believe, came closest to finding them, in Barcelona. The Inquisition suspected the shrouds may have been in the care of a sect of cross-dressing male flamenco dancers. One complication for the inquisitors in trying to track down gay men was that everyone in the town pronounced the city's name as Barthelona. In any case, it turned out to be a dead end, not that the inquisitors didn't find plenty of people to put on the rack and the pyre anyway.""So, the trail ends there. Or so we thought. Until you, Hangdown, came into the picture. Interestingly enough we knew we were onto the secret when we saw you enter that drag show theatre in Piccadilly. I being an expert in ancient garb and its influences on contemporary fashion, and you, being an expert on the secret codes handed down among groups of sexual outcasts used to identify each other. We suspected that the shrouds had found a conduit throughout the centuries via this underground brotherhood -- venerated as those cloths were among those hated circles as symbols of vindication and hope, a reaffirmation from the most High Holy himself in a misunderstanding world.""""So you know what I've suspected as well?""""Yes, yes I do, indeed, Hangdown. That Jesus Christ was gay, and that he had intended to found a Church based on the primacy of same-sex unions, including those based in the Sapphic traditions of Lesbos. A Church that would negate entirely the long-held ideas of Holy Matrimony and destroy the power of the Church that is based on its perpetuation through traditional family structures. This was the incendiary secret guarded by the brotherhood; the evidence kept at bay from the Church that would destroy it. And now Hangdown, you and the girl will hand over the key to the lock of the trunk of Rupaul's wardrobe that sits in the green room, so that the secret can now be revealed to world....""Not so fast, Sir Teabagger."" With that, Hangdown swiftly brought the key to his posterior. The slight wince on his face was like a code to Teabagger.""Very clever, Hangdown, but not an impediment, my good fellow, as I am expert in the art of full body cavity search and retrieval.""-------(Review):The stuff above is NOT what is in The Da Vinci Code. That, folks, is what is called parody.So the lowdown is this:I hate reading mystery thrillers. These kinds of books are irrelevant to me. However, just as I was compelled to read Twilight last week to satisfy my curiosity about that blockbuster, so was I compelled to do the same here.The book was alternately compelling and excruciating. Enough has been said about Dan Brown's lumpen prose style and about the book's cheesy appropriation of formulaic thriller conventions. I can corroborate all that. The novel rather dizzyingly strings together deus ex machina and the MacGuffin to propel a story that stands up under no close scrutiny. And yet, there are good things in this book -- for those who actually stick with it instead of reading a dozen pages, tossing it aside, and feeling one has earned the right to issue snarky pronouncements.The book does in fact prompt thought about the history of Judeo Christianity and because of the imperatives of popular fiction, Dan Brown is able to get down to the nut of the issue.Along the way, one finds good digs at The Church and the patriarchy and an interesting rehash of the origins of Christian theology. The book tries to soft-peddle this stuff at times in deference to the mass readership. Nonetheless the book makes for a good populist starting point for debating the errancy and dogmas of the Bible and the Church. Brown's dopey playfulness with anagrams, along with the story about the Mona Lisa made me smile, ironically enough.I cringed at the first sentence of the book, which in fact is in the opening Acknowledgements, wherein Brown refers to his novel as ""this project."" No real writer, outside of someone intentionally writing a book to be bought by Hollywood calls his art a ""project."" At least Brown's up front at the outset about his crassness -- whether he knows it or not.What makes the book fun and informative (with plenty of grains of salt) is the arcana. The thriller stuff was lame.The gist is that I won't be reading any more Dan Brown books. My curiosity is more than sated.",6,0.9959,0.066,0.838,0.096,0.4657626578611981,NEGATIVE,0.989
197,448968037,11/04/2012,1.0,"Bad mathematics! Sloppy writing! If these cardinal sins weren't enough, Brown added a predictable plot and downright obvious clues - it wasn't a quarter way through when I realised the book was heading for Rosslyn Chapel via Isaac Newton's monument - to his transgressions. There wasn't a single twist anywhere. (Oops! Hold on. The glass pyramid was a bit of a surprise but it was far too late by that stage...) As for the spiritual overtones, others have said it far better than I could.But since this book qualifies for inclusion in the golden ratio in literature, I will venture to make a few useful comments on its mathematical aspects.The Da Vinci Code is a fictional thriller which uses a trail of clues built around different aspects of the golden ratio to lead the hero through a labyrinthine maze of murder and mystery in search of the Grail. It delves into the world of art, where it finds strange hints as to the nature of the Grail in the work of Leonardo Da Vinci. It ventures into the world of science, discovering mysterious clues at the tomb of Isaac Newton and also steps into the world of politics, ascribing arcane motives to the inverted glass pyramid built at the Louvre by order of French President, Francois Mitterand.As an exploration into the deeper meaning of the golden ratio, it offers some excellent insights. Unfortunately, however, its deficiencies are manifest as well. Dan Brown builds a sincere and detailed case for the golden ratio as a symbol of the Goddess from ancient times to the present. His passionate belief is clear as he concludes in the final evocative scene of the novel ~ The quest for the Holy Grail is the quest to kneel before the bones of Mary Magdalene. A journey to pray at the feet of the outcast one.The golden ratio as the token of the Goddess is not a new idea. It was current in the twelfth century at the court of Marie de Champagne. Marie was the influential daughter of Eleanor of Aquitaine and she commissioned Chrétien de Troyes to write a poem extolling the ideals of courtly love. The result, The Knight of the Cart, was a runaway success, not only in introducing Lancelot to the tales of Arthur but in consolidating the fashion of 'courtly love' within society. Lancelot, swooning in rapture every time he encounters some reminder of Guinevere, quickly rose to become a favourite character in the repertoire of the troubadours. Yet, according to the researches of Joan Helm, it is not a flower, a jeweled ring, a silken sash or a romantic song which is love's token in these tales, it is a mathematical proportion. In the works of Chrétien de Troyes, in particular in Cligés and The Knight of the Cart, the golden ratio appears over and over as a reference to woman-as-goddess. However, having said that the golden ratio as a token of the Goddess is not a new idea, it is hardly as ubiquitous or ancient as Brown suggests. The first attested historical use of the golden ratio is in the pentagram adopted as the mystic symbol of the Pythagorean Brotherhood in about 520 BC. Brown doesn't even mention Pythagoras in passing!This is beyond odd, since even Sir Gawain and the Green Knight gets a brief moment in the sun. The golden ratio was certainly used before the sixth century BC, but its origins prior to its emergence as the Pythagorean 'number of man' can only be adduced from the hints provided by the alternative names for the pentagram. It is almost certain that Pythagoras learned of the golden ratio from the magi with whom he studied the mysteries of mathematical and astrological lore when he was a captive in Babylon. Certainly whatever the magi understood by the pentagram is lost in the mists of time, but even viewing the matter through a glass darkly, it isn't particularly difficult to find a trail leading from Babylon in the 6th century BC to Bethlehem in 1 AD using only the mathematical properties of this particular 'star'. Be the Star of Bethlehem whatever it may (and it should be pointed out that one of the traditional alternative names for the pentagram is indeed 'Star of Bethlehem', as well as 'Three King's Star'), it certainly can't be proved that the magi who came from the east bearing gifts for the King of the Jews were actually looking for a town which happened to be on a precise latitude corresponding to the vertex of a golden rectangle. Perhaps it's just coincidence that Bethlehem just happens to lie on this line (to however many decimal points you want to specify) and that's where they were directed. Or perhaps it's not.The magi aside, what we can be sure of concerning the golden ratio is that it allegedly emerged full-blown with Pythagoras. (Historically a huge question hangs over this, but let's keep with popular belief here.) It's passing strange that The Da Vinci Code doesn't mention him. Ever.On one hand, this is very surprising given the minute historical and scientific detail at various points of the novel. Brown mentions Fibonacci and his famous sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377 and so on - each new term being found by adding the last two) and its relationship to the golden ratio: if you divide one term by the one below it, you get very close to 0.618. The first couple of terms aren't particularly good instances of this, but the higher your choice of terms in the sequence, the closer the approximation becomes. (Despite what Brown says in The Da Vinci Code, 0.618 is not the golden ratio, though it's a very good estimate to three decimal places. The Pythagoreans were fascinated by it because it's actually an irrational number - that is, an infinite, non-repeating decimal. It is, for the mathematical purists amongst us, 0.5 x 5^0.5 - 0.5; when this number is divided into 1, you get 0.5 x 5^0.5 + 0.5 or, to three decimal places, 1.618. And guess what happens when you divide 0.5 x 5^0.5 - 0.5 into 0.5 x 5^0.5 + 0.5?) Brown is right - it's a wonderful, wonderful number. He mentions various nifty real-world examples of the Fibonacci sequence: he refers to the haploid nature of bees and the resulting 'golden ratio' genetic make-up of the hive, he mentions the opposing spirals in the head of a sunflower, he mentions Marcus Vitruvius, the Roman architect after whom Leonardo's ideal Vitruvian Man is named, he mentions the placement of f-holes in the Stradivarius violin, he mentions the design of the Parthenon, the pyramids and the United Nations building (is it merely coincidence that he leaves out both Notre Dame and Chartres Cathedral, either of which is a much more stunning example than these last two?), he mentions Mozart, Beethoven, Bartók, Debussy and Schubert, but he doesn't ever mention Pythagoras. On the other hand, perhaps this omission isn't really surprising at all. The basic thrust of The Da Vinci Code, apart from its continual flicks of the knife at various groups within the Catholic Church, is that the golden ratio is, and always has been, a Goddess symbol, a sign of the sacred feminine. Even the faintest whiff of the rankly-misogynistic views of the Pythagorean Brotherhood would disperse any illusion that this was ever the case.Nor is Pythagoras the only omission, although he is by far the most serious. Skip forward nearly two thousand years from Pythagoras to another religiously-minded mathematician who was just as fascinated by the golden ratio. This individual is far more obscure: his name was Fra Luca Pacioli and, if he has any lasting fame at all, it is as the 'Father of Modern Accounting'. He invented double-entry book-keeping. A portrait of Luca Pacioli shows him as an intense portly monk, completely focused on a transparent solid which is suspended in the air. Beside him is an unknown young student who, as has been pointed out, looks remarkably like the famous German painter, Albrecht Dürer (who, by the way, is also mentioned in The Da Vinci Code). This is far from an impossibility. Pacioli was the friend and mentor of an even more famous artist - he was in fact responsible for launching the career of arguably the greatest painter of all time. See, Pacioli wanted an illustrator for his manuscript on the golden ratio, De Devina Proportione - The Divine Proportion. He was sufficiently famous in his own right to be able to choose the best and brightest young talent around. So he picked a fellow from the town of Vinci, by the name of Leonardo.There's no need to invoke any conspiracy, secret motives or arcane agenda to Leonardo's use of the golden ratio and golden proportion everywhere in his works as Dan Brown does in The Da Vinci Code. Leonardo simply became fascinated with it during the course of illustrating Pacioli's manuscript. Brown's case for the golden ratio as a goddess symbol is entirely dependent on leaving out crucial evidence. Pythagoras and Pacioli are serious omissions. Yet the most compelling evidence for his belief is lacking as well. The works of Chrétien de Troyes - Cligés and The Knight of the Cart - actually support the idea that there was a wide-spread belief about the goddess and the golden ratio amongst the proponents of courtly love about eight hundred years ago. This was not the only understanding, of course, at the time - Sir Gawain and the Green Knight makes a point of stating that there was a tradition preserved amongst 'careful scholars' of the 'holy' pentangle and it's clear from the context that this is in absolute opposition to any contemporary idea of its association with the goddess. While Leonardo is, of course, the obvious choice of champion for the golden ratio in the world of art, there are a number of other artists - including most notably Piet Mondrian, Michelangelo and Georges Seurat - who might have been considered in this capacity. However, it's no surprise that Dan Brown, having relied on just a handful of books as background reference sources and thus having overlooked Pythagoras, should also overlook the master of the golden ratio. Yes, there is a master and it's certainly a painter you might suspect. Move over Leonardo. Nothing the painter from Vinci ever did remotely compares with the singularly stylish work of Edward Coley Burne-Jones in The Golden Stairs, a carefully designed Pre-Raphaelite painting of flowing beauty and ethereal elegance. It took Burne-Jones almost a decade to complete - which is probably why he didn't use a golden ratio composition technique continually. At least, not on such a magnificently dense scale - his other paintings executed around the same time, such as The Mill, do show that he was using it repeatedly, but certainly not to the same almost-obsessive degree. Besides hiding at least forty overlapping golden rectangles in its construction, The Golden Stairs contains a partial equiangular spiral. In addition, the stately angelic women descending the stairway are grouped in arrangements of Fibonacci numbers. It's a masterpiece of mathematics applied to art. It is said to have influenced one of the most famous works of the Dada school: Marcel Duchamps' Nude Descending a Staircase No.2 , itself apparently executed within a golden rectangle. It's also influenced directly and indirectly such diverse artistic endeavours as Yasumasa Morimura's Angels Descending a Staircase and Nick Bantock's Man Descending a Staircase.

The ""conspiracy theory"" it expounds is largely fictional (which would be unremarkable if so much of the ""buzz"" around it didn't revolve around the teasing of the possibility that it was all true) and in fact so similar to the non-fiction book Holy Blood, Holy Grail that the authors of that book tried to sue Dan Brown. Similarly, fiction that portrays the Catholic Church in a negative or villainous light or that uses theology to spin a thriller plot is hardly revolutionary.The above paragraph was just to get all that out of the way, since I'm more interested in talking about The Da Vinci Code's merits as a novel (or lack thereof) separate from any brouhaha over its subject matter. I read it (via charity shop, like so many) sometime after it came out to see what all the fuss was about, and the two main impressions I gained from it were:1) It was pretty dull and not at all worthy of so much controversy - I probably had a more exciting and memorable time scrambling around out-of-the-way bits of my Oxford college library looking for resources that might indicate whether there was any grain of truth in any of the Biblical conspiracy stuff.2) In addition to generally dull/clunky writing, it committed a massive, blatant basic storytelling fail. It was largely this (combined with its undeserved fame) that caused me to put it on my ""hall of shame"" shelf.The big writing fail, to which most of the rest of this review will be devoted, is, put simply: the book has the wrong main character. Robert Langdon, our nominal hero, is thoroughly dull, seemingly existing solely to spout exposition and solve puzzles (I can't remember a single distinctive personal detail about him, not even some mundane Characterization 101 element like how he takes his coffee, what he wears, or even what he looks like). Worse, he's not only largely unengaged emotionally with the central plot, but he already knows much of the central ""mystery"" (with the only thing at stake being proof of this central conspiracy theory which he knows of but doesn't seem to care strongly about). This would be bad enough, were it not for the fact that the book has a much more suitable protagonist in Sophie Neveu. She has significantly more emotional investment in the plot (since it's her estranged grandfather who is murdered at the beginning) combined with the skills to actively assist in solving it (unlike a typical bereaved relative in a murder mystery), and all of the Biblical conspiracy theory flim-flam is new to her but not (to a great extent) to Langdon.All this means that our ""hero"" spends most of the book as something of a detached tag-along and exposition dispenser on the much more emotional and potentially much more interesting, but largely unexplored, journey of another character. The obvious reason for this, of course, is that this is the second book in a franchise revolving around Langdon, a sort of nerdy middle-aged James Bond (complete with ""getting the girl"" at the end, uuuurgh), and so he has to be the central character. (One could hypothesize that the other obvious reason is that Dan Brown prefers to write a middle-aged know-it-all male American protagonist, even in a novel set in France about religious attitudes to women, and if one were to go full gender politics on the subject, label this Mansplaining: The Novel.) This, to me, simply exposes the obvious problems with writing a franchise about a globe-trotting action-hero professor who solves mysteries others have more personal investment in, and isn't really a good excuse even if one accepts the franchise concept; it's perfectly possible to write a novel from one character's perspective that is more about another character's struggles and/or emotional journey; this article discusses the idea, using To Kill A Mockingbird and The Great Gatsby as examples.However, I suspect that Dan Brown isn't really too concerned with Novel-Writing 101 concepts like ""who is this book about"" or ""what is the emotional journey"", as opposed to lurid violence and grotesquerie (I didn't even mention the questionable ""mad albino assassin monk"" character), routine plot twists (WHAT A TWEEST!) or clever-sounding exposition about historical trivia, conspiracy theories etc. that keeps people reading and the columnists controversy-ing. So I guess my conclusion, like so many others, is that he's simply a writer of high-concept plot-driven airport thrillers who's managed through clever marketing and adherence to formula (apparently analysis has shown that his writing style is highly suited to keeping people turning the pages) to make it really, really big. (Not that there's any reason why high-concept thrillers have to insult people's intelligence or neglect interesting characterization - see for example Neal Stephenson's Reamde, which I've often described using the phrase ""the best airport thriller in the world"".)",6,-0.9748,0.122,0.768,0.11,0.472447290363957,NEGATIVE,1.0
199,1470777340,12/16/2015,1.0,"“Thriller writing doesn’t get any better than this.” – The Denver Post (blurb on the back of the book)… Really? This is the best thriller writing? If this is the best then I can’t even imagine what the worst would look like!The Da Vinci Code is a wildly popular book. I completely thought I was going to love this, seeing that it has sold over 80 million copies. I was definitely not expecting this to be my first one star rating of the year.Now, I know one star seems pretty harsh. I think that objectively The Da Vinci Code is a good book, but subjectively it is probably one of the worst books I’ve ever read.This was supposed to be read for my book club, but time flew away and I only had two days to read it. I tried really, really hard to finish it but I could tell pretty early on it wasn’t going to happen, and I think that if it had been any other book I would have finished it.I’ve never had a book where my brain was just so against me reading it. I would look at it and remember I should be reading it but then find myself checking youtube or watching a tv show I only kind of like. I couldn’t read more than a chapter at a time without zoning out. Here’s why:
“Murray Hill Place—the new Opus Dei National Headquarters and conference center—is located at 243 Lexington Avenue in New York City. With a price tag of just over $47 million, the 133,000-square-foot tower is red brick and Indiana limestone. Designed by May and Pinska, the building contains over 100 bedrooms, six dining rooms, libraries, living rooms, meeting rooms, and offices. The second, eighth and sixteenth floors contain chapels, ornamented with millwork and marble. The seventeenth floor is entirely residential. Men enter through the main doors on Lexington Avenue. Women enter through the street and are “acoustically and visually separated” from the men at all times within the building.”
Why did I think trying to type that entire paragraph was a good idea? Now my hand hurts.Anyway, if you were able to read this entire paragraph without zoning out I applaud you. Maybe if you’re interested in stuff like the designer and square feet of a building you could read this, but not me, and especially not when paragraphs like this are on pretty much every page. I expect to see that sort of writing in one of my school textbooks, not in a so called “thriller”.That’s the big problem with The Da Vinci Code; it suffers from the age old issue of “great concept, subpar execution”.And I will absolutely give it that—the premise is fascinating. What if Da Vinci hid codes within all of his paintings? What if there’s this huge secret that Christianity has been keeping? What if you’ve got all the clues to figure out the mystery but are being framed for murder?But the book never lives up that idea, and I blame that on Dan Brown’s textbook writing style. He’s constantly name dropping things—people, places, streets, objects, organizations, and as someone with no background whatsoever in any of this I have no clue what he’s talking about.I also think Dan Brown really needed to make up his mind on whether or not he wanted to write a thriller or an expose on Da Vinci. Disagree with me if you like, but either write nonfiction or a thriller, you can’t do both without one taking away from the other. Every time I’d even begin to feel compelled by the story the irrelevant details would drain my enjoyment to boredom.#1 rule of writing—if the information doesn’t contribute to the story it shouldn’t be there.People read for different reasons. Some read to broaden their horizons or learn something new. I enjoy all sorts of books, but mainly I read for entertainment, and rather than being entertaining The Da Vinci Code took 600 pages to present a cool idea that could have been summed up in 350 pages.The characters didn’t really do much for me either. They were pretty flat/uninteresting. Langdon is a stereotypical protagonist without any defining traits. He came off to me as a know-it-all but an idiot at the same time. He is astonished that the French cops (view spoiler)[think he may have killed that guy who got killed whose name I already forgot, but I was literally sitting there being like, “Man, you need to be more careful with how you answer your questions here. If I were the cop I would be suspecting you of this murder. For a Harvard professor you’re kind of a dumbass.” (hide spoiler)]Sophie wasn’t any more interesting than Langdon. I was laughing at her intro because the first time she enters a scene Bache’s “mouth drops open” and then Dan Brown goes on to describe her entire outfit/looks. I was picturing in like Disney channel movies when the pretty girl enters the room and everything turns into slow motion, which I doubt was the effect he was going for.That about wraps up my thoughts! I’m excited to watch the movie, because I think if it was written well the movie could do what the books couldn’t with that awesome premise. Sorry for the super long review! I do recommend this for people who can stomach this sort of writing, but if you’re looking for something more entertaining I wouldn’t pick this up.",6,0.9956,0.071,0.796,0.134,0.5510679079956187,NEGATIVE,0.9999

202,2104493224,08/26/2017,5.0,"The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown is a religious thriller, whose plot revolves around the famous “Holy Grail” in Christianity. The story follows Harvard Professor Robert Langdon, a symbologist, who gets embroiled into the mysterious murder of a well known French curator, of the famous Louvre museum.Jacques Saunière is found dead in the grand gallery of his museum, with a peculiar message on his naked body. Arranged in the pose of the Vitruvian Man, and with a pentagon on his bare chest, Saunière’s body is discovered by the French police, headed by Fache. Also present is another message on the floor beside the body, the Fibonacci Sequence, out of order. Robert, in the city for a professional commitment, is summoned by Fache to crack the codes left by the aged curator himself. Unknown to him is the fact that Fache thinks he is the culprit, because of another message that Saunière had left, “P.S. Find Robert Langdon”.Sophie Neveu, the curator’s estranged granddaughter, helps Robert escape Fache’s grip, and together they embark on a haul, across the country, to locate something that, if falls into the wrong hands, will put the entire Christianity at risk, The Vatican included.Will the couple succeed before it is too late? Will they overcome the mortal danger to fulfill the vow for which Saunière gave up his life?This was my first ever novel by the author, and I admit I’ve since then become a fan of his work, not only because I have interests in religions other than my own, but the way he brings facts and fiction together to churn out a thrilling read is commendable. Like I have always said, the most difficult plot any author could choose is a blend of fact and fiction, and present it in a manner which is neither derogatory to the facts, nor distorts it, rather builds the storyline around it such that it is complimented. While I find this the author’s best work till date, there may be many who don’t. I will admit here, that I did go through several reviews on Goodreads before writing mine, and have found it swelling with as many single stars as with five stars. Yes, am a nobody when it comes to Christianity and it’s birth and growth, and a lot of people must be, and are better at reviewing this book than me, but a fact that remains unabashed is that I enjoyed it immensely, in the same way that I enjoy retelling of my own mythology and religion, keeping aside my own beliefs and taking them as a work of fiction. Needless to say, the novel had me gripped the entire time. My penchant for mysteries and thrillers might be one of the reasons. I remember reading this book ages ago, while I was still new into the world of reading, and usually read into the dead of the night. The language is good and yes, the vocab too. The pace at which the story unfolds is good, neither too slow, nor too fast. The explanations of the theories was explicit, and I felt satisfied. What was lacking though, was the depth in characters, lead and otherwise, I couldn’t see beyond Robert’s symbologist and Sophie’s grand daughter image. Probably that wasn’t the author’s main focus, considering the humongous plot. But I feel that if a character is to reappear in several of your books in future, or you plan to have an entire series with him/her as the lead, it becomes an important aspect of the story and it’s the author’s responsibility to reveal the character’s finer points.For me, Robert Langdon comes second to my most favorite character, Harry Potter. Never did I feel so engrossed in reading any other thriller as I did while reading this.",6,0.9964,0.031,0.828,0.141,0.5218416305916306,POSITIVE,0.9642
203,17242896,03/07/2008,5.0,"It’s about time I’ve read Dan Brown’s the Da Vinci Code. I’ve read a number of books in the past year. This is just the single example of a well proof read, journal style, creative, good writing, formula cut novel that matches the varied descriptions from many reviews who have hit the head upon this one fortunately. My favorite review above all is one on the back of the book itself. “Dan Brown has to be one of the best, smartest, and most accomplished writers in the country. THE DA VINCI CODE is many noches above the intelligent thriller; this is pure genius.” – Nelson DeMille; that helps speedily to convince that overture of crime and espionage are matters of two forms very different to undergo. The wave of credit coming towards Dan Brown is coming for his hit find on experiencing Langdon and his triumph from being innocently drawn-in atop a most hidden crime of espionage. He must revert his symbology with meticulous accuracy to puzzles. Langdon is furthest a symbolist and publishing author. He has used his wits to survive.A wearied world we are with so few clues of solution to unsolvable mysteries. One conquered is as important as any notion of philosophies. Religion is a cake and masterpiece. The renown works of famous artists another. Synchronized into a single idea makes plausibility. Although any literature I’ve been able to acquire had two things upper most in my attention. Boring and alluring. Constant encryption of language religious significance has been none other than a pressure for every unreligious laymen. Movie’s acquired a constant equivalence, presumably due in portion of costs, scalability, and technical fan exuberances.I’ve heard a lot more about Da Vinci since this book. True it was that its mystery about his famed painting was on the news for decades because of the media. A book written in fears of both elements of church and Da Vinci is bound to be ironical. Certainly it is.I intend to read other books from Dan Brown as soon as time allows. I can hardly wait.Well what can one say. Da Vinci Code is right on the mark. They have created the most speculative remark yet. Dan Brown has a technique that you can visualize the writing, description of European living through mock situations, embossing rituals of explanation, of all the importance and of historical sights down to common yards in front of houses. I love fiction. And so little is still known. But fiction always has a special place in mind. In the movies actors show suspense to add thrills and the humor in plots like these. Obviously nothing is going to happen if Langdon turns around. But he might as well felt all alone in this spot, since he could have attempted to turn and head home.",6,0.9954,0.037,0.797,0.166,0.4607853835978837,POSITIVE,0.9996
204,18719778,03/26/2008,5.0,"Wow, this was a fantastic book! I went into it not knowing what to expect. Despite the good reviews I’d heard about it, I thought it would have a strong pro-Christian slant, and thus wouldn’t be the right book for me. However, the premise of the story strongly disputed the entire basis of modern Christianity—which meshed quite nicely with my own way of thinking. As a Goddess worshiper, I already knew and understood a lot of the stuff about the Goddess that was discussed, and the stuff that was newer to me was how it tied in to Christianity. Most likely, I was coming from the opposite side of the coin as so many other readers, to whom the Goddess-aspect is the newer concept rather than the more familiar. Nevertheless, I can honestly say that even from the standpoint of a practicing Pagan and Wiccan, the story held my interest right up until the very end, and I had no qualms with the way the author handled the feminine divinity at all.The entire book, with the exception of the epilogue, takes place within the course of a single day. Thinking back on that, I found it amazing that I didn’t find the story to lag in any way, and that the author could spread an entire 24 hour period over 454 pages. Unlike a previous reviewer who claimed that the short chapters made it harder to read, I found just the opposite to be the case. I was continually saying to myself, “I can get in just one more short chapter before bed.” Which in turn made it impossible to put down. :) And the flashbacks to past memories… I didn’t find too excessive at all. Perhaps that opinion is tempered somewhat by the book I read right before this one, Minion by L. A. Banks, in which the excessive rambling of the characters’ long thought processes was driving me crazy. But I digress…I told my partner that he simply MUST read this book, so I’ve put it on reserve at our local library for him. He usually doesn’t read all that much, but with all the hype surrounding this book because of the film and all, and the fact that I’m sure the book was better than the movie as is usually the case, I’m hoping I can get him to read it within the allotted time once it’s available to us. It’s the kind of book I want everyone I know to read. If they haven’t already… I’m interested in hearing what some of my other Pagan friends have to say about it too, particularly with regards to the Goddess aspect.Oh, and in case other readers weren’t aware, you can go to the Secrets section Dan Brown’s web site to see pictures of all the historical sites described in the book.

205,1100311573,11/07/2014,2.0,"As with the first book in this series, this is pure, unadulterated shit. Where the prose is concerned, there is nothing to recommend it whatsoever; it's fairly simple, poor, and clunky all around, which probably explains why so many people seem to have loved it around the time that it blew up. People have no taste and people, in general, do not want to be challenged in their reading.It asks nothing of the masses except to be open-minded about conspiracy theories. Let's face it, everybody is open-minded about conspiracy theories. The only question is which ones tickle your fancy. For people who are into ones that involve the Catholic Church, this is right up their alley. Making hay of the oppression of over the centuries of women (which is fair to say, and, in many ways, continues to this day) and the way that the Church encouraged this by its suppression of pagan religions that honored, as the main characters like to say, ""the sacred feminine"". Claims in a foreword to be heavily researched, and in many blurbs about the book as well, throwing in bits about things like the Priory of Sion, Opus Dei, and a whole lot of name-dropping of both famous artists and scientists, such as the eponymous Leonardo Da Vinci and the likes of Isaac Newton. Whether or not this is so is largely irrelevant. Has the ring of ""truthiness"" to it, as long as you suspend your brain function for the duration of reading it. It's a lot like a blockbuster movie in this way, and in fact, as I also mentioned about the similarities to the National Treasure movies, only European rather than focused on America. Those movies are also terrible and I nonetheless enjoy them for all of their cheesiness.Unexpectedly, a character has a monologue over a couple of pages in this book that is essentially the plot of a Guy G.

So, I started searching for answer and got more confused as there were many theories out there. I just gave up. Not interesting enough for me to end up crazy.On other note...Amazing isn't it? This is East meets West equal fusion.Okay, back to the book. It will be more amazing if it was the last descendant, like the last princess of Korea. Or, they found the last descendant living in poverty being a child beggar that they met in the beginning of the book. Woah, think about it. Just stop and think. You gave a beggar a coin only for that said beggar turning up as billionaire looking for good-hearted people to inherit his wealth. Wait, wasn't that a plot for a drama I watched years back. Hmm...SPOILER ALERT(view spoiler)[Louvre curator and Priory of Sion grand master Jacques Saunière is fatally shot one night at the museum by an albino Catholic monk named Silas, who is working on behalf of someone he knows only as the Teacher, who wishes to discover the location of the ""keystone,"" an item crucial to the search for the Holy Grail. After Saunière's body is discovered in the pose of the Vitruvian Man, the police summon Harvard professor Robert Langdon, who is in town on business. Police captain Bezu Fache tells him that he was summoned to help the police decode the cryptic message Saunière left during the final minutes of his life. The message includes a Fibonacci sequence out of order. Langdon explains to Fache that Saunière was a leading authority on the subject of goddess artwork and that the pentacle Saunière drew on his chest in his own blood represents an allusion to the goddess and not devil worship, as Fache thinks.Sophie Neveu, a police cryptographer, secretly explains to Langdon that she is Saunière's estranged granddaughter, and that Fache thinks Langdon is the murderer because the last line in her grandfather's message meant for Neveu said ""P.S. Find Robert Langdon,"" which Fache had erased prior to Langdon's arrival. Neveu is troubled by memories of her grandfather's involvement in a secret pagan group. However, she understands that her grandfather intended Langdon to decipher the code, which leads them to a safe deposit box at the Paris branch of the Depository Bank of Zurich. Neveu and Langdon escape from the police and visit the bank. In the safe deposit box they find the keystone: a cryptex, a cylindrical, hand-held vault with five concentric, rotating dials labeled with letters. When these are lined up correctly, they unlock the device. If the cryptex is forced open, an enclosed vial of vinegar breaks and dissolves the message inside the cryptex, which was written on papyrus. The box containing the cryptex contains clues to its password.Langdon and Neveu take the keystone to the home of Langdon's friend, Sir Leigh Teabing, an expert on the Holy Grail, the legend of which is heavily connected to the Priory. There, Teabing explains that the Grail is not a cup, but a tomb containing the bones of Mary Magdalene. The trio then flees the country on Teabing's private plane, on which they conclude that the proper combination of letters spell out Neveu's given name, Sofia. Opening the cryptex, they discover a smaller cryptex inside it, along with another riddle that ultimately leads the group to the tomb of Isaac Newton in Westminster Abbey.During the flight to Britain, Neveu reveals the source of her estrangement from her grandfather ten years earlier. Arriving home unexpectedly from university, Neveu secretly witnesses a spring fertility rite conducted in the secret basement of her grandfather's country estate. From her hiding place, she is shocked to see her grandfather with a woman at the center of a ritual attended by men and women who are wearing masks and chanting praise to the goddess. She flees the house and breaks off all contact with Saunière. Langdon explains that what she witnessed was an ancient ceremony known as Hieros gamos or ""sacred marriage.""By the time they arrive at Westminster Abbey, Teabing is revealed to be the Teacher for whom Silas is working. Teabing wishes to use the Holy Grail, which he believes is a series of documents establishing that Jesus Christ married Mary Magdalene and bore children, in order to ruin the Vatican. He compels Langdon at gunpoint to solve the second cryptex's password, which Langdon realizes is ""apple."" Langdon secretly opens the cryptex and removes its contents before tossing the empty cryptex in the air. Teabing is arrested by Fache, who by now realizes that Langdon is innocent. Bishop Aringarosa, head of religious sect Opus Dei and Silas' mentor, realizing that Silas has been used to murder innocent people, rushes to help the police find him. When the police find Silas hiding in an Opus Dei Center, he assumes that they are there to kill him and he rushes out, accidentally shooting Bishop Aringarosa. Bishop Aringarosa survives but is informed that Silas was found dead later from a gunshot wound.The final message inside the second keystone leads Neveu and Langdon to Rosslyn Chapel, whose docent turns out to be Neveu's long-lost brother, whom Neveu had been told died as a child in the car accident that killed her parents. The guardian of Rosslyn Chapel, Marie Chauvel Saint Clair, is Neveu's long-lost grandmother. It is revealed that Neveu and her brother are descendants of Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene. The Priory of Sion hid her identity to protect her from possible threats to her life.The real meaning of the last message is that the Grail is buried beneath the small pyramid directly below the La Pyramide Inversée, the inverted glass pyramid of the Louvre. It also lies beneath the ""Rose Line,"" an allusion to ""Rosslyn."" Langdon figures out this final piece to the puzzle; he follows the Rose Line to La Pyramide Inversée, where he kneels before the hidden sarcophagus of Mary Magdalene, as the Templar knights did before him.

226,693019871,08/12/2013,4.0,"I don’t know how to rate this book… I’ve been stuck at home all day to finish this book, I wasn’t holding it between my hands enjoying every chapter but when I turned the last page I felt that I didn’t really loved this book... Yep, this seems odd but that’s what happened with me.This book is a piece of art, it’s a large puzzle that Dan Brown only could create and solve their riddles. You are absolutely enabled to read this book without going every 10 minutes to check something on Google and guess what? Every time you think that Dan Brown is making up some events you will discover that he is only telling you the truth, the historical parts in this book are so accurate, so is the description of all the churches and museums, and it will be up to you to believe the author’s interpretations of these historical events. ”That is the definition of faith-acceptance of that which we imagine to be true, that which we cannot prove.”For years and years, I have listened to the story of Jesus Christ and I always had a lot of questions surrounding his birth and his 33 years on earth. Dan Brown in this book tried to tell us a different story from the one we used to believe in for years. He doesn’t only proclaim Bible as a man work, he also take down the Godhead of Jesus Christ. Mary Magdalena the “Whore” that the bible told her story was treated by Dan Brown as a Goddess, the spouse of Jesus and the mother of his child.” Jesus was viewed by his followers as a mortal prophet….a great and powerful man, but a man nonetheless. A mortal. Jesus’ establishment as the Son of God was officially proposed and voted on by the Council of Nicea. A relatively close vote at that. “ “The Bible did not arrive by fax from heaven…The Bible is the product of man, my dear. Not of God. The Bible did not fall magically from the clouds. Man created it as a historical record of tumultuous times, and it has evolved through countless translations, additions, and revisions. History has never had a definitive version of the book.” What I said before will give you the feeling that Dan Brown opened fire on church leaving no coming-back chance. This is not true! Although he questioned the fundamental two basics of the Christian faith, he didn’t really accuse the church directly and he tried here and there to make some peace with it. Well he tried to cut some corners from time to time. Dan Brown didn’t questioned the good nature of Jesus, he just wondered: what the problem is if Jesus was a father? What’s the problem if Jesus loved Mary M.?To me, it really didn’t matter. What I found special about the bible is not related to the fact the Jesus is the son of God or that he was a bachelor. And I don’t understand why the church would banned this book. It was really very interesting to read this novel, I enjoy anything related to Davin chi and the plot was smart beyond imagination. The fastness of the events didn’t give me enough time to absorb the characters or to feel involved with any one of them, the only person that I felt his presence while reading this book was Jesus Christ. I was thinking about him all the time, imaging him with a wife and a child and the image was beyond beautiful, I think that giving him the image of a father would make him clearer and closer to humans. Dan Brown tells the story of Mary M, the missing Goddess in the Christianity as he proclaimed. He accused the church of trying to bury the true nature of Jesus and remove the feminism from the religion. I’m not sure why Brown avoid to talk about presence of the Virgin Mary, I mean Christianity has a very important woman as a symbol, the mother of God is one of the most influencing saints all over the world, she is very sacred and even the Koran talked about her.Maybe the image given by the Virgin Mary is not the one the first Christians feared. Maybe they feared Mary M. because she was a powerful woman, a woman as important as Jesus… Imagine for an instant how the world was going to look if Mary M. was really the precedent of Jesus, if she was the one who carried the Church and completed Jesus mission. I’m sure the world wasn’t going to look the same, at least we would have a female Pope once in a while.Finally, I want to say that I’m not a big fan of the church. I hate how it changed the true spirit of Christianity. I really don’t care if Jesus had a wife or not and I am absolutely going to read Dan Brown again: DPS: while searching via Google I found this interesting website.History VS the Da Vinci Code It marks the mistakes done by Dan Brown while writing the history of Mary M. Even though some of what is mentioned here may be true but I don't think anyone has the right to forbid Dan Brown (or any other one) to say his opinion in any subject including Jesus life. This book is a novel and anything under this title could not be taken as the ultimate truth.",5,0.9978,0.065,0.792,0.143,0.5466052827380952,NEGATIVE,0.958

230,106330703,06/09/2010,2.0,"his is definitely in a sub-genre that I like - mystery-thriller with secret societies and links to the past - lots of references to art and architecture, etc...And it was a reasonably well-written, quite entertaining book.However, before reading it, I expected to be able to dismiss all the (mainly Christian) uproar about the book, much as I dismissed the uproar around The Last Temptation of Christ (which I never got around to seeing, actually...so I can't discuss that.) But instead, I did understand (at least part of the reasons) why people have become upset. Brown has a disturbing tendency to jump from historical fact, to well-known theories debated by scholars, to complete conspiracy-theory baloney, without any transition between the types of material.His bibliography is a strange mix of respected works and completely discredited ones, again without any division made. I have to conclude that Brown is really incapable of reading critically for his source material.No BIG SPOILERS ahead, but you might not want to read if you're planning on reading the book soon...Brown's main theory is that the early church actively suppressed the idea of the ""sacred feminine,"" eliminating goddess worship. There is a great deal of truth to this. When picking ""one god,"" Christianity (and Islam and Judaism) picked a male god. In the past, most cultures had both male and female deities. Today, most have a singular, specifically male god. This is fact. To his credit, Brown doesn't go as far as some modern non-scholarly authors in asserting the existence of some kind of feminist goddess-worshipping paradise before Christianity. However, he then jumps to theories that medieval notions of chivalry and symbols traditionally used for the feminine (and the culture of medieval Europe WAS very intensely into such symbology) are all evidence of a secret goddess-worshipping cult which has survived down the ages to the present day, complete with sex-rituals, etc... This is simply NOT true - but Brown just jumps from one to the other, as if it follows logically.In another part of the book, Brown talks about Constantine's conflation of older religious holidays and observances with the new, Christian ones. Again, true. But he jumps right from that to an assertion that the Dead Sea Scrolls are books of the Bible that Constantine attempted to destroy for their ""humanist"" representation of Jesus, and Jesus' relationship with Mary Magdalene. THE DEAD SEA SCROLLS DO NOT HAVE THIS CONTENT! Argh! This is just misinformation! But it's mixed right in the with the information that, in contradiction with Christian ""myth,"" Biblical writings do NOT ever identify Mary Magalene as a prostitute. Which is true, and freely stated by Catholics.However, Brown jumps on to say that Jesus actually intended Mary Magdalene to take over his ministry after his death, and that Peter just kinda jumped in and took over against Jesus' wishes. Knowing what I do about the culture of the ancient Middle East, I find this to be a highly unlikely theory. A woman just would not have had that kind of authority - and there's no sort of evidence in support of this.I could go on, but I'm sure many web pages have done so in much more detail... and I don't want to give away some of the fun parts! Overall, I enjoyed the book a lot, but I think it's quite possible to invent secret societies, plots and conspiracies WITHOUT contradicting known historical facts, and I wish Brown had made more of an effort to do so in this book...",5,0.9697,0.082,0.803,0.115,0.4111632194965526,NEGATIVE,0.9196
231,187486760,07/22/2011,2.0,"Generally, I try very hard to tread carefully when I write a negative review of an international bestseller. I'm not going to bother this time. I'm sorry if I offend Dan Brown's fans, but this book deserves a lashing.First, I'll explain the two stars. I thought about giving it one. But it got two, since I made it to the end of the book. Also, Dan Brown's ""facts"" stirred me enough to do my own research, so I did learn things I didn't know before.Beyond that, however, there was nothing in this book I hadn't already experienced in Angels and Demons. Naked old man found dead in a strange position -- check. Token female scientist (who also happens to be hot) -- check. Poems written in iambic pentameter -- check. Clues that could only make sense to our reluctant (and boring) hero, Robert Langdon -- check. Factually incorrect information -- check, check, and double check. Honestly, the plot ""twists"" at the end weren't even a surprise to me, because I knew how Angels and Demons ended, and Da Vinci ended the same way. If anyone other than Dan Brown had written this book, it would have been considered plagiarism.Additionally, for a book that flaunts ""the sacred feminine"" on every page, why is it that Brown's one female protagonist (Sophie) is an idiot? She can't figure anything out on her own, and she needs a male baby-sitter to coax her into solving this mystery? Maybe the author should have given her a copy of Angels and Demons before sending her on her quest. Da Vinci Code would have been much shorter.And finally, I echo what countless others have already stated: There are so many factual errors in this book that it can drive an educated person crazy. I took a *basic* humanities course in college, about six years ago, and I still recognized many of the errors in Langdon's lectures. I can only imagine that true art historians must be pulling their hair out.",5,-0.8922,0.098,0.84,0.062,0.5591911764705882,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Because of this, there were even made lots of books which explained the mistakes and the fake information in it.Many people - especially lovers of conspiracies, I guess - took everything that is told in here for absolute truths and the Church had to intervene, explaining that there are more inaccuracies than everything.Also, it had to be specified several times because in each printed copy, in every translated language, the author was determined not to deny the story he told by writing, before the prologue, that «all descriptions of works of art and architectural, secret documents and rituals contained in this novel reflect reality».Unfortunately, I’ve seen the movie before, so making comparisons seems normal but I have to say, honestly, that I liked both in the same way. The novel is great; it can keep the reader interested, involving him or her in joining a clue after another until he or she reaches the most important questions: who is the Master? What happened to Sophie's family? What is it that seems to be missing? Where is the Graal? Someone can say the narration is boring and they are kind of right. The author used a lot of historical details and descriptions of the environments. For an involved person, nothing changes; for a less interested person, they are blocking points. I personally find interested to know that the church was built in 1099, but perhaps not everyone shares this position.Furthermore, I’m glad that reading this first volume doesn't force me to read the next two books because it’s exhaustive enough.↠ 4 stars",5,0.9848,0.059,0.785,0.156,0.5521683673469389,POSITIVE,0.7341

The feminist in me also appreciated all the female roles and the importance we played in history. Our importance over the years has severely diminished and even in 2020 women have to fight for our rights and to be seen as equals, let alone more. That being said there were definitely parts of the book that kind of dragged and then some made me laugh.

The key difference between the two is their focus on the historical facts and art in relation to the fictional story being told. Angels and Demons focuses heavily on the clues found in the art itself. However, The Da Vinci Code focuses more on a theory/ story from the past. The Da Vinci Code is an action packed story. I always enjoy stories that are full of action, however I was looking forward to the steady pace of Angels and Demons that focused more on historical facts and art.

237,80580555,12/10/2009,3.0,"Not bad, not bad at all. Most people I've talked to about this book ask whether the writing is as bad as they've heard, but much like Stephanie Meyer, I don't think Brown is a bad writer, just not a particularly good one. Unremarkable prose isn't a sin, especially if you can keep the pages turning like Brown can (something Meyer struggles with). Every chapter ends on a cliff hanger!

Then I read reviews and saw how polarizing it is; some seem to think it has valuable pieces to ponder, while others feel it is simply drivel and not worth your time. So I had to find out for myself.First, just as a story, it was interesting and kept my attention very well. The characters only had average development, I'd say. I never FELT of them as anything real (I'll give an unfair comparison, Stephen King is exceptional at that, and even knowing his is a novel, I had a good feel for the characters and what they liked, etc). Brown gives some good detail that give the story a bit more of a real feel, though I think that could be better too. The plot line was great and the twists in the story were captivating. Brown is clearly very good at that. My least favorite aspect may have been that Brown mixed real history with slight changes or exaggerations (or outright false aspects) that were hard to detect easily, so I checked to see whether it was factual. For example, The author claimed that no one thought Jesus was God until a counsel (maybe Nicaea) decided that He was divine. Well, no, that doesn't match reality. He did that WAY too much and FOR ME, one who wants to know what was factual, it just made it more work than I like. Also negative was that there were ideal places he could have used foreshadowing to great effect, but he didn't. He simply wouldn't tell you something... let it be known it was a secret. I prefer for hints to be dropped periodically, which engage my brain in trying to figure it out... I get a rush if I figure it out before the author reveals it. But Brown tended to overtly refer to something as a secret, and later just tell you... no puzzle to figure out. Those were really missed opportunities to enhance the book a lot.Even with that, I'm not sorry I read it, but neither can I say it's high on my list of recommendations. Good book. That's all.

I mean what are the chances that that would happen twice to a college professor? Come now. Maybe I just liked Angels and Demons better because I love Bernini more than Da Vinci. Maybe the symbology/cryptology was a little more complicated in this book to follow on an audiobook.Or maybe it's just because I think it's heinous how people assumed that a writer of historical thrillers had secret information that called Church history into question, that somehow a fiction story was actually a key to hidden truth.I don't know, I just didn't buy into this one as much, which is saying a lot because Angels and Demons had some seriously ridiculous plot elements.All this being said, I told my friend I'd read his favorite of the series, so I have more to go. And I do appreciate the skill to come up with a story that fits into existing historical & artistic artifacts, and I do love art, architecture and history, but I just don't see how this book became everything when it first came out.",4,0.9442,0.067,0.812,0.12,0.5418010752688172,NEGATIVE,1.0
279,4390425304,01/20/2022,4.0,"So, in my opinion, this book was much better than Brown’s Angels & Demons book. The biggest difference being that it was more carefully planned out and wasn’t as easy to guess what was going to unfold before reading. One of my favorite things about this book is how Brown can get my mind rolling in wonder with his historical references. This is definitely one of those books that now has an endless amount of dog-eared pages that I will love to go back and explore deeper on my own. I will say though that Brown has a tendency to drag on certain moments a bit too much. As I’ve said before…less is more. I also feel that the ending was not much of a big deal. I felt that I was being built up and built me up some more throughout my historical adventure, only to find myself not completely satisfied in the end. Overall, I had an absolutely thrilling ride! And for a future note, I’m willing to give Dan Brown another shot to awe me in perhaps another historical adventure. :)",4,0.9762,0.023,0.819,0.158,0.519253663003663,POSITIVE,0.9999

I had expected Robert Langdon to be a pompous windbag, from what I knew about the book before I started, and he sometimes is in his flashbacks, but he is more often the bumbling and slightly clueless professor. I found some of the plot devices annoying such as the delay in telling Sophie the big secret. I also never really felt that Sophie or Robert were in danger which reduced the tension a little. But on the whole it was a fun, quick read plot wise. On the other hand, while it pretends not to be, this is an anti-Christian and even more profoundly anti-Catholic and oddly pro-pagan book which I found sad and slightly disturbing considering it's popularity.

The book is filled with thrill, mystery, secrets, betrayal, faith, love and a bucket full of facts.I could take off my eyes of the pages of the book. It was hilarious at times and at times scary. I was so glad to read this beautiful description letting me know some great facts about Da Vinci’s paintings and about cryptography, etc. Such overwhelming amount of knowledge! I am in awe with the mind set with which Dan Brown writes all his novels. Such definition and knowledge. It is certainly worth the read. I am surprised to see that the last three novels I have read have similar parallel story unfurling in the books. In the last book Angels and Demons – I found the entire book written about the episodes happening in a day same as in Da Vinci Code. This is one of the unique plotting Dan Brown does in his books!

Speculation as to its location, its meaning, even its existence have fueled the imaginations of artists, writers, rulers and clerics for centuries. Dan Brown's THE DA VINCI CODE is a stunning new thriller that presents a new slant on the meaning of the very nature of this vessel, which was purported to hold the blood of Christ.Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is in Paris on business when he receives an urgent midnight call at his hotel from the Paris Judicial Police. The man he had planned to meet with the next day, a curator of the Louvre, has been found murdered in the Grand Gallery of the world's most famous art museum. Langdon has been summoned apparently because of his connection to the victim and his knowledge of ancient symbols.He is rushed to the scene to find Jacques Sauniere's body lying spread eagled and naked with a pentagram painted on his torso. He is told that Sauniere apparently painted the symbol on his own chest and arranged his body in the bizarre position before he died of a gunshot wound to the abdomen. Langdon's expertise in symbology and his acquaintance with the curator are called upon to help decipher the motive and help police find the killer.Police detective Sophie Neveu from the Paris police cryptology division arrives on the scene; she and Langdon embark on a dangerous and frantic search for the murderer. They soon discover that Sauniere's message was not a clue to the identity of his killer, which is what the police believe, but instead holds a much deeper and significant message to mankind. The connections to the murderer reach into the very depths of some of the highest authorities of Europe.Langdon and Neveu are ensnared in the ever-tightening mesh of this deadly triangle of power, as Langdon seeks to clear himself of suspicion of his colleague's murder. The desperate battle between The Priory of Scion, Opus Dei and the Vatican in the search for the Holy Grail airs one of the most fascinating theories on the Holy of Holies published in a very long time.Dan Brown's extensive research on secret societies and symbology (he wrote ANGELS AND DEMONS, a bestseller about secret Italian religious societies) adds intellectual depth to this page-turning thriller. His surprising revelations on Da Vinci's penchant for hiding codes in his paintings will lead the reader to search out renowned artistic icons as The Mona Lisa, The Madonna of the Rocks and The Last Supper. The Last Supper holds the most astonishing coded secrets of all and, after reading THE DA VINCI CODE, you will never see this famous painting in quite the same way again.Brown has given us a controversial subject wrapped in thriller clothing that will provoke debate in the circles of religious and secret societies --- and among readers.

294,41934764,10/28/2007,2.0,"My usual book shopping route is a large looping, nose pinched shut, around any book that is being swallowed whole by the masses. Not out of arrogance, but simply because on those rare occasions when I have bent this rule, it has usually resulted in reading time wasted on literary fast food--quickly digested but of little nutritional value. I made an exception with Brown's ""Da Vinci Code"" because the premise fascinated me. Ever on the spiritual quest for enlightenment, the idea of a deeper relationship between Christ and Mary Magdalene was interesting, and appeared to have some merit, too, among respected theologians. I give. The first page of the first chapter nearly convinced me to dump the book after all. Mistake, I thought, should have kept to my usual rule. The opening was, well, ghastly. I was being manipulated into a formula page turner, dead bodies falling, mystery unravelling, clues spattering the pages. The book was a gift, however, and I had wanted it, so I wincingly read on. The manipulations worked. I began turning pages, and I turned them fast, even as I was aware every super short cliffhanger chapter of the book was holding me by the usual ploys of mystery writers of the day. The writing improved. But it was the premise that nailed me to the page. Brown had done his research, and he had enough truth in his fiction that my curiosity was peaked. A museum curator is murdered, leaving elaborate clues, leading down trail after trail, through twist after twist, speeding along the plot. A cryptographer, granddaughter of the murdered curator, chases down the clues with her partner (later, predictably, her love interest) who is a historian-symbologist summoned by the curator himself, literally in blood. Authorities on their heels, they race from clue to clue, putting together the puzzle pieces that eventually lead to a secret society working to preserve the idea of a Holy Grail that is not a chalice, but indeed the sacred feminine, a church built on Mary Magdalene as the rock of the church rather than Peter. Christ's partner and wife? Intriguing. The established Church is furious and bristly at the idea, and that is easy enough to imagine. Brown creates a plausible mystery. Whether based on conjecture or elements of truth, that is what has drawn so many readers to so breathlessly turn these pages, and to question traditional beliefs and reexamine them, whatever the conclusion, is never a bad thing. If for this reason alone, I recommend the book. ",4,0.9686,0.088,0.776,0.136,0.4386529386529387,NEGATIVE,0.9996
295,740558643,10/13/2013,1.0,"This is literally the worst book I've ever read. I’m mostly angry about how Dan Brown’s book heavily centers around the “sacred feminine” and yet his titular female character exists primarily to excite the desires of his male protagonist and as a tool through which said protagonist can explain the mountains of background information in history that you need to understand this bookI’m even more mad that it’s constantly referenced that as a code breaker she “should” know how to break these codes, but no Robert Langdon has to come to the rescue and explain it to her because obviously her weak feminine mind can’t handle it otherwise. The whole story is written in a way that the female character is consistently subjugated by her male counterparts as a plot device but no one is ever held accountable for it. And this comes from a book where justice, and just desserts, are big themes! The people who kill in this book, the people who steal, the people who scheme and plot? They get theirs. There’s no acknowledgement that Langdon and Teabing shouldn’t be sexually harassing and belittling Sophie, it drives the plot forward and fuels Brown’s lazy writing.And it becomes abundantly more obvious when things happen outside of character plot and action to just character description, character depth, scene description (including a memorable and infuriating transmisogynistic bit and consistent reductions of women to their genitalia), verbal description (Sophie never just speaks like Langdon does, her voice has to “quaver”), and the way Sophie’s character arc consistently paints her as a lost little girl unable to persist without the menz helping her. And it’s just infuriating that this comes from a book that is supposed to be about the power of women in religion. It’s a slap in a face.Also I’m mad uncomfortable with the implication that Sophie (previously mentioned leading lady) is completely ignorant towards the sexual practices of early-Christianity and Pagan religions and has to be taught by the older, more “experienced” male characters who also refer to her as a “virgin” in the field. I’m mad uncomfortable that when she expresses her discomfort, they keep plowing ahead with the conversation anyway.Not to mention the ableism. The two bad guys of the book are an assassin with albinism and a man on crutches and there are no disabled people among the ""good"" guys.

296,54425089,04/29/2009,5.0,"An excellent read, but it's truly sad to think that some readers assume that Dan Brown's contrived history is factual and would even base their spiritual beliefs on a book of fiction. It is a novel, not a faith deciding textbook. If you don't agree with facts, go look it up yourself and find what you think is true. ""That is the definition of faith--acceptance of that which we imagine to be true, that which we cannot prove."" It seems that people either passionately love this book or they passionately hate it. The success of this book is that it's a fictional work that brings the non-fictional world into better focus. As a story, it's fine and interesting enough to hold your attention. I found myself staying up til the wee hours of the morning in a race to finish it, but I'll also admit it's not any kind of epic piece of literature.Harvard professor and symbologist Robert Langdon is summoned to the Louvre to help Captain Bezu Fache of the Paris Judicial Police unravel the clues surrounding the body of the murdered curator, Jacques Sauniere. Sophie Neveu, a police cryptologist soon arrives, and it almost immediately becomes clear that it will take their combined skill and knowledge to follow the trail laid out by Sauniere before his death. As they attempt to uncover the hidden secrets of The Priory of Sion. Their search leads them to several Paris locations and eventually to England. Of course, others are also on the trail, including Captain Fachu, a huge albino monk, and an unknown formidable opponent who appears to be the only person in possession of a complete overview of the puzzle which they are trying to solve. The story combines history, murder, intrigue, wordplay combined with cryptanalysis, romance, religion and art. These elements are combined in such an incredibly captivating way that the pace never slackens as you are constantly being bombarded with both new facts and puzzles to solve.The 5 star rating is for the fact that it opens the reader's eyes to topics in history, art, mathematics, and religion that might have been overlooked, but which are startingly true. Also, the book deserves five stars for pure entertainment value. Brown has the ability to take dry facts and present them in a fascinating way.

After his presentation, he was supposed to meet up with Louvre curator Jacques Saunière, a meeting he had been looking forward to. However, Saunière never shows up. A bit disappointed, Langdon's still happy to finally find some rest in his hotel room at the Ritz after a long day. After all, he'll head back to the US early the next morning. At least that's what he thinks!A mere couple hours later, in the middle of the night, he is being awoken and summoned to the Louvre Museum, where the assassinated Saunière has been found. The crime scene is not at all what could be considered even remotely normal. Saunière's body is naked and spread out on the floor, hinting to Da Vinci's famous Vitruvian Man. On Saunière's belly, a six-pointed star has been drawn with his own blood. And finally, a number of additional information next to the body is revealed with a blacklight. Captain Bezu Fache, head of the police force in Paris, pretends to be eager to learn more about the symbols left behind at the crime scene. While Langdon is happy to help, he doesn't anticipate that he's here for an entirely different reason: he's the main suspect! Luckily, Saunière's granddaughter and cryptologist Sophie Neveu has a different plan. She wants to find out about her family's secret... a task for which she needs Langdon's help. Being convinced of his innocence, she helps him escape.As in Angels and Demons, a wild race against time and other enemies begins. Most of the story evolves in Paris, while part takes place in the UK. In The Da Vinci Code, religion again plays a major role: the Holy Grail, the Priory of Sion, and Opus Dei are central. There are a bunch of awesome and memorable characters, among which the fanatic monk Silas and the quirky British historian Sir Leigh Teabing have to be mentioned.
