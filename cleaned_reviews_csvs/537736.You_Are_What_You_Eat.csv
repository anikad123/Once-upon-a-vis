Makes it an unpleasant read. I heard of Gillian from her BBC show ""you are what you eat."" I decided to pick up this book from the library, mainly to see if a few foods featured on her show had recipes in here. A lot of what is in this book is kind of obvious. Fruit, veggies, and organic are good for you, yes, we all know this. Some is interesting to consider, and then there's the rest. I appreciate her use of conventional chinese medicine (ie - the tongue diagnosis) and her pro-organic healthy style, but I think she's taken good ideas and gone over board. A few things in her book are in contradiction to what I've been told by my dietitian. Fine, different ideas are out there. Gillian has a very all-or-nothing attitude that I find a bit hard to work with. Hold on to your pants, I'm going to eat chocolate. I don't need to eat *all* the chocolate. But there's no little bit with her. There will be no chocolate, no alcohol, no caffeine, no red meat, no fat, no refined sugars, no flour, no, no no and NO. That's not so realistic in my world. I'm going to have dinner at friends house, and no I will not be asking to use their blender to juice my celery and cucumber stick. I'm going to work events and restaurants, and they may not be organic and raw foods. I'll deal. And you know what? I'll live. Again, I know first hand that when I eat well I feel good. (again, obvious) but life happens. And Gillian? I know PLENTY of people that eat your anti-christ diet and have strong interest in sex! So calm down on the sex drive already!

She also advises food combining (not eating certain foods in the same meal as others, or taking care to have meals include foods from certain categories together), which, I gather from other sources, there is no scientific support for.Many of the pictures in the book are lovely close-ups of food, but there are also many pictures of the author in various food-related settings.

It was also good to be reminded why we need to take suppliments as our diets are insuffienct to supply all the vitamins, minierals that the body needs.My only gripe with the book is she advocates for eating almost on a constant basis, breakfast, snack, lunch, then snack, supper then snack. She did not delve much into the implication of what constant eating has on our hormones ie insulin and how we can end up being insulin resistance which can lead to weight gain.

9,472110210,12/07/2012,4.0,"Few people know or remember that Gillian McKeith had a television show, as I recall, also called ""You Are What You Eat"", which I sporadically watched while it lasted due to the entertainment factor. During the duration of the half an hour or so the episodes lasted, Gillian would visit the homes of families with awful eating habits, investigate their fridges, make angry comments about how offensive she finds all the Chinese take-out leftovers, Coca-Cola, and/or hot pockets their fridge holds, and then send them off to poop in a large, clear container before taking this container and waving it around and saying, ""See? SEE HOW UNHEALTHY YOUR STOOL IS?"" (Due to this habit, she is known internationally as--I'm not making this up--the Awful Poo Lady.)Those families were eating vegetable casserole for the rest of their lives. I guarantee it.Her book isn't nearly as menacing as her television show. In it, Ms. McKeith tells you simply what kind of food is bad and what is good, and tells you what kind of food can help you improve brainpower or muscles or various other things. (Apparently raw sauerkraut is good for your sex drive. I never knew that before. Did anyone?) She does it comprehensively and obviously knows what she's doing, and manages to hold the reader's interest, despite the fact that it is, you know, a cookbook. Four stars.

It's very colorful and glossy, and it's divided into really small segments, so you can easily pick it up and read a few pages and complete a whole topic. It covers interesting things such as looking at physical problems and figuring out what you may be deficient on -- for instance cracks on the fingertips or tongue. It's right up my alley to use the nutrients in foods to heal and to eliminate the bad things to help fix health problems. What's not up my alley is eating crap, not exercising and then seeking out medicines to mask problems. This book focuses on improving health through wholesome foods, but it's not intimidating. It's informative and simple. She offers a simple 1-day cleanse that involves a lot of fluids -- water and tea and fresh veggie and fruit juice -- along with green smoothies, miso soup and fresh veggies. Most ""cleanses"" are long and intimidating. This one seems so much more doable. The book offers a few recipe ideas in the back and some examples of eating for a week. It's not entirely opposed to any entire food group -- something I'm always interested in knowing before purchasing a nutrition/diet book.

As in, I guess she inspects people's feces and then berates them for being such fat, unhealthy slobs. Well, that sounds entertaining (not).Still, I actually liked this book. The main take-home message: eat lots of fresh, unprocessed stuff, especially veggies, and avoid the ""bad nasties"" like soda and junk food. But it's presented in a fun, inspirational way. This book actually has helped me to improve my diet and reduce some bad habits, so I do recommend it...with a couple reservations.One is to do your own research about the supplements she recommends. I am not against wisely using some supplements, for example I find that taking valerian before bedtime actually works better than some prescriptions I've tried. I relax and fall asleep...no side effects! Likewise, a cup of peppermint tea after a heavy meal calms my stomach down, so no need for an antacid. On the other hand, people can get into trouble if they're not smart, like what happened with ephedra. Some people took huge amounts of that herb, in mixed ""energy"" or ""weight loss"" pills, when that is not even the appropriate use of the herb to start with. Because of things like that, herbs which are helpful in some circumstances get banned, and everything is tarnished with the same brush.I don't recall McKeith giving any particularly bad advice (based on my study of herbalism), but it's always a good idea to do some research before taking anything. (As possible sources for your research, I recommend Andrew Weil or Rosemary Gladstar, two authors whose advice has never led me astray.)The only real quibble I have with this book is that she mentions getting colonics at one point.
