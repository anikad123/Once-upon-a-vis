0,5288076,08/29/2007,5.0,"This book I read in a day. I was in a Chapters bookstore in Toronto (that's like Barnes and Noble to the Americans in the crowd) and anyway I was just browsing around, trying to kill time. When suddenly I saw this nice display of red books with an upturned dog on the cover. Attracted as always to bright colours and odd shapes, I picked it up. It's only about 250 pages or so. I read the back cover and was intrigued. I flipped through the pages and noticed that it had over One Million chapters. I was doubly intrigued. So I walked over to the far wall of the bookstore to sit and begin to read a few pages. I always do this to ensure that I don't waste what little money I have on a book possessing nothing more than a flashy cover. (I do the same at the cinema - if I don't like the first 20 minutes, I get a refund. Restaurants, too: if I don't like the first ten bites, I walk out on the bill). This is a book written by a Child Developmental Psychologist - I think that's the right term... - anyway, a doctor who works with mentally or physically challenged youngsters. The novel itself is a first person tale written by a high-functioning, mentally challenged boy in England who wakes up one morning to find his neighbor's dog dead on his lawn. The boy's teacher suggests he should write about the incident, which he eagerly sets out to do. So we have his first ""novel"", ""The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time"". He plays Inspector and tries to solve the mystery as Sherlock Holmes would do...Of course, if he's going to write a book, that means he can take control. He hates the way other books have chapter numbers that increase sequentially (1,2,3). He prefers prime numbers and will number his chapters in sequential primes - hence, by the end of the book, you're reading chapter 123,314,124 or whatever (I ain't no math guy ;)Now then, he also writes about other things in his life and through his perspective you get some tear-jerking moments of true, unobstructed humanity: the way his parents broke up because of his state, how he has all these dreams about being someone great and going to a top college, even though you know that his situation will never really allow it. Anyway. I read this book cover to cover sitting on the floor of that Chapters bookstore. By the end of it I was absolutely bawling my eyes out. Never cried so much in my life. In fact, as I type this and think back on that story, I'm dripping on my keyboard (and I'm at my office!). However - these are tears of joy. The boy does it. He can do anything. It's the most uplifting book I've ever read.I highly recommend this book to anyone who feels anything deep down inside. ",499,0.9858,0.046,0.834,0.12,0.4301379440665154,NEGATIVE,0.5557

3,77935104,11/16/2009,5.0,"(Book 19 from 1001 books) - The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, Mark HaddonThe novel is narrated in the first-person perspective by Christopher John Francis Boone, a 15-year-old boy who describes himself as ""a mathematician with some behavioral difficulties"" living in Swindon, Wiltshire. Although Christopher's condition is not stated, the book's blurb refers to Asperger syndrome, high-functioning autism, or savant syndrome. Christopher John Francis Boone is a 15-year-old boy who has behavioral problems and lives with his father, Ed. He explains in his narration that his mother, Judy, died two years ago. Then one day, the boy discovers the dead body of the neighbour's dog, Wellington, speared by a garden fork. Mrs. Shears, the dog's owner, calls the police, and Christopher comes under suspicion. He is arrested, then released with a police caution. He decides to investigate the dog's death. Throughout his adventures, Christopher records his experiences in a book. During his investigation, Christopher meets the elderly Mrs. Alexander, who informs Christopher that his mother had an affair with Mr. Shears.Ed discovers the book and confiscates it. While searching for the confiscated book, Christopher discovers letters from his mother dated after her supposed death. He is so shocked that he is unable to move. Ed realizes that Christopher has read the letters. He confesses that he had lied about Judy's death; he also admits that he had killed Wellington, after an argument with Mrs. Shears. Christopher decides to run away and live with his mother. ...عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «ماجرای عجیب سگی در شب»؛ «حادثه مرموز برای سگ در شب هنگام»؛ «حادثه ای عجیب برای سگی در شب»؛ نویسنده: مارک هادون؛ انتشاراتیها: (افق، هرمس، کاروان) ادبیات، داستان كريستوفر، نوجوان مبتلا به اوتيسم؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش: ماه ژانویه سال 2006میلادیعنوان: ماجرای عجیب سگی در شب؛ نویسنده: مارک هادون؛ مترجم: شیلا ساسانی نیا؛ تهران، افق، 1384، در 343ص، مصور، شابک9643692035؛ چاپ دوم 1385؛ چاپ چهارم 1388؛ شابک 9789643692032؛ چاپ هفتم 1392؛ موضوع: داستانهای نویسندگان بریتانیا سده 21معنوان: حادثه مرموز برای سگ در شب هنگام؛ نویسنده: مارک هادون؛ مترجم ترانه شیمی؛ تهران، هرمس، 1390، در 266 ص، شابک 9789643637545؛ عنوان: حادثه ای عجیب برای سگی در شب؛ نویسنده: مارک هادون؛ مترجم: گیتا گرکانی؛ تهران، کاروان، 1384، در 272ص، شابک 9648497222؛ چاپ دوم 1385؛نقل از متن: (سگه، نه میدوید، و نه خواب بود، مرده بود.)؛ پایان نقلنام داستان، برگرفته از یکی از داستان‌های «شرلوک هلمز» اثر «سر آرتور کانن دویل» است؛ رخدادهای داستان در «انگلستان» می‌گذرد، داستان شرح سفر پرماجرایی از «سوئیندون» به «لندن» است؛ داستان از زبان «کریستوفر بون» که پسری مبتلا به «اوتیسم» است، روایت و بیان می‌شود، و از همین روست که لحن ویژه و بیمانندی دارد؛ «کریستوفر» چون اوتیسم دارد، از درک رویدادهای عادی زندگی، ناتوان است، اما هوش بسیار ویژه ای دارد، و دنیا را دیگرگونه می‌بیند؛ ماجرا با کشته شدن سگی در همسایگی آن‌ها آغاز می‌شود، و «کریستوفر» کوشش دارد تا قاتل سگ را با روشهای ویژه ی خویش پیدا کندتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 25/06/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 23/05/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی",245,-0.9878,0.083,0.899,0.018,0.65,POSITIVE,0.9318
4,9401966,11/21/2007,1.0," The concept is interesting: narrating the novel through the POV of an autistic boy. The chapters are cleverly numbered by prime numbers, which ties in with the novel. It has interesting illustrations and diagrams to look at. However, I would not recommend this because it disappointed me and I couldn't, in good conscience, tell anyone to read a book I was disappointed in.I guess my disappointment lies in the fact that not only did my book club tout this as a mystery novel but also many of the literary reviews I read as well. What I was expecting was an exciting roller coaster ride mystery about an autistic boy trying to find the killer of his neighbor's dog and, as he slowly sleuths out the killer, finds himself embroiled in dangerous life threatening situations. Kind of like Tartt's The Little Friend told from an autistic POV.However, The Curious Incident... is not a mystery in any way, shape or form and because of this, the autistic POV begins to wear thin by the second half of the novel remaining sometimes fascinating yet sometimes tedious. Instead, you get a novel that starts off as a promising murder mystery. At the first half of the novel, the mystery is solved. Or rather we're unceremoniously told who is the murderer of the dog. From that point, the second half of the novel hugely focuses on Christopher attempting to travel to London by himself. A difficult task considering Christopher is autistic, hates crowds and can't stand to be touched by people. I won't tell who the murderer is or why Christopher takes off to London, as these are the only two real surprises of the novel. I will say overall this was a huge disappointment to me. I thought I was getting an exciting murder mystery and instead I got a highly readable family melodrama. Perhaps if this was not pushed as a murder mystery I would have enjoyed it much more. An interesting read but I wouldn't recommend it. ",244,-0.9575,0.19,0.641,0.169,0.5274242424242422,NEGATIVE,1.0

I enjoyed Christopher's musings about life and the way in which he sees it.4. I love making lists.Here's what I didn't like about this book:1. It wasn't really a mystery and I found some of it to be a bit predictable (I guessed who killed Wellington long before it was revealed).2. The first half is better than the second half.3.

6,23326297,05/30/2008,5.0,"OverviewFirst person tale of Christopher, a fifteen-year-old with Asperger's Syndrome or high-functioning autism, and a talent for maths, who writes a book (this one - sort of - very post modern) about his investigations of the murder of a neighbour's dog. He loves Sherlock Holmes and is amazingly observant of tiny details, but his lack of insight into other people's emotional lives hampers his investigation. Nevertheless, he has to overcome some of his deepest habits and fears, and he also uncovers some unexpected secrets. It is primarily a YA book, but there is more than enough to it to make it a worthwhile adult read as well. ASD or not?Neither autism nor Asperger's is mentioned by name in the book, but the back cover of my 2003 first edition has this quote from neurologist Oliver Sacks that does:""Mark Haddon shows great insight into the autistic mind."" Photo HERE.Prime Chapters and Structural QuirksThe structure of the book (chapter numbers are all primes; inclusion of maths puzzles and diagrams) and narrative style (attention to detail, excessive logic, avoidance of metaphor) reflect Christopher's mindset and way of viewing life. It is peppered with snippets of maths and explanations of his condition: how it affects him, and what coping strategies he adopts. The effect is plausibly stilted and occasionally breathless, which is reminiscent of people I know who are on the autistic spectrum and tallies with my limited reading about the condition. Honest but Unreliable Narrator?Christopher's condition makes him very literal - something he is aware of. He can analyse a joke, but still not ""get"" it. Truth is paramount, so he hates situations where he can't tell the truth (e.g. for politeness) and indeed the fact that ""everything you tell is a white lie"" because you can never give a fully comprehensive answer to anything. He also hates metaphors (even ""the word metaphor is a metaphor"", meaning ""carrying something from one place to another""), but he doesn't mind similes because they are not untrue. Christopher's feelings about metaphors are highly pertinent to a very different book, China Mieville's wonderful Embassytown (see my review HERE), which is about how minds shape language and how language shapes minds, and focuses on the relationship between similes, truth and lies.Many novels are about uncovering what is true, but Christopher's quest takes the idea to a deeper level, and even though we know this narrator is almost pathologically truthful, his condition means his observations sometimes miss the real truth of a situation.There is plenty of humour, and it usually arises from Christopher's naive misunderstandings of situations and the conflict between his lack of embarrassment and desire to be unnoticed by unfamiliar people.Logic and TruthChristopher loves maths because it is safe, straightforward and has a definite answer, unlike life. He's also good at explaining some aspects, ending an explanation of calculating primes with ""Prime numbers are what is left when you have taken all the patterns away"". His apparent deviations from logic are justified with ingenious logic. For example, having favourite and hated colours reduces choice and thus stress, counteracting the effect of his inability to filter or prioritise: he notices (and remembers) every detail of everything, and can rewind it at will, whereas other people's brains are filled with imaginary stuff. He is a little like his hero Sherlock Holmes, who is quoted saying ""The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance observes"". Similarly, defining a good or bad day on the basis of how many red or yellow cars is no more illogical than an office-bound person's mood being dictated by the weather.All of this means animals are a better bet than humans: ""I like dogs. You always know what a dog is thinking - it has four moods. Happy, sad, cross and concentrating. Also, dogs are faithful and they do not tell lies because they cannot talk"". People are more of a mystery: when having a conversation, people look at him to understand what he's thinking, but Christopher can't do likewise. For him ""it's like being in a room with a one-way mirror in a spy film"". Love is even more unfathomable: ""Loving someone is helping them when they get into trouble, and looking after them, and telling them the truth, and Father [does lots of things for me]... which means that he loves me"".ComparisonsI reread this during a rather stressful journey, including the passages when Christopher is making a stressful journey. It helped me empathise with him - to the extent that it exacerbated my own stress! It's worth comparing this with:* Iris Murdoch's The Word Child, whose main character has tacit Asperger's tendencies. See my review HERE.* Yōko Ogawa's The Housekeeper and the Professor, which is also about finding number patterns in everyday life, and involves a protagonist whose brain does not work like other people's.

7,3630086464,04/24/2021,5.0,"If you loved The Good Sister, this book is for you! The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is a UK story about a 15 year-old boy named Christopher Boone. Christopher is a brilliant person who is extremely analytical and starts to investigate the death of his neighbor's dog, a poodle named Wellington. Who killed Wellington and why? Christopher will be pushed well beyond his comfort zone while unabashedly telling the truth and going on an impossible journey. How comfortable are we to change and adventure?This book was delightfully funny as Christopher tries to solve the murder of Wellington. Christopher uses his skills of analysis to matter-of-factly investigate this horrible crime, and he vividly describes how he goes about the world, the level of detail that he observes. It was a wonderful reminder to take time to look around at the world around us. He also spoke about Stranger Danger and how uncomfortable he is when speaking to other people. For many people, conversations do not flow naturally and being bombarded by chaos and overwhelmed by stimulus is quite challenging.The characters in this book were well developed - these are my favorite types of characters because they are imperfect but try their best especially for Christopher. This book truly is British, not an American author pretending to be British. How can I tell? Well, in my last job, my entire team was based out of London so not a day would go by that I wasn't on the phone with someone from the UK. Also, I have actually been to London so I would consider myself to be a bit more than average on UK terminology. One of the things that I found simply delightful with this book was the British approach. This is very difficult to put into words, but I shall do my best. The British usually respond less hysterical and with less overaction than Americans. For example, when I was in London, there was a protestor who had glued himself to the street. The police were freeing him and taking him down to the station. A large group of people (myself included) gathered around to watch. The protestor was sitting quite calmly while the police gently put goggles over his eyes and started the process. When they freed him, the protestor calmly accepted his fate and allowed the police to do their job. A man next to me explained in a matter of fact tone that they usually just take you down to the station for half a day and release you. He had a rather good plate of eggs when he was last detained by the police.In America, the police would be making the onlookers disband, and the protestors aren't really that committed to actually glue themselves to anything. If someone does encounter the police, usually they are thrashing about and making the whole process as difficult as possible. As an American reading this book, I found it so interesting how the various people interacted with Christopher because I can assure you that Americans would have reacted so very differently, and I found it rather refreshing that the adults weren't hyper-protective and allowed Christopher to fully experience his journey (to some degree). There really should be a slightly Americanized version of this book though because although I do know that The Underground is called The Tube and boot is actually the trunk of a car, there were a few times when I was a bit confused. For example, Christopher was talking about how he didn't like metaphors. One of them was ""I've had a pig of a day."" This phrase is not used in the The States so Christopher wasn't the only one confused.Overall, I thought that this was a delightful read. One of my family members (a bit younger than Christopher) has a genius IQ. He is extremely talented in math and can easily build almost anything. Bring something home from IKEA, blink, and he can put it together. But he can't spell to save his life. This book was a refreshing reminder that not every person fits the traditional mold and not to judge a person based on one skillset.

10,1365229375,08/16/2015,2.0,"Update: my review may not be interesting, but this one definitely is, so please read it if you read the book or plan to read the book. The author created a negative stereotype of Asperger's and autism and offended the Asperger's community. He's not an expert, has no experience with these disorders and did no research (Mark Haddon's blog). I think this is really important to know when you read the book.I'm not enthusiastic about this book. I kept asking myself this question : does this book really do justice to autistic children ? I had my doubts. No doubt the thought-processes of Christopher were sometimes accurate, but I think it was overdone most of the time. What also bothered me was the improbability that an autistic kid, who was only allowed to go to the shop at the end of the road on his own, and who has rage and panic seizures regularly, would have a Swiss Army Knife in his pocket all the time. No way!A long time ago, I read a memoir written by a girl who has autism, and I really loved it. It was not a light read, and it left me emotionally drained, as if her life-story was about my own child. In comparison with that book, The Curious Incident was rather a light read that didn't get me emotionally involved. I would recommend this other book to everyone but the problem is I don't remember it's title or it's author. I've done a search and maybe it was this book, but I'm not sure: Nobody Nowhere: The Extraordinary Autobiography of an AutisticWhile reading the reviews for that book, I stumbled on this review : ""I read this book when my own smart autistic son was very young, and was overwhelmed by it -- by the writing, by her memories, by her perspective on herself, and by her journey. It is a story of a brilliant woman trapped inside the odd shell autism creates, suffering inside it alone (and at the hands of her mother) and then beating her way out of it and learning, through trial and error, how to be herself. I don't have it -- I must have given it away -- or I would consult it to be more specific. But I have always kept it in mind as my son and I grow together, trying to figure out which extraordinary parts of him he needs relief from, and which are essential to who he is. All parents of children with autism want to hear the true voice of their kids who are locked inside their autism, and hearing Donna Williams' voice confirms that there are unimaginable riches of character and intelligence and sensitivity, even in the most apparently disconnected. This book is the reason I HATED The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime"".

13,3343838782,05/21/2020,5.0,"5 starsThis is the touching, raw, heart-string pulling, and sometimes frustrating story of Christopher Boone. He is the protagonist and narrator of the story while suffering from emotional and developmental disorders with some savant capabilities. The interesting thing is the whole time he tells his story, while his behavior is odd and different from others, he never seems to acknowledge the fact that he knows he is different. During his interactions with other characters he feels he is being logical and reasonable while those he is talking to are ripping their hair out in frustration. It makes for some very interesting and entertaining situations.A character and story that this could possibly be compared to is Forrest Gump. Lots of little anecdotes mixed in with a main storyline by a narrator who really does not understand the impact of his involvement or why things are the way they are. Curious, but simple. The only major difference is that Forrest stayed fairly pleasant throughout the story while Christopher gets very violent when he gets uncomfortable.I read this towards the end of a reading slump. I think this might be the perfect book to help get someone out of a reading slump. It is not very long, the story is not complex, and the content is very intriguing. I burned right through this because I could not wait to see what happened next while Christopher unraveled the mystery. I feel I could recommend this to almost anyone.Disclaimer: Have you not read The Hound of the Baskervilles, but you want to? DO NOT READ THIS BOOK FIRST! Christopher ruins the book!

15,1504701883,01/10/2016,5.0,"Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. What a wonderful experience to read this book. To be taken into the mind of a teenage boy with high-functioning autism is quite extraordinary. To understand how he thinks compared to those of us not autistic is mind opening and thought provoking. This wonderful mystery is told by Christopher who sets out to solve the murder of Wellington, the neighbor's dog. This is no minor feat. Christopher has a difficult time socializing as he can't pick up on nuances or cues like other people. He doesn't like to be touched which can sometimes get him into trouble. He says what he thinks without having the skill set to understand how others will react which gets him into difficult situations. Told with humor, we get to see how the mind of someone on the spectrum is wired differently than the rest of us. Told using many mathematical references, we also see the intellectual genius of Christopher which is quite common among those with Asperger's. From a personal perspective, my 23 year old son with Asperger's often says to me, ""Mom my brain doesn't think like yours"". The book shows us this in the interactions he has with his parents and others around him frequently. A fast and enjoyable book for everyone.

17,170037783,05/21/2011,5.0,"I haven’t read a fictional account this heartbreakingly realistic in a long time. Kapitoil was close, but The Curious Incident paints a more complete picture. The book is from the viewpoint of an teen boy with Asperger's syndrome named Christopher - his mom has recently died and he discovers a dead dog in one of his neighbor’s yards. The short list: he doesn’t read people’s emotions very well (like the android “Data” from Star Trek next Generation, if you will), he hates the colors yellow and brown, excels at math, hates to be touched (enter the fist: he breaks out a pretty nasty uppercut when it happens) and often loses his memory when he gets upset. Like many teenage boys, he dreams of long periods of alone time.Since he doesn’t care much about other people’s emotions, he goes around knocking on doors in his neighborhood to ask who killed the dog. So he has your attention right away. He’s a big fan of Sherlock Holmes, who he perceives as the master of objective details that others overlook. Except that no one wants to tell him anything about the dog except the kindly, lonely old Mrs. Alexander, who finally breaks it to the boy that his mom was cheating on his dad. Then a lot more rains down. The dad comes across as calm, especially to a young kid, yet is passive-aggressive person who doesn’t always realize how much clarity his son needs. When he tells Christopher to “drop all this investigation nonsense”, the son considers what he finds out from Mrs. Alexander as “small talk” and not what his dad forbade - “snooping around” the neighborhood asking about a dead mutt. In fact, the father’s passive-aggressiveness and the son’s determination and objectivity make for heartbreaking tension. The crux of the story isn’t about the dog, it’s what the dad keeps from Christopher “until he gets old enough to understand”. Even though he’s autistic, we find out that Christopher is old enough to know anything - and will go way out of his way to find the truth. This is a book that doesn’t end neatly and nicely because life usually doesn’t turn out that way. It just sort of ends. We learn a lot about autism, it’s very defined characteristics and why it’s so difficult for ‘normal’ people to be around. There is no one in the story who treats Christopher the way he wants to be treated except a counselor at school. This is a good story in which we learn a lot about this condition. If the story needs to stall because the narrator is stuck on telling all the facts of a particular situation, then that’s what happens. You don’t necessarily comprehend why everything is written the way it’s written, but it somehow all feels important by the end. I raced through everything regardless. And the boy’s objectivity lends a prophetic feel to some of the things he says. He wonders why people think they’re superior to animals, for example. His thinking is that in a couple of centuries the human race might evolve to where the human beings of today end up on display in a zoo. And if we all kill each other through war or wearing out the planet, then insects could end up being the most superior creatures on earth. He has interesting theories on the constellations, the Big Bang theory, major religions, etc. Sure, a general comparison could be made to the movie “Rainman”, except that this book gives complete attention to the afflicted character, Christopher. It breaks down one of society’s more recent creations - the mental institution, one of the big barriers between “us” and “them”. You discover there’s a ton of humanity and things to consider and learn from someone you may have previously been too nervous to be around.

18,47269924,02/23/2009,5.0,"Re-read for my Fall 2017 YAL class.One of the best YA books ever, wonderful and surprising on so many levels. Very moving. As a parent of a kid with autism and another kid who is spectrum-y, it hits home for me in ways it might not for others. As with many mysteries, it features some misdirection; it appears to be about a kid with Asperger's Syndrome investigating a mystery about a dead dog in the manner of his hero (and also Aspergerish) Sherlock Holmes, but becomes an even richer and ever widening investigation of human tragedy and mystery and the complex nature of love and grief. I find it very moving, having read it several times. My feeling this time? That almost half of the book is about the London trip when Christopher goes to see his estranged mother, and maybe that's a little too long; it makes the story into a kind of movie thriller of sorts, when the heart of the book for me is about mysteries, a dog murdered and just what that means for Christopher and his family, relationships, love, the grief and despair of dealing with a kid with special needs, that heartbreak, all stuff I have been through. I was divorced in the process of trying to deal with the anguish and despair and grief of discovering my son had autism, at the same time trying to do everything we could to try to reverse the process. So I could empathize with the parents.One thing that is different in recent readings is that I have watched and rewatched the BBC Sherlock and the American Elementary and I have this as background for a very Sherlock-focused book (it's Christopher's favorite set of stories). I also have been reading Agatha Christie Poirot mysteries, so I have that related background. And, one course I have been teaching focuses on the relationships between psychiatry, the psychic/supernatural, horror/fantasy, spirituality, the literar vs the rational and logical, and some of that figures very much in this book. I had forgotten Christopher talks of faith and ghosts in this book with respect to logic and Reason. There's a consideration of metaphor and story for the purpose of making meaning, since this first person story is told by Christopher for a school project, a story of ever widening mysteries of life. I admit to tears in several places, earned tears from Haddon.",96,-0.8462,0.115,0.782,0.103,0.3956493506493507,POSITIVE,1.0

I know a lot of people who liked this book very much, but on the other hand, I also know a few people who would not hesitate to burn this book. I'm on the positive side. I really enjoyed this short novel.I've said this numerous times in my other reviews that I like character driven novels. This book obviously focused on Christopher's development more than the plot's. The author succeeded, because I've gotten attached to the little kiddo. I have a soft spot for people, more on children, with disabilities. I can't stomach to be annoyed at them because it's not something they can control. While I don't know anyone personally with autism, the author managed to give justice to the sickness. It's not the best book on autism, but it's a short preview of it. I honestly don't like reading huge novels during the school year. I'd rather read those gigantic books during my breaks because I tend to enjoy them better when read at my own pace. Reading is not a task for me, but it's something that I consider to be leisure. Stress from the university is not something I could control, so reading shorter novels help me unwind at times. It's actually my exam week next week but I managed to squeeze this book in my hectic schedule. I didn't feel like rushing because it was so short to begin with. Aside from being short, it was also really entertaining.Like I said, it's not a novel that everyone's going to love, but I'd recommend taking the risk and find out for yourself.

26,901874785,09/26/2018,3.0,"I started reading this book with the expectation that it is a mystery novel featuring an autistic sleuth - something like a young Mr. Monk, an American TV shows featuring a detective with extreme OCD and phobias.But to my surprise I found that this book is much more than a mystery novel! A murder has been committed – a dog has been killed with a garden fork – a dog that the narrator Christopher Boone liked. Now, let me introduce you to Christopher. He is a fifteen year old boy who suffers from autism – the blurb specifies it to be Asperger’s Syndrome. Like most autistic people, Christopher has no understanding of social behavior; hates being touched (even by his parents); and has other eccentricities. But, he is pretty good when it comes to subjects like Maths. He has even got some strong views on the subject of religion and dismisses  “stupid things” like superstitions. He lives with his father in a small town in the UK.Anyway, Christopher, who is a fan of Sherlock Holmes decides to turn detective. He would have to come out of his comfort zone in order to carry out his investigations, and even tries to find loop holes in his father’s strict orders to stop his sleuthing.Christopher’s investigation would eventually reveal some astonishing secrets about his family and to borrow the clichéd expression -  his whole world would turn upside down  and Christopher would do the unexpected.Another thing which I liked about the book – •	the references to a couple of mathematical problems especially The Monty Hall Problem•	the problem around the properties of right angled triangle 	- these reminded of me of my school days when I did love certain branches of Maths like algebra and geometryI also liked that The Hound of Baskervilles is Christopher’s favourite book (it is my favourite novel in the Sherlockian world too) but  A WORD OF CAUTION!!! the author has revealed the entire story in the book. I accept that he did a good job of summarizing the novel that in about 2-3 pages, but this is strict no-no for me.The author has done a pretty good job in describing Christopher and his reactions to the world around. The complex rules of societal interactions and the complicated human psyche are enough to overwhelm the autistic mind. Life is not easy for such people. In my humble opinion, life is even more difficult for the people, especially the parents, who have to take care of such people.Oliver Sacks, the author of my favourite – The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat and Other Clinical Tales, opines about this novel -  “A delightful and brilliant book. Mark Haddon shows great insight into the autistic mind... I found it all very moving, very plausible and very funny” I found the book to be moving and poignant, but not funny! I felt especially bad for Christopher’s parents and what they had to go through. Then why the 3 stars!!  The beginning and the end were excellent, but towards the end, I felt the story lost its attraction.I would still recommend the novel to readers who would like to read about Christopher’s journey.

27,1057658241,11/19/2018,4.0,"EXCERPT: ...as I was crossing the street I had a stroke of inspiration about who might have killed Wellington. I was imagining a Chain of Reason inside my head which was like this 1. Why would you kill a dog? a) because you hated the dog.  b) because you were mad.  c) because you wanted to make Mrs Shears upset. 2. I didn't know anyone who hated Wellington, so if it was a) it was probably a stranger. 3. I didn't know any mad people, so if it was b), it was probably also a stranger. 4. Most murders are committed by someone known to the victim. In fact, you are most likely to be murdered by a member of your own family on Christmas Day. This is a fact. Wellington was therefore most likely to have been killed by someone known to him. 5. If it was c), I only knew one person who didn't like Mrs Shears, and that was Mr Shears who knew Wellington very well indeed. ABOUT THIS BOOK: Christopher John Francis Boone knows all the countries of the world and their capitals and every prime number up to 7,057. He relates well to animals but has no understanding of human emotions. He cannot stand to be touched. And he detests the color yellow.Although gifted with a superbly logical brain, for fifteen-year-old Christopher everyday interactions and admonishments have little meaning. He lives on patterns, rules, and a diagram kept in his pocket. Then one day, a neighbor's dog, Wellington, is killed and his carefully constructive universe is threatened. Christopher sets out to solve the murder in the style of his favourite (logical) detective, Sherlock Holmes. What follows makes for a novel that is funny, poignant and fascinating in its portrayal of a person whose curse and blessing are a mind that perceives the world entirely literally. MY THOUGHTS: I have been wanting to read this book for some years, ever since it was a Goodreads group read one month, and I couldn't lay my hands on a copy. Last year I found a copy in a bookshop and brought it for my grandson as part of his Christmas parcel. He read it for an English assignment this year, then his mother read it and, finally, I then got to read it. I found it fascinating to see into the mind of someone with Aspergers Syndrome. I have read other books with characters similarly affected, but for some reason it is Christopher that will remain with me. I have found myself looking at numbers differently, and I now have a fascination with prime numbers. This from a person who flunked high school mathematics quite spectacularly! I still, however, have to admit to not understanding the maths problems Conways Soldiers or the Monty Hall Problem. And I have no idea, still, what the relationship is between 7 and 865. So while this book has left me in the dark mathematically speaking, I enjoyed it. And I learned a lot. I know it was written some time ago, but I really would like to know how Christopher gets on at University. 😍😍😍😍.5THE AUTHOR: Mark Haddon is a British novelist and poet, best known for his 2003 novel The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time. He was educated at Uppingham School and Merton College, Oxford, where he studied English.In 2003, Haddon won the Whitbread Book of the Year Award and in 2004, the Commonwealth Writers' Prize Overall Best First Book for his novel The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time, a book which is written from the perspective of a boy with Aspergers syndrome. Haddon's knowledge of Aspergers syndrome, a type of autism, comes from his work with autistic people as a young man. In an interview at Powells.com, Haddon claimed that this was the first book that he wrote intentionally for an adult audience; he was surprised when his publisher suggested marketing it to both adult and child audiences. His second adult-novel, A Spot of Bother, was published in September 2006.Mark Haddon is also known for his series of Agent Z books, one of which, Agent Z and the Penguin from Mars, was made into a 1996 Children's BBC sitcom. He also wrote the screenplay for the BBC television adaptation of Raymond Briggs's story Fungus the Bogeyman, screened on BBC1 in 2004. He also wrote the 2007 BBC television drama Coming Down the Mountain.Haddon is a vegetarian, and enjoys vegetarian cookery. He describes himself as a 'hard-line atheist'. In an interview with The Observer, Haddon said ""I am atheist in a very religious mould"". His atheism might be inferred from The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time in which the main character declares that those who believe in God are stupid.Mark Haddon lives in Oxford with his wife Dr. Sos Eltis, a Fellow of Brasenose College, Oxford, and their two young sons.

Yes, he's meant to be autistic, but Haddon didn't bother researching autism at all so that point is moot. I can't describe how much I wanted this little shit to be ran over by a train when he went to fetch his pet rat (which had made an entirely understandable decision and ran away from Chrissy), but alas, he wasn't and he went on to ruin someone else life. I can deal with a character that is evil (in the sense that they hurt others), but they have to have some charm or they just come out as one dimensional douchebags. There was nothing interesting about Chrissy boy, he just commented about how good he was at maths, how much he hated people (even when those people were trying to help him), and how hard his life is even when he is being mollycoddled. Make no mistake, I have nothing against autistic people, but I'm pretty sure the vast majority of autistic people don't think they're God's gift and that everyone else deserves to die; my (admittedly limited) understanding of autism suggests that people suffering from autism have trouble expressing emotion, rather than being devoid of it. Haddon's lack of research seemed to show mainly in the fact that, even though the book is meant to be from the viewpoint of an autistic child, the understanding of autism seemed to be very superficial, as if Haddon had looked at child with autism and said ""yep, what they say and act like must be exactly how they think... Better write a book about it.""Understandably, as I wasn't overly fussed on Chrissy boy, I did not enjoy the writing style at all. It was a recount of events in the most obnoxious way, appearing not to have taken any literary skill at all. It is very reminiscent of how I (and most others) used to write when I (or they) was five, you know, saying ""and this and then and now and when and and and and"" - I was sat there thinking ""say 'and' again, I dare you, I double dare you!"", and if I had been Jules (I think he was the one played by Mr. jackson), I'd have shot Chrissy boy around seven hundred times, because it seems the only word the author could think to write was 'and'.If this had been fully a murder mystery, then I may have given this book a two stars (providing it was done well) because a good puzzle can make up for unlikable characters and shoddy writing. But no, the culprit was 'found' (he gave himself in without any tension leading up to the moment) and then the book turns into a family drama. A family drama about a horrible and boring family. Great. This book lied to me, it should have been called ""The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime and the Less Curious Incident of a Dysfunctional Family"".Another thing that really bugged me was the random God-bashing thing. I'm not a Christian (or religious at all), but it was not needed in the slightest, it was as if Haddon thought he may as well get Dawkins on all our asses. It felt really preachy and forced and it didn't fit in the context of that part of the story, it was just stupid.The final point I'll make is that this book gives people a false view of autism, and many people who did not know much about the condition before may now think this unresearched drivel is correct.

It is difficult for him to move through his world. It is difficult for those who love him to parent him. Heck, it's difficult for the police to assist him, when that assistance is necessary to his well-being.

The factory is a bakery and he operates the slicing machines. And sometimes a slicer is not working fast enough but the bread keeps coming and there is a blockage. I sometimes think of my mind as a machine, but not always as a bread-slicing machine. It makes it easier to explain to other people what is going on inside it.”I read this when it first came out because I saw it in the library and probably noticed the award nominations – there were a lot! But I knew nothing about the story, and when I read it, I could see the similarities with some of the kids I’d volunteered with in schools. There is no mention of autism or Asperger’s or any sort of disorder. But we do discover later that he attends a special school and there is a woman who coaches him in life skills. Christopher tells his own story, how he finds a dog murdered in the yard across the street and how he plans to solve the mystery. He picks the dog up (he likes dogs) and as he does, the owner comes out of the house. He looks like he’s holding the smoking gun! The police are called and take him to jail, which he doesn’t mind at all. He’s watched lots of TV mysteries and he likes small, simple places, so even though he doesn’t like strange places and new experiences, this is almost familiar. Dad finally shows up.“I stepped outside. Father was standing m the corridor. He held up his right hand and spread his fingers out in a fan. I held up mv left hand and spread my fingers out in a fan and we made our fingers and thumbs touch each other. We do this because sometimes Father wants to give me a hug. but I do not like hugging people so we do this instead, and it means that he loves me.”Now we really start to see how Christopher directs all of the action around himself. The police had trouble with him, but it’s obvious that Father has worked out how to keep his boy calm . . . well, at least most of the time. Then the policeman lets Christopher out and takes him and Father to an interview room, where Christopher gives us a blow-by-blow account.“He was an inspector. I could tell because he wasn’t wearing a uniform. He also had a very hairy nose. It looked as if there were two very small mice hiding in his nostrils.He said, ‘I have spoken to your father and he says that you didn’t mean to hit the policeman.’I didn’t say anything because this wasn’t a question. He said, ‘Did you mean to hit the policeman?’I said, ‘Yes.’He squeezed his face and said, ‘But you didn’t mean to hurt the policeman?’ I thought about this and said, ‘No. I didn’t mean to hurt the policeman. I just wanted him to stop touching me.’Then he said, ‘You know that it is wrong to hit a policeman, don’t you?I said, ‘I do.’He was quiet for a few seconds, then he asked, ‘Did you kill the dog, Christopher?’I said, ‘I didn’t kill the dog.’He said, ‘Do you know that it is wrong to lie to a policeman and that you can get into a very great deal of trouble if you do?’I said, ‘Yes.’He said, ‘So, do you know who killed the dog?’ I said, ‘No.’He said, ‘Are you telling the truth?’I said, ‘Yes. I always tell the truth.’And he said, ‘Right. I am going to give you a caution.’ I asked, ‘Is that going to be on a piece of paper like a certificate I can keep?’He replied, ‘No, a caution means that we are going to keep a record of what you did, that you hit a policeman but that it was an accident and that you didn’t mean to hurt the policeman.’I said, ‘But it wasn’t an accident.’And Father said, ‘Christopher, please.’ The policeman closed his mouth and breathed out loudly through his nose and said, ‘If you get into any more trouble we will take out this record and see that you have been given a caution and we will take things much more seriously. Do you understand what I’m saying?’I said that I understood.”The word that kept coming to mind for me was ‘exasperating’. He would be so hard to live with, but his father tries his best, occasionally blowing his top but not nearly as often as I bet most of us would. He's the kid who will keep saying “but you PROMISED!” and we will have to admit we follishly did.We must keep bearing in mind that this is all told from Christopher’s point of view. He’s not a child. His age is “15 years and 3 months and 3 days”, but his unfiltered language, fixation on games or timetables, and tantrums are the sort of behaviours we expect more from toddlers. He is not going to change, but in his 15 years, he has learned a lot about what is expected of him, and I enjoyed watching him use his wits and his brains to figure things out that are outside his experience. And I loved seeing him challenge himself when he was dreadfully uncomfortable. Not a spoiler, just a personal digression:(view spoiler)[[I remember my parents saying “Patty doesn’t lie” and “children are so literal”. I was the eldest, and mostly I didn’t lie and I did question all those ridiculous things grown-ups say to kids that aren’t meant literally. I liked words and I expected them to mean what I was told they meant. But I always loved puns and jokes and plays on words, sarcasm, irony and all of those things that are so difficult for some people with autism. And I grew up telling the same lies everybody does, but I suspect the autism and the Aspies in my family have made me sympathetic to Christopher, although nobody is as challenging as he is.] (hide spoiler)]Christopher is not going to grow out of it. His basic personality and character are pretty well-formed. He’s a whiz at mathematics and distracts himself from worry by imagining complicated problems. He’s hiding and scared, so he retreats into his mind.“And I did some more quadratic equations like and I made some of the coefficients large so that they were hard to solve.”Another short personal digression:(view spoiler)[[The best I can do is put myself to sleep by counting by 3s or 7s or something, and that’s about it. But I don’t think I’m quite as exasperating as Christopher is either. 😊] (hide spoiler)]I enjoyed this even more this time around, and I recommend it to everyone, not just adults. I think it’s a good YA read. It’s a good story, beginning with the dog mystery and ending with a surprising turn of events.

I just finished “a thumping good read” …and checked the year it was written thinking it was probably 2016 or something like that…2003!!! I guess it was a heavy rock. ☹Mark Haddon prior to this book worked with autistic individuals. The protagonist, Christopher, is an autistic young man. I have a suspicion a number of reviewers will comment on the book and whether he was accurate or not in depicting Christopher. I think he was…and I know there are many different strata of autism. However, I have a lot of respect for Oliver Sacks, the brilliant neurologist who wrote a number of very good books (The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat)…and he had this to say: A brilliant autism novel has been overdue-and this is it! The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is delightful. Mark Haddon shows great insight into the autistic mind, and he brings his young narrator protagonist quite wonderfully to life. I found it very moving, very plausible-and very funny.” (very italicized for emphasis). In my reviews I try to avoid spoilers so I will just say a couple of things (well now that I look back at my review I guess it is several!). I thought the use of using prime numbers for chapter numbers was extremely clever (I started out with Chapter 2 and thought the bookseller had torn out a page!) The drawings were extremely clever.The use of Sherlock Holmes and his powers of deduction/investigatory work was a nice touch. In terms of what happened to the dog in the night – I did not see that coming but when things were explained it made perfect sense. I was captivated by Christopher’s logic/outlook on life – I learned a lot from him.Christopher sometimes did not have an easy time of things – a number of things disturbed him. And I felt for him. I also empathized with his mom and dad. I thought the plot line was superb. It revealed the thought processes of Christopher when he was scared, confused, and happy. I thought this blurb in the inner cover of the dustjacket put it really well: “And herein lies the key to the brilliance of Mark Haddon’s choice of narrator: The most wrenching of emotional moments are chronicled by a boy who cannot fathom emotion. The effect is dazzling, making for a novel that is deeply funny, poignant, and fascinating in its portrayal of a person whose curse and blessing are a mind that perceives the world literally.”Then there’s this quote by Christopher: “I think people believe in heaven because they don’t like the idea of dying, because they want to carry on living and they don’t like the idea that other people will move into their house and put their things in the rubbish.”His explanation of how we read when we scan a book (are yes moving rapidly back and forth and how do we process the stimuli (pp. 116-118) – very provocative at least to me.Christopher makes use of the LONDON AZ Street Atlas and Index, Geographers’ A-Z Map Company. This is a later edition of a street atlas/map compendium that Phyllis Pearsall first created by walking the streets of London circa 1936 and is the subject of a fascinating read, Mrs. P’s Journey by Sarah Hartley (Simon and Schuster, 2001).

Recently I saw a news article where it was listed as one of the best novels so far in this 21st century. This was poignant, original, empathetic, funny and alarming. Christopher is a high functioning autistic boy. All children exhibiting the characteristics of the autistic syndrome are different, but Christopher has many of the traits. He needs to see patterns and requires a sense of order. He has a genius for numbers. He has difficulty understanding the emotions of others.  The book begins with Christopher discovering that a neighbour's dog has been killed. He fancies himself to be like Sherlock Holmes. He will discover who killed the dog and write a book about it. To investigate, he must question neighbours. This requires he must overcome his dread in talking to strangers and venture around the area by himself, knocking on doors. Christopher displays an advanced vocabulary, scientific knowledge, and love of math and puzzles in his journal, but with many digressions from the main topic. Because his rambling thought processes jump from one subject to another, patience is required when reading his journal, and also from his family and teachers when dealing with him. Christopher lives with his loving father who sometimes becomes exasperated with the boy's tantrums, wilfulness and compulsions. He broke the sad news to Christopher several years ago that his mother had died. Halfway through the book, the young detective discovers the identity of dog's killer and a shocking family secret.

People, as a general rule, don't like to watch dogs die. Not the family pet or the stray or the bomb-sniffer or the police canine. Even the dogs one gets the sense need putting down, say Old Yeller or Cujo, come with an adverse emotional risk. And it's a risk you can easily perceive. (Just ask Michael Vick.) Rare is the heart that wants anything at all to do with this. Rarer still, the author who can handle the matter in a manner that delivers sufficient regard to the valiant spirit of Man's best friend. Few folks end up watching the best of those movies twice, or re-reading those particular books. Been there, done that, let's move on.Mark Haddon opens his novel with the killing of a dog. He is, however, merciful about it. This dog is, from the very first sentence, already dead. It's one of those giant poodles, and it's stretched out on a neighbor's lawn with a big ol' garden fork sticking out of it. And because the boy who's telling the tale is an autistic fifteen-year-old, there's going to be a very pragmatic approach taken to all of this - which means we won't be cattle-prodded through the kind of emotional hoops other writers force into play just because they can. Christopher's mind is afflicted with a distinct disconnection between logic and feeling. His logic will be relaying the story. His feelings will come in through the back door - as did, for example, the throwaway fact that he was rocking the dead dog in his arms when the police arrived.Christopher decides to investigate the death of Wellington. As this investigation proceeds, we will learn not only about Christopher's family, his school, his everyday life, but also what it's like to be in Christopher's head. And that's where Haddon's gift shines. His is a tremendous achievement in voice, in the restriction of a compartmentalized awareness, and the impact of our culture on those it simply wasn't designed for. There is not a single false note to be found. It is also a page-turner. Had the clock not hit 3 AM, I'd have finished this in one sitting.

This is another reason why I don’t like proper novels…” pg. 19“I said that I wasn’t clever. I was just noticing how things were, and that wasn’t clever. That was just being observant. Being clever was when you looked at how things were and used the evidence to work out something new. Like the universe expanding, or who committed a murder. Or if you see someone’s name and you give each letter a value from 1 to 26 (a = 1, b =2, etc.) and you add the numbers up in your head and you find that it makes a prime number, like Jesus Christ (151), or Scooby-Doo (113), or Sherlock Holmes (163), or Doctor Watson (167).

A mostly light-hearted novel told from the perspective of Christopher Boone, a teenage boy with autism.

He’s afraid of talking to strangers, being put in unknown situations, being touched and lacks the proper intuition about others that many “normal people” take for granted. He loves timetables, dogs, rats, prime numbers and Sherlock Holmes and he hates metaphors (not similes!), noisy places and yellow and brown colours.Mark Haddon has done a fabulous job.

There are also lots of laughs out loud moments, including times where you probably shouldn’t laugh, but the way they are told by Christopher will have you laughing anyway.

Considering the rate at which I devour books, it is a shame that I didn't take those recommendations to heart until recently. The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is unlike most books that you'll find at your local shop on the subject of autism. Our story follows the exceptionally unique narrator Christopher Boone as he tries to unravel the mystery of who killed a dog on his street. While the concept sounds like a children's mystery novel, the entire concept is elevated by Christopher's narration which provides a distinctive view into the mind of an individual with autism. The chapters are not presented in sequential numbers, rather they are presented as ascending prime numbers (Christopher quite enjoys math). Occasionally, Christopher's sparse descriptive passages are supplemented by small drawings, graphs and figures. Christopher struggles with the overwhelming societal rules that everyone else seems to be following with ease. Quirks like this appear throughout the book and help establish Christopher as one of the most stylistically impressive narrators in recent memory.  Despite Christopher's protestations early in the novel that he is unable to tell a joke, the novel is filled with laughs. Despite the levity of some of the situations in which our hero finds himself, the obsessions and patterns to which Christopher is bound reflect genuine autistic traits. Though Christopher processes emotion differently from most people, the novel is also full of heart and heartbreaking moments. Most of the emotional gravitas is provided by the supporting cast as their personal struggles are brought to the forefront via the narrator's matter-of-fact writing. Indeed, while Christopher's narration provides heartfelt insight into the mind of an autistic teenager, the stories of his parents tell of the difficulties of raising an autistic child. This book also reads like a thriller: it is short, compelling, mysterious, and the pages flew by once I got a hang of the unique style.

A fair warning, though: the main character, Christopher, really likes Sherlock Holmes and at one point in the story talks about The Hound of the Baskervilles. He reveals every single plot point of the story, so if you haven't read it and don't want the ending ruined for you, read The Hound of the Baskervilles first, then read Mark Haddon's book.

59,164149717,04/28/2011,4.0,"I'm reading many types of novels, but I find myself being most absorbed by stories where people need to overcome obstacles within themselves in order to resolve or come to terms with the obstacles surrounding their physical life. This one is exactly that. The book is an amazing tale about a high functioning autistic savant whose parents are behaving foolishly. Christopher, the autistic, is the narrator and his problems with living are astronomically complicated, but his parents are also suffering through difficulties which while not on the same scale as their son are also complicated. All three have to struggle with their own natures to actually solve anything, but in the consequent learning to quell their inner voices for better functioning it does not mean they get what they wanted. It's an unfair compromise with Reality, and Reality imposes the final terms and boundaries of their hopes. Even though Christopher is the one diagnosed as 'special needs' it's obvious his parents are struggling with the special needs that come from living with a kid far different from ordinary children. Christopher is high maintenance and there do not seem to be any rewards in parenting such a child. He requires abnormal behavior from everyone around him that must be in a certain regulated and regimated fashion that soothes him enough to not act out. His parents need his affection and love, but he can't tolerate their looking at him or touching him, much less any emotions. The book is supposedly Christopher's journal so the reader soon gets a read on who Christopher is. He is charming in an odd way, and he is obviously so helpless, but he cannot comprehend the entirety of his deficits or the serious handicapping of his dream to be an astronaut. Although he cannot bear emotions from anyone he is not unemotional. Anyone with empathy feels Christopher's agonies but he cannot be consoled by empathy on any level. His favorite sleeping dream is when he walks an earth where he is the only person alive. This is not a person to love, yet his parents adore him while at the same time tearing their lives to pieces by their unrequited love for him. It is a desperate existence for all of this family, but nothing can be done except to bear it, handling each Autistic meltdown with the only response that works: waiting it out patiently sitting nearby until it's over. I could not do this, raise a child this functionally broken without any reward or affection or gratefulness. Even dogs can like and love back, enjoy petting or want to be with you - none of which is something Christopher can give or do. However, these parents never stop loving their son. The Special Needs Counselor is the one person who helps Christopher understand how to share his life as much as he can, which is little better than understanding how different people are from him and that he must tolerate their presence without instigating or resorting to violence. He learns phrases that are meaningless to him, such as ""how are you today"" simply because he has learned these things minimize his contact with people. To not be polite extends the always unwelcome interest of all persons in his vicinity. The parents are not special people except in their love for their unloving child. They are blue collar, not particularly sophisticated or wealthy. The son baffles them. In their sorrow and disappointment, which they cannot verbalize, they attempt to soothe themselves with alcohol and sex but find themselves once the temporary diversion is over in the same depressing reality. There is no cure, only palliatives. This book is well-written and imagined, and I could not put it down. Christopher's mind is as illuminated as one would want from a good book. Strong in tone, the novel enlightens readers about the cruel inescapable cage the handicapped child and his parents must learn to endure, finding little help except for whatever resources they can discover within themselves and if lucky, in the community.",34,0.9961,0.119,0.694,0.187,0.5654026455026456,POSITIVE,0.5903

They are very logical but you could never work out the rules, even if you spent all your time thinking about them. Fifteen year old Christopher has major difficulties understanding human speech patterns and human emotions, so he finds refuge in the cold equations of advanced mathematics, in scientific papers based of facts instead of emotions and in the ocassional murder mystery novel that uses logic to solve mysteries.We meet Christopher at a moment of crisis: his parents divorce has uprooted the strict routines that make his existence bearable. When the young man discovered the dead body of a neighbourhood dog in his backyard, he decides to emulate his idol Sherlock Holmes and investigate the murder, writing down the clues and his logical deductions in a private journal / novel.>>><<<>>><<<I have come late to the party with this very popular novel and, to be honest, I was mostly disappointed in the journey. I thought the author did a poor job of accurately representing the autistic personality disorder and was twisting the facts around based on the needs of the plot, with little concern for consistency. I know I am nitpicking through the text, but Christopher’s issues with metaphors and similes come and go at random. Similarly, his agoraphobia, violent reaction to strangers and self-control appear and disappear according to plot convenience. Furthest away in the sky were lots of little white clouds which looked like fish scales or sand dunes which had a very regular pattern. In the end, I got reconciled with Mark Haddon and with Christopher after I finished the book, when I read in an interview with the author that his intention was not to analyze the medical condition, into which he had done little research, but to illustrate the impact autism and other mental disabilities have on families and friends, the need for patience and understanding in caring for the special needs of persons who struggle with a lot of the things we take for granted. We all make mistakes, Christopher. You, me, your mum, everyone. And sometimes they’re really big mistakes. We’re only human. As such, I conclude that Mark Haddon has done a decent, necessary job of putting the issue into discussion and I am thankful for my friends from the book reading group who picked the title for a monthly read. Lots of things are mysteries. But that doesn’t mean there isn’t an answer to them. It’s just that scientists haven’t found the answer yet.

62,1723739821,06/21/2013,5.0,"Somebody, I can’t recall who, has said that fiction is successful with people in as so far as their ability to show compassion for others – our very ability to step in to others shoes. And, so if the character in question is more like us or is facing problems that we have faced or are facing – it is easier to show compassion, and the artist is more likely to be successful. However, that also means that one is not challenging oneself too much – both as an artist and audience. Christopher is rendered too different from us by his circumstances – the problems he faced are not ones we had to face, and so it must be that difficult for a writer to step into his shoes. C. is a differently-able fifteen ear old boy; who can’t bear crowds or strangers. Also, he can only understand words in their literal sense- so, he has problems with metaphors including expressions like ‘apple of eye’ or vague xpressions. This sometimes makes him an innocent quibbler – to fury of his parents. His inability to filter the information his mind is receiving makes him anxious in new places.Also, he has a problem using what is called ‘Theory of mind’ – the assumption (which in usual cases is acquired in children by age of three) that other people have a mind of their own; and which also another thing which help enjoy fiction. So, Christopher is not able to enjoy fiction; except for detective novels which he see as puzzles – and he loves puzzles.These very problems make him excellent with numbers and logic – far better than most of us; he finds the world of numbers much more secure and likes spending time with them. He likes numerical and visual patterns; and he has a great love for prime numbers because they defy all patterns. He relaxes by solving complex mathematical problems and puzzles. Also, he has an incredible memory. He is a big fan of Sherlock Holmes - who had willingly worked hard to be as logical as Christopher naturally is. The very things that make him different make him more conscious of the way mind work than most people are.All these differences are incapable of beating his courage. He has a goal, that of being an astronaut. We don’t know if he will achieve that goal but he definitely has a genius and a courage that makes so high an aim possible, and a positive attitude that makes him look at problems as puzzles and challenges to be fought. This story is example of the little victories, that he won against his social-anxieties, which can act as stepping stones towards his goal.",34,0.9875,0.067,0.791,0.143,0.5819934640522877,NEGATIVE,0.996

I had no idea that it was gone.I will attempt, through the group read, to reconstruct the earlier review. ***UPDATE***17 April 2017I read this story 14 years ago, and the review I wrote then was testy because I was too often and too deeply reminded of Forrest Gump as I read it. I ***LOATHE*** every single frame of that film, including the titles, the union notices, and the copyright information. It is sappy. It is manipulative. It is far, far too convinced of its own cleverness. It smirks at its main character behind his back, smiles dazzlingly to his face, and expects all of us to get the joke: The dumb guy's got dumb luck! Haw haw. Like that Swedish hundred-year-old man farrago.Yuck.Now, on dredging this book out the dark corner where it's been blocking a draft for a good long time, I can be a little less wrathful about the story. It's not as mean-spirited as either the Swedish mess or the Gump grimness. I still don't like it, the similarity to the mean-spirited smirky stuff gets in my way far too much. But I can finally tell the difference between this story and those: This one is interested in angles of perception and fields of vision. The conceit is not the point here. The point is to experience the world in a foreign way.While I don't particularly enjoy the story, I no longer want to hurl the book in the path of a draft so as to get some use out of it.

I also found that it is a very typical book of the understanding of a professional- they have their facts about aspergers but they don't actually experience it!

Things I do that are like things that Christopher does: (2) Rely on a pattern of events to determine whether today will be an okay day. Christopher likes to count cars in the morning, I see if I can catch the subway as soon as I get into the station. If I can't, it's definitely not a good start to a potentially perfect day. (3) Tune people out.  (5) Verbally analyze jokes that I don’t understand to the point that the joke is Just Not Funny Anymore, Please Stop. (7) Wanting to be an astronaut as a kid because astronomy and physics made sense.  (11) Being such a huge believer in routine and order that if a bottle of water is misplaced on the kitchen counter or the TV stand is slightly awry, I feel disconcerted and uncomfortable until it is put away or straightened.(13) Prime numbers are the coolest.  The similarities between Christopher's and my way of thinking makes me wonder if this is really how people with Asperger's think and reason. Did Mark Haddon adopt this familiar thinking pattern to make this book accessible to the readers? Or was it that the author couldn't help but write a novel this way since he doesn't have the syndrome either? I was surprised to read this book from the perspective of a boy with Asperger’s. The little diagrams that Christopher uses to explain the logic games he plays were a refreshing element to the disjointed prose. However, after the initial novelty of the prose waned, I found it harder and harder to finish the book. At first, I found Christopher's lack of empathy interesting, but then I noticed the same pattern emerging again and again: a. Parent says to not doing something.b. Christopher does it anyway.c. Parent gets angry.d. Christopher gets angry. e. Christopher’s anger manifests in black outs. f. A lot of bad feeling results from the Parent.g. Christopher plays with his Swiss knife. It got old pretty quick.A majority of the book focuses on the emotional trauma of the people around him. However, toward the end, when Christopher suffers emotionally from something to the point where it physically affects him, I found myself so numb that I couldn’t properly appreciate with what Christopher is trying to express. Simply, I stopped caring when it mattered. Maybe this emotional state was what Mark Haddon was trying to achieve, but I didn’t feel any particular attachment to the book by the end. Also, I did not like the cursing. I don't mind cursing in general, but so many people yelled and cursed at Christopher that it made me wonder whether Haddon was trying to raise awareness of Asperger’s Syndrome by making people look like jerks. Not cool. Overall, a solid 3.5 stars for the novelty and the entertainment. It was very interesting and very eye opening to go through life from the perspective of a boy with Aspergers.

70,480576782,12/18/2012,3.0,"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time revolves around Christopher, an autistic teen who discovers his neighbor's dead dog one night. He is a genius in that he knows all of the prime numbers up to 7,057 and can solve logic puzzles quickly and efficiently; however, he can't stand the colors yellow or brown or the thought of different foods touching on his plate. As Chris investigates the death of the neighborhood dog, he stumbles upon something that may change his life.I loved how Mark Haddon maintained the consistency of Christopher's voice and how he didn't sacrifice the integrity of his character to make him any more likable. There are times when I wished I could snap Chris out of his stupor, but those moments made the book more realistic. I also liked how Haddon incorporated subtle details in the story to exemplify Chris's character even more - like the prime-numbered chapters and the appendix at the end.While the book made me think, I felt like the second half of it floundered in that it didn't have a point. It showed Chris's character and thought process, but what else? The story was okay but in terms of broader theme or proceeding beyond the baseline intellectual appeal I didn't think it was mind-blowing.Mark Haddon deserves all of his accolades for writing a book that delves deeply into the mindset of someone who doesn't fit into society. I would recommend this fascinating read to almost everyone, even if it is arduous at times. Can't wait to discuss this one at book club - there are myriad things to talk about.Also, for those interested in a fantastic story about a character that has a form of autism/Asperger's, I highly recommend Marcelo in the Real World.

72,1298626950,06/04/2015,4.0,"A “lovely” autistic teenage boy(Christopher) with an incredible talent for math and a gifted logical brain which is amazingly observant of every little details around, is our hero in this book. He’s afraid of talking to strangers, being put in unknown situations, being touched and lacks the proper intuition about others that many “normal people” take for granted. He loves timetables, dogs, rats, prime numbers and Sherlock Holmes and he hates metaphors (not similes!), noisy places and yellow and brown colors. Through an incident with a dead dog one night, he resolves to turn into a detective to find the cause of the murder and keeps the records of his adventures in a book, “this book” (The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time), which later progresses to a new adventure to find his mom.

My heart’s for Christopher and all those tens of millions of boys and girls around the globe who can’t connect to our messy wide world but are truly lovable and affectionate. In the following I’ve included some of my favorite lines from the book that might give us a short insight into how these cute special people think and behave:1. Christopher loves math because it’s predictable, logical and has a definite answer, ""unlike life"". Of all numbers he loves primes because he thinks ""Prime numbers are what is left when you have taken all the patterns away"". 2. He notices every details, and ""can detach his mind at will"", whereas ""other people's brains are filled with imaginary stuff"". He believes that ""the world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes"". He also judges a day to be good or bad by how many red or yellow cars he has seen.3. He loves animals better that humans: ""I like dogs. You always know what a dog is thinking - it has four moods. Happy, sad, cross and concentrating. Also, dogs are faithful and they do not tell lies because they cannot talk"". Love has a simple unemotional meaning for him: ""Loving someone is helping them when they get into trouble, and looking after them, and telling them the truth, and Father [does lots of things for me]... which means that he loves me"".4. He hates it when he can’t tell the truth, even if it’s only for the sake of politeness. He believes that everything people say is a kind of lie – a white lie if not the real one.

I think it's possible that it was recommended to that reviewer by a ""literary snob"" and therefore, she got that impression from that, but I could also be completely wrong. I believe the purpose of this book wasn't even to make a huge literary statement, but to broaden the general public's understanding of what it might be like to have autism. The author worked for many years very closely with individuals with autistim, and he writes the book through the eyes of a 15 year old boy with autism. He describes the world from his vantage point, and uses images to clarify what his thought process is like, which to me give the reader an idea that his line of thinking is much different than the average persons. The story is very simple, but why I think it is written well, is because there always seems to be some level of anticipation as to what is going to happen next. It is at the simplest level a detective story. So, it keeps you wondering why certain things happened to this boy. Like he tells you things, and you yourself think, ""huh, that's kind of odd."" So, you'll feel a little puzzled at times, but the character keeps investigating and eventually helps himself and the reader understand the whole picture. So anyways, I think it's a great book.

And I enjoyed the first half. It was the second half that really set me against this book.I enjoyed Christopher's story and his inner monologue, his innocence and simplicity and attention to detail and linear thinking. I started to really feel for him and sympathize with his differences. From what I know of autism (and it isn't terribly much, so don't count me as an expert or anything) I thought Christopher's character was a good portrayal of an autistic child, how their minds work, what they feel and don't feel and how they react to things.It was when shit hit the fan for Christopher and his dad and he took off on a whimsical quest to London that I lost all patience with him. Maybe this makes me a terrible person. I know that I'd never be able to work with autistic children, but I respect the people who do all the more. I understand that it's not a choice for Christopher to be unable to feel or reciprocate people's feelings, but it still drove me over the edge. He stopped being charming and innocent, especially with all of his talk of stabbing people with his Swiss Army knife. Who gives an autistic kid a knife anyway, when he's known to hit people when feeling threatened? Bad move, mom and dad. I don't know. Maybe I was disappointed because this book was billed as a mystery and darkly comedic, and I didn't feel like it was either of those things.

83,6744878,09/24/2007,3.0,"One day in June I was joking with my sister, ""I should TOTALLY write a story about an autistic detective! He would go around solving mysteries, but then not telling anyone about it because he doesn't relate well to people!"" And then I thought for a second, and said ""oh wait, I think there's already a book about this.""As someone who likes neurology case histories and detective fiction, this sounded like the book for me. And it was, kinda. A few months after buying it I started to read it while waiting for a plane and basically didn't put it down for more than 30 seconds during the flight. This book definitely grabs you enough to steam through it in about 3 hours.While it was somewhat fulfilling to read, I did have my reservations, though. For one thing, Haddon does a pretty good job overall at presenting you his story through the eyes of an autist, which is to say the prose isn't the most graceful. It's not supposed to be. It's supposed to strike you with it's stiltedness and make you think about how the thought process of your narrator differs from your own. This is an effective technique, but one wonders if it's the best narrative choice for an entire novel. The story actually comes to a rather abrupt finish in the last twenty pages or so, which almost suggests that Haddon himself got tired of generating a story in this voice and wanted to put the book down himself. But of course, that's just speculation.The narrator's unusual perspective is also indicated by the little tidbits of psychological facts that Haddon peppers the book with - which I found to be hit or miss. At times, they genuinely excited my curiosity. When the narrator describes failing a false belief test as a child, it made me wonder, do autists really remember in vivid detail a test like this so that they can understand how they failed it once they gain the ability to track intentions? It's just surprising enough for me to believe it, although it's unclear whether this is substantiated. But this episode also provides an example of the clumsiness of these insertions, as it comes off a little awkward for the narrator to tell us about his false belief test to begin with. For a book written in an autists voice, a little awkward can be a good thing, and maybe that's why this book just didn't wow me once I put it down three hours later.",26,0.9798,0.069,0.809,0.122,0.5127083333333334,NEGATIVE,0.9993

I remember thinking that the book was pretty good, and that it may be a reasonably good effort at getting into the internal thinking of an autistic mind.The autistic 15-year-old narrator of this novel, Christopher John Francis Boone, is so well imagined that you’ll keep hearing his voice in your head. Often misunderstood, he’s falsely accused of killing a neighbor’s dog and decides to find the killer himself. This is the journal of his investigation, and it’s absolutely unforgettable.
THE CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE DOG IN THE NIGHT-TIME

Fifteen-year-old Christopher is a math genius, but his autism makes socializing nearly impossible. One night he finds his neighbor's dog impaled on a garden tool. He gently cradles the dog—only to end up getting arrested. When he's released, Christopher is determined to figure out what really happened, and is encouraged by the school social worker to write a book detailing his findings.

This review is not meant to be offensive to anyone with special needs. They are my opinions of a fictional individual and not the ones that I share of a group of people at large.
 [This has to be said since people can't seem to separate a critique of a fictional person from my opinion of a group of real people who have a disorder. 🙄😤😒]I picked this book up about 3 or 4 years ago as a pleasure read and put it down after a few pages because I wasn't really connecting to the story or the characters. Recently, it got added to my required reading list and I was forced to give it another go.My overal opinion of this book is that it is a tedious read. Haddon makes it extremely hard not to become frustrated with his main character, Christopher and his method of story telling. While it is understood that Christopher is Autistic, his character wears thin on the nerves after just a few pages. I didn't outright hate this book, but there were many things that were frustrating such as, the idea that Christoper would be given a weapon if he is unfit to identify other people's emotions. This baffled me to no end. Why would someone give an emotionally impaired/behaviorally/emotionally impaired person a weapon knowing that they can't discern whether the people around them are trying to harm or help them? Also, the idea that this character would be given as much freedom as he is given and not watched more carefully was odd. I know you don't want to smother your child, but if they can be a danger to themselves or others wouldn't it be better to make sure that they are well watched at all times?Christopher also reminds me of a special needs version of Holden Caulfield. He has many problems with the world at large and reasons that everything can be done in a logical manner yet, his own actions render this idea void making the character a contradiction. (view spoiler)[ For example, he decides to runaway to London knowing that he can't take the pressures of the outside world nor, does he like to be around strangers. Therefore, his misadventure does not sway me one way or another except in the one instance where he is almost run over by a train trying to save his pet rat. (hide spoiler)]This book is pegged as a mystery, which plays up to be a gimmick since there is only one real mystery in the story that gets solved halfway thought the book and another mystery that gets presented to Christopher in its place. This in itself wouldn't be so bad if, the readers wasn't being dragged along with the character already knowing exactly how things will turn out. However, I guess the real mystery in the story is Christopher finding out how the world and other people work. Therefore, I would caution others against reading this book if they are expecting a proper mystery. If I am honest with myself, I wouldn't have continued this book if I was given a choice. The narrative was tedious and repetitive, I didn't truly care for the character, and the action in the story is sporadically interesting with huge lapse in the plot. I get that the book is written from a perspective of a person who has special needs however, he is very unlikeable in the way he describes other people and their beliefs. If it seemed as if Christopher was remorseful of the way he negatively described his classmates or behaved, I would've reacted to this story differently, but the way that Haddon writes his novel makes it appear as if Christopher is in full control of his actions and behavior. This consciousness no matter how small makes me feel that Christopher is knowingly being surly opposed to acting out because he is ill.",24,-0.7892,0.1,0.81,0.089,0.4701012588943624,NEGATIVE,0.9999

But what role do people with a difference have in our society? How can they be assimilated? And who is to say what is normal anyway? None of the characters in the book appeared normal to me, at least!Christopher Boone is the child in question, and his story starts with a murdered dog. He sets out to investigate the murder, much in the tradition of his hero, Sherlock Holmes (but not Doyle, because he believed in God and fairies!). What he unravelled was something far more shocking and disturbing than any Sherlock mystery.I have no clue if this is a genuine depiction of Asperger's - some say yes and some say no. But whatever it is, I think it a brilliant portrayal of a child facing difficult issues within himself, is unable to fit in, and regularly undergoes parental abuse. I loved the peep into his mind and really enjoyed the way he thought, so logical and clear-cut. I loved his intelligence and the depiction of his slow working out of every single thought before he took action. It was just like being in someone's mind. After all, logic trumps intuition, doesn't it? Kudos to Haddon for creating a young character who didn't make me want to put my head between my legs and groan with frustration.As good as the book is, I don't think it is perfect. Christopher undergoes verbal, emotional and physical abuse by the hands of his violent father, who even calls him 'little shit'. I don't know if this is normal acceptable behaviour in Britain (if yes, they need a culture shift), but I did not find it acceptable. He also yells constantly at Christopher, knowing that it just does not help and only aggravates matters. I am not averse to abuse being depicted in a book, but I think it is important to address it correctly, which has not been done in this book. Christopher's mother is also physically abusive, and is neglectful. I found her absolute disregard for something that Christopher values so deeply, like his A-levels, terrible. She also blames her failed marriage on Christopher. How about taking responsibility like the adult you are? The most mature and normal person in the book was Christopher himself, in spite of his problems.What is worse is that Christopher's therapist does not bother to report anything despite seeing his bruises and being told that his father did it. I can't believe this book was published under young adult. The thing kids would learn is that parental abuse is fine if you misbehave, or worse, if you are not absolutely normal in the accepted sense.",24,-0.988,0.16,0.728,0.112,0.5722959430506599,POSITIVE,0.7437

The fact that the book is written from the perspective of this child is clever up to a point. As I continued reading, though, I started to have doubts. Is the author really attempting to help the reader understand what living with autism or an autistic child could be like or is his agenda more sinister....The author blatantly attacks any form of belief in God. He uses the fact that the child thinks logically and cannot lie due to his mental health condition. He clearly states that beliefs in God are delusional and outside the realms of the logical and rational thought process therefore they are categorically wrong. The child dismisses those with any spiritual beliefs as fantastical. The fact that the author uses the enhanced capabilities of the child in areas such as maths and logic to do this is outrageous. The whole premise of the author's argument is therefore that you cannot be a rational, logical human being and believe in God. Additionally, there is no room for manoeuvre on this point because the child cannot be wrong because of his special gift....To use an illness especially in a child to promote an atheistic agenda is appalling and I'm surprised that more people haven't picked up on this issue with this book.There is a lot of highly offensive language in this book including blasphemy. The author even uses the shortest verse in the Bible as a swear word at one point. From a secular rather than spiritual point of view, even the most basic reading up on these mental health conditions reveals that adults should not just accept or give in to ritualistic behaviour. Yet, all of the adults in this book appear to be doing this throughout especially his parents. This does seem to make his behaviour worse.If this is really what it looks like to be inside the mind of an autistic child, which is possible, it is very sad. His whole life is full of fear; fear if he eats the wrong thing, touches something, says a certain thing and he frequently reverts to solving maths puzzles in his head to calm down. The problem is that the book never attempts to address any of the behaviours seen in the child so he never gets any better....I can't recommend this at all due to the spiritual issues as mentioned.",23,-0.7443,0.104,0.804,0.092,0.4726530797807393,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Autism is something that affects so many people in such vastly different ways, which is why we’ve labelled it a “spectrum disorder.” It’s something that we don’t understand because it has so many faces. I feel that Haddon did a fantastic job presenting one possible face of autism, and of helping readers to get inside the mind of someone on the spectrum. As someone who has worked with children with Aspergers Syndrome, Haddon uses his own experiences and knowledge to craft an unforgettable character in the form of Christopher Boone. Christopher is an incredibly intelligent teenager with a fairly severe case of Aspergers Syndrome. He’s trying to solve the murder of his neighbor’s dog Wellington, and he’s writing a book about his progress. Getting the story from Christopher’s own mind and perspective was fascinating and sad. He reminds me so much of the movie Rain Man, in both his gift with number and his difficulty interacting with the world outside of his own mind. I wish I had that kind of grasp on numbers. Christopher’s struggles with family were heartbreaking, especially as you could see how much his family loved him and how hard they tried. And reading about the boy’s hopes and dreams and plans for the future, and how he was going to go about accomplishing these goals, was beautiful.This is a short little book that helps those of us who aren’t on the Spectrum understand those who are. I highly recommend it, especially if you have someone in your life whom you could relate to better for having read this book.",21,0.9713,0.064,0.791,0.145,0.6618888888888889,POSITIVE,0.9998

This book was a huge success and brought him 3 awards (Whitbread Book Awards for Best Novel and Book of the Year, the Commonwealth Writers' Prize for Best First Book, and the Guardian Children's Fiction Prize) a couple of years ago. The book opens with a mystery. Through the mystery we observe the life and thinking pattern of a 15 year old boy who has Asperger's syndrome. Asperger's is a cognitive/behavioral variant accepted among autism spectrum. What is hardest for these people is coping with the sensory overload they get from regular circumstances; something we have to deal in everyday life. (thus, anything ranging from a hug or a walk on the street to a crowded birthday party can be a problem)The book solves the mystery of a small incident in life and leaves us questioning the bigger unsolved mystery of being such a complicated creature. Also emphasizes how very small things in life are actually the most important ones that keep us alive inside and make our lives worth living. (sorry for the cliché). The part that moved me most was the part where both parents repeatedly express their pain for not being able to hug their child..The author roots for the people in similar circumstances like his protagonist, and shows us in the course of the story (and through inner dialogue) that, we are all capable of excelling even with our shortcomings when we are determined, because we have this self-imposed need for evolving to a higher version of ourselves..

He punches people when they touch him, even his parents. The story begins with a dog being found dead in the night time - clearly just from the title itself.Christopher is the one who finds this dog dead and wants to solve the crime and apprehend the murder. He investigates in his neighbourhood and finds out shocking secrets about his Dad & Mom. I honestly felt bad for that kid and wished to give him a hug. But I know he'd probably punch me right in the face. Christopher is also a genius and the way he calculates and forms equations in his head amazes me. I mean yeah, he is a fictional character but c'mon, a kid who is able to come up and solve mathematical equations like that must be gifted. He is even taking his A Level Math paper!The story began really great and got me hooked right from the start. However, once all the thrills were over it became rather flat for me.

He is autistic and does not like to be touched. But when he sees his neighbor's dog has been killed, Christopher decides to investigate - and he finds much more than he expected. His world becomes a jumble and though frightened, he perseveres in making his own decision on how to proceed. An unhappy situation, but a positive ending. Update: I listened to the audio version, narrated by Jeff Woodman, in Sept 2010. Woodman's narration is exceptionally good.

111,751124072,10/28/2013,4.0,"I may not have been born autistic, but I was born deaf, so reading about Christopher's living with his autism, his parents's struggling to raise him, and his coming to terms with a world that didn't understand him gave me that tingling sense of having spotted two same black cats pass by seconds apart (only there wasn't a cool gunfight afterwards). A lot of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time bordered on the eerie to read: arguments at home, incidents at school, outbursts in public, and awkwardness with strangers, which were common in my early years when I was being a perennial headache and pain in the ass, bringing home live spiders, dressing up as Batman and Power Rangers villains after bedtime, and staying out late to play marbles (which I later paid for dearly with mosquito bites). But most of that was par for the course for every other kid. In Christopher's case, however, things aren't nearly so rosy. I don't push people off swings when I want my turn. I don't discriminate against food based on what color it is. I don't explode in a flurry of punches and screams after being touched even slightly. Facial expressions don't baffle me. The number and color of cars I pass on my way to school don't determine whether I will have Good Days, Super Good Days, or Black Days. My first instinct after stumbling upon a neighbor's dead dog isn't to stick around and look fishy. I'm not in the habit of being someone's potential heart attack by hiding inside cupboards and shelves. It wouldn't have taken much for Mark Haddon to trip over his good intentions and end up with an offensive, mediocre, or offensively mediocre book. Fortunately, the opposite happened. The Curious Incident is as entertaining as it is enlightening. Given his penchant for telling the truth and extreme literal-mindedness, Christopher is the role model would-be reliable narrators dream of themselves being. Books written in the first person are risky, but Haddon pulls it off more than passably in the book. Christopher's is an intriguing mind to live in, his thought processes refreshing in its straightforwardness. Because the powers of description as found in your typical novel are often beyond him, the writing naturally doesn't waste any time in getting to the point. For example, when anyone cries, their waterworks is coolly noted in a sentence, and then the book (or Christopher, to be accurate) spares no further thought on the matter before moving on, so the pacing is such that I'm confused by how, even accounting for life's obligations, it's taken some people up to a month to finish when I myself couldn't not put the book aside until two sittings later. The constant, and I mean constant, ""And then he said..."" and ""And then she said..."" should be infuriating, yet because it feels so natural here, there's no cause for complaint. Christopher's random digressions and debates, especially those on evolution (""[human beings] think human beings are the best animal, but human beings are just an animal and they will evolve into another animal, and that animal will be cleverer and it will put human beings into a zoo]"") and life after death (""... if heaven was on the other side of a black hole, dead people would have to be fired into space on rockets to get there, and they aren't or people would notice...""), are so whimsical and reasonable it's hard to oppose him with a straight face. Some of his conversations with strangers, if they could even be called that because he's not very conversational, are even more priceless. That may be politically incorrect to say, yet I feel Christopher would be forgiving, considering how much he dislikes lies and liars.The Curious Incident gets a lot of flak, mostly for its perceived gimmicky shtick, sometimes for how condescending and exploitative some say it is, and for being, I was somewhat stunned to read in one review, ""literary [blackface],"" the latter of which warrants no further attention. The only elements in the book I could think of that could be perceived as being even remotely gimmicky are 1) the chapter numbers, 2) the first-person narrative, and 3) the flow-charts, emoticons, star constellations, mathematical diagrams and trees, brand signs, dinosaur drawings, maps, orangutan doodles, and various doodads. I try to picture an alternative reality in which Haddon chooses to number his chapters the conventional way, write as everyone else writes, and omit anything else that doesn't belong in the English alphabet. How dull! Using the primes to number the chapters fits with Christopher's interest in mathematics. The first-person narrative is more immersive and insightful than I imagine the other two alternatives could ever be (though my poor imagination could just be that lacking). The assorted images, because Christopher thinks visually, are only to be expected. Take these out and you have another book altogether. When it suits some, the word ""gimmick"" gets tossed around as casually as ""pretentious,"" and it's not a little insulting to those who have read and enjoyed the book. Haddon intended for The Curious Incident to show a life most people find limiting (""horribly constrained,"" he said) that, if looked at with enough consideration, would ""seem infinite."" Autism, or anything else similar, is admittedly not the most advantageous thing to have, at least to outsiders, but with the right mindset and attitude, it doesn't have to mean the end of the world. Haddon shows with Christopher that while his condition can be restricting in some ways, it can be, if only he and everyone else let it, freeing in others as well, maybe more so than some of even those in better shape. It's almost too predictable to paste this quote here, but anything else I can say along the same lines is pathetic in comparison: ""Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor, and it can never be used to hurt you,"" said Tyrion Lannister from a little-known fantasy series. Moreover, Haddon takes care not to let autism define Christopher completely. It may be his most obvious trait, but it's not his only one or his most important: his enjoyment of science and mathematics, his love for animals, his courage to do what he thinks is right, and his hatred of France. He's also more well-read than me despite his distaste for novels, seeing as he doesn't hesitate at one point before revealing apparently everything that happens in The Hounds of Baskerville. Thanks for that! Joking aside, I was wrong to be apprehensive of the possibility The Curious Incident was an overrated fad doubling as delicious sheep food. Then again, that's exactly what I would say if I were bandwagoning and trying to convince everyone otherwise. Another thing in the book's favor is that it's short and well-paced enough it can be burned through in a day or less, so anyone could check the book themselves and either confirm or revise their suspicions. For being so quick a read alone, it deserves at least half a thumb up, rounded up to one thumb up to avoid a mess.",19,0.472,0.112,0.77,0.119,0.5017057569296374,POSITIVE,0.6629
112,2046683064,08/10/2017,2.0,"I don’t know what to say…this book is good but it just isn’t great. My rating started at 4 stars and now I’m at 2…the more I thought about this book the more it disappointed/annoyed me. Ugh okay so this is  sort of  a story within a story. The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time is presented to readers as a murder mystery story written by the main character himself for school. Everything that happens in this book is told to readers exactly as the main character sees and experiences it. Which I have to admit, is a really great concept.Our main character, Christopher, is a 15-year-old boy who has high functioning autism…or so we think. That is never actually specified, ever. Readers see that Christophe struggles socially and emotionally, and we are aware that he goes to a school for people who have special needs. But in regards to what is actually going on with him, we never get any explicit explanation. This isn’t all that surprising, because in one of the earlier chapters the character expresses his belief that everyone has special needs (ie: when someone needs to wear glasses) and is different when it comes to learning, so he doesn’t think that his special needs are all that different from anyone else’s. And this is my first issue with this book, it’s a book that suggests representation for children with special needs but does not provide a clear diagnosis. Not only that, but the symptoms shown throughout the book appear to be very extreme cases. I work with students who have learning disabilities/special needs and while I know everyone who has a diagnosis experiences their symptoms differently I couldn’t help but feel the way that Christopher shows his symptoms felt a bit exaggerated. Also his self-awareness seems to be a bit off when compared to the degree of his symptoms. He is incredibly rude when he talks about other students in his school and he thinks very highly of himself in comparison to other students. I’m not saying it isn’t possible for someone like Christopher to feel this way, but based on my experience with students like him it definitely feels like a bit of a stretch. (Don’t @ me I know anything is possible but I spent a lot of time doing research on students with high functioning autism and this just felt really off for me). So anyway onto the plot. This story is presented as a murder mystery, Christopher is investigating who murdered his neighbor’s dog. And without going into too much detail since I don’t want to give away the plot twists, this book is about much more than that. What I will say is that I like the idea of this story.  I was really invested in the things that Christopher discovers and found myself rooting for him. I just wasn’t really into the delivery of this story, and I also didn’t find it to be all that believable. Everything felt too convenient for the story and not necessarily accurate in the representation of a person with HFA…or just in general tbh. I can’t imagine this story going this way for anyone, let alone Christopher after spending so much time in his head in this story. So while it was relatively entertaining, it just didn't work for me here.Idk this just...wasn’t what I wanted. I didn’t mind that the plot was different from what I was expecting, but the characters weren’t what I was hoping for and like I said the plot was just too much to be believable, even for a work of fiction.

113,1589558500,03/24/2016,3.0,"I read this to help a student with their English course. Its popularity in the UK is so immense that it's recently been made into a West End show, a tribute I don't think even HP can boast... I found it a very quick read and I related hugely to Christopher; it's quite tempting for me to write a series of anecdotes about my own tribulations here instead of talking about the book. But I will resist.The scenario is classic YA/teen fiction: teen struggles with issues including but not limited to imperfect parents. Yet the plot, the style, the appeal of this book rests on Christopher's autistic spectrum disorder and the reader's experience of his viewpoint. It's really enjoyable being in his mind, especially if you like physics and maths. Haddon creates limitless sympathy for Christopher of course, and no matter how he behaves I root for him. When an adult, especially his Dad, gets annoyed with Christopher and behaves towards him in an unhelpful or harmful way, I thought, what a fool this person is being. The plentiful humour is usually at the expense of such fools, or comes from redescription of the familiar: “I didn't say anything because Mrs Alexander was doing what is called chatting which is when people talk in a way that isn't questions and answers and isn't connected”.I appreciate that Christopher's difficulties arise in context; they are created by others, and by time and resource limitations that affect working class folks. This is reflected by his frequent fantasies of being alone. The neurotypical reader can understand how someone with ASD may be harmed or confused by others, and hopefully, behave with more empathy in future. But I did feel uncomfortable that this character, who will be read as representative of people with Asperger's en masse, was created by a presumably neurotypical author who says he didn't bother to actually research ASD. Even though, whether researched or not, the portrayal could not be accurate for all people with ASD, and there are aspects of the book that work against easy misconceptions (Christopher writes that the school's psychologist thinks he likes numbers because they are safe and straightforward, but he thinks “This is because Mr Jeavon doesn't understand numbers”), I still think it would have been much more respectful to actually do that research. I would have chosen a book written by a person with ASD instead if I had had the choice, but I guess that experience would not have been so easy and comfortable, and the question to ask myself now is, am I glad that this easy and comfortable book exists to raise awareness among young people, even if it's a problematic act of ventriloquism? I guess the answer is yes.More subtly, the novel presents Christopher as a sponge of cliché and stereotype; when he talks about the people in the special school as 'stupid' or reflects that he could find a 'lady' to marry so that somebody would be around to wait on him, the absence of 'politically correct' framing exposes the ableism and sexism he has absorbed. If this were a little better anchored in other aspects of the narrative I wouldn't be concerned about some readers taking such comments for wisdom rather than violence.",20,0.9897,0.085,0.768,0.147,0.5341517857142857,POSITIVE,0.7487
114,4093761934,09/21/2021,5.0,"This is an outstanding fictional “case study”. There is not much of a story.The reader is inside the mind of Christopher Boone during the entire book. Christopher, a high functioning autistic boy, decides that he is going to find out who killed his neighbour’s dog, envisaging himself as Sherlock Holmes on a quest. We actually find out who killed the dog quite early in the story, but when Christopher discovers “who-did-it”, his life, as he knew it, is shattered, and he embarks on another quest. That is the story. Not much to it.The genius of the book is letting us see the world as Christopher sees it — a world filled with numbers, patterns, and images. Psychologists have classified people who are like Christopher as being on the “autism spectrum syndrome” but in fact, all such individuals are unique and, to date, geneticists have been unable to discover the underlying genetic causes of what makes such individuals different from the majority of us. Some, like Christopher, have very high mathematical skills. Others have no skills with mathematics at all. I know quite well a woman who is a high-functioning autistic, so high-functioning that it took me years to realize that she was on the autism spectrum. I thought that sometimes she made odd life choices but it never occurred to me that she was on the autism spectrum until I met more members of her family. She is extremely good at mathematics (she once said to me that calculus was “beautiful” and I inwardly grimaced). Her son is completely hopeless at even the most basic arithmetic — he prefers patterns and images but not numbers.If there is anything I could fault THE CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE DOG IN THE NIGHT-TIME for, it is the fact that the author does not indicate that autism is almost always inherited. If someone is diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum, you nearly always find that several relatives on either the mother’s side or the father’s side are also on the spectrum. Yet neither Christopher’s father nor his mother show any signs of autism — in fact just the opposite — and there is no indication that any of their relatives are on the spectrum either. Christopher’s parents are normal people with normal problems, except for having a son, Christopher, who is definitely not normal. What the book illustrates admirably is how difficult it is to live with autistic people. They persist about things that appear trivial to others. They don’t easily adapt. They talk endlessly about things they are interested in and won’t pay attention to the interests of others. Like one character in the book says to Christopher: “Don’t you ever, ever think about other people for one second?” No, they don’t, because they can’t place themselves within the mind of another person.My theory, for what it is worth, is that those on the autism spectrum see details far better than “normal” people. In fact, as it is clearly described in the book, normal people only see sections of the whole and fill in gaps with their imagination. Those on the autism spectrum have great difficulty filling in the gaps, and so see only the details, never able to visualize the continuum of parts that make up a whole.

121,1955695732,04/14/2017,1.0,"1.5 starsThe Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is an interesting contribution to the world of literature. It is one of the first and one of the few novels to cover an Autistic Spectrum Disorder told from the point of view of someone with the condition and written by a man who has worked with special ed students (though I am quite sure he himself is neurotypical). I have gotten mixed responses from different people about this novel, many of which were positive, some of which were negative, one of which that was scathing, and I must say that I reside a bit more with those in the second and third options that I gave. In other words, I did not like this book and feel that it could give readers a bit more of a harmful impression of those that are neurodivergent than one of empathy.Christopher John Francis Boone is a British boy living with his father at the beginning of the book, because from what he was told, his mother died of a heart attack. Christopher sees that a dog from down the street (owned by a Mrs. Shears) was killed and as he goes over to hold it and pull out the pitchfork that was used to kill it, it looks as if he himself committed the murder and Mrs. Shears is horrified. Christopher does his best to solve the mystery himself, much to his father's dismay, while also telling us about things that interest him (like math, physics, and astronomy), things he likes (like the color red and animals), things he dislikes (like the colors yellow and brown and being touched), while also incorporating the details about the mystery and happenings of his everyday life.Christopher clearly is written to have a condition on the Autistic spectrum, but his functioning level is not necessarily the highest. In some ways, I feel that his actions are a bit unrealistic, for someone who is fifteen years old and has his intelligence would likely have the self-control to not hit someone that touches him and be well aware of just that. He may try to get himself away from them, but not noticeably strike them. It does not add up. Then again, neither do many of the things in this novel.The worst part, though, were his parents. I hated Ed and Judy Boone with a passion. I felt they were self-centered, self-prioritizing, small-minded dips that only tended to Christopher because they felt it was their need to do so as parents. The things that Ed did should have landed him in prison, while the mother was just as neglectful and demonstrated how she was unfit to be a parent. If I had a say in the events in this piece, I would have had Christopher taken away from both parties and placed in a more caring home. While it would have taken Christopher time to adjust, these parents bothered me beyond belief and felt that a ""sorry"" and a finger-based contact (since Christopher did not like further touching) was enough. Both of them were garbage (and the same could be said about Mr. Shears). Also, in the context in which this is being told and the events in which it took place, the fact that killing a dog is ""a small crime"" bothers me immensely.There were some decent qualities in this piece, like how the chapters were counted by prime number instead of in order (for instance, the chapters were 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, etc.), for it was an interest of Christopher's and I also liked where he would spend chapters talking about things that interested him. There were many details, though, that were presented in ways that I found it challenging to wrap myself around. I am not sure if his striking of the police officer would have resulted in immediately being detained instead of the stalling that took place. I am also assuming that he was in a special school or classroom, but to have him in a room with a high school student that ate their own excrement does not add up to me. This student has to be really low functioning. I would definitely say that Christopher does not have Asperger's, for his impulses do not support a diagnosis of this nature. He does definitely have a form of Autism, though, despite the fact that its portrayal is a bit off.I feel that after reading this novel, there needs to be more books written about those that have Autism, Asperger's, and other conditions of this nature. If this is the literary reference to novels about the Autistic Spectrum, that would be really sad. I cannot recommend this book and encourage that people that are on the spectrum to write stories about character's on the spectrum and also encourage those with a greater understanding (such as parents, guardians, and others) to do the same.You can find my video review for this book here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL3HJ...",19,0.0389,0.093,0.809,0.098,0.5055204951298702,NEGATIVE,0.6434
122,174040893,06/05/2011,4.0,"They say never to judge a book by its cover, but with The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, that is exactly what I did. Sorry, folks, but I simply could not resist the orange cover with the cut out image of an upside-down dog. It is unique and begs ""read me!"" Reading what people have said about this book paired with what it says on the back of the book makes you think you have a grasp on this puppy but alas, I was wrong. Our protagonist, Christopher John Francis Boone, according to the back of the book, decides to investigate the murder of a neighborhood dog, and ""he knows every country's capital in the world and all the prime numbers up to 7, 057."" Oh, and he hates anything involving the color yellow and brown, even keeps red food coloring to accommodate. Oh, and he can't tolerate being physically touched or yelled at. You would think I would have been smart enough to figure it out. I was thinking... precocious and eccentric like Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close or Dash & Lily's Book of Dares But I was dead wrong... he is Autistic. Took me some pages to grasp that. Suddenly, the book took on a whole new dimension. I don't know anything about autism beyond what I learned in ""Rain Man,"" or seen portrayed in other things on the silver screen, and no matter how much I love ""Rain Man,"" I know that Hoffman's character was only but a tiny glimpse into the world of autism. Well, I still don't know how accurate Haddon's depiction was, but I do have to admit that it made for fascinating reading. While the murder of the neighborhood dog is an interesting concept, it was made even more so by using the unique perspective of Christopher, it is a book he is writing per his teacher Siobhan's instruction. You must understand that Christopher doesn't think the way that we think; moreover, Christopher doesn't experience emotion the way we experience emotion.The plot is interesting, unique and heart wrenching. Reading the things that this boy does and says and thinks is such a different experience. Through Christopher, the main character, we get a sense of feeling from the people he writes about. He writes about the characters reactions, and through that, we can imagine their feelings. While the plot is interesting, it's not told that way, you the reader make it interesting. It is told practically void of emotion. In a part of the book, Christopher is reading a tragic letter full of emotion and probably written while crying. After he reads it, he simply tries to figure the letter out. It isn't sad. It's more curious to him. It drives me crazy reading it, but it's just who he is.The book is written skillfully. The chapters are written on seemingly unrelated topics sometimes, just as, I imagine, an autistic person would write. The sentences are very much like the title. I would describe the book as choppy, because of the language used. Haddon's phrasing, descriptions, thought, and speech AS Christopher often made me stop and reread what I just read. Trying to understand the language and the thoughts of the narrator is half of the book. I think you might see how that could be slightly annoying, but if you understand Christopher or want to understand Christopher you can see the beauty in it, like trying to learn a language or understand another culture and their ways. The language is difficult to understand and the culture and thoughts are too, but it is definitely rewarding in the end. I definitely want to learn more about Autism; moreover, I have a copy of George and Sam waiting on my shelf to do just that. Definitely recommend this, it was a different but great read.",18,0.9823,0.08,0.795,0.125,0.5765378971311176,NEGATIVE,0.9711
123,1524625,05/29/2007,4.0,"From my Amazon.com review: ""...I wrote a book and that means I can do anything..."" What a sad, strange book. Christopher's stream-of-consciousness narration was unique to say the least (I liked how he jumped around from topic to topic, because organized writing can become quite a bore). While I don't see this as a study on autism, many autistic characteristics are displayed - most notably, the OCD. Can't have one sort of food touching another sort on his plate, can't eat anything yellow or brown, the rigid timetables, counting the cars, etc. Yet he is highly functional IF certain conditions are met: -no one touches him -no crowds -no loud noises -there is order/if things make sense (he always appreciates order when he discovers it in new places, such as the train stops in intervals of 15 minutes) There are others, of course. But he's basically highly sensitive to his surroundings and cannot cope when strangers, touching, or unfamiliar situations get in the way of an otherwise peaceful existence consisting of his preferred white noise and solving math equations. His mind can't process emotions correctly; instead, he reacts to negative emotions by screaming and moaning. He doesn't think highly of anyone besides himself and scientists. Anyway, I found Christopher's dreams about being one of the only persons left on earth to be fascinating. He loves it because he can do anything - he can walk to the sea and it's raining and he can take ice cream from an abandoned shop and he can put on dry clothes at an abandoned house and, etc...(I wonder how many times ""and"" is used in that book!). He can do whatever he wants and no one bothers him. Christopher didn't like to imagine things in his head that weren't happening, and the above reference was of course referring to a dream, but when he would imagine himself as an astronaut, isn't that a lie? He could become an astronaut, but he isn't one yet. He would look down on regular people who imagined things that weren't real, and yet he finds no fault with himself for doing this. Just an inconsistency. I can seem him as an astronaut, however, and I think he would make an extraordinary scientist if all environmental conditions were met. It wouldn't be good to have a breakdown in a lab full of dangerous substances. I was quite angry to find out the truth about his mother, and his reaction was to be expected, I think, although if it had happened to a ""normal"" person, the repercussions would be longer lasting. How did this not destroy him? He is very fragile and though it's true that he hated his father and couldn't trust him for the rest of the book, it seems to me that he should hate his mother much more. She could have made more of an effort to see him, I think. Two years passed!! Perhaps she could have showed up at his school one day since his dad wouldn't have her at the house. Overall, a really intriguing book, and I loved the drawings (I used to make drawings of floor plans of my house, neighbors' houses, relatives' houses, and stores to put in my diaries when I was younger. I also made intricate schedules and cried if my schedule would be disrupted, but those are only mild OCD symptoms, nothing near Christopher's --it just made me understand him a little more. I also hated places with lots of people; I would run out and hide in the car after church, for example) and appreciated his math and science explanations..most of it made a lot of sense and was very educational. I'll have to look up more about ""The Case of the Cottingley Fairies"" - those real life mysterious happenings are so interesting to me.

124,1930339272,03/03/2017,3.0,"This is a cleverly written book about a boy called Christopher who is 15 and has aspergers. It is a mystery book like no other. Christopher's discovers Wellington dead in the park with a pitch fork through his belly. Because Christopher cares for the dog he is found cuddling the dog when Mrs Shears. Finds out her dog is dead. The police are called and after the police touch Christopher and he hits the police officer he ends up in prison. Christopher's dad gets him released and Christopher goes on a detective mission to find out what has happened to Wellington. Could the killer be closer to home then Christopher realises? This is a very interesting story which has either been very well researched or the author knows someone who has Aspergers because the disability is shown in a new light. I really liked reading all the bits about Christopher and his Aspergers. It gives the book a different edge to it. Which hasn't been done before. Christopher is great at maths, physics, science. So good in fact that he is sitting his A levels and is predicted an A at the age of 15. Christopher cannot tell a lie, doesn't understand jokes, and is always honest. Ironey, jokes and random terms of phrase are lost on him. If you want to talk to Christopher you need to do it clearly and manner of factly. A point that is made lots throughout this book. When he is asking questions and he isn't getting a clear answer. Christopher doesn't like the colour yellow and brown. So much so that if he has a dinner of that colour he has to die it. Christopher doesn't like strangers or interacting with people. Christopher lives with his father in Swindon after being told that his mother died from a heart attack. But as Christopher comes to realise in this book that things aren't always as simply and straight forward as they seem. I really liked Christopher and this book shines a light on Aspergers in a wonderful and sensitive way. For people who are not aware of this condition or any conditions which do not show physically as a disability. If you think that disabilities are just ones that you can see this book will break down your preconceptions. It will make you think how you interact with / see people and judge people on first impression and hopefully break down those preconceptions and misgivings. Making people realise that you shouldn't judge people by what they look like. Because they might be fighting battles we cannot see and so we should treat everyone how we want to be treated. With kindness and respect. For the reasons above I particularly enjoyed this book. Let me know what you thought about he book.

125,1278140017,05/12/2015,3.0,"This book wasn't what I was expecting. I was kind of disappointed because I thought it would be a mystery novel and I was expecting something a bit darker. It's not that I didn't like the book but I just wasn't really blown away by it. There was so much hype around this book and everyone told me it was amazing but I didn't even think it was really good. It was just an average read. I'll start off with what I liked about it. I liked Christopher and I think Mark Haddon did an excellent job with him. I haven't read many books with narrators with Aspergers but I have read enough to know there's a right way to do it and a wrong way to do it. This book does it the right way. Instead of just explaining Aspergers and listing off all the facts about it, we really got to know Christopher and his Aspergers. I really liked getting an insight into how Christopher saw things. The writing was the best part of this book. I think it was close to flawless. I also liked how the family was conveyed. They're a dysfunctional family but I really felt for the parents. They didn't know how to treat Christopher. I found myself getting quite frustrated at how they treated him sometimes but then I realised it was a very realistic portrayal. You could tell Christopher's parents were desperate for Christopher to feel something sometimes but he just couldn't. It kind of broke my heart when his mom was so desperate for a hug but he wouldn't give it to her because he didn't like people touching him. I really liked how they spread their fingers and pressed them against each other to show Christopher that they loved him and that he loved them too. At the end, I really felt for the father and I thought his love for Christopher was very powerful. I liked how Christopher did the chapters in prime numbers and how he drew diagrams. I loved Siobhán and I wish we got more from her or about her. Even though I liked a lot of things about the novel, I just wasn't thoroughly impressed. For one, it was really predictable. There was the identity of the dog-killer and a big twist and I saw both of them coming from a mile away. I just really wish this book was different because there was so much potential. The actual storyline was boring. Mark Haddon could have done so much better. I would recommend this book to people who would like to get an insight into the mind of someone with Aspergers but to nobody else. ",18,0.998,0.055,0.731,0.214,0.6240374873353599,NEGATIVE,0.9944
126,1969130282,12/18/2018,4.0,"I don’t read much literary fiction. In fact, Literary Fiction scares me. I hate that literary fiction means it has merit. As if genre books can’t have merit. I think books under the genre, literary fiction, sounds stuck up and only very posh people read them. With all that being said, I decided I would pick this book up and try it. As a mother of a son with Autism, this book really gave me anxiety. Our main character Christopher is 15 and is higher on the spectrum than my son. Christopher is able to compartmentalize his fears and take action, which helps him on his journey. Christopher is a math whiz and a logical thinker. One day his neighbors dog turns up dead. This dead dog (Wellington), starts a very important chain reaction in Christopher’s life. Without this catalyst, he wouldn’t have this particular future.

At his special day school his teacher Siobhan, convinces Christopher to write a book. The book that I, we, the readers have just read is that story.I am really impressed with the emotions I felt while reading this book. Mark Haddon is not on the spectrum, but did work with children with disabilities in the past. He writes through the eyes of these children so well. This is a fictional story that feels and reads like a nonfiction. So much so I had to look up whether or not Christopher Boone our protagonist was not in fact the author in disguise. It made me get a better perspective of what might be going through my sons head. Christopher is very straightforward and articulate. His journey is difficult and scary. It’s also extremely dangerous and caused me numerous times to really worry. Even though this is fiction, I think it would be helpful for parents like myself or even faculty in education.

127,2542734030,08/20/2019,4.0,"Christopher Boone is 15. He lives in Swindon with his father and Toby, his pet rat. His mother, it seems, has died. On his own, he has never been further away from home than the end of the road until the night he finds the neighbor's dog dead—a pitch fork sunk into the poor animal—and decides to become an amateur detective to investigate—and solve—the case. Also important, Christopher is in the spectrum, for he has some form of autism, Asperger’s syndrome perhaps. Those with autism are not easy subjects for a novel. Their interests are often prescribed, their experiences regular and static, their interaction with others limited. However, Mark Haddon finds a way around that by making Christopher a fan of Sherlock Holmes. Is this admiration what leads Christopher out of this stasis, pushing him to abandon his everyday routine, so that the story can happen. Although he knew the dangers of talking to strangers, Christopher starts by speaking to his neighbors about anything suspicious they may have seen relating to the death of Wellington, the murdered dog—an exception to his strict rules in an effort to find clues.Later in the course of his investigation, Christopher discovers a box of letters from his mother, soon realizing that his dad has been lying to him about her. And that is where a simple mystery turns into a deeply touching story offering glimpses of how overwhelming and challenging it can be for young autistic people when they try and experience something different in the real world, whether they’re getting a haircut or trying to understand human interactions.This is a book intended for young people but with so much for adults to enjoy it’s hard to limit it to a YA audience.Haddon’s does a great job with Christopher’s voice, which makes the narrative interesting while punctuated by all those little pieces of information that enrich but also plagued Christopher’s view of the world.PS We do get to know who killed the dog.",18,-0.448,0.081,0.851,0.067,0.5093304843304843,POSITIVE,0.9998

They are interesting and oddly compelling in their normalcy and imperfection; relatable, but also making you want to believe that you could do better, where they did wrong. Christopher is especially wonderful — beautifully painted, in first person even! It’s almost magical how instinctively accurate his portrayal feels, even where there isn’t a sense of familiarity with the circumstances and challenges he faces. So why only three stars? Because even with all the above, I found his book unsatisfying. Because in the end, there was very little story; and it felt like such a waste, to let his be just a slice of the everyday (albeit with a bit of excitement) when you are armed with a compelling, remarkable but realistic MC and believable supporting characters.I feel like this book tried to be To Kill a Mockingbird, making the ordinary into something exceptional and memorable... and fell short. It felt like a teaser. I would love a full-length book in Christopher’s POV!

I don't think you can have one without the other, so my feelings are quite mixed.Initial Thoughts:1. Really enjoyed the introduction to the book. Quite humourous. Even though our main character states he can't tell jokes, he is unintentionally funny. He says things no one says, the filter is off, and it made me laugh. 2. Christopher is effectively portrayed through the narration style, and it was an amazing, jarring, and disorienting experience.3. Christopher goes off on a lot of tangents, revealing facts and observations, and there were moments that I felt overwhelmed (I believe that's intended), and I started to become detached to the overall story.4. Great surprises and twists. I got halfway, and it was 'WOW'.5. Heavy on the heart. We see how Christopher and those around him are affected by his autism.

The story is really grounded and wholesome and told through the perspective of a 15-year-old boy with Asperger's syndrome. It doesn't really feel like fiction but more like a true story, considering that in the book, he writes about writing the book and what should be in it. The story is really quite humane and real. The title would make you believe that the story is about a dog that got killed but that's actually quite a small part of the actual story. It's more of a starting point of this whole book. I don't want to write more about the story because I feel like people should experience it on their own.

142,1189935125,02/03/2015,4.0,"Phrases like “curious incident” and “night-time” lure the reader into the framework of a mystery. However, this is as much a murder mystery as THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES was about two dogs being killed (Mortimer's Spaniel and the Hound, for those like me with fuzzy memories). In the eyes of the fictional narrator/author, 15 year old Christopher Boone, that was the subject of Arthur Conan Doyle's story, and this is a murder mystery. Christopher Boone is autistic and he is recording real life events as seen through his eyes into a book. He uses the formulaic devices of a mystery to help him with structure: Open with an attention grabber, acknowledge “Red Herrings,” consider motives.... The reader is cognizant throughout of how autism skews Christopher's perception, and sympathizes. Read this as a straight-forward mystery and you will be disappointed. This is a multi-layered story of relationships as well as a touching account of how it feels to be autistic.Christopher has difficulty interpreting facial expressions. His teacher, Siobhan, draws some simplified examples of happy, sad, frightened, etc. as cues, but Christopher rightly perceives that in real life people are changing their expressions so quickly that it is difficult to use these cues with consistent accuracy. (To relate, you need only imagine Bill Belichick's tortured press conference “smile.” Is it a grimace of badly concealed pain or a mask for his boredom with the whole process? How we actually “read” facial expression is a combination of perception and associations formed from past experiences). He has difficulty dealing with new people and new situations. Simple statements and questions feel out of context and disordered to him. Almost inevitably, he experiences sensory overload and even his attempts at self-calming come across as bizarre and off-putting. There is a black and white quality to Christopher's world. He is particularly insistent that lies are bad. This is one reason he likes dogs. They do not lie because they can't talk. Nevertheless, he seems particularly adept at rationalizing his own “white lies.” These, he explains simply, are when you tell only a partial truth. Finally, Christopher really can't stand being touched. It triggers a sense of losing control over himself, as well as a sensory revulsion, and often ends not just with screams of horror, but panicked violence.All of these problems surface as the story proceeds. When a policeman questions him, his confusion is mistaken for affront. When the policeman puts a hand on him, his response gets him arrested for attacking an officer of the law. Christopher is aware that his “Behavior Problems”, which he helpfully lists, cause tensions in his family. Occasionally he permits glimpses of their frustration. Those glimpses, however, are presented as a backdrop, parenthetical to his storyline.One of the reasons this book is so effective is that the language and cadences are so convincing. The sentences are short; the descriptions are unembellished. At the same time, the narrator's candor is charming. His literal minded observations offer insight, and his intelligence is reflected in a keen sense of observation, and extraordinary curiosity. Christopher is a math genius and loves prime numbers and solving mathematical problems. He even uses these gifts as part of his self-calming arsenal. He displays extraordinary insight when he reviews the connection between his sense of being overwhelmed and his experience of memory storage and retrieval.  “My memory's like a film. That is why I am really good at remembering things, like the conversations I have written down in this book, and what people were wearing, and what they smelled like, because my memory has a smell track which is like a soundtrack.” (p.76) This is a film that is crammed with hundreds of random details that can be configured into a staggering quantity of patterns. New events trigger a comprehensive and time-consuming search for the right pattern. “And this is also how I know how to act in difficult situations when I don't know what to do. For example, if people say things which don't make sense like, 'see you later, alligator' ...I do a search and see if I have ever heard someone say this before.” (p.78) Equally interesting is Christopher's views on time. “...time is not like space....time is only the relationship between the way different things change...if you get lost in time it is like being lost in a desert....And this is why I like timetables, because they make sure you don't get lost in time.” (p. 158)I liked this book, but felt there was a disconnect between Christopher's mystery story, and the story of family relationships. The portrayal of Christopher's parents lacked emotional resonance, and calls on the reader's ability to embrace with equal compassion a kind of negative space of emotional drama. This book is perfectly paired with the nonfiction book, THE REASON I JUMP, by Naoki Higashi. I highly recommend reading the two books together. The combination of fiction and nonfiction complement each other perfectly.",16,0.9609,0.12,0.739,0.141,0.5121771284271283,NEGATIVE,0.7173
143,1379247832,08/31/2015,3.0,"I've gone back and forth on giving this book either two or three stars, but I think I'll give it the benefit of the my doubt and give it 3.3 Stars - Good solid book, it has strong writing and generally a strong plot but with enough issues that I can't rate it higher.I found the story line interesting and something I haven't read a lot on before. Now, I don't know if that's because there isn't a lot of books out their with characters such as these, or because I just haven't chosen a book with such characters. Either way, Christopher (the main character) is really the only character I liked. He is very intelligent (as shown by all the math!) and knows what he wants and what he's capable of. I can respect that in a character, and real people too. On the other hand his father, while doing his best I suppose, made some terrible parenting choices (view spoiler)[ like telling his son that his mother died when she actually left them for another man. And hiding the letters from her.  (hide spoiler)]. The bad choices are highlighted even more when (view spoiler)[ you consider how sensitive and straightforward Christopher is. It's not surprising that Christopher freaks out and runs away from home. His father lied to him - something that from very early on, Christopher tells the reader he does not do. (hide spoiler)]. I also don't care for his mother. (view spoiler)[ I have no respect for people that abandon children. That's not to say certain people don't do the right thing by giving up their children, or moving out. But the way in which Christopher's mom did so was awful. Truly, truly awful. I do not care for her. (hide spoiler)] That being said, I don't think you have to like every character in a book to enjoy the book.I enjoyed Mark Haddon's writing. It was clear and easy to read. I sped through this book. Though it helps that is quite a short book too. (One of the shortest I've read in a long while). The organization and writing really reflect the main character and narrator, Christopher. I also liked how the text was broken up with diagrams, charts, drawings, etc. They added to the mood of the book. Additionally, I liked the parallels between Sherlock Holmes and Christopher. If you think about it, they really do have a lot in common. Both very logical and straightforward. I thought that was really a brilliant addition to the book.The reason this only gets three stars is because I just couldn't fully connect. There was something lacking for me and I can't quite place what it is. Likewise, the only reason I gave this book three stars was because of Christopher. I really liked him. But other than that, the book felt lackluster. I wasn't wowed by anything or taken aback, with maybe the exception (view spoiler)[ that his mother was actually alive (hide spoiler)]. If Christopher had been only slightly different this book probably would have received fewer stars. There isn't enough substance, in my opinion, to warrant a higher rating. Also, I felt that last few pages were rushed. The author spent a good deal of the book getting into the situation with Christopher's parents and the neighbor's dog that all the information that presented itself in the last two or three pages felt like he just tossed it in. However, I would recommend this book conditionally. So long as the person knows that, in my opinion, they're not going to be reading a literary classic.",18,0.9966,0.086,0.74,0.175,0.5037313988095238,NEGATIVE,0.9998
144,9535063,11/25/2007,3.0,"It's a rare book that can sit on the bestseller shelf and still call to me... for most tomes, the bestseller label is a big enough turn off to make me never consider it. That being said, I have no clue what made me go for this one. Maybe it was the upside-down dog. Maybe it was the lengthy title. But what I really don't get, having read it, is how it was ever a best-seller.That's not to say it's a bad book. It wasn't. I'll be honest, I don't know exactly how I feel about it, but it was not bad. It was done well, in fact. It just didn't have many elements that people like in best-sellers. Being done well, for example, is usually taboo. To start, it's a bit of a challenging read for the DaVinci Code crowd. We have to follow the train of thought of an autistic child, which isn't always as rational as he'd like to believe. Action will go on hold for stretches of time. There are diagrams and math problems. There's bold letters and repetitious breaking-down of everything. Even while some of these elements would make it easier for the normal book buyer to relate to, it's still a style that requires a brain to wrap around. Also, I found the characters wholly unlikable. Bestseller markets like likable characters. While I was offended and pained and trying to justify the fact that every character sucked at the end of, say, Tom Wolfe's ""I Am Charlotte Simmons,"" Haddon's book is far smaller, so I feel the unlikable characters simply added a unique flavour. Honest, though, outside of minor, flat characters (who are actually the most likable), none of the main adult characters are good people, and Christopher, autistic or not, is a self-centered brat. I know, I'm supposed to have compassion for how unlike other kids he is, but I really don't. He's a huge brat and hyper-intelligent with book smarts but completely naive about real world smarts, which makes his self-important fact-rattling really, really annoying. It's how his character is supposed to be, though, so I can't fault the author. It does lead to another question, though... this is the sort of book where you need to know something about a problem effecting other humans. Is the bestseller public ready to be educated about autism? Who convinced them that disabilities were the new gauche thing to read about?At the end of the day, it was worth the read. It was a memorable book, and not bad, if not entirely my cup of tea. Still, I'm left wondering how it became so popular.

Having been blamed for it, he decides to investigate to clear his name. However, he is severely limited by his own fears and difficulties when interpreting the world around him. Throughout his adventures, Christopher records his experiences in the form of a book, entitled The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time. (Adapted from: Wikipedia)During the time of his investigation, he has to face the world with his “aspergerness”, got confused about direction when he has to leave his house, having trouble with comunicating through other people, and knowing about the fact that his mother is still alive, after years being told that she was dead, that makes him shocked untill he is unable to move, curls up on the bed, vomits, and groans for several hours.What makes this novel very unique is that the novel presented in a way an Asperger-Boy narrated. Full of the switching of fonts and use of long, run-on sentences when describing the surroundings. Another uniqueness u can found in this book is that the book's chapters numbered unusually by prime numbers started from “1”, “2”, “3”, “5”, “7”, “11”, “13”, and so on.

In itself, the book is a good choice: the language is challenging but readable, the story moves quickly and maintains interest, and the book touches on many other topics—math, autism, memory—that can be used for supplementary exercises.However, it is too similar to the book assigned to the students last year: The London Eye Mystery, by Siobhan Dowd. Both books center on a boy with autism who is trying to solve a mystery in London, told with frequent asides. So the experience has been somewhat repetitive. Granted, I think that Haddon’s book is far better than Dowd's, more exciting and more touching; and Haddon also gets points for originality, since his book came out four years earlier. It is really our fault at the school for picking two similar books one year after the other.One very striking and, eventually, very annoying aspect of the book is the narrator’s tendency to string every sentence together with an “and.” At times this technique achieved a desirable bluntness or immediacy, which worked well with the narrator; but I think it was carried to excess. Why would Christopher be so averse to grammatical subordination? It does not exactly correspond with his logical and orderly mind. Besides, Haddon uses the same writing style when he is writing in the character of the narrator’s mother—who is very different from her son—using one “and” after another.All together, however, I think that this is a fine book, well conceived and well told, which manages to be appropriate for children while dealing with some more “mature” themes.

154,3178391914,02/06/2020,3.0,"""The Curious Incident of the Dog in the nighttime"" is a novel by the English writer Mark Haddon. The protagonist is Christopher, a special 15-year-old boy who sees the world in a different way from other people. Christopher has a disability, which although it is never mentioned in the book, is supposed to be Asperger's syndrome, a type of autism.He often does not understand people's behaviors, what they have in mind, hates yellow and brown and does not touch anything that has these colors, does not understand social norms, humorous jokes, body language and just cannot bear to be touched. In mathematics he is a genius and in terms of logic and memory he is unrivaled and that is why his dream is to become a scientist when he grows up. Christopher lives alone with his father because his mother has died.One evening Christopher finds the dog of his neighbor, Mrs. Shears, dead on the lawn, skewered by a farmer's pitchfork. He does not understand the reason for this fact that disturbs his routine and decides to find out who killed the dog, also because at the beginning of the story, since Mrs. Shears sees him with the dog in his arms, for a few hours he is suspected to be the killer. Christopher deals with this fact like he faces all the facts of his life, that is, with logic and interpreting as clues all the sensory inputs to get to understand the world around him. Christopher is an analytical mind and therefore uses only factual data, with very detailed explanations of what he observes, all data that he needs to accomplish his goal, that is, to write a book about this investigation.In the book he is writing, Christopher talks a little about himself, his situation, the things he likes and dislikes: he tells us that his mother died two years earlier and, during the investigation, Christopher discovers that before dying, she had an affair with the neighbor's husband, the owner of the killed dog. Christopher writes it in the book as if it were a natural fact, and when his father reads it, he gets very angry. Beat up Christopher and throw the book away. A few days later Christopher finds the book in his father's closet, along with some envelopes addressed to him: he takes one, reads it and sees that they are letters from his mother to him and then he realizes that she is not actually dead, but she ran away in London with the neighbor's husband. For Christopher, finding out that his father lied to him and his mother is not dead is a real shock. He then confronts his father, and the father starts to cry and tries to justify himself and, to regain his son's trust, he confides to him that he is the killer of the dog, and he had an affair with Mrs. Shears after his wife's escape with Mr. Shears. Christopher's shock increases beyond the level of endurance and Christopher decides to join his mother in London.After a very eventful journey, between trains and subways, Christopher arrives at his mother's house: she is very amazed at what Christopher's father has done and said and decides to keep Christopher with her. This decision, however, does not like to Mr. Shears, now cohabiting with the mother, and then the mother decides to leave London and return to their village. Christopher starts studying mathematics again and passes the exam with top marks. Meanwhile, little by little he gets closer to his father and the two also create a small vegetable garden, obviously very neat, in the garden. The book ends with a very charged Christopher: in a year he has to take the advanced mathematics exam, but he knows he can do it, because he made it to go to London alone, to find his mother, to find who killed the dog and even write a book and therefore he feels he can do anything. It is a very special book, with comic moments, dramatic moments and moving moments; it has the great merit of introducing us to certain aspects of autism with a text that has nothing of essays, but rather is full of humanity. It is a short book and therefore it is easy to read.",15,-0.7275,0.087,0.83,0.083,0.4437074829931974,NEGATIVE,0.9896
155,838034666,01/29/2014,4.0,"I have a younger brother with autism, and for a time I struggled to understand his condition which made me unable to accept who he is while we were growing up. Fortunately, I managed to read three magnificent books that helped me change the way I view him as a person over the years, and one of them is Mark Haddon's novel about a savant who attempts to solve the murder of his neighbor's dog. What made me instantly connect with this book are three things: (1) the first-person accounts of the lead character, Christopher Boone whose third name is 'Francis' which is also my brother's; (2) he idolizes Sherlock Holmes like I do; and (3) the logical but also absurd observations and theories that Christopher comes up with to make sense of the world around him.The narrative voice is peculiar, disjointed and hilarious all at once and that's really the charm of Haddon's The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time. Christopher may possess a supreme kind of intelligence but he also has a discernible lack of social graces and that disables him from comprehending the subtleties of daily human interactions. I was also uncomfortably familiar of the tension, disgrace and pain of his home life situation especially since I can contextualize them with my own experiences with Francis (who is not a savant like Christopher at all; he only has the mental capacity of an eight-year-old). Though the protagonist is apathetic due to his autism, it doesn't make his narrations of his relationships with his father and other people any less painful and confusing for both him and the reader. The power of Haddon's prose is hard to miss; he deliberately highlighted the fears and horrors of a mind like Christopher's so readers will know exactly how it feels to be so blatantly different from everybody else; as if you are a prisoner of your own gifted mind and no one else could ever hope to decipher and unravel you.More of a character-driven story, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time has a ridiculous premise for a plot but it nonetheless has a very emotionally satisfying pay-off for its protagonist. The struggle and journey of Christopher Boone as he tries and fails to understand concepts that are beyond his means but do come easy for ordinary folk like us are worthwhile reading experiences that should not be missed. There is a lot of poignant moments in the book and Christopher's inability to feel the extent of emotional burdens could be strange but it only makes the whole thing sadder for the readers. Still, Christoper is not merely a shell of a person who operates in a different level of logic; he is a real person with real feelings although he can only express them in ways that are unique to his misunderstood yet very enigmatic kind.I could not be objective about this book personally because I know how it feels to love someone who cannot return your feelings with the same degree and intensity, and I suppose that's why this book resonated inside me. Loving people like Christoper and my brother is never easy but thanks to authors like Haddon who are willing and compassionate enough to tell stories in their points of view, being able to read a story like this makes it less painful for family members and relatives who know the trials and blessings of loving a special child.RECOMMENDED: 8/10* It could prove a challenge to understand and relate to Christopher and his inane quirks and mental patterns of thought; but it is an experience you will not trade the world for.

Unlike the main character, 15-year-old Christopher, who has social problems (he's autistic) but is great at math and science, numbers make my brain go on the blink, so I skimmed the many equations and maps, and stuck to the parts of the story that intrigued me: Who *did* kill the neighbor’s dog, Wellington?Christopher has insomnia, and one night he comes upon the dead body of Wellington, who was murdered with a gardening fork. Christopher likes detective novels, so he decides to discover who the canine murderer is.His investigative efforts are quickly hampered when Mrs. Shear’s, the neighbor who Wellington belonged to, refuses to talk about it, and then when Christopher’s father makes him promise not to investigate any more. Christopher is incapable of lying, so he has to obey his father, but he still wants to solve the mystery. Investigating in a roundabout way leads to an even bigger mystery that he has to solve. The main tension in this book comes from Christopher’s issues with people—primarily strangers. He is afraid of crowds and new places, and he sometimes acts out in ways that could get him or another person hurt. He’s constantly clutching the Swiss Army knife he keeps in his pocket, and you as the reader are dreading him getting the notion that it might be a good idea to use it. Along the way, however, you do want answers to the mysteries, and it’s a fun journey with Christopher to unravel the puzzles. ",15,-0.9814,0.164,0.744,0.092,0.4456228956228955,POSITIVE,0.9984

He's absolutely cute even when he groans and you can't stop laughing at his antics.Such as this :""...And it was horrible inside because there was poo on the seat of the toilet and it smelled of poo, like the toilet at school when Joseph has been for a poo on his own, because he plays with it""Special appreciation for Mark's aristocratic narrative.

165,1465293472,12/10/2015,4.0,"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time is a slowly unfolding case study of an autistic English boy named Christopher and it is relayed in a manner that creates considerable insight into the world of the boy's affliction. Christopher's world is fractured in many ways, including his inability to see the world as many others do, taunting schoolmates (a situation helped in part because he attends a special school for those whose behavior is ""non-standard"" in one or more ways) and also because his parents seem intolerant of each other, adding further to Christopher's feeling of alienation. Christopher comes upon a dead dog named Wellington whose presence he has valued and is initially accused of having caused the dog's demise, which sets in motion an attempt to solve the mystery of who killed Wellington. Christopher's favorite book is The Hound of the Baskervilles.My interest in the novel by Mark Haddon is a byproduct of having seen the theatrical version of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time at the Ethel Barrymore Theater in New York, the Broadway version having fascinated me, at least once I settled into the various British accents. Each chapter of the novel begins with a prime number, following Christopher's keen interest in prime numbers and mathematical puzzles, solving quadratic equations to relieve stress. The boy finds certain patterns & sequences comforting (for example, 5 red cars in a row signals a good day) but is easily distressed by loud noise and any behavior that appears random, not ordered in a familiar manner and also by the colors brown & yellow. Christopher also keeps a pet rat named Toby, is incapable of lies and has no facility for humor or for any form of language that is not completely literal, though he attempts to comprehend colloquial expressions and rhetorical questions, almost completely foreign to him. Meanwhile, a railway time table is a thing of beauty because it is orderly & predictable. Much of the story involves Christopher's flight from his home in search of his mother who lives at 451-c, Chapter Road, Willesden, London NW2-5NG, an address that is repeated with great confidence and becomes a targeted destination, even though Christopher has no native ability to travel solo from his home several hours from London, with his journey becoming a considerable adventure. There is great charm in the way this fairly simple quest for his mother, recently separated from Christopher's father, unfolds and carries the reader forward by Underground and British Rail. I have encountered several autistic individuals, including Temple Grandin, the author of several non-fiction works detailing her special world & a professor of animal science, at a lecture & book signing. (She would not or could not make eye contact.) The late Oliver Sachs has written a really wonderful piece on his own encounter with Grandin, An Anthropologist on Mars and beyond that has commented:Autism was once seen as childhood schizophrenia but phenomenologically the reverse is the case. The schizophrenic's complaint is always of outside influence. (He is passive, played upon, cannot be himself.) The autistic person would complain of the absence of influence, of absolute isolation. Autism presents an island cut off from the main. I found Mark Haddon's novel and the play it inspired a formidable & extremely absorbing window into the world of an autistic person.",14,0.9933,0.067,0.779,0.155,0.4050455291834601,POSITIVE,0.9997
166,385324612,08/06/2012,3.0,"I have a confession to make.I didn't study English Literature past GCSE (aged 16). I was one of two people in my group of friends, of whom there were about a dozen, who didn't study English Literature at A Level (aged 18). Why not? I read as much as them, probably more than a few of them. I certainly read more than most of them these days. The trouble is that sixteen-year-old Fi did not want anyone to tell her what she could and couldn't read. She wanted to read things she liked, for their own sake, and not to have to ruin them by writing essays about them. I've never once regretted my decision, although I've always felt like my knowledge of classic literature is a bit patchy, and my approach towards analysis is hardly academic. I kind of like it that way. Autodidactery is the life for me, etc.Reading Curious Incident a second time around, I'm reminded of myself at school, because when I read this the first time I remember loving it - prime numbers and Sherlock Holmes, hello! - but this time, I've got to read it with one eye on things I can say about it, lessons I can teach about it, things I can pick out to keep someone else interested. I want to say ""that's not how I read!"", but I've been writing reviews on this website semi-regularly for over two years now, so I can't pretend that I don't think about how books make me feel, how and why they're doing that, how good they are at it.The problem is that reading with one eye on regurgitation is just odd to me. Literature Students I Have Known tell me that studying books changes the way you look at them, and that after you've got the hang of it, it enriches your experience and adds another several layers of contextual fascination. And I get that, that's great! But I never did that, quite consciously and deliberately. I learned a different way. Maybe it was a less effective way. But the stage I am at in respect of literary analysis is the stage of the first year undergraduate: I know how it's done, I know I gotta do it, but damn it all I just want to find out what happens next.Curious Incident is a murder mystery, told through the eyes of a boy with Asperger's Syndrome. You're meant to see through his view of the world, to be constantly reading between the lines to see the things that he's not seeing, or that happen but that he pays no attention to.More importantly, it is a story about Christopher's dad and how he deals with the stuff that gets thrown at him: being the single parent of a boy who is difficult to understand and live with and who expresses his love differently, being left to carry the can by other people who have the option to walk away when things get hard. This is a book that constantly says one thing and means another, that invites you to do as Sherlock Holmes did and deduce, deduce, deduce. It's clever. It's great fun. It's surprisingly hard work when you're trying to read it more slowly and deliberately, to notice how rather than just that.You may have noticed that I'm in a bit of a reading lull right now: after racing through a dozen books in December, stuff's got busy and I've barely been able to concentrate on stories for the last six weeks. That's not a very good time to read something like this, where you're having to second-guess yourself all the way through. I'm sure I'll come out with stronger reading muscles, and the world will be brighter and shinier for me because of it. Nevertheless... urrrrrg. Who would have thought it would be this book in particular that would stymie me?",14,0.995,0.049,0.826,0.125,0.4439506886875308,POSITIVE,0.6819
167,181065017,07/01/2011,4.0,"At the top level, this is a fictional story about a teenage boy (Christopher) who tries to solve a mystery involving a dog in his neighborhood. But it is far more significant for being a first-person, full-immersion view of the mental processes of autism. It must have been extremely challenging to write, and that job was done very well. It has a lot of parallels with the real-life story of Born on a Blue Day: Inside the Extraordinary Mind of an Autistic Savant, which I WILL get around to reviewing one day.The book was a leaving-the-lab gift to me by my last PhD student. She told me it was the book that got her excited about working on an autism-related project, which she did in my lab for her dissertation. From the prime-numbered chapters, to detailed discussions of the nonsensical ways that ‘normal’ people think, every page is loaded with examples of the autistic thought process. In this case, the individual also shows special skills in areas like math and spatial relationships. The mental processes of these autistic savants bring into very sharp focus the seemingly inexplicable – that autism can completely degrade a set of normal social skills, while enhancing other not-so-normal skills to a truly astonishing degree.As one example, Christopher cannot be too close to people, and cannot bear to be touched by them. To relieve stress, he sometimes counts to 50 or higher, while cubing each number as he goes (!). In other stressful episodes, he solves extremely complex spatial puzzles in his head, to take his mind off the unpleasantness of too much going on around him. The story is painful to read at times, because it portrays in detail the extreme frustrations and everyday hardships on both sides of the autism divide – for those who have it, and those who provide care. Awareness of autism is growing in our society. Still, many of the too-typical views of autism are badly misinformed. Wrong about what causes it (vaccines? Very unlikely). Wrong about how to deal with it (blame the parents; give the child some old-fashioned discipline). Wrong about the numbers of affected individuals – roughly 1 in 110 children in America, though some very recent estimates are even worse. Some of the exponential increase in recent years can reasonably be explained by diagnostic criteria and improved testing methods. But most investigators would agree that something very scary is happening out there in the way that genes, the environment and modern life interact. The kids are, very likely, a leading indicator. In the context of these appalling numbers, the book forces us to think carefully about the monumental struggles attached to seemingly normal, simple activities of everyday life – for the affected individuals, and for their parents, teachers, and society. For those who are interested and/or dealing with these issues in their own lives, there is an excellent series of review articles in the recent issue of Nature:http://www.nature.com/news/specials/a...I highly recommend this book.",14,0.5174,0.083,0.818,0.099,0.5765092165898615,POSITIVE,0.8486

But it's not only the unusualness of this one boy that makes this book special. It is how messed up we ""normal"" people actually are. It's us who do most of the irrational things.The boy lost his mother two years ago. He presently lives with his caring but sometimes 'losing-his -mind-under-pressure' father. His favorite subjects are mathematics and physics. Has a knack for solving difficult problems as well as an astoundingly good memory like many autistic people do. The story started with the murder of a dog named Wellington in his neighborhood. And just because Christopher was an autistic young boy who happened to find out first that Wellington was dead, the owner of the dog Mrs. Shears took him to be the murderer without blinking an eye. The police came and took him to jail. After getting released with a warning from the police inspector Christopher set out to find the real murderer of the dog. But the truths he actually dug out were far more shocking and devastating for his simple mind-brilliant yet unable to grasp human complexity.This seemingly insignificant incident went back to two years ago and connected his father, mother, neighbor Mr. and Mrs. Shears in a way that came crashing into his life and altered it. Everything he thought he knew became confusing and left him in an even more volatile mood.The story got sidetracked a lot. But that did not bore me because that's how an autistic mind is supposed to work. He talked about maths and formulae and puzzles, constellations and sky and clouds, psychology and human relationship and how our brains work, evolution and medical conditions and geography -all very deep subjects for a 15-year-old. There was simply no prediction as to what he would say next because his mind wandered like a firefly jumping from this topic to that. Some readers may not find it very attractive to read when he talks so sporadically but then again we are not much familiar with autistic children's minds, are we? And this book is an excellent chance to peep into their wonderful thought process.This book shows people's general detest for the minority, those members of society whom we call ""special"" so generously. But when we come to know them it's very easy to sympathize with them and love them.Deftly describing, this book was not made too long by English novelist Mark Haddon. It's pretty fast-paced. I tore through the book and couldn't keep it down even for 5 minutes. Everyone especially maths and psychology lovers will find this book really interesting.

From not allowing his food to touch, to not understanding other peoples emotions – all perfect examples of how autism can affect a persons behaviour and actions.The story is narrated from Christopher’s perspective, as this is the book that he wrote. Everything written in it must be true as he doesn’t know how to write fiction.You get to be with him through all of his actions, including his melt downs in which he screams, sometimes making him sick.I loved Christopher, his logical view of the world, and the inability to tell lies, along with the way in which he portrays the world. He is a lovable young man. He tells you exactly what he’s doing and why. I like a character who gets right to the point, rather that skirting around issues.I wasn’t very keen on his dad though, as he was portrayed as someone who, although loved his son, is very stern and I got the feeling he didn’t understand his son very well.The book is quite an emotional book from the readers point of view, although Christopher doesn’t understand emotions.There are lots of funny moments, moments where you probably shouldn’t laugh, but the way they are told by Christopher, will have you laughing anyway.What I found most remarkable about this book is that it gives you an insight as to what it is like to live with autism, not just from the person with the diagnosis, but how people have to learn to adapt to living with someone with the condition.I first read this book years ago and then when my middle son was diagnosed, I re-read it and I found that it was far more helpful in understanding the condition than any reference book has ever been. For this reason I put this book into my top ten books.One of the little side notes which I want to add is that I liked how the chapters were all prime numbers, something that Christopher loved.I also had the pleasure of watching the adaptation on stage, just before Christmas.

The main character Christopher Boone says he doesn't understand jokes, but despite that the book is very often quite funny. It's not a laugh out loud comedy, but alternates between the humorous and the tragic. And it does it so well that I really felt for the character who has difficulties dealing with the world because of his Asperger's Syndrome. Even though I to know someone very slightly who has Asperger's, I really couldn't say how accurate portrayal this is of people with that Syndrome, but it sounds right. At the very least it is a strong emotional story.This book is written in two languages, English (which I can read pretty well), and math (which I can't read). So there is part of this book I don't understand, but these math problems still give the character identity. It is part of his character, part of who he is, and it gives him more life than if they had been left out.The narrative is unusual. It goes into lists, maps, math problems, and often quite precise descriptions. It works because it is used very well to describe the character himself. The logic, and precision is how he is. He gets one thing wrong though. Viking weren't people who lived 2000 years ago, he was about a 1000 years off there.In short, this is really a great read.

Considering that this got published 2003 and Picoult published her rip-off seven years later, I still think that this is the much better book.

Christopher has Asperger's Syndrome, so his world view is an utterly engaging one and I felt the author captured the difficulties of Christopher, his close family, his neighbours and the odd passing stranger, very well. In particular, I liked the way Christopher tells us of the strange things people say to him which make no sense to him - for instance, the man who saves Christopher from being run over by an underground train, and it is from these snippets of talk that we really understand the kilter of Christopher's world view. The story centres around the death of his neighbour's dog. This was not an accidental killing. C sets out to investigate, and he will find out disturbing information about his own father and his mother (view spoiler)[that will set him off running away from home. (hide spoiler)]This would have been a five stars for originality. However, the middle of the book becomes far too bogged down with trivial details. These details were interesting at the beginning, but need not have been padded out so much once we understood who Christopher is. For instance, did we really need a whole chapter on orang-utans, or long passages about the advertising on the underground? I think not. Whilst I sympathised with the difficulties faced by his parents, I also found their constant complaining and short temper, difficult to stomach. A solid four stars.

Christopher has set out to work out who killed the neighbour’s dog Wellington. While I don’t claim to understand anything about autism, I was a little jealous at how logically and well Christopher thought. While Christopher is out playing detective trying to solve the murder of Wellington, he is writing this book to recount his adventures. His adventures lead him to discover a much bigger mystery that he needs to solve as well. Like most decent mysteries, Mark Haddon wastes no time to get into the thick of the action; the very first page sees the dog impaled by the gardening fork. Unlike normal young detective novels (Nancy Drew and The Hardy Boys), this is more of a nod to the Sherlock Holmes novels with the gruesome crime and the way Christopher thinks. The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time is written the way that Christopher would write it. Even the chapter numbers show is love of maths; the book starts at chapter 2 and only uses the prime numbers all the way up to chapter 233. This book is a very interesting read, not only is it a very enjoyable mystery, but it also gives you a little insight into the mind of an autistic boy.

183,1397034259,09/20/2015,5.0,"“And That Means I Can Do Anything”Cathartic Realism in the end of the curious incident of the dog in the night-timeThe juvenile narrator of the curious incident of the dog in the night-time (hereafter the dog), Christopher Boone, can be analyzed as a tragic hero who completes a quest. The novel ends with the haunting claim by Christopher that he will achieve his dreams and be exactly what he envisions himself to become, a scientist. Christopher lacks a full sense of self-awareness. He believes his dreams will succeed because he completed his ‘quest’. Christopher believes he showed success and capability in going to London on his own, solving the mystery of who killed Wellington, found his mother, was brave, and wrote a book. Due to his self-perceived success, Christopher concludes ‘that means I can do anything.’The ending of this story is intentionally meant to give the reader pause. Christopher himself, being not fully aware of emotions, cannot experience full catharsis as a tragic hero. However, the artistic genius of the dog is the author’s ability to let the narrator present a voice to the reader which does not make conclusions or tell the reader what to think, thus leaving the reader to analyze the narrator internally. The reader must contrast Christopher’s optimistic self-assessment to realism. Christopher cannot do anything and everything he could envision. His trip to London was not a success. Police were looking for him, and at any moment he anxiously gripped a knife handle, unable to serenely handle the human atmosphere around him. In solving who killed Wellington, he isolated his father as a liar and refused to grow past that one fault to allow a successful relationship. Christopher found his mother, ruined her current relationship, and forced her back into a life style she purposefully escaped. He was brave, in a sense, but was incapable of enduring the stress of high human interaction in the subway. He views his quest as a success and a sign of growth, but to an astute reader, his quest is seen as a series of near tragedies and life altering chaos for his parents. In Christopher’s self-acclaimed success and claim that he can do anything, the reader should see the subtle, but climatic emphasis of the author’s purpose in writing the text: humans are not capable of anything and everything; thus, to show true empathy and emotional connection, we need to acknowledge the difficulty in living with limits on our potential. As the sister of a brother born with a terminal disease and enrolled in special education, I empathize with Christopher’s family. My brother Dustin, a beautiful blessing, had mytonic dystrophy and could not accurately claim he could do anything he wanted, in part because he was not physically or mentally capable of speech. My parents, like Christopher’s, put commendable amounts of effort and energy into caring for my brother. Along with that energy, came occasional stress and frustration. The catharsis at the end of the dog is not about Christopher’s personal growth; in fact, he changes very little in course of the novel. However, the catharsis rests in the reader, who experiences an emotional cleansing of realism, acknowledging that not everything is possible for everyone and moving forward from that realization to accept that it is neither fair nor correct to expect everyone to be the same, to be capable of all their dreams, or expect that living with limits is easy on any one individual or their family. We are not fantastical knights in a story who all complete fairy-tale like quests and succeed in our goals. Life has real limits, challenges, and risks. Christopher was brave, but in his daring, he encountered a world that was not ready for him, and that he was not ready for. His mother could not handle the challenge of raising him and abandoned her family. His father loved him dearly, but after one lie Christopher could not fathom living with the instability not being able to believe everything his father said and refused the help of his most consistent caretaker. The answer to life’s challenges is not always success. However, I believe Mark Haddon, in his tragic ending that the narrator views as a success, wants to encourage empathy for those with challenges and their families in acknowledging that the path is not easy and that there is no clear ending where the struggle stops and that no one is capable of everything.

184,3461678,07/24/2007,4.0,"The great think about Curious Incident isn't that it is a mystery story about a boy with Asperger's Syndrome, it's that Mark Haddon does such a great job of reinventing the mystery formula. Let's face it, the Sherlock Holmes stories (which play a pretty prominent role in the novel's construction) are the benchmark by which a lot of detective narratives are mentioned. But they're pretty formulaic, especially in terms of character: Sherlock Holmes is a genius and Watson is a sidekick; Sherlock Holmes is a thinking machine and Watson takes dictation; Sherlock Holmes knows your darkest secrets from looking at your shoes and Watson can't even remember where he was wounded (his arm? His leg?). Doyle needed that structure--he had to have a straight man for his great detective; one who could palm the ace so that the readers could enjoy the pleasure of being told how the crime was committed (as opposed to the pleasure of figuring it out for themselves). After all, Watson always knows the who, what, where, and when, but he's very careful to keep it hidden from the reader by reporting himself as a (let's be honest) bumbling. Who else but a John (or was it James?) H. Watson would be willing to represent himself as perpetually awestruck?Even though Holmes and Watson perpetually haunt Curious Incident, their roles have been radically rewritten. There's no need for a crime-fighting duo here (a puzzle master and his biographer, the brain and the brawn, or the machine and the lover). Christopher fulfills both those positions and in doing so, repeatedly hides the ""whodunit"" not from the reader, but from himself. It is this recurring dramatic irony--the reader watching Christopher struggle in coming to grips with the fact that deductive logic alone is not enough in crime solving--that makes the book effective in so many ways. For starters, Haddon is engaging with precisely those qualities that made Sherlock Holmes a literary celebrity. If Holmes truly is a thinking machine, how effective can he really be? When taken to the extreme, isn't Holmes simply Christopher? Or, alternatively, Christopher is what Holmes would be if he were removed from a fictional world in which people can be read like texts, soil can be identified on sight, and monographs can be produced on 140 varieties of tobacco ash. Christopher's world, in other words, simply doesn't measure up to the categories Holmes produces for people. After all, what is a detective to do when deductive analysis cannot filter out motivations for utterly irrational behavior?",13,0.9682,0.059,0.823,0.118,0.6286064425770309,POSITIVE,0.9842
185,1949120077,04/05/2017,4.0,"Why do you read fiction? I read for several reasons, but largely to understand, especially to understand people who are different from me – people who see the world differently, who have gone through things outside my experience.Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time , by Mark Haddon, is a quirky little book that offers me that. Curious Incident is told in first person by Christopher, a mathematically-gifted and autistic 15-year-old who finds a murdered dog. Many of us have difficulty understanding people diagnosed with autism, people who often seem to do things ""for no reason."" In Curious Incident, we hear these reason(s). When questioned by a policeman, for example, Christopher observed: He was asking too many questions and he was asking them too quickly. They were stacking up in my head like loaves in the factory where Uncle Terry works. The factory is a bakery and he operates the slicing machines. And sometimes a slicer is not working fast enough but the bread keeps coming and there is a blockage. I sometimes think of my mind as a machine, but not always as a bread-slicing machine. It makes it easier to explain to other people what is going on inside it. (p. 7)He makes sense, right? Christopher does all sorts of ""crazy"" things throughout the book, all making sense when we hear his perspective on the world. His voice is interesting, honest, and engaging, often making me laugh.While this is a lesser part of the story, Christopher's parents struggle in parenting him and often make mistakes. Those of us who've ever parented know that parenting can be a no-win situation – at least at the time. Parenting well is even more difficult for parents of children on the spectrum, as his father discovers. His parents err, sometimes seriously, but try to get back on track.Christopher's story is often about courage: his parents', yes, but more importantly, his own. And because I've been thinking about PBS and Sesame Street, I'll leave you with this segment with Itzhak Perlman.

I especially liked the way Haddon presented the story by portraying Chris as someone who just has a different world-view than most others, and not in anyway stigmatizing or labelling him as an autistic savant or an asperger's guy or the like. The publishers and the media like labelling it so but that's a different story. The story's appeal wouldn't've been complete without Ed Boone, Chris's father.

Christopher’s observations about the people around him and the conversations he has reminded me of what I really enjoyed about Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine. Little that he says is untrue, yet it’s through such a different lens than what a person without autism experiences, believes, or notices. It’s comical at times and a bit sad at others. I enjoyed the discussion he had about math throughout the book and how this is one thing that seems to comfort him. The ending was a bit overdone.

That's honestly the only reason to read this book. a special function of literature is exposing us to different experiences and perspectives. you are fully immersed into the mind of a ""autistic"" boy. If this is a authentic representation of a persons thought process with autism (and I have no reason to think otherwise) it is worth reading. there is a bit of a Agathean/Sherlock mystery here. but a more interesting personal family drama lays underneath. If personal dramas are your thing than take a look at this one if no other reason than it's told in a unique voice. The narrative was a little frustrating at times.

209,2317302301,03/05/2018,4.0,"I agree with Christopher—this book’s brilliant narrator—about three things:1. Dogs are important.2. Blue Planet is one of the best TV shows.3. Anybody who touches me deserves to be punched.“I like dogs. You always know what a dog is thinking. It has four moods. Happy, sad, cross and concentrating. Also, dogs are faithful and they do not tell lies because they cannot talk.” – The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-TimeFifteen-year-old Christopher has been blessed and cursed with an unusual brain. He’s a genus who can solve complex math problems and remember entire conversations word-for-word. But, he’s unable to relate to other people. He doesn’t understand jokes or facial expressions, and he dreams of a world where he’s the only human alive. Animals are much easier for him to befriend. When the neighbor’s poodle is mysteriously stabbed to death in the middle of the night, Christopher is devastated. He sets out to uncover what happened to the dog. Along the way, he unearths secrets buried in his father’s past and learns what really happened on the day his mother died.People have been recommending this book to me for about a decade. I remember when it first came out. It was everywhere. It was on all the award lists. If you walked past an airport bookstore, you just saw a solid wall of violently orange poodle books. I didn’t read the book back then because I’m a contrary creature. If everybody is doing something, I have to do the opposite. I refused to read it until the hype was deader than the poodle on the cover.And . . . all the recommenders were correct. I loved this book. I should have read it 10+ years ago. The author never reveals what makes Christopher’s brain different, but he does an excellent job of showing Christopher’s differences. Chris is a believable character with a unique voice and an odd way of seeing the world. The story sometimes goes on random tangents because Christopher’s definition of “important information” is different than the reader’s. The math-related tangents were baffling to me, but I never found them annoying. They fit perfectly with the character’s personality. He’s a peculiar person who really, really likes math.“All the other children at my school are stupid. Except I'm not meant to call them stupid, even though this is what they are.” – The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-TimeMy favorite part of the story is the conversations that Christopher has with his father. I felt bad for laughing, but some of them are hilarious. It must suck to parent a kid who can find loopholes in all your rules and repeat your exact words back to you days after you said them. Christopher would be an endlessly frustrating child.Normally I’d never put the last sentence of a book in a review (because spoilers!), but this line is too important not to share:“And I know I can do this because I went to London on my own, and because I solved the mystery . . . and I was brave and I wrote a book and that means I can do anything.” – The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time This novel shows that we all have different abilities. Christopher is capable of writing books and passing difficult math tests, but taking a train to London is nearly impossible for him. I, on the other hand, have wasted a lot of my life on public transportation. I could probably figure out how to get to London. Can I figure out how to write a book or get an A on a math test? Nope. I barely passed math in school. I was a solid C- student.For Christopher, going to London was the hardest thing in the world. Now that he’s done it, he feels like he can accomplish anything. It’s an uplifting end to the story.As much as I like seeing Christopher overcome his fear, I think the last third of the book is tedious. Watching someone ride a train isn’t interesting. The train journey dragged on and on and on. I just wanted Christopher to get to London and finish solving the mystery.Speaking of the mystery, I didn’t guess who killed the dog. I always love a twist that I don’t see coming. The mystery kept me motivated to push through the overly long train ride section of the book. Christopher’s unique way of seeing the world and the mystery made this novel worth reading for me.TL;DR: Tedious at times, but the unusual narrator and compelling mystery make up for it. Don’t wait 10+ years to read this book. ",12,0.9941,0.076,0.778,0.146,0.5487012987012989,POSITIVE,0.9986
210,84322806,01/10/2010,1.0,"This book is seriously over-rated. It is not in my top 80%, so I gave it 1 star. It is a marketing triumph, but a literary catastrophe.It's incredibly disheartening for any aspiring author to see such a badly written book achieve so much success, while so many very good books and authors will never achieve the success they deserve. It's books like this which put me off wanting to be a writer. It seems that knowing how to build hype counts for so much more than being able to write well.I was racking my brain, trying to remember a book I could give 1 star to. To add credibility to my good ratings, I ought to give low ratings. If the lowest rating I gave was 3 stars, then I'd be limiting myself to a 3-star system (3 stars being for the worst books, 5 for the best). Further, I believe I should give out my ratings in equal measure. Thus, 20% of my ratings should be 1 star, difficult as it is to hate a book that much and yet read it. It's also difficult to 1-star a book, for fear of upsetting the author. At least they tried. Bless 'em. 2 stars for effort, at the very least. But that would limit me to a 4-star system. I've been given 5 options, so I will use them.You might say you love this book, and be bewildered by the thought that anybody could give it 1 star. I think it's outrageous that anyone can give it 5 stars. 4, I can accept. But 5 is silly. Did you give it 5 stars because everybody else did? People get hurt that way. Did I give it 1 star, in order to undo some of the damage done by the 5-starrers? Possibly. If this was an obscure book that virtually nobody knew about I would be more inclined to give it a higher rating. As it is, our expectation of this book was elevated by all the hype and praise. Could I give it 2 stars if it was obscure? I like to believe that I would say 'no'. Am I worried about upsetting this author? Not really. His ego has been massaged enough by all the ludicrous 5-star reviews. He needs somebody like me to bring him back down to Earth. I am good for him! He needs to be shown the error of his ways so that he doesn't make the same mistake again.It frustrates me that the author could achieve so much success with something so pants. Big brown pants. Why do I hate it? Hmm. I found myself in somebody's car one day, on a longish trip. I found this book on the back seat and, for want of something to speed the journey along, I began reading it. When else would you persist with a rubbish book? I could not allow myself to review-and-rate a book that I had not read at all, and normally I would not continue to read a book I was hating. Although, I do usually intend to finish books after I begin reading them. Except this time. Long before the journey had ended I had closed the book with the words ""that's quite enough of that"". Truth be told, when I began it I thought: ""ah, this is interesting and new - I've not read a book like this before"". I stopped at about chapter 101. About half way through, I think. The novelty had worn off and I was bored. I decided that looking out of the car window was a better use of my time.I recall that the chapters were very short. This tactic encourages readers to 'just read one more chapter'. But I didn't need to read any more. I was done. And I have no interest in ever going back to it. Who knows, maybe it gets good in the second half. I'll never know. I care not for the protagonist, and I think I had partly worked out what was going to happen anyway.When this book was at the peak of its fame, people knew about it because of its gimmick: The story is told by an autistic boy who only uses prime numbers when numbering the chapters. That gets old quickly, and you're left with a very repetitive narrative. Some people have said that it doesn't represent autism properly (but others have said that it does). I think I remember thinking that it wasn't quite right. However, at the time I thought I was mildly autistic. It turns out I just have self-diagnosed OCD. So, I don't know how good the autism is. But the book is successful because of the autism. I'm sure that somebody can do a much better job of writing a story from an autistic angle. However, anybody that tries will be accused of being unoriginal. So this will forever remain the autism book. What a shame.",12,0.6012,0.124,0.756,0.12,0.4558178655438929,NEGATIVE,1.0
211,2129414791,09/10/2019,3.0,"Two years ago I had to research Asperger's syndrome, with this book I actually lived it. The details are amazing, the story is beautiful. I loved the chapter below:People believe in God because the world is very complicated and they think it is very unlikely that anything as complicated as a flying squirrel or the human eye or a brain could happen by chance. But they should think logically and if they thought logically they would see that they can only ask this question because it has already happened and they exist. And there are billions of planets where there is no life, but there is no one on those planets with brains to notice. And it is like if everyone in the world was tossing coins eventually someone would get 5,698 heads in a row and they would think they were very special. But they wouldn’t be because there would be millions of people who didn’t get 5,698 heads.And there is life on earth because of an accident. But it is a very special kind of accident. And for this accident to happen in this special way, there have to be 3 conditions. And these are:Things have to make copies of themselves (this is called Replication)They have to make small mistakes when they do this (this is called Mutation)These mistakes have to be the same in their copies (this is called Heritability)And these conditions are very rare, but they are possible, and they cause life. And it just happens. But it doesn’t have to end up with rhinoceroses and human beings and whales. It could end up with anything.And, for example, some people say how can an eye happen by accident? Because an eye has to evolve from something else very like an eye and it doesn’t just happen because of a genetic mistake, and what is the use of half an eye? But half an eye is very useful because half an eye means that an animal can see half of an animal that wants to eat it and get out of the way, and it will eat the animal that only has a third of an eye or 49% of an eye instead because it hasn’t got out of the way quick enough, and the animal that is eaten won’t have babies because it is dead. And 1% of an eye is better than no eye.And people who believe in God think God has put human beings on the earth because they think human beings are the best animal, but human beings are just an animal and they will evolve into another animal, and that animal will be cleverer and it will put human beings into a zoo, like we put chimpanzees and gorillas into a zoo. Or human beings will all catch a disease and die out or they will make too much pollution and kill themselves, and then there will only be insects in the world and they will be the best animal.",12,0.803,0.09,0.801,0.108,0.4499716553287983,POSITIVE,0.6935

213,159106538,04/05/2011,4.0,"As you probably already know, this book is notable for being the first-person narrative of the life of an autistic boy: he starts out trying to investigate the murder of a neighbor's dog, and winds up in the middle of a family crisis. The protagonist, Christopher, also inserts into the text a variety of things that interest him: math and logic problems, discussion of space and astronauts, and so on. The most interesting thing about this book is its unique point-of-view. While Christopher certainly can't be taken to represent everyone with autism, it's still interesting to read his thought processes and learn about how he sees the world. But beyond that, what I admired most about this book was its honest portrayal of how having a child with special needs affects a family. Haddon doesn't sugercoat it; this isn't one of those works that portrays special-needs children as a constant joy to everyone around them. It seems that a lot of reviewers despise Christopher's parents, but I see where the parents are coming from--I can't imagine living with him day in and day out for years on end--and I was pleased to see the author take a more realistic and sympathetic look at the family. Beyond that, I don't have a whole lot to say about this book. The plot and prose style are both quite simple, but that fits the story and the narrator. The most problematic thing for me was that Christopher shows no empathy for others; not only does he not understand emotions, he doesn't seem to care, and he doesn't seem to be attached to anyone around him. That may be realistic, but it makes for a very cold character. At any rate, this book didn't inspire any particular passion in me, and I'm not entirely sure why it's as popular as it is, but it was a quick read and I found it to be worthwhile.

214,1746591346,09/02/2016,4.0,"A favorite quote about autism is, “If you’ve met one person with autism, you’ve met one person with autism.” And indeed it is impossible to generalize to the larger group from one individual. My sister and brother-in-law's two sons (almost 22 and 18) have both exhibited 'autistic' behaviors since their earliest years and yet they are as different as can be, all the more so in how they are autistic. My older nephew, E, is a highly functioning 'Aspie', as those with Aspergers are sometimes called, and my younger nephew, L, is much more profoundly autistic—preferring his own world. In the curious incident of the dog in the night-time Christopher clearly exhibits autistic tendencies but the author, Mark Haddon, never has anyone refer to Christopher by this label, something my sister and I really appreciated. Even better were all the attempts by individuals to meet Christopher where he was. He didn't like to be touched, hugged or kissed. so his parents found a hand signal to say, “I love you.” He excelled at math and puzzles, so these skills were encouraged and cultivated, in the short-term as a means of stress-relief and for his long-term career goals. Christopher endeared himself to me right off the bat with his fearless concern for the dog in the incident. He continued to maintain this compassion throughout. As the narrator of the story, we get to see inside his head and author, Haddon, does a fair job of portraying what a teenage savant might be thinking. Sometimes I think he made Christopher a little too sophisticated and I didn't find his atheism believable but aside from those two quirks, it seemed favorably representative of one autistic young man.All in all a good book, whether or not you know anyone like Christopher.

The note at the beginning states that Haddon has worked with autistic individuals for a number of years, so I get the impression that this was his attempt to show just a tiny bit of the world he's been so involved in, THEIR world, so we can have just a little bit of understanding.

4.5 all-smiles stars! 
Warning: I haven't bothered to look in for spoilers, but I'd recommend not to proceed if you haven't read the book. In the vast expanse constituting all libraries, bookshops and book-dwelling places in the universe, the variation one encounters is stupendous. There are books which seize you and hold you at the tittering edge. There are books which make you gasp in horror. There are books which stir in you a feeling of rebellion and books which concern daily musings of life, easy to relate to. Then there are books which fill you with warmth infinite, which make you smile because they are simply naive, unscathed. Mark Haddon's book is such a creation. Written from the perspective of an autistic child, it makes you wonder things that are evident and often missed by the occasional human eye. It makes you ponder about the thinking trajectories of children like Christopher, and marvel at how differently they react to everyday situations.I've met with characters showing similar features like that of Christopher. There was Don Tillman from The Rosie Project (though he wasn't at such an extremity as Christopher) and Colton from Puddle Jumping. They are wired in an entirely different way. Speaking of Christopher, socializing is not something he is capable of. In a crowd, he panics and has his own defense mechanisms. The way Haddon describes them, reasons them out is applaudable. One example is when he talks of closing his eyes and blocking all the noise because so much of information ticks his brain off and he can't cope with it. He tries doing mathematical equations to test himself and finds that his brain functions less efficiently than normal in such situations. This has been expressed with such clarity, I could almost visualise the working of his system. Also the need for a closed space away from people as an escape route adds to this behaviour.I loved how observant Christopher was. More or less, his keen interest in detective novels helpes him sharpen his already smart skills, an indirect way of saying how books shape us. His love for animals made me love him instantly. Such an innocent little heart, oblivious to the cruelty in the world, unaffected by emotions. I'm not telling life is easy being Christopher, no. But there are always going to be things you can look ahead for and be glad about, even when at a disadvantage from the mass. Another wonderful demonstration in this book is how people react to children like him. We see Christopher's mother who feels incapacitated when handling him. We see Mrs. Shears negated reaction to moving in with them, despite of the fact that she had been real sympathetic after his mother left them. We've Siobhan, always understanding, helpful and sympathetic. And Christopher's dad who doesn't let his disability ever question his love for his son. And I don't blame anyone because it's never easy dealing with a child who stays closed up all day long, who is so detached from emotions, something that governs the human race, that it all appears like a rare puzzle to them. However, I am conflicted about Christopher's father. Never can I forgive him for what he did to Wellington. I don't care whatever he reasons it with and I'll always call him a heinous human being. The only thing which doesn't make me hate him completely is his role as a father. His patience with Christopher is laudable, even in the thick of all matters. It's not easy raising a child all by yourself, especially someone as difficult as Christopher and he never, for once, gave up on it. He fought for Christopher pursuing his Maths A Level exams, knowing his knack for it. He understood his child at levels no one else did, not even his mother.So okay, but not very okay. Not in my books.Glitches, there weren't many. The book dragged a bit around the middle half. The fact that Christopher really arrived at his mom's place in London was a bit far-fetched, I guess. I never really expected him to reach there, and it came as a surprise when he actually did. Also the spelling errors in the letters- I know they were intentional, but they weren't very important to add to the authentic nature of the book. That's again the obsessive me speaking, but, bite me, I cannot help.Overall a very well written book. Go for it if you are looking for a story from a fresh perspective. 4.5 stars in all.

232,2760761415,03/23/2019,5.0,"This book was exactly what I needed right now. It's the story of an autistic teenage boy named Christopher, asking what he thinks is a simple question, ""Who killed my neighbor's dog?"" The not-so-simple answer takes Christopher to places (both literal and figurative) he never wanted to go; but Christopher is braver than everyone thinks he is, and proves himself equal to the challenge. It's a journey of self-discovery and compassion and courage and it made me tear up just a wee bit at the end. Reading a book told entirely from an autistic person's POV was a fascinating experience. (I should pause to say that Christopher of course isn't meant as a cookie-cutter representation of people on the spectrum, so not everything he does will match every other autistic person. But I will say, without going into specifics . . . it did ring true to what I know & have seen in my personal life.) Emotionally speaking, the book is bare-bones to the extreme. Christopher has emotions and is not shy about asserting them, but on the other hand, he won't spend any time describing or analyzing them. ""I am sad."" ""I am happy."" That's it. You have to piece together the how & why, from context clues. A lot of reviews of The Curious Incident complain the book is ""boring,"" because Christopher constantly pauses the narrative to talk about science & math, in ways that seem unrelated to the action. And those reviews are not wrong. From most people's point of view, those detours ARE boring. But guys . . . THAT'S LITERALLY HOW THE KID PROCESSES HIS EXPERIENCES. By relating them back to science and math. If you pay attention--if you make yourself listen instead of dismissing it as ""dull""--you'll find he is telling you how he feels, just in a language that he can understand and you can't necessarily. There's always a connection. You might have to work to spot it, but it's there. And it Has Value. [Also, please, please, PLEASE, if you have an autistic child in your life, LET THEM TALK TO YOU. Let them tell you about the things they care about. They need you to listen. I promise, you won't regret it.] [I did not realize writing this review would make me so emotional. Welp.] Theme-wise, and tone-wise, The Curious Incident follows one of my favorite patterns: it starts out very bleak, becomes even bleaker in the middle, then gradually builds toward a quiet hopefulness at the end. Because Christopher's life IS pretty bleak. His mom is dead, his dad is . . . Of Doubtful Character *coughs*, he has no friends, and a lot of people laugh at him while he tries to navigate a world which wasn't designed for people like him. Moreover, Christopher really struggles to find the bits of light & hopefulness in his situation, precisely because his autism makes it so tough for him to interpret other's motives so sometimes he's terrified of even people who mean WELL. And conversely, when other people [no spoilers] screw up and make hurtful choices, it impacts him even harder because he can't understand/imagine why they would ever do such a thing. It's super easy for him to perceive flawed human beings as Utter Monsters, in other words. Which is absolutely understandable. And not his fault. And I'm not even saying his perspective is ""wrong."" But that makes for a very terror-filled existence, you know? But . . . . . . it also makes Christopher's ultimate triumph over his fears that much more powerful. Which is why I cried. And why I gave it five stars. And why you should read it.",11,0.9971,0.069,0.763,0.168,0.556620879120879,POSITIVE,0.998
233,1293267223,05/29/2015,5.0,"Maybe some people think this isn't an accurate representation of Asperger's syndrome. Maybe some people think this is a pretentious piece of garbage. All I know is that this may have been the most moving, emotion-shattering book I've ever read. The only one that might compare is Out of My Mind, which is about a girl with cerebral palsy, but who's brain is highly functional and incredibly intelligent. I've never really understood what autism is. When my younger brother was about four years old, my parents thought that he might have autism because all he would do was suck his thumb and stare out of the window at cars. But that was just a stage he went through, and I only vaguely remember it at all. So the whole world of autism, and how it affects people, was unknown to me. Now, I'm not sure if this book was a wonderful example of it, but it sure felt like it. You get plunged right into the mind of this crazy-intelligent boy, and it's really fascinating to see how he sees things, and what problems in the world face him. But be warned: this book will fucking play with your MIND. I'm still in shock from finishing it. By the way, it's probably even worse if you read it all in one sitting, like I did, because then the full-on force of the insanity gets your mind going. It also doesn't help if you're alone, in your room, with soft music and a fan blowing, and you haven't seen anyone for the better part of two hours. Then you start feeling really strange. Another precaution is that you will cry. And cry, and cry, and CRY. You will cry about Christopher. You will cry about his parents. You will cry about that poor dog. You will cry about the people who try to help him. You will cry as you read about his incredibly tormenting trip to London, by himself, being chased by his father and policemen. BE PREPARED TO SHED TEARS OF IMMENSE SIZE AND QUANTITY.However, just because it's an emotional roller coaster, doesn't mean you won't enjoy it. And please, for God's sake, don't fear it because it's one of those 'medical' books. There could be nothing farther from what you're most likely imagining. If I'm honest, I didn't even know it was about autism. I'd just heard a lot about it, and not wanting to read more of my boring Russian nonfiction, I picked it up for a quick read. And I can truly say that I have never been more rewarded from an innocent book pickup.",11,-0.991,0.178,0.717,0.106,0.6070339845339845,NEGATIVE,0.9841
234,1863995366,11/21/2017,4.0,"After reading almost a quarter of the novel, I started to realize that the novel isn't really about the curious incident of the dog in the night-time. It's more about the psychological advancement of a 15 years old boy which has been suffering from a high functioning autism. Christopher Boone sees the world simply with plain logical explanations and mathematical probabilities. He lives with his father with the belief that his mother has died in a heart attack. Christopher's routine-bound life takes a drastic change when he discovers a neighbour's dog's dead body. With a view to solve the mystery Christopher finds himself surrounded by the dirty things in the world. Now Christopher has to break out from his inner circle and change his life forever.What I loved about the novel is its theme and plot. I even loved the title. The title shows exactly how Christopher would name his mystery novel. It's so much interesting how even the title gives an insight into Christopher's personality. What I didn't like is that often the narrative gets a bit boring. Also there are too many mathematical equations which were definitely necessary for the novel but made me baffled anyway. Another thing I didn't like is that I couldn't find any logical explanation of how Christopher did whatever he did. It's true that he needs to get out of his circle but suddenly he's traveling all alone to London,finding his mother, then returning home again and ace his mathematics course. Looks a bit simple now that I have written it in a few words but in the novel it's just way too much dramatic. Still, it's a good novel and makes us appreciate the simplicity of the outlook. I kind of want to wish all the best to Christopher. Well, best wishes Christopher and hope that you get everything the way you prefer.",11,0.9908,0.057,0.762,0.181,0.460583717357911,NEGATIVE,0.8759
235,64922583,07/25/2009,4.0,"I've been meaning to read this book for a while. I was curious about it, since I've known quite a few people with Asperger's Syndrome, and since my mum is a psychiatrist and it's one of the things we've discussed and that she's explained to me. As far as I remember, Mark Haddon himself isn't autistic, so I wouldn't read it as if every bit of it was gospel truth. People with autism think differently to people who don't have autism, and it's hard to imagine a way of thinking other than your own.From what I know, though, Mark Haddon did a reasonable job. The prose is matter-of-fact, a little stilted, and there are various stylistic nods to what it's trying to pass itself off as -- the chapters are numbered with primes, not the normal sequence of numbers, there's a lot of diagrams and footnotes and exact numbers, etc. I really believed in the character of Christopher -- although I kept picturing him as younger than he really was, I guess that was intentional: he certainly acts like a reasonably young boy. The things he does seem to me to be consistent with some of the things I've read about autism, and the way he sees the world and the way he finds other people incomprehensible is interesting.The actual plot... I could just about believe everything but the actual fact of the dog killed with a fork! It didn't really seem to fit with the rest of it, yet it was really so important for the plot. Oh well.

Throughout the story, you like, then hate, then like again different characters, but with Christopher the feelings are different: his life, and what he goes through, is so heartbreaking in some aspects, that there's no way someone could hate him. What I felt, mainly, was compassion. It's sad to see how people can treat ""Special Needs"", as Christopher refers to ""people like him"". But I believe that was the point of the whole novel. Lies, laughs, more lies and even cruelty are completely ignored by hopeful Christopher, whose main worry is to find out the truth about the curious incident of the dog in the night-time. And getting a grade A in his Math A levels. And get to be an astronaut.I can absolutely recommend this book, especially considering that it's an exceptionally good read for every age.

The mystery of who killed a dog, shown through the eyes of a 15-year-old autistic boy, was more intriguing and entertaining than most of today's generic amateur sleuth mysteries. Written in an easy to read format with helpful diagrams, this book appeared to be an interesting tale that could perhaps shine a little light on the thought processes of autistic teenagers.About halfway through the book, the dog's murderer confesses and the entire focus of the story shifted. Instead of a mystery, it became a rambling tale of running away from home. It went from engrossing to dull in the turn of a page. With the story switching gears so unexpectedly, it felt as though the book was in fact two separate stories (featuring common characters) pasted together to create a book. It felt off, like something just wasn't fitting properly.The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time's quirky uniqueness didn't translate through the second half of the book.

I won't reveal any more than that, though I will warn my religious friends that the hyper-logical Christopher seems to be the work of a stridently atheistic author. Even still, he's a well-drawn and likable character who gets himself into some entertaining scrapes. The book is intended for a teenage audience, but adults will like it, too.

It's not a book I would have chosen since it doesn't have the usual inspector/detective character. I was mistaken. Christopher Boone was just another sort of detective/sleuth. Christopher has Asperger's Syndrome a form of autism. Although his health issues cause many misunderstandings, he does excel in solving puzzles. One puzzle he is trying to solve is who killed a neighbor's dog. While he attempts to find an answer to this incident there are goings-on inside his home between his parents. His orderly life has been replaced by chaos and that's something he finds unacceptable. I loved this story and the main character. Jeff Woodman was excellent in bringing to life Christopher with all his complexities. This was truly a heartwarming story of courage. Highly recommended.

257,24625518,06/16/2008,2.0,"""The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,"" by author Mark Haddon, is the story of Christopher John Francis Boone, a fifteen-year-old boy who discovers his neighbor's dog dead and sets about to solve the mystery of who killed it, making many other discoveries along the way. In this book, readers are treated to a unique voice, not only in literature, but in life, as Christopher is developmentally disabled. He doesn't like other people and he doesn't like being touched; as a result, when confused or angry, he often screams, groans, or physically attacks others. In giving Christopher a voice, Haddon succeeds in making us identify with his protagonist for his similiarities, but not for his differences, and ultimately fails to recognize what makes Christopher special. By allowing Christopher to tell his own story, Haddon shows us that Christopher isn't really all that different from the rest of us, despite his disability. While outsiders deride Christopher as ""special needs"" and an ""elf,"" because we are allowed inside Christopher's mind, we can see that he is not a freak. In describing one of his episodes where he loses control, Christopher says, ""I felt giddy. It was like the room was swinging from side to side, as if it was at the top of a really tall building and the building was swinging backward and forward in a strong wind . . . I rolled onto the bed and curled up in a ball."" Hearing about Christopher's outbursts in his own voice, we feel compassion for his experience instead of fear. While obviously he is different from us - he can multiply 251 by 864 in his head, he counts prime numbers when he is upset, and he lacks imagination - he is also similar. Like us, Christopher feels happiness and sadness. He is happy when he can pretend he is the only person in the whole world and sad when he finds the dead dog. Also, Christopher, like the rest of us, has dreams: he is going to pass his A-levels, take more A-levels, go to the university, and become an astronaut. In fact, by the end of the book, after he has passed his A-levels, made plans to take further A-levels, and finished his book about who has killed his neighbor's dog, he knows he ""can do anything."" Like the rest of us, Christopher has dreams, and his determination to make his dreams come true makes him a character that we cannot only identify with but also root for. Unfortunately, though, in highlighting Christopher's similarities, Haddon never recognizes Christopher for his differences. When he acts out, his mom and dad both hit him, and when he is mocked by his father's friend, his father - his primary caregiver, the one who cooks his meals, cleans his clothes, and looks after him - doesn't even defend his own son: ""I don't like it when Rhodri laughs at me. Rhodri laughs at me a lot. Father says it is being friendly."" In fact, at one point, his own father mocks him, asking him, ""How stupid are you?"" Even worse, though, is the treatment of other students at Christopher's school. While we are supposed to object when Christopher is mocked as ""special needs"" and a freak, Christopher treats his own schoolmates with similar contempt, particularly Joseph Fleming, who ""eats everything,"" including ""one of the little blocks of blue disinfectant which hang inside the toilets,"" ""a 50 pound note from his mother's wallet,"" ""string and rubber bands and tissues and writing paper and paints and plastic forks,"" and also ""bangs his chin and screams a lot."" Just as Christopher is shunned when he is out in public, Christopher himself shuns Joseph. Christopher sets himself as different not only from this boy but his entire school, as he says, ""All the other children at my school are stupid."" He is not like them, he is not stupid, because he is going to pass his A-levels, which in fact he succeeds at doing. Christopher becomes acceptable, then, because he is not a Joseph Fleming; he is more like ""one of us,"" so we can find him tolerable. He can communicate with us and he is not stupid. We admire him in spite of his differences, not because of them, and in the process we fail to recognize Christopher for what makes him truly special. In giving Christopher a voice, Haddon succeeds in making us identify with his protagonist for his similiarities, but not for his differences, and ultimately fails to recognize what makes Christopher special. Because we are able to get inside Christopher's head, he does not seem so different from us; he is someone who can, to some extent, communicate with us, and someone we can learn from. But what about other mentally disabled people whose voices we don't have access to, like Joseph Fleming's? Is it ok for us to shun them? In the classic book, ""Flowers for Algernon,"" we come to like the disabled protagonist, Charley Gordon, not because he is similar to us, but because he is different. His differences are what make him special, and when he loses these differences, his character becomes almost unlikeable. In the ""Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,"" however, we come to identify with Christopher because we can see that he shares some of our qualities - he is good at math, or he likes dogs, or his parents are having problems - and we choose to ignore his differences. In truth, though, we probably shouldn't like Christopher for how he is one of us, but for his differences. In the end, a book like ""Flowers for Algernon"" makes a stronger point: we should not, as ""Curious Incident"" suggests, find the developmentally disabled tolerable because somewhere, somehow, they are like us, but instead we should recognize them for their differences, because that is what makes them special.

258,466545493,11/29/2012,3.0,"It suddenly hit me: postmodernism is kinda autistic literature. It mixes styles (literary, scientific, advertising, journalistic, etc.), it uses pictures and drawings to enforce ideas, it blurs the line between imaginary and reality, it gently parodies other literary works, it questions the reliability of the narrator… It is apparently so messed-up that it always amazes us how it seems to find its way in the end :).This is to explain why I don’t care much about the medical condition of the narrator, which provoked many a reaction from some readers that vehemently contested the accuracy of the hero's behaviour. Autistic spectrum disorder, Asperger’s Syndrome, whatever, why should I care whether Christopher’s disability falls into a certain medical category or not? The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is not a medical book, nor a guide for parents with autistic children, and shouldn’t be judged as one. The story is simply about a boy whose perception of the world is different from ours, and maybe the postmodern approach (intended as a joke) could be a key of lecture for a book that develops the alienation theme in a surprising and very modern way. An interesting question concerns the narrative voice: is Christopher a reliable or an unreliable narrator? (I had the same question about Benjy in The Sound and the Fury). Arguably, he reports whatever he sees and he sees almost everything (provided that he is not too scared) with the impartiality of a mirror. He does not interpret what he sees, like an ideal omniscient narrator, but unlike the latter, he does not see everything. The mirror is distorted, since he cannot interpret facial expressions, and stained, since there are lapses in time whenever he separates from the world (Benjy didn’t feel the time at all so his unreliability consisted also in the impossibility of establishing a timeline of the events).The world according to Christopher is different from ours: it is governed by order and rules to maintain this order and it is devoid of emotion. Lies, crowds, metaphors, touching disturb this order and upset him so no wonder his favorite dream is about an Earth inhabited only by him. This Little Prince understands better animals and numbers than humans and even the relationship with his family is superficial and emotionless. On the other hand, is he different from any other adolescent in search of independence who struggles to sever his family ties? And isn’t the world of the yesterday child as puzzling as it becomes for the adolescent Christopher? And his perpetual quest for order could not be interpreted as his way to cope with all disturbances he experiences, like violence towards animals, like disintegration of the family, like dangers in the street, like weird adult behavior? Let’s not forget that, as overwhelming as the world is, he succeeds in finding its secrets and restoring the order in the end. This is the beauty of the novel: for once, innocence is neither slaughtered, nor corrupted. The little prince may remain alone on his little planet, but whenever he chooses, he can visit other worlds, no harm done.",10,0.7686,0.093,0.797,0.11,0.4531904761904762,NEGATIVE,0.9618
259,2746363653,03/11/2019,5.0,"Fifteen-year old Christopher Boone loves mathematics, physics, order and mysteries. While he is very good in math, he has very little understand of human emotions. He doesn't want to be touched and he doesn't understand metaphors or similes; he doesn't like the colors yellow and brown; he bases the quality of the day on colors of cars he sees on the the street: 5 red cars in a row for a Super Good day, 4 red cars in a row for a Good Day, 3 red cars in a row for Quite Good Day and 4 yellow cars in a row for a Black Day. During Black Days, he refuses to eat food and doesn't talk to anyone. When he finds Mrs. Shears' dog killed in her backyard, he makes it his mission to find the killer. Using Sherlock Holmes as his inspiration he sets out to the neighborhood to solve the mystery. His adventure leads him to London and ultimately makes him come to terms with the turmoil that is his parents' marriage.Mark Haddon made a remarkable narrative using the voice of a fifteen-year old autistic boy who perceives the world differently. The effect is a clearer understanding of the mind that is often misconstrued by society. Here is an excerpt from the book that I find funny. While the joke might be funny or not to the readers, the hilarity comes not from the joke itself but the idea that Christopher believes that it is a good joke. There are three men on a train. One of them is an economist and one of them is a logician and one of them is a mathematician. And they have just crossed the border into Scotland (I don't know why they are going to Scotland) and they see a brown cow standing in a field from the window of the train (and the cow is standing parallel to the train).And the economist says, ""Look, the cows in Scotland are brown.""And the logician says, ""No. There are cows in Scotland of which one at least is brown.""And the mathematician says, ""No. There is at least one cow in Scotland, of which one side appears to be brown.""And it is funny because economists are not real scientists, and because logicians think more clearly but mathematicians are best. The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is equally poignant, funny and inspiring. Albeit being hilarious most of the time, it has so much to say for a short novel.

I had no idea about what to expect from this book, I even thought that it was a mystery (silly me!) but this book gave me way more than that, because this book is a full experience into the life of someone with Asperger’s Syndrome.Through the story, we see our main character Christopher dealing with his condition, we see how he sees the world, how he thinks, what scares him, how he reacts to certain things that we consider normal and we also see his parents and how hard it can get for them to take care of him. Even if Christopher has some really hard moments, you just can't help but sympathize and care about him, because the way he tells his story is really real and cute. He is a fan of Sherlock Holmes, he loves his pet rat deeply, he is a math genius, he has some ""love"" for prime numbers, and yet he is scared of the color yellow and brown.There is plenty of humor in this book but there is also plenty of realistic facts about the Asperger’s Syndrome and I think this makes this book so relatable and so powerful. Every single thing Christopher likes or dislikes makes 100% sense with his condition and it was amazing to get to know him and to gave him explain with simple words why he can't tell a lie, why he can't understand a joke, why is color yellow so horrible to him, why he loves math so much, why he thinks metaphors are stupid and waaaay more. 
“Prime numbers are what is left when you have taken all the patterns away. I think prime numbers are like life. They are very logical but you could never work out the rules, even if you spent all your time thinking about them.” 
I think the title of this book is brilliant, because at the end you understand why an incident with a dog traces back to him and his parents, and their actions and their fears and to why everything happened the way it did.

It actually may be the first year I will make my reading challenge since 2016 (yay!)Anyway, why you should read this book:- Educates about autism- Explores the other side of a dark disease- Has a murder mystery that keeps you at the edge of your seat- Has these neat little descriptions of concepts everyone should know- Drives home the point that autism, in itself, is a disease widely misunderstood, underrated, ignored and hated when it deserves none of those notionsI have to warn you that the main character is not likeable. The story's pace varies too, hence the three stars, rather than a generous four-star rating. Plus, the kid's parents ain't gold. BUT it makes up for that with what I would call a very honest commentary on how society views autism and how not trusting someone versus misunderstanding someone can be quite different things. Oh, and of course, a huge shoutout to Reader's Digest for making me want to read this book by featuring it in a very unusual way: an article that shows someone teaching prisoners how to read and contextualize real-life events through books, and what book do they pick first? Yep, this one. That article is why I bought this book and why I am glad I still have some trust left in recommendationsOverall impression:It's actually a pretty cool story for young adults. It can be used in a classroom as well; I know I would've learned a lot from it through social commentary. And the characters are well-developed so you actually end up with a story that has characters evolving, even the protagonist, which is a feat in itself considering he has autism. So yep, I would definitely recommend it. ",10,0.9824,0.068,0.787,0.145,0.5200617283950618,POSITIVE,0.9942
262,1169225826,01/15/2015,1.0,"I have some serious concerns about the representation of the inner working mind of an autistic boy. Haddon is not autistic and though he may have some experience interacting with autistic individuals, he has little right to speak for them. The only thing he has a right to represent and to speak of in his novels is his own experience of the nature of autism. Thus, I would find his depiction of the towns peoples and his parents to acceptable. He should not have the right or be applauded for this novel and for the reinforcement of negative stereotypes of autistic people. Haddon, in writing this book, claims that he can speak for an intimate knowledge of how a high functioning autistic person thinks.I am not saying that authors cannot taking the POV of people that they are not. A black author may write about the experiences of a white person and an author may write about the experience of an amputee. A man can write about the working mind of a woman and a woman may do the same for a man. However, the author must conduct some kind of research that is based on the direct words (written, spoken, or otherwise) of those they are representing. Haddon may have experienced an autistic kid hit him when he touched them, but he does not know. He cannot know, unless explicitly told (which I highly doubt) the motivations of that individual. I believe this to be the case because of his consistent representation of the stereotypes perpetrated about autistic individuals. Also, I hate how he justified Christopher as just like you or me, but with a different set of rules (i.e. seeing 4 yellow cars in a row is just the same as if I woke up to a rainy day). And not only is he just the same as you and me, he is highly intelligent and can do all of this math! Which leave me to say F*** you, Haddon.

In the first half of the book I was leaning to a 3,5 stars because I found it very interesting so it read like a train, but the second half was a bit slow for me. It felt like reading about a young Sheldon Cooper from the Big Bang Theory and it was really interesting to see through Christopher's point of view. I also think the writer wrote this character brilliantly because he doesn;t have 'special needs' as he calls it in his books, but actually does work with children with special needs. So to write as cleverly as he does through a whole other mind set than his own is very unique and incredible. So I can see why people enjoyed this book so much suddenly.The plot was really well constructed, but it did leave nothing up to imagination, because you could see the plottwists coming from a mile away. I also found the second part very long I felt like there were too much random bits and pieces all over the place which didn't seem relevant. But of course that's to illustrate how Christopher's mind works. But that just put me off a little because I'm not a maths or science person, it's not that it's not understandable it's just not what I want to read about in my free time.So overall it was very interesting I got through it considerably quickly and it sometimes made me feel the feels.

How many books to you read where you reach the end and feel sad because you’ll miss the people who have shared their life with you, albeit a fictional one? Christopher is one such character, so innocent and yet so cosmically mature, viewing people and the world around him with his unique perspective. It has changed the way I will think about people with Asperger’s.And that’s probably one of the hallmarks of a great book: that it changes our consciousness.There are no jokes in this book, Christopher tells us, but get ready to laugh because he sees the absolute absurdity in the way ‘normal people’ (with inverted commas because who can claim to be ‘normal’ anyway?) conduct themselves. Christopher also does not lie. And the extraordinary unfiltered conversations he has makes me wonder what life would be like if everyone told the truth all the time, even those little inbuilt responses we have to simple questions like ‘how are you?’I’ll admit to getting choked up in certain parts of the book too, in particular the moment where Christopher explains how he responds to one of his classmates having an epileptic fit. The description is dispassionate, like the majority of his observations, and yet it’s filled with tenderness and humanity.This is a book I will read again and again. It has a lot to say.

It’s not even moving, touching, or a “great masterpiece”, as other reviews have described it.Write a book from the perspective of an autistic boy isn’t easy, and even reading it’s not that simple.In some points, the doubt arises spontaneously about what exactly you’re reading. I guess it’s normal because the mind of a boy who has autism focuses on completely different details, things that other people don't even notice. For this reason, it can be a bit heavy to read all the details of the environments, the mathematical problems, the narration without commas, etc. This, however, has a double meaning: while on one hand, it discourages a reader who is not voracious; on the other, it shows the author's ability to have identified himself so well with Christopher.As for the story itself, I could spend another twenty minutes writing about how much I’m not satisfied with the ending or how the author didn't give importance to some passages rather than others, but all this it wouldn't make sense because in this book it's not the story that really counts.

They were very obvious from the beginning (to me anyways) to what they would turn out to be and I found that quite disappointing.I quite liked all the illustrations this book had to offer and thought it brought a little more pleasure to reading it.This is not a book I will reread in the future but I do recommend it to everybody as it does give a good insight on life as an autistic teen and is I believe an unmissable classic.

285,2138359396,09/29/2017,3.0,"3 starsThe Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is not my typical read. It is from a very different perspective because the main character is autistic, and I rarely read from perspectives of people with that different way of receiving the world. In fact, the only other book that I read like that which comes to mind is Counting by 7s. Going into this novel, I was afraid that it would be overly mathematical and was pleased to find that there was nothing too overwhelming.Christopher Boone is a mathematical genius. He plans on doing his A-levels, and passing with an A grade, at just the age of fifteen. But when his neighbor's dog dies, Christopher decides to solve the mystery of who killed it. Soon, he finds out that there might be much more story than what he ever thought before. But why does no one want him to find out who killed Wellington, the black poodle?I liked this book. Personally, I am not crazed about it, like most of the internet is, but I do appreciate a good novel, and I do understand the reasons that people really like this book. For me, it just wasn't ""my type."" I'd recommend this book to people that have autistic relatives, or lovers of books with similar topics like Counting by 7s or Me Before You. The storyline is really interesting, because under that face of ""who killed the dog?"" is a deeper story about family and children with special needs (or not so special, special needs in Christopher's opinion). A thing that I really appreciate is when the first idea in the novel doesn't just fade away like it does in many other novels. In YA it is that if there is romance, the plot is forgotten, but here it would have been the dog being forgotten and Chris would just focus on solving problems within his family. This didn't happen though. The protagonist was consistent throughout the whole novel. We do find out who killed Wellington, and we do find out what happened with his family.Another thing that I find interesting is Christopher's perspective. We gain a lot by learning events from his point of view, but we also lose things. We gain better foreshadowing and the understanding of ""normal"" through his eyes, but we lose the detail of things happening in the world. It was engaging to try to imagine yourself looking from his eyes and seeing the world differently. An incident like this for me occurred during this novel as I never thought that people might be so afraid of noise and trains!
“Prime numbers are what is left when you have taken all the patterns away. I think prime numbers are like life. They are very logical but you could never work out the rules, even if you spent all your time thinking about them.”
Recently, I've been noticing all the philosophy behind novels, because of something that I am studying in school, and here I found it striking, that even though minds differ, they can still be very philosophical. Christopher asks questions about why and how, and even though he doesn't like to believe in ""mysteries of life,"" he still makes some big questions about them. What I did not like, was just that it was so slow. For a deeply critical read, this book is really good, but if you're reading this for fun, don't expect it to be an action-packed mystery thriller because it really isn't. This is not a bad thing, I was just not in the mood for something like this and will definitely reread it in the future to make more of the novel than I can now.To sum up, Mark Haddon wrote a fascinating novel from an unexpected perspective, which really helps the reader dig deeper. It is a wonderful novel about a boy, his family, and a dog, which I can't wait to reread sometime in the future.",12,0.9989,0.05,0.745,0.205,0.4575930059523809,NEGATIVE,0.9989
286,2545706811,09/30/2018,3.0,"I loved the first half of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, but the second part, when Christopher travels to London and back, was somehow less clever and interesting. And the story is almost relentlessly sad and depressing all throughout, which is hard to read. What was great about the first part is how Mark Haddon shows the reader a bigger picture of what’s happening than what Christopher observes. We note, for example, that Christopher is usually looking mostly at people’s shoes. We’re also increasingly aware that there are cues about what’s really going on that are relatively obvious to the reader but completely hidden from Christopher. To build up a story like that, in which the main character tries to emulate Sherlock Holmes but actually reveals clues that allow the reader to be more Holmes than he is—that’s just really clever.What diminished my enjoyment of the novel is the sadness, that what Christopher most needs is personal connection and understanding, and that’s exactly what he isn’t getting—anywhere. An alien who read this book would assume that either all humans or just British humans are entirely awful creatures. It’s hard to be beaten down again and again by how badly people treat Christopher. (And I also felt beaten down by the foul language that permeates the book. It felt like an almost laughable amount of all the bad words, and it’s sad that that will make it a hard book to recommend, and a lot of people—and younger readers, especially—who might appreciate the book are never going to pick it up because of that wall of language.)I know that Christopher reflects a lot of Haddon, especially in his atheism. That part saddened me, because the church is where Christopher would be most likely to encounter the unconditional love and care he unconsciously yearns for—but that option is cut off, with emphatic deliberateness, over and over. As a reader, I can assume that we’re not seeing “the truth” from Christopher’s observations about religion, because clearly he’s an unreliable narrator in many other ways. And so what I see in Christopher’s perspective is the limits of human understanding about ultimate questions when we approach those questions with pure “logic.” That approach takes us pretty far, but not all the way to the truth. (And I know that my reading of this is contrary to Haddon’s intention, so I’m not going to push it any further.)The detail in the book that most puzzles me is that Reverend Peters is reading Bonhoeffer’s Cost of Discipleship while Christopher takes his exams. When that detail was mentioned, I just sat there staring at the book, thinking, “Why that information? Why that book and author, of all the things Haddon might have brought in? What does this connect to in the story?” And I really don’t know. I like to think that it’s a tiny indication that there are people near Christopher who are seriously pursuing a life of faith, not just hypocritical or uninformed outward affirmations of faith (or outright atheism). But I can’t figure it out. (I did find, oddly, a mention of the original “curious incident” quote—from a Sherlock Holmes story—in a chapter of Steven Plant’s book, Taking Stock of Bonhoeffer; but that book was written years after Haddon’s Curious Incident, and it doesn’t even reference Haddon’s novel, even though it brings those two things together!)I had seen the National Theatre Live cinema broadcast of the London stage version of The Curious Incident, and I really enjoyed that—more than I enjoyed the original novel, it turns out. The play seemed somehow not quite so bleak, perhaps because of how innovative the stage tech was, which provided something else to think about other than Christopher’s depressing situation. I will be seeing much more of this story this year, as my son is playing Christopher’s father in a production at school—which I’m sure will be my favorite version of all!",9,0.9971,0.071,0.766,0.162,0.5625000000000001,POSITIVE,0.5019
287,164324166,04/28/2011,3.0,"My initial thought after reading the book was, Wow, that was a weird one. Then, after a reassessment, I realized that weird has a negative vibe to it. Unique sounds just about right.The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time is the story of fifteen-year-old Christopher Boone, who has Asperger's syndrome, a mild form of autism. He discovers the slain body of his neighbor's poodle, Wellington, with a gardening fork stuck to its side. Deciding that he should write a mystery book on Wellington's murder, he takes on an investigation on his own, and in the process, unwittingly unearths secrets long kept from him by his own Father. (Yes, he calls his parents Father and Mother.)What's unique about the book is that it was written from the first-person point of view of Christopher, whose mental condition both hampers and facilitates his “detection” of Wellington's murder. His Asperger's syndrome makes him an emotionally detached protagonist, and I honestly didn't know whether to feel pity or be stressed because of this. Imagine if you knew someone like Christopher, who groans aloud to block out any sound he doesn't like, hates anything yellow or brown and uses red food color so that he can eat yellow or brown food, hates physical contact, and almost gets run over by a train because he is more concerned about losing his pet rat than anything else. And because he was exceptionally awesome at math, he uses this skill as defense mechanism when he feels, even remotely, lonely or stressful. On the other hand, the book was an eye-opener. Although it is by no means a medical treatise on autism or any of its forms, it will make readers realize that what these “special” children (or people) ultimately need is patience and understanding, especially coming from their immediate family and loved-ones. Reading about the scenes which would otherwise be considered lamentable by a normal person who happened to be in that situation, but was merely reduced to insignificance because of the emotionally-detached hero that is Christopher, was gut-wrenching for me. On a lighter note, though, it will also make you feel amazed how really, absolutely good they are at certain things; in Christopher's case, it was math. When he feels anxious about something, he just thinks up math equations and puzzles in his head, a talent which someone like me, whose waterloo is anything with numbers, seriously covet. His logic is impeccable, too. For example, he talked about how stupid it was to have to call the people at his school as “special needs” people, or people with “learning difficulty”. If that's the case, he argued, then Father would be a “special need” person, too, because he had to carry with him a packet of sugar substitute wherever he went. Isn't that a special need? And his teacher, Siobhan, would also be a “special needs” person, too, because she always had to use prescription glasses for reading and writing. Wouldn't that also fall under “special need”? :) And the “learning difficulty” thing, aren't people who find it hard to learn a new language, like French, considered people with “learning difficulty”, too? Surely, learning a new language like French is complicated? :)If you're looking for variety in your reading, or if you find yourself wanting to veer away from your usual genre for a change, I would recommend this book. It's easy to read, and just unique. ",9,0.9792,0.072,0.824,0.104,0.6103241408796966,NEGATIVE,0.6927
288,2150437397,10/17/2017,5.0,"Since I have family members with ASD, I really enjoy reading about it in books and seeing different approaches to it. I was gifted with the opportunity to read this extraordinary novel just not once, but twice. The first time, my English teacher told us that we were going to be reading To Kill a Mockingbird, so since I was disappointed that we weren't going to be reading this one, I whipped it up. About a week after I finished it, she changed her mind and chose this book, so I got to read it again, which was SO WORTH IT.The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time was equally as excellent both times around. Although the representation of ASD in this novel may have been slightly generalized, I overall loved the unique perspective and insights the author gives regarding how those with autism perceive their world.This story is told through the eyes of 15-year old Christopher Boone, who has Asperger's Syndrome. When he finds his neighbour's dog Wellington sprawled on the ground dead, he decides to take charge to see who has killed him by investigating his clues and writing a book about it. Through doing so, he uncovers many secrets not only about Wellington's death, but about himself, his family members, and the world.It was a great idea for Haddon to write this novel in an eccentric perspective like Christopher's. I found him to be a very interesting character and it was great to see such a different and diverse protagonist for a change. Although Christopher was far from intuitive, it was very refreshing to see a character with a more logical and philosophical approach on life- he is mesmerized by maths and sciences. His quirks made him stand out in the sea of YA characters and I really appreciated this. Yay for diversity!Because of the unreliable narrator aspect, the plot came with many fun twists and turns. As the adults in Christopher's life gained more and more faith in him, they began to trust him more with secrets about his family life and the world, and many of these uncovered secrets came as complete surprises to me. The book is also short, and I finished it within 2-3 hours when I first read it for pleasure. However, when Christopher went into theoretical applications of math and science concepts, these made the plot run a bit slower, but it was definitely still interesting to get a deep insight on his interests.All in all, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time was a fabulous novel and I definitely agree on the fact that it has become a modern classic in young adult literature. It has a unique main character, it is insightful and teaches the reader a lot about dealing with someone with autism, and the plot is a roller coaster of extremely captivating events. If you're reluctant to read classics, then this is the one to pick up as it isn't dull in the slightest way and it does not fail to resonate with readers. I don't normally reread books, but this was definitely a well-deserved reread!",9,0.9982,0.051,0.749,0.199,0.5195402298850574,POSITIVE,0.9973
289,39101710,12/02/2008,4.0,"Spring has come and I decided to take this book and read it outside today in the sun. What more could I ask for after a tortuously cold and miserable winter besides a good book and sunshine? Anyways, I digress. On to my review of the book rather than my review of my surrounding while reading the book.This novel piqued my interest as I worked with 2 special needs children for 6 years. The one is severely autistic and the other has Asperbergers combined with some behavioral issues. Christopher, to me, was a delightful little cross between these two boys and I immediately found myself understanding him and taking a great liking to his precocious nature. I read this novel in a matter of 3 hours whilst outside basking in the sun. It read very quickly to me and I couldn't put it down; even in the midst of his science and math related tangents which always prove difficult for me anyways because math/science is not where my talents lie.I liked the style and didn't find it distracting. I always thought it really added to his thought process and to understanding it through the eyes of a kid with autism. The boys that I worked with relied heavily on visuals--picture schedules and the like. I found the parents extremely real. Being a part of this family working with this kids, I have seen the frustrations, struggles, anger, confusion, chaos and love that goes on in a family with a special needs child. I've seen their lows in dealing with their child and I've seen the highs that result of the progress and success of their child. The parents might have annoyed me a tad and I felt like shaking them but 1) this is how I've felt in the past working with this family and 2) unless you are around it everyday, you will NEVER understand what it takes as a person. The part where it talked about the boy laying down and screaming and ""groaning"" on the floor while everybody stared was situation that happened many times in working with these children so I really understood the plight of the parents. I found the basic plot interesting. Autistic boy tries to solve the mystery of a dead dog. I knew there would be all sorts of misadventures and real hurdles for the character. However, my thoughts of what the novel would be like took a drastic turn when the killer of the dog was revealed half way through. I thought it would be more of a mystery the whole time but it turned into something different that I was very much okay with and not expecting. I don't want to give anything away plot-wise but I would definitely recommend this book if you are looking for a different kind of main character, a little bit of a mystery with an interesting twist, and a story that explores the relationship of a special needs child with his family and with the people around him which will be very real in regards to the social difficulties these children face and the struggles of a parent.

290,1043436550,09/02/2014,5.0,"12.55 pmI just finished reading a book called 'the curious incident of the dog in the night-time'. It was by Mark Haddon,an author whose works I haven't read before. I had been hearing about this book for a long time and it has been on my to-be-read bookshelf since long. I finally decided to read it when I saw it on a book list on which I had to vote. And now I am going to give my vote again. 12.57 pmThe book was real good. I do not know how minds of autistic children work,or whether the behaviors mentioned in this book are true or not. I haven't ever met anyone who is autistic. But the things written in this book brought tears into my eyes. And that means I was sad. But I was happy to have read such a good book after a long time.( I am happy and sad at the same time. Confusing,isn't it? I'm sure Christopher would have felt the same.) I laughed at times when Christopher's naïveté created funny situations. And what a genius he was at mathematics.! But I am not. I am ok with numbers but I haven't any special liking for them. I just pass. So I should add that I did skip the end part where Christopher gave the solution for that equation he had to solve for A level mathematics. But everything else was fine. Thanks, Mark Haddon,for not adding too much of such equations. 1.05 pmSo I really liked that book. I would have given it six stars out of five if that were possible but you can't do that because otherwise it would create many possibilities like why not give seven or ten or even a thousand out of five and that would be confusing. So I will give this five stars. I was reading too many dull books till I came upon this one and so I must add that this was a refreshing experience. 1.09 pm9 minutes past my lunchtime and I didn't even notice.! The book must have been real good.!",9,0.9556,0.058,0.828,0.114,0.5917233560090702,POSITIVE,0.9961
291,74877115,10/17/2009,4.0,"***Goodreads swap from 10/09 at Vroman's. Thank you anonymous swapper!***What an achievement to write a book that steps into the mind of an autistic teen yet allows us to laugh out loud and feel some deep emotions! Not to mention it reminded this crusty scientist of her childhood wide-eyed amazement and enthusiasm for the beauty of math.Seriously, it's okay to laugh at Christopher's quirks and missteps despite his autistic-spectrum disorder. He has Behavioral Problems that most of us have experienced in one way or another, but perhaps not taken to such extremes. He reminds me a lot of Adrian Mole, twisting and bending rules and getting himself into funny, awkward situations.My favorite part of the book is where he describes his logic of seeing red cars and having a Super Good Day. He points out to the psychologist that other people take seemingly illogical cues (the weather as they step out of the house) that sets their mood for the day. His cue is a bit more unique. Likewise, people have morning routines they faithfully follow that shows they like things nice and ordered, too.This book should be read in high-schools. It reads fast, funny, with emotional reverberations and a strong empathy moral. Readers question what it means to be ""normal,"" a question that torments teenagers daily.OK, I can see where the ""normal is not all its cracked up to be"" moral is a bit ham-fisted at the end. The emotional or sympathetic didacticism here can turn off some readers; not everyone wants a moral lesson with their novel. However, sympathy and empathy are two morals-of-the-story that everyone should learn, embrace and practice. This books gets you there with a laugh.",9,0.9966,0.012,0.763,0.225,0.5462121212121213,POSITIVE,0.9979
292,1631379840,05/07/2016,3.0,"Ok so I had to read this book for some kind of reading contest/book club thing. I initially gave it 3 stars (and I won't change my rating). As I finished the novel, I had to write like a 5 page essay/review based on this book, and I had to get deeper into the story in order to do it properly. This had a huge influence on my rating, as I would be tempted to give it 4 stars now. But nope, not today!I started reading The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time being very optimistic, because I thought the subject was quite interesting: the world seen through a boy that suffers from (most likely) autism. Indeed, Mark Haddon does a great job portraying Christopher, even if this thing can be pretty annoying sometimes (short, straight senteneces, lack of description). I'm used to reading classics so I didn't like it but this doesn't affect the quality of the book since that would be the way a mentally challenged boy would write his book.I liked that this book is not really a detective novel, but a psychological one; it actually orbits around the problems of mentally challenged people and their family's struggle; it also does a pretty good job in portraying the way they think. My favourite thing about the book is the way Haddon expresses his atheist views of life/death/heaven through Christopher, a character whose main traits are logical thinking. Smart move there, Mark.
“I think people believe in heaven because they don't like the idea of dying, because they want to carry on living and they don't like the idea that other people will move into their house and put their things into the rubbish.”
So yeah, its a good story, but nothing special.",9,0.989,0.056,0.763,0.181,0.5179339477726574,NEGATIVE,0.9934

Not all people with Aspergers are the same, just like any other group of people. My 22 year old son has Aspergers and while he is a bit higher functioning than the protagonist of this book I found them very similar. Often I smiled or laughed to myself because I could see Owen so vividly in this boy.I loved everything about this book. It enchanted me and I found myself fully invested in the story.
