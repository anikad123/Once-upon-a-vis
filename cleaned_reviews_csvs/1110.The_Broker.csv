There bits that were intriguing and bits that just went on and on.Our main protagonist, Joel Backman, was a high level lobbyist who got his hands on some very sensitive software. So sensitive that it would become a game changer for future military conflict.All Joel could see were dollar signs in front of his eyes and so he tried to sell it to the highest bidder. When the CIA became aware of this Joel was arrested and convicted for treason and to spend the next twenty years of his life behind a prison door.There were a lot of countries after Joel’s blood, promises were made and promises were broken. As a result Joel spent much of his life looking over his shoulder, even in prison.When the current Presidents term was just about over he gave, much to Joel’s delight and surprise, a pardon for past wrong doings. The reality was that this was a CIA ruse to see who would kill Joel first.Part of the ruse was to give Joel a new identity and send him somewhere safe, which turned out to be Bologna Italy. So Joel ends up in Bologna with some CIA minders in tow.At this point the book becomes a travelogue for Bologna, a crash course in learning Italian and also a good food guide to the best restaurants in Bologna. This would have been interesting had I been interested in going to Bologna. Enough said.Where credulity leaves us was when Joel, who knows about as much about espionage as I do, decides to takes on the CIA at there own game.Look there were parts that were quite exciting but there were lots of it that were just a drag so as I said at the beginning, at its best this was just so-so.

Because it's Grisham, the characters are always interesting and the writing is always great. But my problem here was the pace. There were a lot of instances where I thought Grisham was beating around the bush. He was rather fond of the Italian culture and took lengths to explain quite a few things and that would have been nice if this was a book about Italy. But, this is an espionage thriller of some sort and there were quite a lot of dull parts. Well if this is a thriller, I wasn't thrilled. The ending was redeeming because it contained some excitement, but it was little too late. I was at the point of no return. I had already gotten bored and my mind was already filled with thoughts about how I wasted my time. That being said, I still think that Grisham's sub-par work is better than most out there.

He touched a hand, mano; an arm, braccio; a leg, gamba.” The trees cut down for this book would have been more useful for toilet paper purposes, but nevertheless, not wanting to begrudge the book its value as in-flight low-grade soporific entertainment, one can best suggest to leave it on an airport bench somewhere, with a forewarning inside for its next unsuspecting reader.",20,0.9865,0.048,0.766,0.186,0.4265555555555556,NEGATIVE,0.9889

You know it's going to be a fun book when the CIA is leaking someones whereabouts just to see who kills him. When I read the jacket of the book I was afraid that they may have given too much of the plot away. I was wrong. There was still plenty of suspense and drama to be had. This book had me guessing how it was going to end until it was over. I must admit that I didn't guess right at all. The characters in this book are well rounded and well developed. It seems that Grisham takes great pride in developing the characters and the settings of his books and it shows. The chase in this book takes you into 3 or 4 different countries and crosses paths with many, many people. If you are a mystery fan or a Grisham fan then this book is a good read for you.

8,677100230,07/25/2013,2.0,"My brother recommended this book. Since I want him to read Joel Salatin, in a tit-for-tat deal I agreed to read The Broker. The first 13 pages, the political pardon arrangement, were hilarious. I was hooked. But not for long. After the main character, Backman, was whisked away to Europe by the CIA, the spy-vs-spy vs innocent-in-a-strange-land story - or whatever this was supposed to be - went awry. At this point Grisham's editor - he does have one, I presume - should have sent back the manuscript and told his celebrated author to toss all pages from 14 on into the garbage and not only rewrite the book, but rethink the story. What is all this mangiare and vino and birra and espresso doing in a story of a man hunted by assassins? While I belong to the 1% of Grisham's readers who thoroughly enjoyed learning to speak basic Italian right along with Backman, I was expecting a thriller, not a language lesson and tour guide to northern Italy with an emphasis on Bologna. To repeat, where was his knife-wielding editor?Worse, The Broker doesn't make sense. It contains many plot Whys, but I'll note just 5 big ones. First, the CIA places Backman in Italy, gives him an apartment and wardrobe but no money or passport, tutors him in how and when to order a cappucino, and then gives the equivalent CIAs of 4 foreign governments a recent photo of Backman on the streets of Bologna just because the CIA wants to see who will kill him. The CIA says this plan is vital to the national security of the U.S.A., but even I, a non-reader of thrillers, recognize that this plan is pointless, so why do it? Second, how is killing Backman going to help the CIA get what they desperately want, which is JAM? Third, since the CIA believes Backman has JAM, why didn't they stick to Plan A and inject him with sodium pentathol when they had him under their thumb at the military hospital? Fourth, eventually we learn that Backman does have JAM. He's always had it. So why didn't he cut a deal with the CIA before he was sentenced to 20 years in solitary confinement? Of course, had Backman done that, this book would not exist. Fifth, while real life doesn't have neat endings, fiction does. But this story has no conclusion. Is Backman safe now from all his would-be assassins, or not? Is this sloppy mess typical of Grisham or was I just handed a lemon? ",14,-0.6211,0.066,0.854,0.08,0.3636904761904762,NEGATIVE,0.9996

When he needed a crutch, and especially when he would need someone to blame, he opened up the decisionmaking process and included Critz.” Every so often, we wonder how the decision making process goes inside the government, particularly in the seemingly superior branch of the government (go figure). The Broker gave us a little preview of how the decisions go into process inside the government legally and (surprisingly…not!) illegally. In this novel, the process goes a little too corrupt. It began with a Washington power broker-lobbyist and a lawyer, Joel Backman. He is, in the story, the famous broker that was sent to jail for six years. Upon the dissolution of his sentence, the political wheels in Washington have turned and numerous powerful people want him dead. So, several bloody bargains were made. Unexpectedly, the outgoing disgraced president granted him a full pardon at the request of the CIA. Joel Backman now finds himself out of the prison in the middle of the night, bundled onto a military plane flown to Italy to begin a superficially new life. He began having a new name and mysterious ""friends"" who will teach him to speak the language and to blend in with the people in Bologna.The Broker is not a very good book but I don’t hate it. The novel’s plot has a lot to offer but I was surprised that it didn’t turn out the way I wanted it to be. There are too many “extra scenes” and the pacing was too slow. For instance, the story intensively put the attention to Joel Backman’s idle days where he ordered pizza, cappuccino before 10:30am in an Italian café speaking Italian. The routine of his life is too reiterated, that it is too much to be told.Anyway, this book is one of my

The story starts with a slightly more sardonic humorous tone than usual Grisham books introducing a quintessential 'worst president ever' who goes on to pardon the real MC Joel Backman aka 'the broker'. It's all part of a plot to get Backman killed something that basically just requires getting him off US soil and letting his enemies take care of it.The story starts powerful and tense, Backman isn't a hugely relateable guy but his underdog status makes us root for him, its horrible to see the machinery of the CIA and other nations spy networks work towards his demise.I did the find the plot petered out however. At first Backman was locked into a power struggle with his 'minders' but then a fair chunk of the novel was really just about him learning all about Italy which I couldn't help but wonder if Grisham himself was showing off his knowledge. When the story came to its inevitable climax it felt like like a letdown, without spoiling too much, the secrets Backman hid weren't that earth-shattering and all the contrived plots to kill him sort of fizzled out rather than dramatically resolved.

And this fixation continued to this novel. But in it, Pakistani characters graduated to the main plot. That was nice. Considering he is popular and read widely in Pakistan.

Many readers are disappointed and say this is a slow book that Grisham wrote just to have an excuse to spend more leisurly time in Italy, and that he spends far too much time describing details of Italian towns and Italian language that are totally irrelevant to the plot.I adore Grisham, but it's all true: after the first few chapters, that I found gripping and intriguing as ever, Grisham's fast, punchy writing comes to an almost complete halt, when the main charachter arrives in Italy and he starts taking in all things Italian so that he can blend in as much as possible. Pages and pages of details on how wonderful Italy is, the life there and the food and the people. Well, I am Italian, so all this is very flattering. Yes, a little too much of an idealized Italy, especially an idea of Italy that very much exists in the minds of tourists, but nonetheless, flattering. And yes, a pleasure to be reminded of the beauty of my country, as I don't live in Italy anymore. But these pages where Grisham takes us through the main charachter's Italian lessons and his wonderings in Bologna are just so useless and so far removed from the plot, written with a completely different pace and mood, that they seem like those weird candies that you sometimes find in a piece of chocolate: they have nothing to do with it, and they actually end up ruining the experience of eating that piece of chocolate. Maybe he was trying to write something a bit different, something like a mix of espionage thriller and romance, but there is just something that doesn't quite work out with the two parts of this book. For this book to be as strong as most of his other books, he should have stuck to the initial plot, and driven it relentlessly to its end. I loved the idea of the secret satellite system, and oh my God I sincerely loved the idea of having the Chinese burn an entire forest in order to launch these satellites without being seen by other countries. The Russians did it for real, I think, but I'd have to google that and i cant be bothered now.

She looked away, through the window, and said, ""I have so little to smile about.""This type of thing, along with the rhythm (wretched) of most of his prose convinces me that Grisham ought to be a screenwriter, not a novelist. The singular strength that has propelled him to stardom is that of his plots, which usually aren't bad. It is a rare writer that can combine intriguing plots with good prose and fully developed characters. Grisham is one for three, and that one is occasionally debatable.

During his time as a high ranking attorney in Washington, three young, but brilliant, Pakistanis discover a surveillance satellite that has technology that is decades ahead of everyone else. The Pakistanis find a way to take over the satellite and manipulate it to work for them. Joel Backman decides to help them sell the program but when all three are found dead and no one accepts responsibility for the killings or the satellite, Joel becomes worried for his life. When the CIA arrest him for past crimes, he quickly pleads guilty and serves time.After serving 6 years in prison, the President gives Joel a full pardon in the eleventh hour of his presidency. It looks like Joel will get out early and earn 14 years of his life back. But the catch is he has to move out of the country and take on a whole new identity. Backman agrees with this idea because he is still worried about the people who killed his three young partners. He takes up his new life in the small Italian town of Bologna as Marco Lazerri. He spends the majority of his time learning the culture and, of course, the language. What he doesn't know is that the CIA planned the pardon from the beginning. They pardoned Backman and then leaked the information of his new identity to the possible countries that would've had motive behind the killings six years earlier. They figure that once the broker's location and new identity is ""discovered"", the actual owner will exact their revenge on Backman by assassination. Backman is the cheese in the mousetrap and the CIA does not worry if he gets eaten so long as they can locate the mouse.I enjoyed reading this book.

It's funny how books are the one thing that we do judge solely based on the cover sometimes. Anyways, The Broker by John Grisham certainly didn't disappoint.It starts out by with sitting President Morgan, who is on his way out after a historically bad campaign, pardoning the notorious Joel Backman, sentenced to years in prison for stealing of classified documents. This was done due to the advice of the Director of the CIA, Teddy Maynard. While Morgan simply wanted to spite America for his horrid campaign, Teddy had other ideas. He wanted to relocate Backman, leak his location, and try to get another country to kill him. Much of the book is spent covering Joel's transition to Italian (the country to which he is relocated) life, including a name change to Marco Lazzeri.

What didn't appeal to me as much was the amount of time spent on Joel's assimilation into Italian culture.

I think I enjoyed it even more this time! Most of this novel is set in Bologna, Italy, and I was reading it while vacationing in Warsaw, Poland, so I found myself absorbed by Grisham's descriptions of lovely Bologna (been to Florence, Rome, Pisa and Venice but not Bologna) while really absorbed by the beauty of Warsaw. Interesting, but the descriptions aren't all - this is the first book of Grisham's that I thought was taut and suspenseful. To be fair, I've only read A Time to Kill, one of the handful of novels that was actually a better movie than book, and The Firm. This novel was far better, about a white collar criminal in federal prison for six years who is fully pardoned by the President, then hidden in Italy by the CIA so that they can see which of his many enemies arrives to assassinate him. Well written and didn't for a minute lose my interest. ",2,0.9929,0.087,0.658,0.255,0.6572463768115944,POSITIVE,0.9984

This book was published in in the early 2000 and was very suspenseful with a thriller that deals with the law, just like many of his other books.

He does this by focusing on a different law in each book and creating new characters every time with all new traits. This time, he decided to explore the life of a pardoned convict that was given an all new life by the CIA, but then made the mistake of leaking his location.

The book starts with the President who lost re-election and decided to pardon the broker at the CIA's request so that the foreign governments could kill him abroad. It turns out the reason that the CIA wanted to free the Broker and have him killed was so they know who built the system and it would overall answer unanswerable questions to them. It seems to me the main players in this espionage thriller were the Chinese who built the system, Mossad who was pissed that the Saudi's won the bid to buy the satellite system and wanted it for themselves, and the Saudi's who won the bid for the selling the system. The ending was great too, with Joel giving the satelite technology to the Pentagon and calling a press conference to throw the Chinese Assasin off his tracks so he can lay low again.It is almost a 5 star book but I cannot get over the slowness that occurred in the book when he talked about Marco Lazzari learning Italian. For me, it really slowed down the book.Within the thriller there are few politico-moral dillemas:1) In the book, it is implied that the President excepted money for political pardons especially for rich clients. This kind of reminds me of Clinton's pardon of Mark who was a rich benefactor to his campaign. Sure, his crime was white collar and thus only indirectly hurts the US, but I still think it is wrong.2) All his books, Grisham showcases the competing interest between the FBI and the CIA and the Oval Office. It is no wonder Al-Quaeda was able to infiltrate the US because of the lack of coordination between the three powers that should be able to protect us. I do not think this is an isolated event as Looming Towers suggest there is really an intense competition between the FBI and the CIA for gathering evidence on one hand the gathering of information on the other. In the book, this tension shows itself in that the CIA wants to keep Marco alive to gather information from him and eventually kill him to protect the information that he knows. The FBI on the other hand wants to prosecute Joel for possible bribe in the pay-for-pardon scam. The two do not trust each other enough to let the other side know why they want Marco/Joel, thus creating a standoff. In terms of our national security/and terrorism, this is scary stuff. If two of the most important bodies to our defense do not trust each other than terrorist attacks are likely in the future.3)In the book, a professor of law in Texas was kicked out from his position because he espoused communist leanings. I think Texas has a right to kick him out only as in this case he teaches communism in his class room especially if it is a core class but I do not UT should have kicked him out if he was just an espoused communist but did not teach it in his classroom.4)In the book of course, the CIA wanted Joel released in a foreign country so other governments would be able to kill him.Now is that legal? Sure it is legal but it is definitely unethical and immoral. 5) CIA if the story is true is scary because they seem to be making their own rules outside the purview of the executive branch that they are under. Does this actually happen in real life? I am sure in extenuating circumstances it does but it is still scary because it recalls a certain state police mentality without checks and balances. So this means, the Iran-Contra affair really could have happened without Reagan's direct knowledge.6)Lobbyist, Broker, adequately gets what he deserves because he was ready to sell US intelligence capabilities to the highest bidder. The brings to mind lobbyist precarious position in representing companies or countries who maybe counter to US interests. So they become mercenaries ready to sell their services to the highest bidder. If I ever end up in the lobbyist circuit, I would only represent interest I believe in so I would be a lobbyist for a cause not for a money.",0,-0.8708,0.125,0.746,0.129,0.5068843193843193,POSITIVE,0.6

I remember liking the pacing of his novels, the characters doing what is right despite the odds being stacked against them, and Grisham's easy writing style that provided enough detail to sympathize with the underdogs but never crossed into too much familiarity. So when I came across the paperback of The Broker memories did their thing and the book came home with me. It sat on the shelf through my well-intentioned ""reading schedule"" phase, got passed over a couple of times after that until finally I was in the mood for it. Almost immediately I saw that either my memories were flawed or The Broker didn't fit in with the Grisham novels I read. In the beginning there was a lot of backstory setting the scene for Joel Backman's release from prison. It painted him as a ruthless, greedy man unfamiliar with the very concept of morality, and even as freedom was offered to him after years in solitary confinement in conditions that were clearly meant to break him he accepted it as if it was his due. And then Joel was moved to Italy and with the new clothes and a pair of Armani glasses he seemed to take on a new identity in more than just name - still demanding and knowing exactly what he wanted, he at the same time has acquired an appreciation for the simpler things in life, and seemed to have re-evaluated his past and was determined to live differently. Unfortunately this transformation got almost no page time, it was more or less just there, leaving the reader to arrive at their own conclusions as to how Joel got from point A to point B. Pacing left much to be desired as well. Events rolled along leisurely for about three quarters of the book with Joel endlessly going from Italian lessons to meals and back, and things started to feel a bit like Groundhog Day, until in a blink of an eye our protagonist transformed from a frustrated tourist into a man of action masterminding his true freedom and once again manipulating some of the highest powers in Washington into doing his bidding. This transition, though not unexpected, was so sudden and swift that it almost gave me whiplash and once again left me with a sense of dissatisfaction.My favorite scenes in the book were where Joel was shown adjusting to life in Italy. His first attempts to order food in a foreign language, his growing familiarity with Bologna, even his overwhelming drive to learn Italian made him into a sympathetic character despite his thoroughly unsympathetic past. I really could do with more of that because I think it would develop the characters and the book wouldn't feel so much like a chronology of events past and present.All in all it was a decent read and I was glad for the way things turned out.

Amazon.com Review 

Before he was sent to federal prison for treason (among other things), Joel Backman was an extremely powerful man. Known as ""the broker,"" Backman was a high roller--a lawyer making $10 million a year who could ""open any door in Washington."" That is, until he tried to broker a deal selling access to the world's most powerful satellite surveillance system to the highest bidder. When caught, Backman accepted prison as the one option that would keep him safe and alive, since the interested parties (the Israelis, the Saudis, the Russians, and the Chinese) were all itching to get their hands on his secrets at any cost. Little does he know that his own government has designs on accessing that information--or at least letting it die with him. Now, six years after his incarceration, the director of the CIA convinces a lame duck president to pardon Backman, and the broker becomes a free man--and an open target.

The Broker marries the best of John Grisham's many talents--his ability to immerse himself in the culture of small town life (in this case, Bologna, Italy), and his uncanny mastery of the chase. The first half of the book focuses on Backman's transformation from infamous power broker to helpless victim in his own game. Upon his release from prison, Backman is taken into ""protective custody"" and whisked off to Italy where he is assigned a new identity, and a tutor to help him blend in. Sure he is on the run, but some readers may feel that Backman's time spent in Bologna is a bit too leisurely--readers join him on an almost cinematic tour through the Italian town, complete with language and history lessons. Impatient readers will be happy to know that the final half of the novel is classic Grisham--a fast-paced, thrilling cat and mouse chase pitting Backman against the numerous agencies that want him dead--as the broker makes a move to take back his life. --Daphne Durham

From Publishers Weekly

Readers will find an amiable travelogue to Italy and its charms in Grisham's latest. What they won't find are the suspense and inspired plotting that have made the author (The Last Juror, etc.) one of the world's bestselling writers. Yet Grisham remains a smooth storyteller, and few will fail to finish this oddball tale of what happens to ruined D.C. powerbroker Joel Blackman, 52, when he's suddenly released from federal prison after six years. Teddy Maynard, legendary CIA director, has engineered the release in order to put Joel into a variant of the witness protection program and then see who kills him. Many want him dead—the Saudis, the Israelis, especially the Chinese—because of his role in trying to sell a global satellite spy system that would alter the world's balance of power; that was what got Joel imprisoned, and the CIA hopes that whoever kills him will clue them in to who may have access to the satellites. Joel is relocated to Bologna, and much of the narrative consists of his touring that city, its historic sights and its many restaurants, and learning Italian ways from his male handler, Luigi, and his language tutor, Francesca—a middle-aged woman with whom he falls in love. A major subplot concerns Joel's secret dealings with his stateside son to prepare for escape from Bologna if necessary. Eventually, the CIA leaks Joel's whereabouts to his enemies, who dispatch killing teams. Can Joel broker his way to safety? There's some depth to the troubled relationship between Joel and his tutor, but otherwise the novel reads like a contented afterthought to a memorable Italian vacation, with little action or tension, plastic characters and plot turns that a tricycle could maneuver. Still, anyone wishing to learn how and why Bologna built its famed porticos, why to be wary of most Italian desserts and how to send an encrypted wireless message using a global cell phone will find that information cheerfully given here.

122,2516006042,09/07/2018,2.0,"Mediochre. Not the page turning thriller I had been expecting, and honestly it felt like he had a short-story length idea, and padded it out with much bimbling around Italy to get it up to novel length.The plot is that the broker - bigwig lobbyist lawyer in Washington - got involved in the sale of a satellite hacking programme and ended up in prison. The CIA desperately want to know whose satellite was being hacked and who was going to buy the programme, so they get the outgoing president to pardon Backman, get him released from prison and sent to Italy to start a new life. With the intention that they'll let the world's secret services know his whereabouts and then sit and watch who kills him.Now, to a point it was interesting to read about and think about what it would be like to be taken away from EVERYTHING and expected to set up a new life and identity in a country and a language you don't know. That coupled with a sense of the place and the tension of not knowing if you're being hunted would be the kind of thing a writer like Patricia Highsmith would have done brilliantly. But I don't think this is Grisham's forte at all, and it just got dull at times. I thought more would have been made of his professor friend as well, although that's just a random pondering on my part.It is also so American in that everything's refered to as ""European"" as if Europe is just one homogenous blob and we all live our lives and attitudes exactly the same. Which felt wierd when characters that were supposed to be Italien would say things about this is the ""European Way"". Do Italiens speak like that? We certainly don't in the UK - and Brexit politics aside, folks - EU membership regardless, we are still part of Europe geographically.I've only ever read one other Grisham book, The Street Lawyer, which was a lot of years ago and I remembering enjoying. I suspect this is one of his not-so-great books. ",0,0.9287,0.061,0.829,0.11,0.496979107848673,NEGATIVE,1.0

124,466190283,11/29/2012,3.0,"So ""The Broker"" was the worst John Grisham book I've read - though that's a bit like choosing my least favorite chocolate bar. Unlike most Grisham books, the plot unfolds predictably and very slowly. The vast majority of the book consists of an extended Italian lesson as the main character, a former Washington lobbyist, tries to blend into a witness protection program. He seems already aware, somehow, that the CIA broke him out of jail just to let him get killed, and he conveniently flees moments ahead of hit squads from multiple continents converge on his location. I've recently read some of Grisham's newer books - playing for pizza, Ford County - and really enjoyed his branching out. This book was a disappointment, but I guess only writing 19 out of 20 great books isn't too bad.Jesse Cozean

With The Broker, I came away with a great education in Italian culture, cuisine and great insights into the oft-overlooked city of Bologna, Italy - but it was a thriller with precious few thrills.
The Broker
 is centers around Joe Blackman, a Washington, D.C. lobbyist that plays fast and loose with all of the rules and revels in throwing his weight all over town. Blackman is approached by Pakastani computer hackers who have discovered and hijacked a set of super high tech spy satellites with a special computer program. They want Blackman to sell it to the highest bidder and soon enough the Israelis, the Saudis, the Chinese and the CIA are all interested. One of Blackman's associates winds up murdered and an FBI probe into Blackman's practices place him in prison.Suddenly, he is part of a surprise last minute pardon deal by an outgoing president and he is whisked into a witness protection program administered by the CIA in Italy.

As I was searching for another book to read his name caught my eye and I wound up checking out the book from my school’s library. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I don’t recommend this book to anyone who wants a quick read that they can read for about 5 minutes a day, you can’t put it down! I recommend it to anyone who wants a great book to envelop themselves in. The novel’s main character is Joel Backman, considered to be one of the most powerful men in washington. Sometimes even for the strongest willed human beings power can just be too much to handle. Power may take up many different forms such as money or fame. Joel takes the role of money and infamous power. He makes some bad decisions trying to get more power and money and finds himself with a 20 year sentence to high security prison. Six years into his sentence, as the president’s term is ending, he is granted a full pardon. Joel, then, is shipped off to a foreign country where he assumes a new identity as he hides from the many groups of people that wish to kill him. Does he survive and lead a peaceful life or is he mysteriously assassinated by someone? Read the book to find out! ",0,0.9701,0.051,0.796,0.153,0.5095716423494201,POSITIVE,0.999

That made it a bit personal and as a result even more pleasant book.The end is not quite fully done, the full resolution is not quite there, it looks the author is inclined to leave an open end and let the audience decide what or how it may end.

He's not so good at these in this book, so it was a near flat Grisham to me. Yes, one needs back story, but in this book his jumps back and forth in time in this book (and others of his recent adult genre portfolio for that matter) went above and beyond his usual and pretty much kill the narrative line. It's like watching something filmed with a hand held camera, all herky-jerky. So that undermines strength (1). As for (2), while no one expects a Grisham book to be torn from the pages of the hum-drum, the plot points in this book were either a little too illogical (Italy, for one - there was never a good answer to this, even when the main character keeps asking this obvious question) or just plain too difficult to believe.So, not my favorite.",0,0.872,0.091,0.756,0.153,0.489328231292517,NEGATIVE,0.8833

206,2939342245,08/15/2019,2.0,"A lightweight thriller with an intriguing initial premise but ultimately uninteresting, morally confused and full of stereotypes. On the surface the set-up is not at all bad. An ex-lobbyist gone bad with some big secrets is released from jail and bundled off to a pretty place in Italy by the CIA. Their intention is that he should be killed away from the US but so that they get to see who did it.* He spends the next few weeks of his life desperately trying to learn Italian and work out exactly why he is there. At some point he starts to become a man wholly different from that which he was in his previous brash and soulless earllier life. I would guess that his 6 years in prison might have been also relevant for that but for interest purposes I can see that the author decides concentrate on the short spell in Italy.The problem is that the set-up is all this book has.It felt like jumping out of a top floor window only to find that the ground is right there 2 feet below the window. In between times nothing much happens and you find yourself bored enough to notice the books more obvious flaws.First and foremost there is the plot: endless pointless episodes that neither develop the plot or the character. The situation on page 300 is broadly the same as that one page 20. In between we learn Italian, eat some nice food and have coffee.Closely linked with these plot issues is the narrative style. Episode...and then...dull episode...and then...dull episode....and then nothing exciting happens. It is as if the author thinks that to be genuinely European he has to slow everything down and concentrate on the small things. Problem is, he has absolutely no idea how to do that well.Joel was a bad man and then he went to Italy and then he wasn't so bad and then he studied Italian and then he had some nice pasta and then he studied Italian some more and then he was being chased by lots of bad men and then he met a woman and then he studied Italian again and then he got smart and then he went home and then maybe he was alright. Nothing happens and then it does. And then it moves to another place and then something else small happens. And then there is no suspense. And then he is never in any peril. And then who is this mysterious Chinese assassin and what torture will he inflict? And then we never find out. And then I got bored and then I had a cup of tea and then ""ooh isn't this Italian food lovely"" and then Bologna is, like, full of, like, old things and then the women are ALL pretty in Italy (really, is there some sort of infant euthanasia programme for those unfortunately ugly humans who happen to be born in Italy?) and then they all smoke and then they all kiss each other (even the men, uggh gross!) and then they take time to eat lots more of that lovely food and then we all had tea and cake. Oh and then we have a little bit of action and then not too much and then it ends.Finally there is the lack of any coherent moral stand point. There is no doubt that the author is attempting to consider how power corrupts and the effects of an empty but financially rewarding career on the individual. Perhaps rather than getting so stressed we should all smell the flowers, look at the architecture and have a coffee in a Piazza. However, this is completely negated by a series of later crass money-posturing scenes reminiscent of the ""spraying money around is soooo cooool"" 1980's. Look at me, I can impress a Swiss banker! Well glory be.In summary, a tedious plot padded out with the narrative style of an essay written by an average ten year old mixed with the sort of gross and confused stereotyping found in the very dumbest American descriptions of all things European. No offense to the many Americans who know better but wow, this almost beats ""The Tourist"" film for misunderstanding Europe, it really is that bad. *As it happens, on reflection this part of the plot is wholly nonsensical: since all of them are trying to kill him it does not follow that the winning assassin would come from the country who owns the satellite system. In fact, to hide ones ownership of a satellite system, it is unlikely that one would kill an ex-political lobbyist in some sort of revenge/ secret hiding exercise. Oh and why Italy? And why teach him Italian? Come to think of it, why at all?",0,0.5294,0.116,0.766,0.118,0.4589118629908104,NEGATIVE,1.0
207,2944825806,08/20/2019,4.0,"The unique (and successful) combination of thriller with a European travelogue!With technology stolen from two US defense contractors, a cutting edge satellite surveillance system dubbed Neptune was secretly built and launched under the very nose of the CIA and the rest of the world's elite spy communities - Israel, Saudi Arabia, Russia, England and China. Nobody even knew of the system's top secret existence (let alone who was operating it) until two brilliant Pakistani computer wizards unwittingly hacked into the system and parlayed that illicit entry into an astonishing piece of software capable of hijacking, manipulating and neutralizing the system. When greed and human nature drive these naive programmers into the arms of Washington power broker, Joel Backman, to ask for his help in shopping the knowledge of the clandestine satellite system and their superlative software package to the highest bidder, the best laid plans of mice and men and crafty programmers and Washington lawyers are smashed into a million tiny pieces. The hapless young hackers are assassinated and never seen from again and Joel Backman is indicted and hidden away in prison on some nebulous but entirely bogus conspiracy and treason charges. The reputation of his multi-million dollar legal firm is shattered, his partner commits suicide (maybe?) and his son's reputation is left in tatters. The story really begins in earnest when a cynical, conniving director of the CIA and an unscrupulous outgoing president hatch an idea to solve the continuing puzzle of who owns Neptune. Grant Backman a pardon, create a false identity for him in another country, be a little less than 100% efficient in guarding this identity and location and, finally, sit back to see who comes gunning for him! Joel Backman's character as a man, a failed father, a wealthy lawyer and power broker, a broken prisoner, a driven student of culture and language and a newly minted caring lover is exceptionally well-developed. Francesca Ferro, his language tutor, is equally well crafted and a wonderfully detailed study of an enigmatic and sophisticated but very human European woman. While its fundamental premise is a tad over the top and registers a little low on the credibility meter, THE BROKER is an enjoyable spy vs spy suspense thriller with the legal overtones for which Grisham is so well known. It's a cautionary tale that warns of the dangers of power without checks, balances and accountability. It's a dark and sinister story that should terrify readers about the extent to which an unscrupulous government spy agency will go, ostensibly in the interests of national security. Finally, and perhaps this will be quite difficult to believe, it is also a charming low-key romance and a wonderfully informative travelogue on Italian life in the city of Bologna. By the bye, THE BROKER also relates an exceptionally interesting narrative of the difficulties of cultural assimilation and learning a foreign language. As surprising as the juxtaposition of these story components may be, Grisham has pulled it all off quite effortlessly. It's not a combination that will work and be of interest to every reader but I found it thoroughly enjoyable and charming at the same time as it was exciting. THE BROKER is a fine addition to Grisham's already excellent and well-stocked body of work. Highly recommended. Paul Weiss",0,0.9938,0.117,0.687,0.195,0.5585866477272727,POSITIVE,0.9938
208,726688933,02/02/2017,1.0,"Summary Statement: Despite its captivating beginning and well-written dialogue, 'The Broker' ultimately suffers due to poor pacing and a failure to deliver on its promise.Extended Review:John Grisham's 'The Broker' is about a notorious Washington power broker named Joel Backman who has spent the last six years locked away in federal prison for having committed a number of felonies that influenced the outcome of a presidential election. After losing his re-election in a historic defeat, outgoing President Arthur Morgan grants one final pardon to Joel Backman, who is quietly smuggled out of America with a new name and identity, and forced to live in Italy. He is unaware, however, that the CIA has also leaked information about his whereabouts to a number of foreign countries who want Backman dead for various reasons involved with his crimes, putting this corrupt broker on a desperate path to stay alive.I was very eager to read this book considering I was aware of John Grisham's massive success as a writer of mystery and thriller, and that the only other book I had read of his up until now was a lesser-known piece of work called 'Playing for Pizza,' which was very different from most of his other works and nothing anyone would recommend to a first-time reader of his. I was eager to read a book of his that fell in line with his forte, and while I do not believe 'The Broker' is a terrible book, I was unable to give it more than 1 star because I ultimately stopped reading the book because I lost interest in the story, and per my usual rules, books I drop automatically receive one star.'The Broker' does have the distinction of being the only 'dropped' book of mine where I skipped ahead to read the final two chapters to see the ending. I'll probably do this in other dropped books just for some assurance that the author at least had the ability to structure their book in a way that led to a cohesive endpoint and strong conclusion. I would say 'The Broker' passed this test, even though I undoubtedly missed some intriguing climax somewhere in the third act.My biggest complaint with 'The Broker' is how it fails to deliver on the promise it gives the reader. If you read the synopsis I wrote at the beginning of this review, or the actual synopsis on its Goodreads page, you would be inclined to think this book would focus primarily on this criminal's desperate struggle to stay alive despite the staggering number of people who want him dead for reasons you, the reader, don't know about and are curious to know. That's what I went in expecting, and the first few chapters (fifty to sixty pages, or so) do a fantastic job at getting you invested. We're introduced to this broker whose name alone is enough to draw suspicion, we know he's dangerous but we don't know why, and we know there are several people who want him dead. I was on board with the story from the first chapter and I wanted to learn more, but sadly the rest of the book fails to capitalize on that in several ways.For example, there is a substantial amount of the book's second act that involves Joel trying to learn to speak Italian. I was obviously expecting the transition from life in an American prison to a secret new life in a foreign country to be a jarring experience and that some time would be taken for Joel to grapple with his new way of living, but Oh. My. God. Half of this book, to me, felt like Joel was trying to learn to speak Italian. That is not an exaggeration. Each time a chapter ended I expected that to be the last scene Grisham would spend developing Backman in this way, and that the story was about to delve into the assassination attempts and the dark, corrupt history I wanted to know more about, but pretty soon it all just became scene after scene of Joel wandering around Italy practicing Italian and I just did not care at all about any of this. The most interesting chapters in this section of the book are actually set back in America, going over things that happen with the former president, vice president, and backstories about what happened before Joel was even sent to prison. I often asked myself if these subplots and backstories would have been a better starting point for the book than the one Grisham wrote, and I ultimately decided they would be.I myself am an aspiring author. I have a rule for myself that I ascribe that a writer shouldn't make a reader wait for a story to get interesting. You can't write a book that relies entirely on some amazing third act climax or plot twist and expect your readers will slog through the first half of your book just to find out what happens, because people don't always finish reading books. Every chapter, every scene, every paragraph even, needs to keep some kind of intrigue or tension, but sadly there is so much this book that just felt like it was stalling until something interesting happened later. This is a book that has a lot of secrets. There's a lot of information that's hidden from the reader to create intrigue which I felt really ruined the pacing of the story because it kept me so unaware of so many things for too long that I eventually lost that spark and didn't have any reason to keep reading. More importantly, I actually found myself not really caring what happened, which is the most important thing a book needs to do. I asked myself halfway through reading this book if I cared whether or not Joel lived or died, and I honestly didn't have a preference. There are very few outright likable characters in this book. That's not a problem for me, since there are plenty of books, shows, and movies like 'House of Cards' or 'The Godfather' that are highly acclaimed and get audiences to root for characters who are criminals with a lust for power and wealth, but the reason why these characters are so captivating is because of their motivation. They want respect, and they want power, the same things most of us dream of having, and so watching them has an almost cathartic appeal. Joel Backman doesn't have this charisma because he really doesn't want anything except to stay alive, so when he isn't desperately fighting for his life every chapter the story loses its tension, which causes the pacing to drag, and ultimately, the story itself is ruined.Without giving any spoilers, I know from a quick exchange in the final chapter that Backman's life was saved at some point, which I'm sure means that there was some near-death heart-pounding climax in the third act that I missed, and it probably reveals the true nature of Backman's crimes that were eluded to in the beginning. I trust John Grisham is smart enough to craft a story that at least leads to conclusion. But I don't give books points because they explain a mystery—that should be a given. I don't care about plot continuity as much as I care about how invested I am in knowing what happens next, and halfway through reading this book I decided I wasn't. The lack of tension, motivation, and the multiple POV shifts left me with so many scenes in which I didn't know what was relevant and all of Grisham's brilliant work in the first few chapters just fizzled out and suddenly I felt like I wasn't reading a story so much as waiting for an ending.Despite my mostly negative thoughts on this book, I was impressed by Grisham's skill at crafting clever dialogue and definitely the signs of his talent. I would be interested in reading one of his more well-known books so I can get a better taste of him. Maybe I'll get a copy of 'The Pelican Brief' if I get the chance. Even after giving a bad review, I'm always willing to be impressed.Thank you for reading!",0,0.9903,0.097,0.776,0.127,0.4644265037721413,NEGATIVE,1.0
209,3889463675,03/14/2021,2.0,"I can only assume that, sometime in 2004, John Grisham vacationed in Italy and it left an impression. In two back-to-back books—2005’s The Broker and 2007’s Playing for Pizza—Grisham uses Italy as his backdrop, giving readers quite a different setting than what we’re used to from him. Joel Backman is considered to one of the most powerful lobbyists in Washington, but with great power comes a good chance that someone’s going to screw you over. When a shady deal he’s brokering goes south, Backman’s left holding the bag and sent to prison. Six years later, there are other certain unknown interests who want to know what Backman knows. For national security reasons, the US government wants to know who wants to know, so they set up a plan to use Backman as bait. He gets a full pardon on the condition he leave the country, and then they wait to see who tries to kill him. The middle part of the book moves from thriller to tourism, as Grisham slows down to revel in the details of Bologna, Italy. A fair part of the book is simply a suspicious but unknowing Backman getting used to a new country, language, and name. Slowly but surely, he realizes that the CIA has had ulterior motives all along. Backman manages to survive several assassination attempts, confirming his suspicions, and it all leads to one final brokered deal.The Broker is a wannabe spy novel that instead spends much of its time reading like an American Yankee in the Pope’s Court. Grisham’s descriptions are vivid and engaging, but do nothing to further the plot. The middle of the book is supposed to be the meat, but Grisham simply strings us along to the end. It’s like he didn’t know what to do once he got his main character to Italy but, by golly, let’s sit down and enjoy the sights a bit. Hilariously, for all the book’s attempt at being a travel guide, it isn’t even a particularly good one, sporting more than a few inaccuracies. Usually, you can brush this aside as creative license, but none of the inaccuracies are…well…creative. They’re just incorrect facts that have no bearing on the story and, since the story seems intent on telling us a lot about Bologna, I have to critique it on those grounds. The thriller/spy element to the story is a bit far-fetched and doesn’t come across as believable, leading to an ending that could have just as easily happened from the outset, avoiding all the drama to begin with. The Broker is one of those novels that you can applaud Grisham for in trying to step out of the genre that made him famous, but it’s really just a reminder that Grisham is really good at one thing and most of his attempts outside of fictional courtrooms have been anemic at best.

210,3264836236,04/05/2020,3.0,"Having read a range of John Grisham’s books (which I mostly enjoyed), I picked this one up, mostly because of the author rather than the plot line. The synopsis did not particularly grab my attention; being stuck in the covid-19 lockdown, I am working through my collection of books and decided to give it a go....Whereas the previous books I have read of John Grisham, were mostly lawyer/court room based, this one revolved around politics and espionage.I think as my expectations of this book were quite low (as afore mentioned the synopsis did not particularly appeal), I was pleasantly surprised to find myself engaged in the storyline. The premise of the story is set around a ‘lobbyist’ who was jailed for trying to sell a programme that controls satellite intelligence. As someone who didn’t know what a lobbyist is (and have to say, I still don’t understand), Joel Backman’s (main character) role and crime, where slightly lost on me. However, I enjoyed the espionage side of the book, when the CIA work to smuggle out Joel Backman and set him up with a new life. Rather that glossing over what this might actually be like - to be pardoned for a crime, be released 14 years early from prison and then whisked to a new country and life - Grisham took the Joel on a journey of emotions - the fear of the unknown, the frustrations of having his life dictated by the CIA agents, the contrast of this new life to his previous high-flying existence and in solitary confinement in prison. Bearing in mind, Joel had committed a crime and before he went to prison he was greedy, selfish, demanding...etc, I had very little sympathy or empathy for him, however through Grisham’s developing of his character I found myself sympathising with Joel, and hoping he is able to outwit the CIA and those wanting to kill him. In some of Grisham’s books that I’ve read, I find I neither care or engage with the characters when reading, so for me this seemed an improvement.I think the ending felt a bit abrupt for me - there were a few unanswered questions and incomplete storylines when the book came to an end. I think there were elements of the story that were unnecessary (won’t mention to avoid spoilers), which showed when they tailed off and were never addressed again in the story. All in all for an easy read and something different from Grisham, I would recommend it.",0,-0.9756,0.126,0.803,0.071,0.4952581369248034,NEGATIVE,0.9878

Joel Backman finds himself suddenly pardoned, after six years securely behind bars, by an outgoing one-term President who doesn’t read his daily intelligence briefing. Sound familiar? It’s uncanny how so many authors have a knack for predicting the future. Anyway, the CIA, who secured Backman’s pardon, hides him for a while in Italy until they are ready to release him to the wolves for slaughter. The problem is that they have to keep an eye on him, because they want to find out who wants Backman dead. Then the CIA will know who launched some very sophisticated surveillance satellites whose software Backman’s Pakistani contacts hacked. Backman, true to his nickname, had brokered a deal with the Saudis for the software that takes control of the satellites, but pleaded guilty when his scheme was discovered, and all of his fellow schemers wound up dead. The storyline becomes a little tedious while Backman, in his witness protection of sorts, is studying Italian with a CIA-supplied tutor, eating scrumptious food, and exploring centuries-old cathedrals. However, the frenetic finale more than makes up for this short pause in the action. Obviously, Backman’s deeds brand him as an opportunist without a moral compass, but Grisham lures us into rooting for him nonetheless. Maybe we are willing dupes because Backman’s handlers are so much more despicable. Given Backman’s reputation and history, it’s hard to fathom why his son, whose own legal career Backman virtually destroyed, would willingly help him. The son and the reader can only hope that Backman has realized the error of his ways and that he will somehow right the many wrongs that he has left in his wake.",0,-0.0909,0.086,0.808,0.106,0.4906994047619047,NEGATIVE,0.9939
214,1318976824,12/08/2021,4.0,"In most ways, THE BROKER is a straightforward John Grisham thriller. Joel Backman, the titular broker, one of the most powerful players in Washington, D.C., tried to sell a technology that got his partners killed. He pled guilty to charges and went to prison where the assassins who took out his associates couldn't reach him. Six years later, he's pardoned by a president on the way out, and the assassins who were after him over half a decade ago are gunning for him again.Where BROKER differs is the type of stakes involved. The CIA sends Joel to Bologna, Italy, a city and country where he knows no one, doesn't speak the language, and has no money to survive. He depends on the government, but he suspects that same government of shipping him him out of the US so they can sit back and wait to see which of the assassins get to him first and force him to spill his guts about the secrets he's kept for the past six years before killing them.Before prison, Joel was reprehensible.

Not often, but it does occur. The Broker simply does not stand up to his usual excellent standard of writing.It is a book that starts out slowly and ends rather slowly.

Yes, I admired the proponent's (and was he really a proponent?) determination to learn Italian in a short amount of time. But did I have to read each phrase that he learned? It felt that way and the plot line suffered consequentially. And the laboured descriptions of each church and cathedral visited was, in my opinion, unnecessary. The characters in the book were flawed. I found myself wanting to like ""Marco"" (aka Joel) but there was just as many reasons to dislike him for what he had done, both to his family as well as his nation.

Now let us see if Pres. Trump's reelection comes close to the fictional one herein depicted, or that he gets a divorce as well.	This si a a story of a political man, a lobbyist lawyer, who was brought down by the powers that be because he and his associates got involved in matters that were national security threats of various nations, the United States being one. The others were killed, but he was indicted on some trumped up charges. To save his skin, he plead guilty, and was sentenced to solitary confinement for the duration of his twenty (20) year prison term. But after six (6) years, the president, on the day of the of his successor, is willing to parole this fellow at the behest of the CIA, and the CIA will take care of him. The actual plan for him is that he will be freed, but exiled. He is taken care of, and given language lessons. The CIA figures that the other nations will kill him as soon as they can, if not kidnap him for what he knows, and the CIA wants to know who will do so.	Then he turns the tables on the CIA, He does what ever it takes to free himself of the stuff that is so deadly, and becomes a truly free man,.

It became monotonous, and if his intent was to introduce his readers to some basic Italian, than adding pronunciation guides would've helped tremendously!

All of Grisham's books are riffs on escape-whether it's from the bad guys, surveillance, the Feds, or the corrupt, soul-destroying corporate world that traps us all. Grisham's obsession with Italy is prevalent in this story. It is here that the character-once again like all Grisham's protagonists-relearns what's important, reinvents his life, and gains redemption. This story is nothing like Grisham’s other books. Over half of it is a slow repetition of a man trying to learn Italian. After a while it starts to sound like a tourist guide but Grisham still knows how to tell an intriguing story. The thing about this story that sets it apart from everything else is that while it had to do with law, it had more to do with politics, power, money, and international espionage. I got to ""live"" them vicariously through Grisham’s love of Italy, and his vivid characterizations. I found it believable and strangely powerful and, of course, it's almost impossible to stop reading toward the end.

All is not as rosy as it seems because Teddy Maynard, legendary CIA Director wants him free in order to see who will kill him. It seems that Blackman's downfall was trying to broker/sell a satellite spy system that was better than anything the U.S. had. He is put into a witness protection program in Italy with his handler, Luigi. The idea is that, after he's adjusted to Italy and learned the language and the customs, he will be cut loose and watched to see who comes after him, the Russians, the Israelis, the Saudis or the Chinese. Supposedly that will lead the CIA to the creator of the system. I had a hard time with the reasoning since everyone associated with its theft had been murdered and still, no one knew where it came from.Blackman's justified paranoia serves him well and he is able to confound his handlers so that he can be truly free. In a sub-plot, he falls in love with Francesca his middle-aged language teacher. With the help of his son, Neal, Blackman puts his plan to save himself in motion. As the story progresses, Blackman realizes what a jerk he had been chasing money and power to the exclusion of everything else in his life. He's still a very clever operator but he begins to develop a more humane side. While there are not a lot of surprises, Blackman's efforts to escape his fate are interesting and provide what suspense the book holds. The book is an enjoyable way to pass time. I read most of it while traveling. There are other far more exciting Grisham books. Nevertheless, I can recommend this effort as a fun read.

From appearing to be someone who only cares about himself, by the end of the novel I found myself fearing for the safety of Francesca, Neil and his family.

This book combines those threads to a degree I didn't see in The Litigators, although The Associate comes close. To a greater degree than in most of his books (The Reckoning and The Litigators come to mind), the hero is less than heroically ethical, but you will pull for him nonetheless.The formula involves legal thriller, espionage thriller, fish-out-of-water adaptation, and JG's love for all things Italian.

His descriptions were so extensive that I had to pause the book and google him to see what his fixation with Italy was...and sure enough in a few interviews he expressed his love for the country. Grisham's descriptions of Italy were so detailed. Sometimes too detailed. I felt like I was smack in the middle of Bologna right along on the ride with Joel. But I also felt like this was a travel guide through Italy. More time was spent on describing the ambiance than developing the storyline and the characters. Nonetheless Mr. Grisham did reasonably well with his storytelling and holding my attention.

It has a certain slowness to it though.

Yes, it's good that the reader understand the protagonist's struggle to fit into a new culture, but at times the book resembles more an Italian phrase book.
