0,85546448,01/18/2010,1.0,"3 days before Christmas found me standing in Smiths, with zero inspiration, looking at the bestsellers shelves - and wondering why the hell I would want to read any of them. Katy Price, Jonathan Ross, Chris Evans...celebrity ""auto"" biographies... blah, blah blah. Then in post Christmas desperation I picked up Dear Fatty from the shelves at home...and half way through I was still wondering why I was bothering. Now, I like Dawn French, I love F&S and the Vicar of Dibley, she is very, very talented, and very, very funny - but does that mean that her life might be of interest to me just because she’s famous? I mean it probably wouldn’t be if she wasn’t famous would it? Viz the opening of one chapter ""I loved Lincoln"" - yes well I'm sure you did Dawn, great place, but why is that worthy of my reading time? I expect lots of people love Lincoln. What I am questioning here is the premise that text has an intrinsic worth if it is framed in the context of a celeb life – parts of Dawn’s life are indeed interesting, some are tragic, but none is momentous in any wider sense – well, not yet, anyway. Now, in case this sounds overly crabby, I have read “Rich: the Life of Richard Burton” by Melvyn Bragg twice, and will probably go for a third read because it is a stupendous biog of a stupendous life. Plus it has the advantage of time – it was written at a decent interval after the death of the subject, which gives us time to reflect on a life hard-lived, time to put that life into context, and assess the contribution, the impact, the significance. Come on guys – your lives aren’t even half over and you’re boring us rigid already – leave the autobiogs until there is something to say ....oh, unless this is all really just about the money....",15,0.9901,0.076,0.75,0.175,0.6018888888888888,NEGATIVE,0.9973
1,35463976,10/16/2008,5.0,"I love watching Dawn French on TV and so I naturally had to have her book when it was released.The book takes the less-used form of a collection of letters written to various people in her life. Through the letters she communicates her most prominent memories of experiences in her life. Dawn definitely has a way with words. The writing flows well and it's made all the better by the fact that she's written it herself instead of having a ghost writer do it for her. The letters she writes manage to be funny (naturally) and heart-wrenching all at the same time. The letters to her Dad are particularly touching, as he committed suicide when she was 19 and left her with so many unanswered questions. I like the fact that she's been pretty honest throughout the book, whilst managing to keep the private things private. She writes to her husband - Lenny Henry - but doesn't really go into lots of intimate details. I respect her more for this - there are too many autobiographies now that feel the need to reveal Everything. I loved this book, and I also really enjoyed looking through the (many) photographs that accompany the letters. Dawn has led a pretty interesting life, and after reading her book I like her even more.",13,0.9894,0.019,0.792,0.189,0.5232758620689655,POSITIVE,0.9995

I usually steer well clear of autobiographies but enjoyed this immensely (apart from the bizarre letters to Madonna). Dawn's warm personality and touching bonds with family shine through on every page. One chapter in particular is heart-wrenching and worth the read, I think, for anyone who has suffered the pain of the suicide of a loved one, as I have. All the questions, bewilderment and frustration are laid very bare indeed.

4,2885635444,07/09/2019,2.0,"I really wanted to like this, I suppose I was sucked in by the title 'Dear Fatty' and assumed it was going to be more about her experience as a plus size woman in the public eye but sadly not. Fatty is actually her nickname for Jennifer Saunders and the whole book is laid out as a series of letters to various people. I really disliked this format because the friends/family are never properly introduced so I spent their entire letter trying to work out who they are, and there are also some addressed to celebrities, most of whom I'm too young to know (I'm 26 and have no idea who David Cassidy is, sorry Dawn). The letters to Madonna were the worst because they were written in a bizarre accent and couldn't figure out why - maybe I missed the joke there but I ended up just skipping them all.She introduces the book by saying that she considers it to be memoirs rather than an autobiography as she doesn't want to bore us with every little detail, but sadly it ended up as exactly that. A large percentage of the book is stories about random girls she went to school with, boys she snogged, how much she loves Lincoln etc. - it's very dull, and the monotony drowns out the parts of the book that are genuinely touching, such as when she's talking about her dad's suicide, or her and Lenny Henry's struggles with racism.It felt like she didn't want to write about herself at all as all of the letters feature large rambles about how wonderful various other people are and thanking them, which is nice, but I wanted to know more about Dawn (as an adult) and I didn't get that from this. Some other important life events, such as her struggles with IVF are very glossed over. I think you would enjoy it if you're a massive fan of Dawn French and are familiar with her other works, but I found it hard to get through.",6,-0.9621,0.142,0.768,0.091,0.4933831672203765,NEGATIVE,1.0

7,183213839,07/08/2011,2.0,"This autobiography is very slight. In the first half Dawn reminisces about her grandmothers, her brother, her school friends. I was bored to pieces. Later it picks up as Dawn almost marries, and then loses a loved one. Toward the end we get a bit of her early friendship with Jennifer Saunders and their time in The Comic Strip. A bit of Lenny Henry and issues surrounding race in Britain. She says a lot of nice things to her husband but they were probably seriously talking about divorce when she turned this in to the publishers. A brief mention of The Vicar of Dibley. I’m a huge fan of Dawn French and wanted to know what makes her tick, who were her comedic influences, what was her creative process with Jennifer. Did she have any professional disappointments? She has long been a spokesperson for large women, did both a Southbank Show and a book of flashy sweater knitting patterns on the subject, but says nothing political on the matter. This autobiography treats its subject as if she were just an ordinary woman and goes about telling completely banal stories that could have happened to almost anyone. Much of the problem is in the telling. Any story can be interesting if well told. But overall I want to hear about events that are outside an average person’s experience. I want to know more about her comedy which has touched myself and my close relationships so deeply. I think that her generation of female comedians had a rough time in their early careers and learned not to talk about themselves, wishing the work to speak for itself. I would love to hear her thoughts about the state of comedy today. It is strange that she was reluctant to speak about her career yet was able to speak with a (for me, uncomfortable) amount of vulnerability about her formative years. This book will leave me scratching my head until I have forgotten it completely, which should be sometime next week. ",4,0.977,0.064,0.801,0.135,0.4050892857142857,NEGATIVE,0.9954
8,68083974,08/19/2009,3.0,"I enjoyed reading this book and, as autobiographies go, found that in the end I had gained in my knowledge about the witty and rather gregarious lady that is Dawn French. I liked the style of writing in the book, however edited, and French does go into some detail about various aspects and stages of her life. Moments of the book are laugh out loud funny but moreover the book is sensitive and nostalgic about subjects such as childhood, school, friends, (and especially) family, etc. You do get the picture that 'people' are the moving force and inspiration to French's life rather than the money, power and fame thing, etc. a la Jordan et Pete. This is refreshing considering the way UK celeb culture constantly inflates and defaltes itself as of late. French is definitely more genuine and whole a character. There are moments in the book that bug me, for example, when French 'over'jokes in specific chapters just for the gag factor. Unfunny French. Just stick to the autobio please and tell us about YOU - save the 'specific' jokes for the stage/telly if you please! In other parts of the book, French seems especially guarded like she really struggles with aspects of her fame. This is something that I, and I'm sure other readers, will continue to find contradictory. Surely one walks into fame aware of the pifalls of bittersweet life, rough with smooth, etc. Non? In all a satisfactory read though. Entertaining, different, well put together, informative and a reminder, if ever we needed one, that family does, must and should come first.",4,0.9947,0.037,0.751,0.212,0.4840643274853801,POSITIVE,0.9915

I was initially disappointed that Dawn wasn't reading it herself, but she does a short section at the beginning saying she felt some of it too personal and difficult to have attempted to read herself. Ok, fair enough. She enlisted a friend, Liza Tarbuck, to do the reading, and she does a great job. Liza sounds quite a bit like Dawn actually. The book is written as a series of letters to family, and friends, and would be friends like the letter her teenage self writes to David Cassidy. There's great stuff here. Some very funny. Often intelligent and well observed. Some very poignant. We learn early on that Dawn's father is to die quite young, and the most poignant letters are often those Dawn has written to her now dead father.

Oh well, like I said Dawn has had a pretty darn interesting life, full of people and I really admire her self-confidence and upbeat attitude.

Some of it, though, was a bit long and even a tad boring. I also can't say I really understand the author more now than I did prior to reading the book.

(For those that haven't read the book, each chapter starts Dear 'Someone' as you address your thoughts to a family member or dear friend) I was introduced to Dawn by my wife, who is from England. We have enjoyed so much of your humour and acting; French and Saunders, The Vicar of Dibbly, your acting in Lark Rise to Candleford, etc. So I have been interested in reading this for quite awhile since I bought it for the missus back in 2008. I have to say that I've enjoyed this look at your life, the highs and lows. I found it especially interesting that you were a military brat like I was; my father was also in the Air Force, the Canadian Air Force, mind you. So I have an appreciation with that portion of your life; the moving around constantly, the trying to make and keep friends who you might only know for 2 or 3 years.There were many touching and poignant moments in this book. I can't relate to it but I found those portions dealing with your father's internal struggles very touching. Your family dealt with it strongly and seems to have made the most of their lives, especially your mothers. I particularly enjoyed hearing about your life in the Comic Strip and your development as a comic and actress. I wish there might have been more covered about that aspect of your life.

16,114876322,08/02/2010,5.0,"Dawn French (one half of the British comedy duo, French and Saunders) may be one of the funniest women alive today. The other funniest woman alive today is Jennifer Saunders, the other half of French and Saunders. For those not familiar with either, they have had a successful run at BBC with their variety show, French and Saunders; Dawn French may be best known for her role in The Vicar of Dibley; Jennifer Saunders is probably best know for her role as Edina in Absolutely Fabulous; both have also starred in shows too numerous to list here. And every single show that I have seen them in has been top notch.Dear Fatty is Dawn French's memoir. Like anything that French does, her memoir is frequently laugh-out-loud funny. What surprised me most about her memoir is how unflinchingly honest she is throughout. She relates her life, both its ups and downs, as best she remembers it. Written in the form of letters to her friends and loved ones, Dear Fatty touches on the funny and the sad in French's life. For instance, one letter is to her father, who committed suicide when she was 19, and in one paragraph that goes on for almost two pages, she asks him questions. Why he did what he did; why didn't he ask for help; etc. By the end of this particular letter, I'm not ashamed to say that I had tears in my eyes. Her frustration of 30 years of unanswered questions is so evident, and she does nothing to hide that. Of course, not wanting to keep her readers in too serious a mood, she immediately segues into far more lighthearted material, but that honesty is there and it can be raw and emotional, and I respect her all the more for it.I never doubted her ability to write; watch any of her sketches or shows, and it's obvious she has a talent, and she excels at proving that over and over again in her book. One of my favorite lines from the book is:‎""It's a process of having faith in the self you don't quite know you are yet... Believing that you will find the strength, the means somehow, and trusting in that...""Words that speak volumes to me in my life right now.I don't that many people would rush out to buy this book. First off, I'm not even sure it's available in the US yet, and secondly, I don't know that anyone who isn't a fan of Dawn French would really care all that much. But for those of us who are fans, this is a gem of a book, and even if you aren't a fan of Dawn French, I still think you'd find this a funny and revealing look into the life of one of the funniest ladies out there right now.Highly recommended.",2,0.9971,0.036,0.777,0.187,0.4263650579440051,POSITIVE,0.9995
17,115615347,08/07/2010,4.0,"In this epistolary memoir, Dawn French writes to her loved ones in turn, sharing stories from her life and telling each person what they have meant to her. She also imparts sage advice for those following in her path. These letters range from the sublime (every letter to her late father), to the hilarious (the letter to the families for whom she babysat during her college days) to the frankly silly and pointless (lame jokes in letter form to her comedy partner, Jennifer Saunders; pointless asides to Madonna). Dawn lost her father when she was a young adult, and this loss reaches across the whole of her life. Denys French has cast a loving shadow over her loves, her work and her self-esteem. Every teenage girl should have the pep talk that Dawn's father gave to her - I know it would have meant the world to me to hear those words when I was in the heart of my most unsure years. The most bittersweet section is the lengthy letter that Dawn writes to her then-husband, Lenny Henry. She states that the book could be titled ""Love Letter to Len"" and could be all about how marvelous he is, and that there's nothing the two of them cannot face together. This portion makes me terribly sad, because while there is obviously deep and abiding love there, we have learned in the years since this book came out that love wasn't enough. Dawn French and Lenny Henry divorced in 2010, after spending more than half of their lives together. All in all, this is a rich, loving remembrance of a life well lived, though I wish she had skipped the silly jokes to Jennifer (jokes that my friends and I were telling to one another in grade school; unworthy of Dawn's talent). This is a small quibble - they are short sections in a book full of beautiful stories about Dawn and her ""BF"" buying baby supplies without the press getting the idea that they were for Dawn herself, and about how Dawn maintained her sense of humor as best she could during some very dark times.

Dawn French is a funny woman and this memoir presents plenty of hilarious and awkward moments from her life but also shares some of the heartbreak she has experienced. It's more personal than I expected with her very successful career more a backdrop to her emotional, nostalgic journey through her memories and a tribute to those who have been a part of it. I admit I was a little disappointed that her 13 years as The Vicar of Dibley is given fairly short shrift as I imagine that much hilarity ensued behind the scenes of that program and that is the character I know her best as. Still I enjoyed reading about how she build her career and partnership with Saunders. Given the demise of her relationship with Lenny Henry after the book's publication the letters have some real poignancy when she address her husband. There are significant gaps in this memoir which is in no way comprehensive but it is an endearing mix of frank honesty, self depreciating wit that nevertheless still carefully guards her privacy.

Although this rare format is probably contrived, I felt it let me get to know Dawn French better than the typical biography account of her life thus far. The ""Fatty"" in question is her close friend and comedy collaborator Jennifer Saunders, and although French addresses many things to her, it is her beloved father (who died when she was just 19) who is at the metaphorical receiving end of many of Dawn's heart-felt scribblings. Her strong-willed, stoic mother features heavily also, providing many of the sad moments just as easily as she triggers some of the happier, funnier moments in the book through Dawn's funny family anecdotes. Of course, with every celebrity biography there is a lot of delicious namedropping. Saunders (given), Edmondson, Mayall, Sayle, Planer, Richardson, Elton, Curtis, Henry and the list goes on...Overall, DEAR FATTY is an honest, intimate look into Dawn French's life outside the fame and the larger than life characters she is known for playing on-screen... with a bit of her usual persona self for good measure!

Towards the end I started losing interest in the name dropping (of apparently famous people) and her writing style, but heck, she is an actor, a comic and not a literary genius.

37,3131295632,07/21/2020,3.0,So I only read this as a friend was throwing it out as part of her new year declutter. I dipped in and out throughout the year so far (and its been a long one!). This was released around 2007 I think and it has dated somewhat. Not only has the world moved on but a lot of the anecdotes take on a different tinge when the writer is no longer 51 and married etc but 63 and divorced and quite changed.This felt a little bit like reading old blog entries from a blogger you have followed recently. It is the same person but its not. There is a lot of nostalgia which both worked and didn't for me in this book. I have a brunette sister born 1957 so some of the cultural references were great and humourous and relevant. However I did not grow up in Britain and do not have a great knowledge of some of the popular culture references of the 1980's and 1990's. This made it both informative (who knew who she did early comedy with and the photos were great). But also this made it feel a tiny bit self indulgent - guess who I knew before they were famous type stuff.I guess if you knew more about Dawn French this might be fun but I don't beyond a couple of sitcoms and charity appearances so make of that what you will. I think this may have been why I was not engrossed or fascinated as much as I have been by other memoirs of those I know of a little better (Miranda Hart springs to mind). Also the overriding impression was how oddly the book has dated. On the plus side it is well paced and well edited.,0,0.9904,0.025,0.827,0.148,0.509090909090909,NEGATIVE,1.0

I’ve read Eminem, Mae West (about Fred and Rose) and Gary Barlow before embarking on my French and Saunders ones. First I read Dawn’s and I’ve just started Jen’s.I’m not much of a book reviewer, I tend to just star them at the end on my kindle and that is pretty much that... until I read this book.I really enjoyed how she wrote the book as a form of letters to people, it kept me interested.One thing I have to admit to is I really really related to a section of her book about bridesmaids when she was 11. I felt her devastating pain, I cried with her and I felt the “rabid injustice” and “howling tornado of hurt” at not being chosen 😭. Having never EVER been asked to be a bridesmaid - or a godmother either incidentally (ok so technically I have been a bridesmaid age 3 - but I don’t remember it so in my eyes it doesn’t bloody well count!). At least Dawn was told she hadn’t cut the muster and then she eventually managed to achieve her bridesmaid dream.... me however.... Didn’t get told that I didn’t make it, and got left to my own horrid brain to think up reasons (and believe me completely irrational reasons) why I wasn’t good enough, and I felt every ounce of the above pain that Dawn felt at age 11. I spent that wedding pretty much unable to say much and trying to avoid cameras so they couldn’t see me or the tears that were ready to spill at any moment, should anyone look me in the eye too long. The only happiness I felt that day was that I did actually get chance to see her get married even if I wasn’t a chosen one. I wouldn’t have missed it for the world.I’m not quite as lucky as Dawn, I don’t think I ever will get the chance now, I’m 40, who truly wants a 40 year old bridesmaid? Dawn - if you read this and you get married again, consider me please 😆. I’d make a good godmother too by the way....shameless self promotion there!Hell, I might just buy myself a bridesmaid dress and keep it in the wardrobe and wear it around the house whenever I feel like it 😆😆🤣So, back to the review:Did I enjoy it?

61,697449176,08/17/2013,3.0,"I have wanted to read this book since its release in 2008. So imagine my delight when I spotted it for 20 p in our local Post Office. Due to some of reviews I had read previously I did open the book with a few misgivings, but I was soon won over.The book begins with a segment of lyrics taken from the song Smaller by Alison Moyet: I used to dance to the drum in your chest, My feet on your feet, My head at your breast,You gave me a tune and I carry it still, And I promise my darling, that I ever will. Following this there is then a letter entitled Dear You. It begins with stating that she has decided to think of this book more of a memoir rather than an auto-biography. The reason she states is because she believes an auto-biography is in chronological order and has to touch on the sometimes quite dull aspects of her life. In her memoir Dawn French only recounts the memories that are especially important to her or she has a vivid memory of.Each chapter is a letter addressed to a variety of people that have touched her life for example her father, Jennifer Saunders (Fatty), her niece but also people such as Madonna and David Cassidy.Before I read this book I admired Dawn French and thought very highly of her and truly do regard her as one of Britian's greatest talents. I was relieved that this book did nothing to destroy my view of her and lived up to what I expected it to be, a heartwarming, funny and reflective romp through her life. Of course just the same as everyone else she has experienced heart break, disappointment and tragedy, such as the tragic death of her father when she was 19 years old, but through her letters she deals with each of these things with true compassion and is reflective instead of negative.I loved all the stories especially those towards the end of the book in connection to her career. The Vicar of Dibley memories in her Dear Richard (Richard Curtis) were very funny. I also especially enjoyed the letter entitled Dear BF which described her bizarre family gatherings and her two very different grannies. Of course there were lots of stories I enjoyed. Unlike most celebrity writers the book does not come across as being self-indulgent and no topic appears to be off limits. I feel as though Dawn French has been very canny in delivering her stories in a series of letters. Instead of producing a series of long winded descriptive chapters about the various stages of her life, she have provided a variety of witty insights and has kept a measure of privacy at the same time.What I did not enjoy however were the letters addressed to Madonna, I did not understand the point of them. Also having read this post-Lenny, the letter dedicated to him was also a bit hard to read. I was a little sad when this celebrity couple broke-up. The photographs were also lovely, especially the ones of little Dawn, meeting the Queen Mother at her the RAF barracks.If you are fan of Dawn French and enjoy her sense of humour, you will love her book.",0,0.9976,0.067,0.749,0.184,0.5210440251572328,POSITIVE,0.9988
62,185672621,07/17/2011,4.0," So, it's in this spirit of reminiscence that I offer you this memoir of my life. My life so far, that is. To this end, I have decided to tell my story through letters, because this way, I can address my life to the people I've actually lived it with. I'm not normally a big fan of biographies, mostly because I don't care enough about most people to find their life story interesting. But a childhood of The Vicar of Dibley and a love of Absolutely Fabulous and a feeling that Dawn French is probably pretty damn awesome made me give Dear Fatty a go. It really helps that this is not really a biography. It's a series of anecdotes written to the important people in her life interspersed with hilarious and mocking letters to Madonna and the fan letters Dawn French wrote to the various stars of her childhood. They're not all written to ""impart wisdom and life lessons"" like Tuesdays with Morrie or stating the facts of a life in the way of ""I was born at 4:23 in the morning on _______ to parents ______ and _______.This book is about Dawn French reflecting on the first 50 years of her life as she is wrapping up the final tour of French and Saunders in preparation for how the next 50 will go. She is humble and witty with a really big heart and very few cross words to share. This book, and Dawn French is also really classy. The only embarassing stories are those about herself, and she still manages to keep the most personal moments of her life private, by only showing how these moments have shaped her life. I also learnt that Julie Walters could have been the Vicar of Dibley, and Dawn French could have been Julie Walters in Mamma Mia had it not been for her apalling singing. I think they are much better suited exactly where they were. I really enjoyed reading of her youthful antics (putting chameleons onto tartan rugs to see just how well they camouflage), the very loving moment her dad shares with her that gets sidetracked when he tells her that faceitous is one of the few words where the vowels appear in correct alphabetical order and most importantly, my favourite letter  Dear Parents of everyone I ever babysat for on pages 148-150. Dear Fatty is a fantastic celebration of a fantastic life filled with little moments and big moments, happy and sad and full of love and quirks.

It’s certainly a large part of the book, outlining her early days in the Comic Strip, the films she took part in, as well as her recent roles.However, the fascinating aspect of this book is the way that Dawn shares her life growing up, the relationships she’s had, her heartaches and her joys. She fiercely loves her family, her friends, and her colleagues, and that shines through. (However, she most certainly does not like Madonna! ;))The book is written as a series of letters, to various people.. a large proportion of these are written to her father, and it’s easy to understand why, as he had such an affect on her. One particular letter had me in tears, and I was so glad to see Dawn reaching a type of resolution by the end of the book.. which did make for a good place for it to finish.Dawn’s voice is obvious in the book, you can almost hear her speaking it in your mind.. in her own unique style. There are serious moments in the book, but the humour that you expect is always there. Who else would write a letter to her niece, talking about her life ahead of her.. including what it may be like to have a big bosom?!For anyone who has enjoyed watching Dawn French over the years, I would highly recommend this autobiography, not only as a peek into her life, but also as a better understanding of the sort of person she is.",0,0.9901,0.021,0.812,0.167,0.5490756302521008,POSITIVE,0.9947

The book takes a rather unusual form of a collection of letters written to various people in her life. Through the letters she communicates her most prominent memories of experiences in her life - from the day she found out she was getting to adopt her daughter, Billie, to first kisses (and all of the kisses from there. Her kiss list is quite extensive and still growing!) I like the fact that she's been pretty honest throughout the book, whilst managing to keep the private things private. She writes to her (now ex) husband - Lenny Henry - but doesn't really go into lots of intimate details. I respect her more for this - there are too many autobiographies now that feel the need to reveal Everything. She most certainly has a way with words. The writing flows well and it's made all the better by the fact that she's written it herself instead of having a ghost writer do it for her. The letters she writes manage to be funny (naturally) and heart-wrenching all at the same time. The letters to her Dad are particularly touching, as he committed suicide when she was 19 and left her with so many unanswered questions. After reading this I think I'll definitely look in to reading some of her fiction, which I know will be very different to this but I think with her way with words, it'll be pretty good!",0,0.9878,0.031,0.795,0.173,0.5411412151067323,POSITIVE,0.9995

I love Dawn French, but had read a few bad reviews of the book and couldn't see how the format was going to work - oh how wrong I was! By telling her life story through letters to people her life, French has been very clever - instead of paragraphs of description, you get short, witty incidents of her life, told in a way that is comfortable and familiar. There's a lot of sadness in her life, but also a humour that you'd expect, all muddled together in one very enjoyable read. A couple of niggles stopped me awarding a higher rating. The small one is that sometimes it was hard to work out who the people were that she was addressing, specially when nicknames were used. Sometimes it became clear as you read the letter, but a lot of the time I was left slightly in the dark - not that it meant you couldn't enjoy the letter, maybe just not understand the particular nuances.

212,556666298,01/24/2020,4.0,"I hadn’t intended to start my reading for 2020 with a string of memoirs by well-known faces, but this is my third in a row. Dawn French is by far the most well-known (and well-known to me) of the three I’ve read. I wouldn’t really class myself as a fan, exactly. I like her, I like her work and I’ve been aware of her since childhood, but I don’t follow her in any sense. I have, however, always had a warm feeling towards her and a sense that she is a woman to be admired. This very honest, rich and deep memoir has confirmed all that. French has structured this book around the people she loves, writing each chapter as a letter to someone she cares about (oh, and Madonna). This approach made the whole thing feel so much more personal, with raw emotion and reflection colouring each of the memories she recounts. She had such an interesting childhood, and this book focuses much more on her formative years (and her formative years in comedy) than it does her later career. As someone who was reading this out of interest in the person rather than the personality, I appreciated that. Of course she mentions many famous friends, but as a genuine part of her life rather than name dropping or kiss-and-tell (though there is a brilliant list of all the people she’s snogged). I think I probably picked this book up more for its title and that French is a prominent plus-sized woman, as I am always keen to learn from those who seem to be comfortable in their own skin. She does talk about living in a fat body, but contrary to my pre-reading assumptions Fatty is not French, and her body is not central to this book. Just as things should be, I suppose – she is so much more than her outward appearance, after all. She is obviously very funny, but she is also driven by love, values and the power of the relationships she holds so dear. I don’t think this will encourage me to follow her work any more closely, but I know I’ll appreciate what I do come across more now that I understand the woman behind it.",0,0.9985,0.0,0.772,0.228,0.4990384615384616,POSITIVE,0.9989
213,3836174780,02/13/2021,3.0,"*audiobook* Goodreads is mostly full of pricks so I'm not surprised to see lots of extremely harsh reviews for any book, but it seems especially weird here considering the book itself and the woman who wrote it. It's a light, distracting, and kind book (until it isn't, the stuff about her dad had me welling up at 2am) and, much like any autobiography not totally ghost-written, it's written in a way that's specific to the person's life and their mannerisms. If you're not interested in hearing about the plain bits of a celebrity's life, or you don't like the the way they express themselves, perhaps it's best to either find a genre better suited to you or simply put the book down? Life is too short. I myself don't typically like these things, but I won't put myself through something I dislike.I was sideswiped by some of the more emotional moments of this, but I did find the way it was written quite off-putting. It was extremely wordy (not a reading joke, lol) and reminded me of the times in high school I used a thesaurus to make my essays as explicit and emphasized as possible. It's extremely English. Maybe that's racist of me, I apologise. That being said, the letter format is compelling and hearing about her father's suicide isn't something I'll forget because of how honest and raw French wrote about it.I think I've learned that to enjoy an autobiography I either need to be truly obsessed with the person it's about, or I need to very much gel with how they've opted to go about it. It's an obvious comparison, but considering it's the only other one I've read, I did prefer Saunders' book.",0,0.9816,0.082,0.756,0.161,0.5563150901386196,NEGATIVE,0.9996

This may well have been intentional on her part, she would have had the opportunity to give us a full warts and all autobiography but instead fed us snippets. The chapters where she was brave enough to let us glimpse into her 'real' self warranted 5 stars, as you got the impression of someone who feels things really deeply and despite her on screen bravado is actually quite insecure and needs the love of those close to her. Particularly the writing of/to her father, who committed suicide when she was 19. These chapters were really captivating, she clearly misses him and in many ways was talking to him through this book. The other chapters just frivolously dipped into less meaningful and almost throw away stories.

She talks candidly about her father's suicide and it's impact on her family. For me, the big takeaway, was that French credits others support, almost as much as her own hard work, as heavy contributors to her success. I think French underestimates get own contributions and overestimates that of others. There's a dearth of characters later in life. Childhood stories are fanciful and full of life. Adult stories are less lively, more like recounting an itinerary.For those looking for juicy celebrity gossip, this is not the book. For those looking for a ""showbiz"" memoir, this is not it.

Everyone should read this and succumb to the sheer brilliance this book is. Magic. ",0,0.9788,0.025,0.711,0.264,0.5376190476190477,POSITIVE,0.9999
