2,3721818872,12/28/2020,1.0,"I am in pain.Make it stop. 🚨🚨🚨SPOILERS🚨🚨🚨TW: attempted suicide, depressionThis book begins with Bella Swan being grumpy because of her eighteenth birthday. Why, you might ask? Well, that's because she's now one year older than Edward looks, and we all know her entire life revolves around her relationship with Edward. She is devastated. She pressures him to bite her and turn her into a vampire, but he refuses, because ~reasons.~ He doesn't want her to ""lose her soul."" A few days later, Bella notices that there's something wrong with Edward. He's extremely moody all of a sudden (even more than he was before), and he's not talking to her. She decides to wait for him to approach her, instead of confronting him about why he's being a jerk, because her life is based on this guy she met half a year ago. Well, Edward breaks up with her. The Cullens move away, and Bella wallows in depression for four entire months. She decides to hang out with Jacob Black instead. He never seems to be wearing a shirt *war flashbacks* and he's oddly into Bella, but at least he's better than all the girls at school. Bella is not like other girls. She hangs out with boys and boys only. Jacob was fine, I guess, until he became all moody for no reason. Bella thinks he joined a cult, but no, he's just a werewolf. *disappointment* Anyway, Bella discovers that she can hear Edward's voice whenever she risks her life. So she decides to do just that, and embarks on a bunch of suicidal ventures that she somehow survives, and she decides it's all worth it because of Edward's ""perfect voice."" *chokes* I can't believe I actually wrote that sentence. Where's the bleach? For example, she buys a motorcycle and purposefully crashes it to hallucinate and hear him speak to her. I'm just... not going to say anything. 
My velvet-voiced delusion had yelled at me for almost five minutes before I'd hit the brake too abruptly and launched myself into the tree.
 Then one day, she jumps off a cliff. This is not a drill. Edward thinks she committed suicide, so he also decides to commit suicide and runs away to Italy to be killed by this super elite coven of vampires. Fortunately, he has a flair for drama, so Bella and Alice are able to catch him in time. His grand plan of suicide? Stepping out into the sun. Because, you know, he sparkles in the sunlight? And that... will totally get him killed...
Bella Swan:
Bella needs some serious therapy. Her worst problem is that she feels the need to change herself just to make Edward happy. 
Maybe, when I was beautiful and strong, he wouldn't want distractions.
She had pretty much no life before Edward, but still, her life isn't over just because she's not dating him. However, she seems to think it is. She described the feeling continuously (by this, I mean every single page) as a hole in her chest. ""The hole ached."" ""The hole was tearing apart."" WHAT IS THIS HOLE? Maybe if she had a hobby besides Edward, she wouldn't be this empty. I can't believe she's such a famous protagonist. She's a terrible role model and no one should ever strive to be like her. 
His harsh rejection had punched a painful new hole in what was left of my chest.
As a person with trypophobia, I do not appreciate this.Here are all the hole-y quotes I highlighted. There were probably more I forgot to take note of. 
It was a crippling thing, this sensation that a huge hole had been punched through my chest, excising my most vital organs and leaving ragged, unhealed gashes around the edges that continued to throb and bleed despite the passage of time.But what if this hole never got any better? If the raw edges never healed? If the damage was permanent and irreversible? The worry was eating a hole in my stomach. Soon I would have matching punctures.
So, I thought the hole was in her chest. If you're going to have a giant opening in your organs, at least be consistent. 
The pain twisted in familiar patterns through my body, the jagged hole ripping me open from the inside out. I'd thought Jake had been healing the hole in me--or at least plugging it up, keeping it from hurting me so much. I'd been wrong. He'd just been carving out his own hole, so that I was now riddled through like Swiss cheese.
Bella has no life. She has no hobbies, no aspirations, no dreams, nothing that makes her happy besides Edward. I ship her with this plastic fork:They're both white, they both have no purpose in life, they both break with hardly any force used. What a perfect couple. 🥰Edward Cullen:Edward was gone for most of this book, hooray! First of all, you can buy glitter from Walmart for a dollar. Nobody's going to think you're a bloodsucking vampire just because you're sparkly. Can I have a break from the descriptions of his skin? Marble, stone, granite. Honestly, is this guy a statue or something? 
...what with his chest being hard and cold--and perfect--as an ice sculpture...
I am choking on my water. 
I took his marble face between my hands and held it very tightly. A deep frown carved creases into his marble forehead.""Hi."" I snuggled into his stone chest.
Concerned for you❤️
It was like curling into a cool stone, but a stone that was contoured comfortably to the shape of my body.
And his voice, too. Why is it velvet? Is it furry? 
It was only when he was disapproving like this that I could hear the true memory of his voice--the velvet texture and the musical intonation that made up the most perfect of all voices.
Excuse me, I'll be in the bathroom, throwing up. Consider this. Edward is immortal. He has time to do anything he wants. So naturally he chooses to relive high school over and over again and to start a relationship with a teenage girl. Maybe he's living vicariously through Carlisle or something, I don't know. He could cure cancer or Alzheimer's, but no, high school. Ew. Jacob Black:Put a shirt on, my smol friend. So why do werewolves hate vampires? There's no clear reason. Apparently there's some really old feud, but where did that start and why? This had a lot of potential to be really intriguing. Unfortunately, it was not, and was just there to create an agonizingly stupid love triangle. At least make the werewolves interesting instead of just being like ""Jacob exploded."" ""he exploded."" Blah blah blah, bombs are going off, whatever. Who even cares anymore.

3,19939471,04/11/2008,3.0,"Keep in mind that though this review is about to wheel off into an angry rant, this book is good. The series is addictive. And as I said previously about Stephanie Meyer, if you want to cease brain function for a few hours, she's your girl.The beginning is slow, the middle is gold, the end is lacking. The blank pages to represent months passed in zombie-depression, great idea.Now, my problem. My problem is not so much with the story as it is perhaps with the idea behind the story and thus, the author herself. It all starts with Romeo and Juliet. Stupid kids. Yes, yes, the great tragedy of love. Please note the word tragedy came before the word love. Because without the tragedy there would be no story. What would the story be otherwise? I'm not going to presume to rewrite Shakespeare (at least not for the hypothetical purposes of illustrating a point in this review). I will say, that I find it sad and unfortunate that Meyers insists on her characters not only admiring Romeo and Juliet (not the play, but the hormone-addled teenagers who committed suicide rather than take a minute to think it through), but specifically referencing the star-crossed lovers in near direct comparison to her protagonist and the lover-vamp. (Her main character also can be caught reading Jane Austen, but more on that later). My point? Impossible love is a great story. No doubt. And Meyer's characters, the human girl and the vampire (um, Buffy and Angel anyone?) are certainly in an impossible situation. Great, perfect, wonderful. The difficulty? No where to go. That's what makes Romeo and Juliet a tragedy. That's why Buffy and Angel never got back together. What choices has she left us? Either the human becomes a vampire or the vampire (in what would be a HUGE cheat) becomes human again. So? Make the human a vamp, right? Problem solved. Well, despite the flippancy with which so many of Meyer's characters approach this option, to do so would be a tragedy of sorts. Because in effect, it would be suicide, a life ended to be with the man she loves so senselessly that it makes you wonder how she could admire Jane Austen at all. Yes, Jane Austen writes about love, but take a look at ""Sense and Sensibility"". Jane Austen recognizes that love is more complex than the simple lust of it (while Romeo and Juliet barely get a chance to blink before they marry, screw and die-much like the carrion flies Romeo references. . .) Strength of character, not the sweaty passion, conquers all. Clear conscience and unerring moral fortitude conquers class-differences, social stigmas and familial disapproval. And so, they all get to live happily ever after.This is your dilemma Stephanie Meyers. You've laid the groundwork, not for a Jane Austen like happy-ending despite the odds, but a Shakespearian tragedy that will not only leave the audience sobbing, but foaming mad. Frankly, the readers of today don't want a tragedy (for the most part), they get that enough every day. They want the happy ending. I want the happy ending and what would that be in this situation? As far as I can see there is no way to have a true happy ending. Either you make a living girl a vampire. Or you pull out the deus ex machina and make the vampire a human. Neither option will be unsullied enough to be fully satisfactory. Personally, I would rather see the girl become a vampire, though I wish the character would take it a little more seriously than she has. Because my sense of fairness would be violated if the vamp miraculously becomes a human. But no matter how it ends, I fear I will be disappointed, as the endings of both books have been so thoroughly let-downs I cannot imagine the author has it in her mind to tack a new course at this point. How do I have the audacity to be so critical? Have I written a New York Times Bestseller? Two, three? Not yet. ",338,0.9871,0.137,0.686,0.176,0.5460368270227425,NEGATIVE,0.965

10,174300491,06/06/2011,3.0,"oh, hai, just me here, reading new moon on my nook simple touch...this twilight craze... the books are not as bad as the haters say they are, but they are also nowhere near as good as lovers of this series believe. this installment was just kind of... bland. despite my reading it on the fine e-ink technology of the new nook.she did one thing right - one wonderful thing. i assume it is too late to actually ""spoil"" anything in the bellaverse, so i am just going to barrel ahead - but when edward leaves bella in the woods. that moment - when she just loses her mind and her desolation and her emptiness and her self-destructive impulses shoot straight to the surface. it was pretty well-done. because let's face it, we have all been left behind by someone we are still in love with. even me. wonderful, wonderful me. and having recently rewatched my favorite movie, head-on, i have to point out the best scene in it, and how it mirrors this book. this is a spoiler for head on. which you should all watch. and be gutted. (view spoiler)[so that scene where sibel is in instanbul and she gets harassed outside the bar by those four guys? and she just attacks them - that headlong run into destruction because you don't want to have to kill yourself, but you are not opposed to someone else doing it for you. and each time she gets up after being beaten down you can tell she is happier and happier with that gleam of defiance because she feels like she deserves this punishment, and she is hoping it will end in her own obliteration so she canget some peace from her misery. that is the best part in any movie anywhere, and a feeling very close to my heart. of being unmoored and not caring what happens to the physical body because the emotional part is dead. (hide spoiler)] that is the kind of heartbreak bella has here and lord, do i get that impulse. and bella keeps it up the whole book - testing the boundaries of her own mortality to get that rush of maybe-edward each time she is close to death. and that's pretty ballsy for teen fiction.but i don't know how many near-death experiences one girl has to have in order to become interesting. this book was fine, but mostly just one-note. she misses edward and likes but doesn't like-like jacob. for nearly four hundred pages. but my, how slender four hundred pages can be on the new nook!so - yeah - i am reading on a freaking robot. i was forced to borrow one from work so that i could get on board with the emerging technology. did i do all right, john petrie?? are you proud of my commitment to excellence?? do you see i read a whole book on a machine?? a book that i read for the express purpose of getting to eclipse so i can be a completist in my reading books that are ""based"" on wuthering heights quest?? and no one looking at me knew what i was reading. the freedom from shame was well worth it... nook. lightweight. tiny. capacious. good for hiding your books from nosy subway riders. may contain traces of new moon...come to my blog!

11,73289698,10/03/2009,3.0,"As ye sow, so shall ye reap. Earlier this year, I foolishly lent my copy of Twilight to Cate across the road. She liked it. Then, when she got a place at college last month, we thought we'd give her something as a congratulations-and-going-away present. It was so logical to buy a copy of New Moon.Cate zipped through it quickly, and dropped off her copy before leaving so that I could read it too. How could I possibly say anything except thank you?Well... look on the bright side. I've heard so much about this book, and I suppose it is interesting to see what people are talking about. But, Jesus Christ, Bella is eighteen and she's already obsessing about getting old. She keeps hassling Edward to turn her into a vampire so that she can stay young and pretty for ever. There is some chance that this will result in her losing her immortal soul, but hey, seems worth the risk.I suppose future ages may consider that this says something about early 21st century Western society. You don't exactly have to overexert your mind to come up with interpretations in that direction._____________________________________So here's a thought that occurred to me this morning, which I'm surprised to find hasn't already been discussed to death by hardcore Twilight fans. Bella is a bright girl who gets mostly As and Bs at school, so why hasn't she stopped even for a second to consider the physics of vampires? To start with, where do they get their energy from? They don't really eat, they don't really drink, and they don't even need to breathe. Yet they're incredibly strong and fast. OK, they claim they need blood every now and then. But not, apparently, very often, and how could they possibly get this amount of energy from the occasional liter of blood?Then they're hard, ""like marble"". In fact, if they didn't claim to be vampires, would we even think of calling them that? They certainly seem to be a lot more like humanoid robots. And if you just follow up that hypothesis for a moment, several things fall into place. Their blood must surely be full of those little nanobots that are going to be the Next Big Thing. When a vampire bites a human, the nanobots get into the victim's bloodstream and start restructuring him from the inside out, replacing all the soft animal tissue with something far more durable. That no doubt includes the brain too; they probably scan it and then map the structure onto software, a trick that's been standard in SF for several decades now. No wonder the ""vampires"" can think so uncannily fast. But if your brain has been scanned, destroyed, and turned into software, are you still the same person? You can see why Edward is warning Bella that she might lose her soul. It's a bit like turning an LP into a CD, a process that several of my classical musician friends describe in exactly those words. And, going back to where we came in, where is their energy coming from? Those nanobots must have their own power source too. I must admit that I don't know what it is. The fact that ""vampires"" don't seem to need any kind of material inputs suggests it's not chemical; nuclear seems more likely. Maybe they have some kind of catalyzed cold fusion, or it could be a post-quantum force that we haven't discovered yet. After all, we're way overdue for the coming revolution in physics.Also, where did the nanobots come from, and why are ""vampires"" unhappy to be out in open sunlight? I can only see one sensible answer. They can't have been created by humans. ""Vampires"" have been around a long time, and human technology was primitive when they first appeared. They must be from elsewhere, which in practice means from another solar system. Probably they were originally created thousands of light-years from here, and have been drifting slowly on the cosmic currents for millennia. Well, if their normal habitat is deep interstellar space, no wonder they're scared of sunlight. They wouldn't normally be this close to a star; they're not designed for it at all. And here's the thing that surprised me most. In fact, the story isn't irrelevant or far-fetched. If people like Ray Kurzweil are right, it's tackling what could soon be a major issue. According to Kurzweil, the Singularity is supposed to arrive this century, and those nanobots will be a reality. Millions of people will have to make exactly the moral choice that Bella has to make in the book. Are you going to stay human, or allow yourself to be transformed into a godlike and near-immortal being, which might however not actually be you any more?It's interesting that the books are appearing when they are, and present such a compelling emotional case for allowing yourself to be infected by nanobots. If you like conspiracy theories, feel free to speculate some more here. _____________________________________I'm doing my best to like this book. I mean, hating it would hardly be a challenge, would it? But every now and then, I get a passage like this one:I'd been broken beyond repair.But I needed Jacob now, needed him like a drug. I'd used him as a crutch for too long, and I was in deeper than I'd planned to go with anyone again.Aaarrrrgh!!!_____________________________________Having now reached the end, I must admit that I enjoyed New Moon more than I'd expected. Of course, there are some problems, starting with the fact that Stephenie Meyer can't write to save her life. But by making it a first-person narrative told by the shy, clumsy Bella, she has found an ingenious way to get around that. Bella's endearing klutziness is just a metaphor for her even more serious problems as a writer. As she keeps telling us, every time she walks across a room she wonders if she'll trip over her feet and end up in hospital; similar remarks apply to her ability to string together an eight word declarative sentence. But she's stylistically consistent, and after a while I found myself accepting her. This just happens to be her voice, even though it's not a very good one.I also thought that she was a seriously unreliable narrator. Not about factual events; to start off with, she doesn't seem to be imaginative enough to make anything up. When it comes to telling us about her feelings, however, I found it hard to believe her, and presenting everything as a mass of regurgitated romantic clichés is an effective way to show us how poorly she understands herself. We hear over and over again that she loves Edward, and only thinks of Jacob as a friend. But we also hear that Edward feels hard and cold to the touch. I couldn't help thinking of the wonderful scene in Mean Girls where Rachel McAdams's Cool Mom insists on giving Lindsay Lohan a silicone-enhanced hug; I'm sure that Bella often winces in just the same way when Edward hugs her, though she doesn't allow herself to notice it. In contrast, Jacob is warm and alive, and she genuinely likes holding his hand and feeling him put his arm around her. There are several scenes when she nearly kisses him, knowing full well what that will lead to. It's clear that she wants to, and the excuses she makes to herself about him just being an unsatisfactory substitute for Edward are laughably unconvincing.I found the opposition between Edward and Jacob the heart of the book, and after a while I decided that the author was presenting something interesting and essentially honest. The tricky thing is that she's subverted the vampire symbol. Usually, vampires represent the young girl's simultaneous dread and fascination in the face of sex. But Edward isn't very sexy. We're always being told that he looks like an angel, and indeed there does seem to be an angelic purity about him. I find it much more plausible that he's representing religion, and when you think of him in those terms several other things come into focus. As Richard Dawkins keeps telling us, a religion is a kind of virus, which infected parties want to spread as quickly as possible; well, vampirism is rather like that too. And Bella is very conflicted in her feelings about vampires. She loves the Cullens, ""her family"", but she is well aware that most vampires are monsters. If you're brought up in a cult-like religion, that's not a bad metaphor. All other religions are evil and wrong; your own religion is the one exception to the rule.As everyone knows, Stephenie Meyer is a committed Mormon. It doesn't seem far-fetched to claim that Bella's feelings about vampires mirror the author's feelings about her religion, which among other things is very down on premarital sex. And that's where the werewolves come in; they represent the normal sexual feelings that most young Mormon girls are taught to deny. The tension between these two conflicting attractions is what gives New Moon its undeniable force, and I found the story credible at an emotional level. I can readily believe that it's just like that to be a eighteen year old Mormon girl with a healthy sexual appetite, and I feel I understand their plight better after having read this book.

Is anyone else completely aghast that this dreck saw a printing press not to mention became a wildly popular series?I thought I was being hard on Twilight when I criticized it for portraying a relationship so ill-advised and unhealthy and then romanticizing that relationship to young people as if people didn't already make enough bad decisions. I thought maybe now that Book 1 was done the series would take a nice turn.Enter: New Moon. Exit: Shred of decency.Were it simply a problem of the weakly-developed characters, confused and uneven plotline, hundreds of pages of cloying depression (only to be replaced by cloying sentimentality later on), and an appalling and unsubtle parallel to Romeo and Juliet, this novel would simply be mediocre teen fare.But then we must consider the problem of Bella: whiny, needy, and sullen, blindly devoting herself to a partner that constantly patronizes, criticizes, and subjugates her only for him to leave so she can spend the next 8 months in a state of emotional vacancy so acute that she forgets everything else in her life that a girl can be happy about. Bella is only complete--and she says this herself--when her man is by her side. And apparently, according to Meyer at least, this is ok. It's ok to create a character so bereft of purpose, self-assurance, and identity that she can't live without a relationship based on nothing substantial, just beauty, lust, and exoticism.And it's ok for her to experience no emotional maturity whatsoever because in the end, her lover comes back spewing the same gushy nonsense as before while still lording it over her and flying into rages when he doesn't get his way.The only compelling character in this story was Jacob. That is... until he became a werewolf and became as cardboard and unappealing as the rest of the cast. The irrational hatred between vampires and werewolves gets played off as instinctual, but it has all the logic of bigotry, and that these characters do nothing to try overcoming it is yet another way in which they are immature and non-self-examining.Due to the audience for which this intended, I have to say that New Moon and the Twilight Saga as a whole are not just poor, they're damaging.And don't even get me started on the ""epiphany"" of p. 527. We were expected to believe Bella thought Edward had ceased to love her even though an autistic housefly could see it was nowhere near true?This book failed. Intensely.

13,1243724917,04/02/2015,,"“What happens when you lose your heart's desire?”I love the Twilight Saga. I love every single book and it's kind of hard for me to pick a favourite. This one, however, is probably my least favourite. Not for obvious reasons, though. Most people complain about how nothing really happens, how Bella is mainly depressed and moping and boring. To be honest, this is my favourite part in this book. It's the perfect rainy autumn day read. When you're feeling down and annoyed, this book wraps you in a blanket and comforts you. Bella's numbness and depression, Fork's atmosphere, Jacob's warmth, all of that soothes your - or well at least my - soul and lets you sulk a little and enjoy the silence.I could do without the action, though. I don't need the big drama at the end of every Twilight book. I'm happy just reading about Bella's thoughts and inner conflicts, about her life in Forks, her friends and the Cullens.

14,42220845,01/07/2009,5.0,"I admit I put off reading this second book in the Twilight series, for a few reasons. Maybe my love for Twilight would turn out to be a fluke. I had watched the movie recently, so it would feel like a rerun. I wasn’t ready to dive back into the series. Well, I finally manned up and read New Moon this week. I can honestly say this is one of my favorite books of all time.Many bad things have been said about Ms. Meyer’s writing. I don’t agree with any of it. Ms. Meyer has proven to me that she can write books that I can admire and enjoy, and that I can appreciate from an artistic and literary standpoint. She brings the story to vivid life, and pulls me right into the action. She knows how to make me feel. For me, it’s not a good sign when I read a book and I feel detached, bored, withdrawn. I want to be involved in a story that I read for pleasure, which is 95% of the time I spend reading. When I read Twilight, I couldn’t get over the awe and joy I felt as I discovered the world of Bella Swan and Edward Cullen. The beauty of their love story. I didn’t think this book could top that feeling. Surprisingly, it did. Ms. Meyer took the story that much deeper for me with New Moon. I have actually read few writers that have such a gift for illustrating and bringing emotions to live. Showing the complexity of relationships, how they all come to matter and play a part of our emotional landscape. The pain that Bella feels when Edward leaves….I felt it acutely. I felt like my heart was breaking along with Bella’s. I felt angry at Edward. I was so mad I wanted to slap him. But, I also felt that same love for Edward I felt when I read Twilight. I could understand why he left, not possibly knowing that his leaving could never be the best thing for Bella. With this couple, as with my favorites in literature, you can see how mutual, how all-consuming their love for each other is. Some might call it self-destructive. But emotions don’t follow the rules. Even when people try to control them, they still manifest in other ways. Especially those that are so powerful, like the love these two people shared. When it came to Bella’s recovery (at least partial), I thought it was so well-written as Ms. Meyer showed Bella picking herself up from the abyss that Edward and the Cullens’ departure had thrown her into. The way that Ms. Meyer showed the first four months was so beautifully evocative and yet so basic, it was that much more effective. Just each month written on a individual page. Nothing else. That’s how it was for Bella. She couldn’t stop living, not knowing what that would do to her parents. So she existed. Nothing more. After that, there was her developing relationship with Jacob Black.Again, there was so much skill in describing how Bella becomes friends with Jake. I love how Jake is described as Bella’s sun. Her love for him that is more than just a friend, like a brother, but deeper. I know that if there was no Edward Cullen, then maybe Jake could have been Bella’s true love. But in the world where Edward existed, there was no substitute. I thought that the book would be boring without Edward, but it was far from that. I found that I loved this book even though he wasn’t technically there, except for his voice in Bella’s head. That voice that came around to warn Bella when she was in trouble. Yet at the same time, Jake had the power to hold the pain from Edward’s leaving at bay. When he would smile his sweet smile, and shine his light on Bella. Even though Jake was like a crutch that held a crippled Bella on her feet, I didn’t feel like she used Jake and gave nothing in return. Her friendship also helped him. She stood up for him and cared about him, bringing something to his life as well. I love Bella as a character. She’s a good person, very caring, but also stubborn as a mule. I like how she is shown to be imperfect, but more than willing to examine her actions and her motives to see if she is doing what she feels is right. Yes, Bella did some immature things, but what do humans do when they are hurting? I think that considering the circumstances she went through, I don’t find fault with Bella. I think Bella might come off wrong on first glance to the casual observer. Like she is in her own little world, selfish and self-absorbed. The way I read her is what I’ve seen in people in real life like Bella. She’s one of those people whose capacity for love is all consuming. She has to hold herself at a distance or lose herself. Because some people don’t understand how deep she commits herself to others. It totally makes sense why she falls apart when Edward leaves, and then when Jake pushes her away because of what is going on with him. The fact that I respected Bella so much is why I loved this book passionately, even though my favorite character is hardly even in the book. It also testifies to Ms. Meyer’s skill at writing. Her characters keep me invested, the way they interact with each other, creating the fabric of this book, a beautifully-woven creation that sucked me in too deep to let go until I was done. I love my dad, but Charlie would be a great dad for any girl. He makes this book series special to me, just for his small parts in the books. He’s adorable!Silly me. I didn’t expect to enjoy Jake’s story and the wolves as much as I did. I’m silly because I love werewolf stories. I’m silly because I was completely wrong. The wolf pack aspect was very interesting. I felt so much for Jake, how he was confused and at sea; how he truly believed that the wolf that had awakened in him made him bad. I was glad that he had Bella to help him see that the wolf was a beautiful thing, part of who he was. Part of why she loved him, and like she loved Edward even with his being a vampire, she would continue to love him, even as a wolf. I have to say that although Edward is still my favorite, I adore Jake tremendously. I could see what a special, sweet guy he was, how hard he tried to do what was right, and the control that he mustered when it was clear how much his ‘gift’ made control very difficult for him. I just love how he is described. He is like sunshine to Edward’s moon. So yes, I am a Jacob fan now, and well as loving his pack brothers and Emily.Even though there is not a lot of action in this book, it still kept me riveted. I appreciated how the menace of the Volturi came off so clearly, even with very little onscreen violence. The contrast between the Cullens and the Volturi was beautifully, clearly rendered. How the Cullens had chosen the connection between them, the capacity to love over the bloodlust, even if it was terribly hard at times. This helped me to see that Edward’s motives were truly good, even if they seemed foolhardy. Once that was clear, and seeing his pain, how leaving Bella had destroyed him, I couldn’t stay mad at him. I love Edward way too much. I also adore the Cullens, especially Alice and Carlisle.  I honestly feel that this series shows a deep kind of love that I haven’t seen in all my twenty-plus years of romance reading. It’s not just boy-girl romance, either. It shows a deep, powerful romantic love, but also the love of friendship, the bonds of family (not merely by blood, but by choice), and how they all come together, serving as our greatest weaknesses, but also our greatest strengths. That’s the duality of human nature. Funny how I can learn this lesson from a book about vampires and werewolves, and a human girl caught between them. I can hardly describe how much I love this book! I’m done trying..for now!",96,0.9998,0.074,0.689,0.237,0.5725378787878789,POSITIVE,0.9837
15,4701349,08/17/2007,1.0,"Bella Swan's relationship with her hot vampire boyfriend Edward Cullen is heating up when her characteristic clumsiness messes everything up again at her vampire-thrown birthday party. In typical Bella style, she gives herself a paper cut and Edward has to literally throw himself in front of her to keep her from being dinner for six hungry vampires. That's the last straw for Edward, and he and his entire family pick up and leave to prevent any more harm from coming to Bella on their tab. Bella is, of course, inconsolable, and walks through life like a lovesick zombie - until she renews her friendship with local boy Jacob Black. Jacob is a good friend - and more importantly, he helps Bella fix up two motorcycles and teaches her to ride them. Bella's friendship with Jacob - and the adrenaline rush that the motorcycles bring - sustains her, until she discovers a dangerous truth about the identity of Jacob and his friends - they are a pack of young werewolves. And even worse, they have been working to protect her from a vicious vampire who has it in for Bella.After the horrible drudge that was Twilight, New Moon was a pleasant surprise. At least, part of it was, if you can get past Bella's melodramatic, lovesick, woe-is-me-I-am-the-center-of-the-universe depression. I was actually starting to enjoy Bella's somewhat odd relationship with Jacob, and the book in general, which kind of surprised me - until Edward showed up again. Then, the writing dissolved once again to ""I love you more, shmoopy."" ""No, I love you more."" and I lost patience once again. That's the problem with this book. The shmoopy, syrupy, unexplainededly irritating Romeo-and-Juliet True Love that Edward and Bella share. I like Bella with Alice. I like Bella with Carlisle and Esme. I like Bella with Jacob. I can't stand Bella with Edward. And let me rephrase that. There is nothing likeable about Bella as a character - she is a complete and total MarySue. Jacob is goodhearted and clever and interesting, and I have no trouble understanding why Bella is drawn to him. But why is Jacob drawn to Bella? There seems to be no reason I can understand. And most laughable of all is Bella's desperate urge to become a vampire herself. Especially at the end, when Edward asks her to marry him first, and she balks. She's afraid of commitment, but not of being turned into a vampire so she can stay with him always? Give me a break.",94,0.9413,0.072,0.805,0.123,0.5983987603305784,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Angry.Is this what we're supposed to be teaching our teenage daughters? Sisters? Nieces? Apparently Ms. Meyer believes that:1. Moping for 4 straight months over a goddamned boy is okay, and even though you'll make people worried and your friends may stop talking to you, hey! it's okay, because your love for this boy is so strong and you'll eventually figure yourself out on your own.2. Becoming another boy's friend solely to use him to make yourself feel better and to try and fill that ""void"" the other boy left, without any regard for his feelings and how your actions might affect him is definitely okay because hey! he's just a friend and even though he may see it differently, you know in your heart you'll never love him like that. Even though he doesn't know. But that's okay. Cause you know. And you'll tell him. Eventually. Okay never.3. Hopping on a plane to another fucking continent is definitely the best decision you could make when your twoo wuv is in danger of killing himself, even though he's immortal. With no regard to your father. Who literally just came back from his friend's funeral. Nah, don't think about Dad. He's probably not that worried. Cause Daddy, I love him!4. You're supposed to be selfish because you're in love! I'm not even going to try to explain this one. It's literally the whole book.I'm just so utterly disgusted by what I just read, and I can't believe I managed to stomach it all. Bella is so incredibly weak as a protagonist, girl, woman, character, whatever. Just the way she treats everyone is extremely self-centered--from her father to her friends to Jacob--and it made me furious. But it's okay because ""she's in pain."" Christ, apparently Stephenie Meyer hasn't ever been in an actual teenage relationship because almost none of this shite is enough to break someone for four months. A boy broke your heart? I'm sorry, honey, but you'll eventually get over it because you're a strong woman who doesn't need to rely on other people for your own happiness. Get out there and make your own. Without a goddamned boy. Do you really have nothing else in your life worth living for? Really?
Fuck. That.

18,27814425,07/20/2008,5.0,"Reviewed for THC ReviewsTwilight was a grand romance which frequently left me smiling, but New Moon takes on a bittersweet, angst-filled and edgy tone in this continuing dramatic saga of teen love between a vampire and a human. The book gets off to a rather explosive start, but rapidly turns to heavy sorrow when Edward make a fateful decision concerning Bella's safety. Following his decision, Edward is off the canvas for about the next two-thirds of the book, as is the entire Cullen family. During this time, the story is very reminiscent of Twilight in that it moves at a languid but steady pace while extensive character and relationship development occurs. The fall-out to Bella's psyche from Edward's choice is heart-wrenching to read. Stephenie Meyer is so good at writing Bella's agony, that I felt like my own heart had been ripped to shreds. Then a newfound depth in her friendship with Jacob Black, seems to be Bella's saving grace, bringing some sense of peace to her otherwise chaotic life. Still, danger lurks everywhere, bringing a certain level of suspense to the story, which then escalates into a taut thriller when an unfortunate misunderstanding places Alice and Bella in a race against time to save Edward from certain death. With so much going on, New Moon was yet another installment in the Twilight series that was extremely difficult to put down.I can't help but continue to enjoy the characters in this series. I still like Bella very much, but I found myself wishing that she would have a little more confidence in Edward's love for her. After the beauty of their romance in Twilight, it was hard for me to understand how she couldn't, but ultimately, it seemed that her feelings of inadequacy – of not measuring up to a spectacular creature like Edward – simply got the best of her. Thankfully she did have an epiphany before the end, so hopefully will be beyond that stage by the next book. Bella also has a tendency to think of everyone else first (except when she's being reckless), which can be a very good trait, but also left me thinking that it might be nice if she took care of herself once in a while too. While Bella is still an accident-prone magnet for danger, I missed her endearing awkward clumsiness. Instead she is now living on the edge and seeking out the danger. It was also very difficult to read about her severe depression without being dragged down a bit myself. Edward is still the same thoughtful and loving hero I adored in Twilight though his absence for much of the story, left a huge hole, which was a major point of the story that I though the author conveyed magnificently. One of my favorite things about Edward is his wry, teasing sense of humor, but the tone of New Moon is so serious, it didn't allow for many of these moments to shine through. In Edward's absence, Bella develops a deep friendship with Jacob Black, who ends up being much more than she at first thought he was. Jacob also essentially becomes a second hero and the third point in a love triangle. While Bella never really feels more for Jacob than friendship or brotherly love, Jacob does fall for Bella. Jacob and Edward have very different personalities, but Jacob is such a wonderful character, I couldn't help but adore him too. While I don't think that his happily-ever-after does or should lie with Bella, I do hope he gets one eventually. These three characters have completely engrossed my attention, and I can't wait to see what develops next for them.The secondary characters were wonderful as well. It was nice to see Charlie finally taking charge and acting more like a father. Most of the Cullens didn't play very big roles in this story, with the one exception being Alice. Because of her visions, she is an intriguing character who I hope will be front and center throughout the series, as I really like her breezy manner and no-nonsense attitude. New Moon also fills in a couple of the missing pieces of her human past. Although Carlisle only appears in a couple of scenes, he also fills in some missing pieces about himself and Edward. New Moon introduces Sam Uley and a “gang” of Native American teens who are far more than they seem to be on the surface and who play key roles in Jacob's life. Billy, Jacob's father, is also present, but doesn't take on a particularly strong role. Readers are also introduced to the Volturi, a group of vampires who live in Italy and are basically vampire royalty. They are at once both fascinating and monstrous creatures, and unlike the Cullens are extremely dangerous, posing yet another threat to Bella's existence. Overall, I thought the story had a varied and colorful character palette.As with Twilight, New Moon did not contain any explicit elements – no sex, only a dozen or so mild profanities, and minimal violence. There is a scene though, in which a group of humans become unwitting prey for a group of blood-thirsty vampires. It does takes place in the background and is not played out explicitly, so whether or not it is disturbing for readers, would depend more on the individual's imagination and sensitivity level. I happen to have a very vivid imagination, so it did make me a tad squeamish. The story also contains several mature thematic elements, such as severe depression, discussion of and a near attempt of suicide, deliberately reckless behavior, and stealing cars (though for a good reason). There are also racial tensions between two classes of supernatural beings, which includes some derogatory name-calling. In addition, depending on the reader's point of view, it may seem that Edward and Bella's love for one another borders on obsession. Even I admit, that if these characters were real and normal, I would have been telling them to go get therapy and quick.;-) I've read enough paranormal romances though, to know that the bond shared by supernatural creatures and their mates is stronger, deeper and more permanent than most human bonds. It's just that in this particular story that bond gets a rather heavy treatment owing, in my opinion, to it's highly character-driven nature and emotional intensity. I still think that most mature teens should be able to handle all the complex subject matter, but all these elements would make great points of discussion for parents and educators.In spite of the serious and sometimes even depressing overtones of the narrative, I found New Moon to be yet another fascinating read. I really enjoy stories that include some sort of spiritual element, and New Moon has one in the form of an ongoing debate over whether there is an afterlife for vampires or whether they truly are the eternal damned. I love stories that make me think and there is so much more going on beneath the surface in this one (even outside the spiritual thread), that I can't seem to help pondering it even after turning the final page. 
New Moon
 has earned a place on my keeper shelf right next to it's predecessor, Twilight, and I'll be eagerly looking forward to reading Eclipse and 
Breaking Dawn
, the final two installments in the Twilight series, as well. With two-for-two, Stephenie Meyer definitely deserves a place among my favorite authors.

Because apparently vampires sparkle in the sun now instead of burning?Bella: Little Miss Dumb: Because well aparently someone who wants you for your blood is attractive? Hmnh, I don’t think so.Jacob: Fuzz balls: I don’t think I need to explain. This review will have major spoilers for this and the rest of the series so you have been warned. Also there will be swearing. Shall we take a look at what the back of my New Moon book says?FOR BELLA SWAN THERE IS ONE THING more important than life itself: Edward Cullen. But being in love with a vampire is even more dangerous than Bella could ever have imagined. Edward has already rescued Bella from the clutches of one evil vampire, but now, as their daring relationship threatens all that is near and dear to them, they realize their troubles may be just beginning....Here, ladies and gentleman, we have the amazing writing skills of Stephanie Meyer. Honestly AFTER A MONTH OR SO MR LIGHT BULB IS THE ‘BEST THING IN HER LIFE?!?’YESS 111 I WOULD LIKE TO REPORT A CRIME Oh my god I did not think the most dumb girl ever can get any more dumber but here we have this book 600 pages of Bella having no brain cells. BUT SOMEEEHOW SHE BECAME SO DUMB WORDS CANNOT DESRCIBE.Oh dear, where do I even start? SO FIRST MR LIGHT BULB LEAVE BECAUSE HE THINKS IT WILL BE BETTER FOR HER BECAUSE THEY ARE VAMPIRES AND WILL KILL HER AT ANY SECOND.So apparently now Miss Dumb has crippling depression because her Vampire boyfriend has left her *takes a deep breath* I’m so all she does is sit there for a good four months thinking over how much she loved and adored the person I want to kill her. But then suddenly she had an accident and she heard Light Bulbs' beautifully soothing voice. *vomits* In reality his voice is just the same as every other teenage boy no wait no teenage boy AN 100 YEAR OLD MAN. So now she does crazy shit to hear his voice LIKE JUMPING OFF A DAMN CLIFF. And then of course Mr Fuzz Balls is there to save her every single time because he’s Mr nice guy but NO Bella can’t go for Mr nice guy she has to go for the guy who WANTS TO KILL HER. *takes another deep breath* AND THEN THE VISION VAMP has a vision Bella committing suicide basically and told Loght Blub and now Light Bulb distraught because the LOVE OF HIS LIFE ,now let’s not forget that he left her, is now dead in his eyes. So now he goes to the vampire government that all look like babies. AND ASKS THEM TO KILL HIM BECAUSE HE CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT MISS DUMB. Let’s take this moment to remember that YOU LEFT HER!!!!!!!And ofc the baby vamp government says NO you cannot kill yourself because some girl died! AND THEY HAVE A GOOD REASON. AND SO THE ONLY LOGICAL STEP TO DO NEXT IS TO GO OUT INTO THE SUNLIGHT AND ✨SPARKLE✨ but OK WAIT MISS DUMB HAS COME TO SAVE HIM!CUE THE DRAMATIC MUSIC 🎵 AND THEN BAMB MISS DUMB IS THERE TO SAVE HIM AND THEY LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER. NOT. ANOTHER THREE BOOKS OF THIS SHIT!and then the baby vamp government are like ‘she can live but she needs to become a vampire’ and Light Bulb is like NO I LIKE IT WHEN I WANT TO EAT HER AS A SNACK So they leave and Miss Dumb is like LETS TAKE A POLL TO SEE IF I SHOULD BE IMMORTAL! AND THEN OH WAIT HER BOYFRIEND DOESN'T WANT ME TO BE LIKE HIM. and wait there more: the book ends when Light Bulbs like I WILL BITE YOU IF U MARRY ME. LIKE HOLD UP SHE'S ONLY 18 AND YOUR AN 100 YEAR OLD VIRGIN IN A TEENAGERS BODY. ILLEGAL 
Little Miss Dumb::
She is much dumber than last time I checked. I think she will be continuing to lose brain cells.
Mr Light Bulb:
A 100 year old man in a teenager's body after a teenage HUMAN girl because none of the female vamps wanted him. UNDERSTANDABLE.
Mr Fuzz balls::
IM SO SAD THAT BELLA DIDN’T CHOSE JACOB BECAUSE HE WAS THERE FOR HER AND SHE WAS LIKE ‘NAH I'LL GO FOR THE KILLING MACHINE’So overall this book is dumber than Miss Dumb and Light Bulb is a child predator.

The lack of vampires was the reason for this. I never really cared about the whole Edward vs Jacob thing - sure, I did choose Edward over Jacob, but this was only because I thought the vampires were much cooler than the wolves, and not because I thought that Edward was actually better than Jacob - even at fifteen I could see how glitterboy was actually kind of a douchebag.But to my surprise, I liked New Moon better this time around.Now we all know this entire series is problematic, so I won't linger on the subjects of Bella's entire life basically ending because a boy broke up with her, or how she just immediately forgives said boy within seconds of seeing him again... it's bad, but we all know this already.Instead I had fun; fixing bikes with Bella and Jake, getting to know the wolf-crew and vomiting a little every time Jacob called Bella ""honey"". Also, a compliment to Stephenie Meyer for actually introducing the Volturi in the very first book - that was actually some solid planning on her part, instead of just introducing them when they were relevant to the story, nice!",75,0.9651,0.066,0.779,0.155,0.5194773825208607,NEGATIVE,0.9999

I've been running with this theory that if Meyer was to take these books to any publishing house in the year 2020, she would not be published. There is no way that anyone would let half of this stuff slide now. So since there's absolutely nothing that I enjoyed about this novel, let the critical analysis begin. I would also like to point out that reading this book was extremely painful for me. I only finished it because I was using an audiobook to assist. The first problem of this book is the glorification of this toxic relationship between Edward and Bella. I'm not sure why this relationship is gloried so much but it's wrong. In the beginning of the book, Edward leaves Bella knowing how obsessed she is with him and their relationship. Instead of trying to figure out things like the 110 year old man that he is, he decides to run and abandon her while telling her that ""he'll love her in a way."" Like what?? There, in my opinion, is a clear indication of emotional abuse in this particular situation and Edward is never held accountable for it. After Edward leaves, Bella beings to seek thrill rides in order to ""hear"" Edward's voice. Clearly this is supposed to be a representation of mental health, but instead of addressing it or using it as a gateway for a bigger discussion, Meyer allows both characters to avoid it. Even when it appears that Charlie could make a good decision by sending her to a psychiatrist, he is forced to back down and Bella continues with her self-destructive behavior. There were even specific points in which I felt as though Bella was clearly suicidal and no one does anything to address the behavior. In addition to this, Meyer engages in constant harmful representation of the Native community. While the vampires (who are all white) are described with such care and admiration, Jacob and his family and friends are often described in an aggressive/distrustful manner. While I cannot speak directly to all of the Native representation present in the book because I, myself, am not Native. I have listened to Native reviewers and they have explicitly stated that she misrepresents and harms the Native community. It's actually quite funny that the main character of this book is the one character that I absolutely HATE. Bella has to be the most unlikeable character that I have ever encountered in a YA book. I think at one point I was feeling for her because I knew that she slipped into depression; however, when she began using Jacob to fill the gap for Edward I fell right back into my previous feelings. Bella does not care about anyone in the world except for Edward. I mean she doesn't even care about herself. It gets frustrating seeing her constantly put herself down and really disregard her own safety and the safety of others for an OLD MAN that left her high and dry during the first sign of trouble. I mean most of the book really didn't even have plot. It was page after page of the glorification of their unhealthy relationship. She was willing to drop Jacob the moment she figured out that it was a possibility for Edward to be back in her life. Jacob just deserved better treatment especially after he was lying to friends and family to keep Bella entertained. I think what disturbs me the most is how shocked she is when no one wants to deal with her. It should be clear that after you treat people like shit and use them because your boyfriend leaves you then no one is going to want to deal with you. Clearly, I didn't enjoy this book. I'm only reading these now for the live shows that I will be participating in. They don't hold up against the test of time and I'm truly wondering how Stephanie Meyer could possible think to publish a book from Edwards perspective when everything about these books is so toxic and wrong.

23,3315481084,05/03/2020,3.0,"Reading New Moon for the first time. You know I had to do it (to them). I'm taking extensive notes as I go along, similar to my Twilight thread.(Scroll down to keep up with me as I update)Going into this right after Twilight, I was begging and hoping I wouldn't be let down. Twilight surprised me with how much fun I had with it. It was silly and over-the-top and romantic and problematic. All the components for a great book to live-tweet. Which I did. Along with a review. It brought me out of my quarantine funk and gave me something to look forward to, however silly it may be.When it comes to Twilight you have to kind of leave logic behind, what with all the angst, drama, and you know, vampires vs werewolves. I was prepared for that side. I was not prepared for New Moon. Oh, how I wish I would've been prepared for New Moon.Buckle in for the journey that is the second book in the Twilight series. True to form, it contained all the ups and downs. Read along to discover if there were more ups than downs. It began innocently enough:*Cue transitional music traveling back to the start*• “Well, Gran, you might have noticed that my boyfriend glitters. It’s just something he does in the sun. Don’t worry about it....”Hmmm, will this ever feel normal. . . .• I sighed. “Do you want me to watch this alone?”“No, I’ll mostly be watching you, anyway.”The hilarity of them watching Romeo and Juliet together.• The info dumps at the start were driving me mad. they’re the equivalent of “previously on…” and I remember all too clearly what happened in the first book. . . I HAD JUST READ IT. Trust me, Carlisle's backstory can wait to be repeated later on.• “But what would I do without you?”“Whatever you were doing before I came along and complicated your existence.”He sighed. “You make that sound so easy.”“It should be. I’m not really that interesting.”Where is the lie? Also: Good old fashioned relationship troubles with Bella and Edward? I relish that now, coming from the other side of this book.• Speaking of Bella being uninteresting:“As far as Rosalie was concerned, I was an unwelcome intruder into her family’s secret life.”And she is right. I low-key love Rosalie. She's the only one to put Bella in her rightful place. In what universe is Bella adored by all vampires? In the same universe where she makes them runoff from their own home?• “Well, that’s everyone,” I sighed. “I can clear a room, at least.” Read the room: you don't belong with the CullensI fear this will become a recurring theme. And meme.• “If I develop this film,” I said, toying with the camera in my hands, “will you show up in the picture?”I forgot that the humor in the Twilight series isn't all that bad. Though, I feel like Twilight had more of it than this angsty follow-up book.Adding to that, I got to wondering late one night. Whenever Bella gets ready in the morning, Edward just sits there waiting for her to be done. Do vampires not use the bathroom or brush their teeth? asking for a friend.• Back to the melodrama, and no, I'm not talking about Lorde's album. Unfortunately. We're back to the same old same old:“Bella, you gave yourself a paper cut—that hardly deserves the death penalty.”“It’s still my fault.”My words opened up the floodgate.“Your fault?”Even Edward is amazed at how she seeks to punish herself. That's saying a lot.“I’d rather die than be with Mike Newton,” I protested. “I’d rather die than be with anyone but you.”“Don’t be melodramatic, please.”This is where their age difference comes to play.Also: is she going to repeat this statement throughout the book? We're tired, Bella.• “I didn’t realize that you were capable of being reasonable.” This whole ""don’t get harmed & bleed or i’ll feel triggered to kill you because i’m a vampire"" is getting worse and worse. There's only one simple solution yet neither seemed reasonable enough to go through with it.• “The guilt made my head bow and my shoulders slump. I’d run them out of their home, just like Rosalie and Emmett. I was a plague.”Yes! If you can’t dump Edward because you’re too attached to him, at least think of the people around you suffering because of your decision.• “When you say we—,” I whispered.“I mean my family and myself.” Each word separate and distinct.”Does it have to be spelled out for Bella to understand that she's not part of the Cullens?“I won’t put you through anything like this again. You can go on with your life without any more interference from me. It will be as if I’d never existed.”When this moment arrived I was astonished. And then I realized what it meant: F R E E D O M. If anything, I was glad to get a break from the daily quarrels that weren't going to clear themselves up anytime soon. I was over the moon giddy, actually.On the one hand, after spending so much of Twilight with Edward at Bella's disposal, I was excited to see what she had to offer without him at her side 24/7. I wanted that character development. Save yourself in this one, for once. However, what I soon came to realize was that we either get an obsessed Bella going on and on about her vampire-boyfriend made of marble or we get a lifeless Bella moping on and on about Edward being gone. . . choose your fighter.And then, it struck me. I had stumbled onto a larger beast than anticipated. Bella without Edward is... mind-numbingly boring. I was seriously contemplating skipping pages to when Edward shows up. The realization hit that Bella's infuriating without him and she’s infuriating with him, but at least Edward keeps it interesting.And no, the plot convenience of Edward appearing in her head was not working for me. It's an obvious ruse to appease the fans. We want the real deal, not an illusion.It has to be said. The truth can't escape me at this point: I'm here solely for Edward and Jacob. Or at the very least, I'm not here to be tortured by Bella Swan. So I guess, good luck with New Moon. This is my cry for help. I came unprepared.“The next few hours were agony.”Is that Bella or me reading New Moon? I am desperately looking for the light at the end of a very dark tunnel.At this point, it has to be said: Twilight peaked at... Twilight.• Of course, we all know why the author swept away the Cullens so quickly. Make way for our new brooding hero: *Cue Kiss Me in She's All That* The new – not improved, but different – Jacob Black.• Does this mean that I have to care about a whole new cast of characters now? I do not have it in me, Bella. We're tired.I guess, anything to get out of Bella's mind. But I had an inkling before diving into this book - I even wrote myself a reminder before opening the first chapter - that the author would ruin Edward and Bella so as to make way for our new – not improved, but different – hero (I'm having way too much fun with the She's All That references). I literally wrote a note titled, ""Things to remember in case Edward's character gets ruined in the follow-up books."" The list wasn't long, but still.To backtrack, what I noticed pretty early on is that in order to enjoy Twilight I had to go into it with an open mind and zero preconceived notions. I just didn’t realize I would have to do so with each book in the series. So once I let go of my exceptions for the follow-up book, I could just let things run wild. Let the Cullens be gone for most of the book. Who cares? Not this open-minded gal. Let a new cast of characters take over. I’m fine.You know, as long as I'm reading and being distracted from quarantine life, I'll take it.• What is reading the Twilight series like? Reading this with a straight face: “Is that all? Really?” he interrupted me, a smile breaking across his face. “You’re just scared because I’m a murderer? That’s the only reason?”• “Can you stay out of trouble for one hour?” she asked skeptically. Then, before I could answer, she held up one finger and closed her eyes. Her face went smooth and blank for a few seconds.”How hopeless is Bella? Alice has to actually foresee the future to answer that question.• I really thought Romeo and Juliet was just an innocent mention at the start of the book. Oh, boy, if only I knew. • “I watched the figures moving across the little screen, but I couldn’t even tell if the movie was supposed to be a romance or a horror film.”This reads like a review of Twilight.• The race to get to the Volturi was more fast-paced than the entirety of New Moon. Oh, but how convenient for the author to suddenly have Bella turning into a vampire be considered for the greater good so we can't criticize her in the future.Speaking of, I feel like the author made the book without Edward so unbearable so that when she finally gives him back to us, we’re supposed to be thankful and realize Edward carries the entire series on his back. I can't figure out if that's a genius move on her part or not.I feel like I went into New Moon so naive, and by the end of it, I left utterly destroyed. I was, for one, not expecting Edward to be gone for the majority of it. I am still struck by that fact. It definitely added to my trust issues. I have no idea what to expect now with the following books in the series. I even wrote at one point in my notes that I want to make fun of him, but I'm so Edward deprived that I don’t care what he says right now. What a trick! After reading Twilight, New Moon seems like its evil twin.On that note, another complaint with New Moon that I hope to get resolved in the next book is that there are barely any intimate or tender scenes lingering between Bella and Edward. I went into this series thinking it was more romance based instead of being so heavily focused on the plot. I mean does Stephenie Meyer think I chose this series to freshen up my memory on vampires? Who cares about the Volturi? Give me scenes with Edward and Bella. Scenes where they're not fighting for once. I just wanted that moment of sweet reunion to last longer than one page... I'm here for the romance is what I'm saying.But you know as long as I'm invested enough to continue, I will. I just hope that as the series grows it will focus less on the history of vampires - because I don't remember signing up for Vampires 101 - and give us more of what we're all here for. . .If you're looking for an entertaining distraction, be sure to snatch a copy of New Moon for yourself to reminisce or read along with me:

“Forbidden to remember, terrified to forget; it was a hard line to walk.”
 This was sad. Edward and Bella are separated without good reasons. He wants to protect her, but now what ? I couldn't stomach the first few chapters of this book, after that it was all bearable for me with Jabob and his attitude. I like his protective instinct of Bella, especially when he cares for her, my heart was melted like ice cream.
“Before you, Bella, my life was like a moonless night. Very dark, but there were stars, points of light and reason. ...And then you shot across my sky like a meteor. Suddenly everything was on fire; there was brilliancy, there was beauty. When you were gone, when the meteor had fallen over the horizon, everything went black. Nothing had changed, but my eyes were blinded by the light. I couldn’t see the stars anymore. And there was no more reason, for anything.” 
I remember I was excited about the movie and I went back to reread this series over again when I was in highschool. I loved the feelings this book gave me then. I also could feel why Bella has to act like that during the moment without Edward.All in all, I still like Twilight, no matter what people say. This series is the best romantic YA I've ever read and nothing can substitute it.",69,0.9914,0.072,0.724,0.204,0.5210185185185187,POSITIVE,0.9991
25,32321956,09/08/2008,2.0,"The first thing I'll tell you is that Stephanie Meyer knows her way around lyrical prose. She finds the balance between sensual and realistic, modern day language. Unlike say, Anne Rice, who bores me to tears with her page-long sensual odes to, say, cement walls and turgid baby nipples. Meyer doesn't so much turn a phrase, no; she lays it gently on it's back and rubs it's tummy until it purrs.When I landed in Port Angeles, it was raining. I didn't see it as an omen -- just unavoidable. I'd already said my goodbyes to the sun.So the first book had conflict, love and sensual embraces that can go no further. I liked it because I like Bella. She is funny and accident prone. In true Mary Sue fashion, despite her ""ordinary"" looks, every carnivorous boy within sniffing distance acts as though she bathed in meat. Edward is not my favorite character. He's gorgeous, melodramatic and just a touch creepy in the 'I lay awake all night and watch you sleep' sort.In ""New Moon"" after a horrible incident, Edward breaks up with Bella and leaves town. She collapses. I don't mean she falls down. I mean she has a total emotional breakdown.This is where my problem with the book starts. Early on, the author captures the exquisite pain of loss. At first, you ache for Bella, then you get annoyed at Bella, then you want to kill Bella. About 380 pages of ACHING EMPTINESS and HOLE IN THE HEART THAT WILL NEVER HEAL and SCREAMING NIGHTMARES OF EDWARD LEAVING, WHY GOD WHYYYYYY? It becomes interminable. I kept hoping that the book would find Bella learning that she is capable of taking care of herself without Edward and that she can be a whole person without him. It is a wasted hope. Without Edward, Bella has no more personality. She becomes a turnip. He sucks the soul out of her and turns her into vegetable matter. Bella spends most of the book angst-ing over her pain and using her friend Jacob. He is funny and they actually have fun scenes together. Sadly, she calls him her ""safe harbor"" while she pines for her pasty, Emo Romeo. She is just biding her time until the glistening, fanged wonder boy gets his head out of his ass and comes home.The readers are supposed to buy Bella and Edward as star-crossed lovers. We don't go on a journey that makes us root for their love. Superficial and jarringly automatic, he loves her smell, she loves his beauty. They don't earn their relationship and there's no REAL conflict because the author has crammed it down your throat that they are meant to be together. You never doubt that poor, besotted Bella will choose Edward because she has no identity of her own.I find this whole thing very problematic because it is a YA book. This is not a healthy book for teenagers to read. This is not for young teenagers, unless you are willing to have some real conversations about self-hood, identity and what real loving relationships are like. Oh and the plot twist. Without giving away the cliched secret of LAUREL K HAMILTON proportions, I have to say, this book was predictable. It didn't hint, it beat you upside the head. You can only be concerned that Bella's IQ is that of a bowl of Caesar salad because you figure it out 150 pages before she does. Despite my dislike, Stephanie Meyer did wow me again with more of her lyrical prose.The smile broke across his face the way the sunrise set the clouds on fire.Lovely. I still hate the book but damn that's pretty. An entire book written like that would be cliche and difficult to take seriously, but in small doses, it's incredibly effective. If Stephenie Meyer could write a book with a heroine who didn't set my teeth on edge, I'd be shouting her praises from my rooftop.",56,0.9573,0.094,0.789,0.117,0.5726610365954627,NEGATIVE,0.9998

28,1143435552,12/27/2014,2.0,"So much to say about this book! Most of which I already posted in my eleventy-thousand updates, so I'll stick with the theme suggested by a friend: what is it about Bella that casts a spell over so many readers and drives so many other readers smack-dab out of their minds?I got a clue from one of my favorite lines from one of my favorite novels, Anne Tyler's Ladder of Years: ""The very thing that attracts you to someone can end up putting you off."" That must be it, I decided: the very qualities of Bella's character that make some readers love her, or at least identify with her and root for her, must be the same things that make other readers want to club her and skin her and wear her as a hat.Clearly, all I had to do was sift through Bella's personality and figure out which of her characteristics was having this effect.It didn't take long, and that was my next clue.The secret of Bella's appeal and repulsiveness is this: Bella has no discernible personality whatsoever. None.She has no hobbies, no close friends or family, no political beliefs, no artistic tendencies, no spiritual bent, no religious curiosity, no academic interests, no ideas, no ideals. She gets good grades by diligently applying herself and doing her homework rather than from any intellectual passion.She is a competent cook because the alternative is living on takeout pizza and her father's never-ending eggs and bacon.She used to live in Arizona, which she liked because the weather is hot and dry; now she lives in Forks, Washington, which she dislikes because the weather is cold and wet.She says she's a reader, but there's no evidence for it. She doesn't bother getting a library card because the local library is too small. She plans exactly one trip to a bookstore, and doesn't mind at all that she never gets there.That's it. That's all there is to her.Bella is (to paraphrase Robert Musil) the woman without qualities.She is, in other words, a perfect blank on which readers can draw any picture they choose. Readers who want to imagine themselves into the story can put themselves in Bella's shoes without any difficulty or glaring contradictions. This same utter blankness is what makes other readers (yours truly included) want to use the Twilight books as fuel for a line of alternative-energy vehicles we'd be willing to design and build by hand just so we could feel we'd made the world a better place in two ways.That said, this book is an improvement on Twilight – hence the two stars to Twilight's one. Here's what New Moon has going for it:1. Edward is gone, Daddy, gone. For most of Eclipse, the reader is blissfully free of Edward's constant chuckling, condescending remarks, sneering observations, and alleged physical perfection.So is Bella; but unfortunately, she doesn't take this as good news. Instead, she spends her time pining for him and having even less personality than usual. When she isn't being utterly passive, she's flinging herself into dangerous situations with no thought for anyone's feelings but her own. Her monstrous self-absorption is actually rather impressive considering how little self there is for her to be absorbed in.Still, Bella sans Edward is a huge improvement, storywise.2. Jacob's story is pretty cool. It's really a shame we all know (view spoiler)[he's a werewolf (hide spoiler)], because Meyer does some really good storytelling here. Jacob is afraid that some former friends of his have been sucked into a cult, and terrified that he's being targeted as the next member of the creepiness club. Even his father seems to see what's happening and approve of it. Bella is worried, but tries to reassure him. The next thing she knows, he's hanging out with the very gang he'd been so afraid of – and wants nothing to do with her, though they'd been best friends just a few days before.BWAHAHAHAHAHA.It's actually quite compelling. Unfortunately, Edward comes back, Bella feels validated in her steadfast refusal to get a life, and Jacob is kicked to the curb.The end.P.S. I've already started reading Eclipse. I'm less than 200 pages in and I can't tell you how many times I've begged to have Hitler or Stalin or Mussolini brought back to life just long enough for me to beat them to death with this book and then use it as kindling for their funeral pyre. I'm absolutely enraged at how horrifyingly stalkerish and controlling Edward is being. Any suggestions for my take on that review are most welcome, since at this point it's looking like one long scream. ",55,0.9898,0.09,0.775,0.135,0.48981688809275,NEGATIVE,0.9997

Being a Lit student, I've always admired Shakespeare and his plays, but surprisingly, Romeo & Juliet was the first book of his I hated..You might want to know why..First of all Romeo & Juliet is called one of the greatest romance of all times. Why? Because both of them played dead to be with each other, but the end, they ended up dying for real. While others see this as a sweet love story, I don't....For me the greatest love story is a grandpa and a grandma who face life together and grew old together.

30,13323233,01/23/2008,2.0,"Not as good as Twilight having chosen to abandon EVERY element that made it so great but still manages to keep this book afloat with the new mystery and dangers.Edward leaving wasn't surprising, he kept thinking about it before when Bella was in the hospital and it was a drama and angst inducing twist- it was bound to happen in due time. I just can't believe Bella's self esteem went from feeling occasional envy and remorse due to Edward's perfection to not considering herself worthy of him and constantly reminding herself how unworthy she is- she couldn't consider him lying to her at all! Hey, Meyer, where did the observant, sarcastic Bella go that we grew to know and love? Because this spineless, pathetic shell can't be true- I thought Bella was smarter than that. I actually googled ""psychotic"" and found ""psychotic depression"", the symptoms being: suicidal thoughts (Ed's voice itself could qualify), suicide attempts (all of her attempts to hear Ed's voice), audio and or visual hallucination (Ed's voice again and her vision of him before passing out in the ocean), not feeling as you once did when well (hole in chest), aggression (well, she couldn't bring herself to be mad at Edward, even if she forgave him and understood his actions, her subconscious should still be mad), frustration (perhaps her visits to the Cullen home and meadow), and feelings of hopelessness (the entire book, from being upset to aging at the beginning to her woes of the Volturi and Jake at the end). Great, we got ourselves a crazy person (no offense to those actually afflicted with this). Sheesh Bella, get back your old spine then fix it so you can stop embarrassing teenage girls. At least Bella is now certain that Edward loves her.I know many fans were upset at Edward's scarce appearances and even more upset and even mad with Jake taking his place. Now, I like Jake, he's fun, sweet, loyal, has a temper, fixes automobiles- wait, that's- that's a personality I spy. Whodathunkit. Besides Alice and Carlisle, none of the other characters have displayed a prominent hobby that they do on a regular basis for fun rather than as part of the plot. Though not nearly as perfect as Edward, Jake offers a sorely needed element to Bella's tale: humanity. Jake is a human with all its flaws and gifts- he jokes, he mocks, he fixes motorcycles, he fears, and he loves. Of course is not only human. I just don't understand why he loves Bella, Meyer actually gives a brief second person POV to help us better understand Jake, the only thing it did was make me question his love for Bella even more. She offers him nothing besides a free motorcycle. Poor Jake, forced to love Bella for the sake of plot.I suspected werewolves when Jake mentioned wolves being sacred to the Quileutes back in Twilight not too mention being Native American with the skin walker legend- it wasn't very surprising (that and I read werewolves in that copyright page). The werewolves added a very homey, nature sort of feel to the story which I enjoyed, I think I would like a tale of Native American werewolf teenage boys more than the Cullens. Though the fact that only boys are werewolves only added more fuel to my fire of ""The Twilight Saga is Misogynistic"". You can deny it all you like Stephenie Meyer but Alice nor Jane- only two pros- is enough to fight back the tides supporting this. If you're so ""anti-human"" then why are all the women so desperate, bitter, and clingy, huh?The Volturi. Now this was cool. It made the dull middle all worth it here. Aro was fun (the only one to be), Jane was too happy-to-serve-and-hurt-people-while-creepily-smiling, you know, those little girls who won't stop creepily smiling, they annoy me. Sadly, the Volturi are basically, your typical baddies who dress in black, act intimidating, and set a time line to force someone's hand and create more drama and tension. Their role as secret keepers makes them unique but... Why must the vampires remain secret from humans? Unlike your typical vampire, Meyer's are not vulnerable to ANYTHING besides another vampire and werewolves and even then they can survive that unless all parts of the torn apart vampire are burned. Why hide? Bad Meyer, she made such an interesting group yet has no good reason for them to exist.Victoria... geez, why does her desire to kill Bella for vengeance only strengthen my idea that the universe revolves around Bella? It can't be because the Cullens, James, the Volturi, Forks High, and the werewolves are all either out to get her, romantically pursue her, worship her, or protect her when she doesn't deserve it. Meyer's writing is nothing special but it made Twilight magical and actually made my heart race in the meadow; it possessed a simple and descriptive prose that definitely helped me envision the setting. New Moon's was not as magical but it was still descriptive (certainly better than the robotic Eclipse). The pacing is also strange- Meyer merely wrote the months' names on the pages to show how detached Bella was from her ""hopeless"" life and then taking so long to tell us of her bonding with Jake. Interesting and effective but dull and slow nonetheless.My biggest gripe with New Moon is how Bella never grew as a human. She spent all her time holding onto Edward- who DUMPED her- and then clinging to Jake as a life support, then of course abandoning Jake to save her love and then clinging to him even more desperately then Jake. I can pity her but only when Edward (and the other Cullens) return does Bella return to normal. It was pathetic and sickening. Damn it Bella, you're a human girl, ACT LIKE ONE! Another grip is how New Moon turned into a love triangle (or will turn since that action takes place in the sequel). Meyer has stated that Twilight was meant to be a stand alone novel and it certainly shows. We came for Bella and Edward and now we have this love triangle which I cannot understand. Bella becomes absolutely pathetic and whiny, Jake's love goes unexplained and serves as nothing more than like Paris in Romeo & Juliet, and Edward is seen so seldom it threw the story off balance. The werewolves provided a nature, family, real horror feel, so I enjoyed the book more than an average Edward fan. But trust me reader, it only gets worse! Prepare yourself for Eclipse which spends the majority of its incredible length too strengthening Bella and Jake and leaving Bella and Edward in the ""Too Be Developed if Ever"" category. Just stop here for nothing more than a supremely lame love triangle of inexplicable absurdities awaits you- and bad writing.",51,-0.9574,0.177,0.661,0.162,0.5248189198189197,NEGATIVE,0.6705
31,1454019383,11/28/2015,1.0,"Continuing from my review of Twilight, I'm going to refute points that claim that Twilight is better than Harry Potter. I repeat, I'm only posting this because I read this article. I'm literally only refuting the points mentioned in this, nothing else. I don't like comparison, but if the other party does it, be sure that I will respond. 
REBUTTAL POINTS 11-20:
11. In harry potter all they do is fly around on brooms and kill people with magic sticks (wands) I mean, really?In Twilight, all they do is lust after each other and play baseball. I mean, really? In defence of Harry Potter, though, they also learn magic, give exams, celebrate Christmas and Halloween, deal with loss, deal with horrible teachers, plan their careers, protect the downtrodden (remember SPEW), participate in duels, watch Quidditch, play Quidditch, go to Hogsmeade, learn to make potions, and more importantly, learn of the importance of human relationships. I could go on, but I'm sure you get the gist.12. Edward wasn't a dork. Yeah, sometimes, dorks are cute. However, Harry was a bit too dorky and I can't see why girls even liked him.No, Edward wasn't a dork. He was just an asshole paedophile who wanted to fuck a virgin. And yes, dorks are adorable (going by what I assume dorks are, anyway). My (most recent) ex is a dork...? and he is genuinely one of the best people I know. Harry was also, as you put it, dorky, but he was a good person. You see, normal girls like good people. By this point, I'm honestly wondering what the relevance of all this is in proving that Twilight is superior, because honestly, none of these points are even remotely sensible. But my momma didn't raise a quitter, so I trudge along.13. Harry Potter is for virgin nerds. Twilight is for cool and mature people.How refreshingly mature of you! Not. *rolls eyes* Honestly, I'm definitely more mature than you are if this is the best you can come up with. 14. Hermione is a week character. Unline Bella, who struggles every day. Hermione has no problems, the only things she has are self-created. She follows Harry into his troubles. Big whoop. Even if she is teased about being a mud blood or whatever its called, she has a choice. She could quit Hogwarts or something. Bella has no choice, she is in love.I'm sorry, what? You take that back right now!!! Are you actually serious about this? Hermione Granger is an inspiration to girls everywhere. She is smart, confident, independent, kind, compassionate, and one of the most amazing fictional characters to ever bless us. She doesn't have problems that 'she's created', she knows the sacrifices that she has to make for the greater good of the people. Bella doesn't even make sacrifices for her family (except Edward, but that's mostly because she wants the big D)! She doesn't follow Harry anywhere. She chooses to help him bring order into the world. She chooses to fight evil because that's who she is, a good person. And the whole mud-blood issue that you so carelessly trivialise has a much deeper connotaion in dealing with the stigma that people face for being different. She wouldn't quit Hogwarts, she's not a quitter. Besides, we don't see her complaining, do we? To paraphrase Hagrid, NEVER. INSULT. HERMIONE. GRANGER. IN. FRONT. OF. ME. And what bullshit! Bella of course, has a choice. She's just a co-dependent mope who cannot live on her own. Love Lust vs. the greater good. Hmm...tough choice there. 15. Twilight was a best selling novel, and has a bigger fan base than Harry Potter.You know as well as I do that Harry Potter has sold more copies. This actually goes against your own argument. Oh, and Harry Potter definitely has a better and much larger fan base. In my own house, everyone from my grandmother to my second cousin once removed has read and enjoyed Harry Potter, while I'm the only one who's subjected myself to medieval torture the Twilight series. There's also this gesture.16. Stephenie Meyer writes that the only thing that can kill a vampire is another vampire or a werewolf. Since Edward is a vampire created by Meyer, we can use her written characteristics and apply them to Harry Potter. Since Harry Potter is neither vampire nor wolf, this means that Harry Potter could not kill Edward and Edward would win.Finally, a point that makes remote sense. Okay, first of all, why would you assume that there are no werewolves in Harry Potter? There's Remus Lupin, who is my all time favourite Harry Potter character. There are also actual evil werewolves like Fenrir Greyback who would be more than happy to kill your precious Edward. There are other vampires in Harry Potter also, but we never really pay much attention to them. I wonder why?! Alternately, because you're bringing Edward into a world created by Rowling, where all magical creatures more or less have those powers that are traditionally credited to them, a vampire may be destroyed by using methods that one would usually use to purge such undead. Think garlic, holy water, or the holy cross. Either way, you lose. 17. Twilight led to many other supernatural romances in books and tv shows.Actually, if my knowledge is to be trusted (and it is), every other vampire-related show/book/work I've come across predates Twilight. 18. Unlike Harry, nobody's thoughts are actually that deep or intellectual. I bet if any of us published our thoughts into a book, none would be great English lit; Bella's thoughts are more realistic.Harry's thoughts aren't really deep and intellectual either. Granted, he's a lot smarter than Bella; the troll in Philosopher's Stone is smarter than Bella, honestly, but he thinks just like anyone else would. Bella's thoughts are either along the lines of ""I HAZ LUSSSSST"" or ""everything sucks"". Hate to break it to ya, darling, but Bella's thoughts are insipid, and that's me putting it kindly. 19. at least all of them dosent a scar of a lightning bolt.At least all of them aren't sparkly vampires. (Also, did we read the same Harry Potter, because if my memory serves me right, only one of them, i.e., Harry has a lightning bolt scar.)20. no witchcraft (practicing witchcraft is bad).I have come to the point of praying that these reasons have some element of sarcasm to them. Okay, let me break this down for you. It's pure fiction. Besides, if you think witchcraft is bad, shouldn't you think vampirism is bad? Seeing as how it is actually a sub culture where people bite each other and drink each other's blood? It might do you good to look into Richard Chase, aka the ""Vampire of Sacramento"", one of America's most prolific serial killers.

34,3955328106,04/19/2021,,"EDCOB: A LOVE STORYPart 1 by meThe air was damp and chilly and the waves crashed on the black cliffside. Bella thought of throwing herself down those cliffs. She imagined Edward’s velvety voice in her head. Jacob had promised her cliff-diving in the morning. Just because he was unavailable, Stupid Bella thought, should she have to give up the distraction she needed. Just because he was out there fighting for Bella. (Well technically, Bella, you should not go and risk your life but when do you listen)Bella wanted to jump. It was clearly the most reckless and stupidest thing she had ever done. And because she was suicidal, she smiled. The wind blew stronger now, whipping the rain into eddies around her.Stupid Bella stepped out to the edge, keeping her eyes on the empty space in front of her. Her toes felt ahead blindly, caressing the edge of the rock when they encountered it. She drew in a deep breath and held it...waiting.“Bella.”She was clearly hallucinating. But she didn't wanna believe it. She wanted to throw herself off a cliff for a blood-sucking vampire she had just met in the last book. Bella smiled and exhaled.“Don’t do this,” Edward's voice warned. She rolled up onto the balls of her feet.“No, Bella!” He was angry now, and the anger was so lovely.She smiled and raised her arms straight out, as if she was going to dive, lifting her face into the rain. But it was too ingrained from years of swimming at the public pool—feet first, first time. Bella leaned forward, crouching to get more spring...And Stupid Bella flung herself off the cliff.She screamed as she dropped through the open air like the fking fool she was. And then the current caught herStupid Bella, Edward shook his head, pressing his lips in disappointment, Now I'll have to come and save you, dammit.Bella fought to keep her breath in. She was going to drown. Stupid Bella was drowning and no one would come to save her like they did every time.Again she was hallucinating, his perfect face as if he were really there; the exact shade of his icy skin, the shape of his lips, the line of his jaw, the gold glinting in his furious eyes. Because she was dying? (No, Bella, because now he will have to save you that is what he said.)She closed her eyes. And waited for Edward to come and save her.***Edward was having an awesome day. He hadn't had to see whiny Bella who kept insisting that she was his girlfriend for a long time. He was chilling on the beach and watching the waves crashing on the other coast through his cool shades. But then he suddenly felt someone screaming in his brain. He grimaced. No, no, no. But it was exactly that. Stupid Bella was doing her stupid stuff. It was such a nuisance. He rolled his shoulders, pocketed his shades and whizzed to the other coast where there were tall, black cliffs. And then in slow motion, he saw a tiny figure plunging into the water. If it were up to him, he would never save her. But whiny Bella was still screaming and because Ed was Mr. Perfect, he had to save her. When he reached the cliff, Bella was in the water, struggling to swim as the current pulled her. Edward, in slow-mo, removed his shirt. Technically he would never get wet but just for posterity and the posters. He hesitated, eyeing the water. Then he heard something. It sounded human.He turned. Edward's breath caught in his throat. It was a man, shirtless, his figure cutting right through Edward's heart. His dark, short hair stood up in spikes, droplets of water glistening on them. And his abs...oh man, his abs were the best he'd ever seen. ""Jacob?"" Edward squeaked, his perfect voice suddenly nervous. What was happening to him?Jacob. Oh the werewolf Jacob. He had always been drawn to him whenever he had seen him in town. His name rolled off his tongue and Edward struggled to pull himself together. ""Yeah.""""Wait,"" Jacob held up his hand, ""You are Bella's ex-boyfriend she can't stop babbling about? I have seen you before.""""Ugh,"" Edward groaned and ran his hand through his hair, ""Ex. She is too clingy and whiny and dumb.""""I know right,"" Jacob had a different look in his eyes. A look that melted Edward's resolve and his toes curled, ""But I also didn't know you were so...attractive."" Jacob coughed and looked away. Edward, though he was a vampire, could feel a blush (or something akin to it) creeping on his cheeks. He rubbed his neck awkwardly. His heart (or something akin to it) was thumping in loudly and he sure everyone could hear it. His gaze dragged itself to the perfect abs that were shining with sweat and water. And Jacob's eyes...his eyes were a dark brown, the color of his favourite chocolate. ""I didn't know you were so handsome,"" Edward said, then chided himself. He was clearly lying. Edward had crushed on him from afar. He didn't know why he had said that but he felt full when Jacob met his eyes and smiled shyly. They stood in silence. The only sound was the water thundering on the shore, trying to engulf everything. Edward felt an ache in his chest but it did not hurt. It was...beautiful. He could not look away from Jacob. There was something magnetic about him. He-he wanted to be near him, to snuggle with him and to...kiss him. Edward let out a strangled cry. He was so confused. But this was attraction, was it not? He liked him. ""Ahem,"" Jacob interrupted, ""Is something wrong?""""No, nothing,"" Edward said quickly. Too quickly. Jacob raised his eyebrows. Edward sighed, ""I am not able to think straight around you."" (Pun, get it??)Jacob looked at him and for a fleeting moment, Edward felt he had said something wrong. Horrified, he started babbling, ""I'm sorry. I mean, I, I didn't mean it that way. I meant-ah, it is all coming out wrong-""""I can't think straight around you too,"" Jacob cut in, his voice all bashful, ""I have a crush on you.""Edward stared at him, his jaw hung open. Not straight. And he liked him too. His heart was fluttering. Yes! Jacob now moved to him, and Edward was still shocked. Then Jacob held a hand to his chin and shut his jaw. That is when Edward snapped out of it. He could feel tingling all over his body, his nerves focusing on his cheek and his arm where Jacob touched him. He gazed in his eyes and Jacob couldn't tear away. Edward had an inner battle. 
Brain: What is happening.Heart: Your crush is touching you!Brain: what. is. happening. Heart: Love is love!Brain:  Am I not straight?Heart:  Edcob is my OTP!!!Brain:  What should I do?Heart:  kiss him!Brain:  Are you crazy?Heart:  Their song will be-
Before he could change his mind, Edward took a deep breath and closed the distance between them. He softly pressed his lips Jacob's and then drew back. Jacob grinned and pulled him towards him and they kissed again, the wind whipping their hair and their hearts jumping with joy. That day Edward's brain burned a socket: i. kissed. my. crush.When they finally broke away, Jacob’s eyes were wide, ""But what about-""Edward and Jacob completed the sentence, wincing, ""Bella?""They inched to the edge of the cliff and glanced downwards. Jacob gulped and Edward bit his lips. ""Oops?""~THE END~Here you have it. A gay love story between Edward and Jacob while Bella in under the cliff.

35,3481075823,04/26/2021,1.0,"Me @ the people who thought Twilight was bad: In all honesty, Twilight wasn’t terrible. At least it was entertaining. New Moon, however...TW: Depression, attempted suicideBella Swan barely had a life, but after Edward left her, she took what little life she had and poured it down the drain. Apparently, Bella cannot survive without this hot vampire she met six months ago ago so now everything revolves around him and she wants nothing more in life.At the beginning of the book, Bella is already stressy and depressy because she’s a year older than Edward now. And that’s bad because she now looks older than Edward. There’s no way you can be a year older than your boyfriend, can you? It’s absolutely unheard of. She even has nightmares about being an old lady while Edward is still a young teenage vampire.Edward refuses to turn her into a vampire because he insists that he doesn’t want her to “lose her soul.”  “I don’t care! You can have my soul. I don’t want it without you - it’s yours already.” I’m 99% certain her soul looks like this:So I doubt it would be much of a loss, anyways.But then, Edward leaves her because he claims that “his world is not for her.” Don’t even start, crusty old man. We all know you’re going to come running back soon anyways. “Love, life, meaning...over."" (please, as if you had a ‘meaning’ to begin with. Let alone a life. And love? Nothing without eDwArd.)After that, the next few chapters are as follows:October: November:December:January:Let’s be honest here. At this point, I felt both genuinely concerned as well as bad for Bella. She really needs to find someone better, less toxic than Edward, perhaps? I think she also needs some therapy. A rock would do her wonders.Bella has four months of time in which she does absolutely nothing. She’s depressed, and badly. Edward was basically her only personality trait and when that was taken away, well...this was what happened. Not to mention the fact that she literally threw away all of her friendships? Everyone who was nothing but kind to her (at least, at the beginning of Twilight) and now she’s suddenly bitter at all of them.I was about to say “thank GOD,” when Jacob showed up. He, at least, was no Edward. Unfortunately, the only friendships that Bella has are with guys because she’s Not Like Other Girls. However, I was hoping that it would at least help her keep her mind off of the one single Important thing in her life that had gone away.Well, Bella only wants one thing, at first.After that absolutely DEVASTATING turn of events, and several months of doing nothing but think about Edward’s marble face, Bella has a purpose!! She suddenly wants to build a motorcycle.After weeks - or perhaps months - of working on this motorcycle behind their parents’ backs, Jacob and Bella finally finish the motorcycle. But oh no, this was not what Jacob had intended at all. You see, Bella had a completely different idea of what she was going to do with this motorcycle.She built the motorcycle so she can crash it and hear Edward’s velvety voice again.Please, for the sake of everyone, get this girl some help.Jacob starts being moody all of a sudden, hanging around with these random guys. I had hoped it would be something more interesting, but no. He’s just a werewolf :(So then, don’t ask me why, Bella Swan decides to jump off a cliff.Edward thinks she committed suicide, and decides that he, too, will commit suicide because he totally didn’t just leave her alone in miserable Forks. Yay. Then we have this cringeworthy-dramatic-set-of-scenes that are almost laughable where Bella and Alice have to travel to Italy and stop Edward just and time.I don’t care.Romeo and Juliet was already written, we don’t need a part two. No thanks. Not to mention there were LITERALLY Romeo and Juliet quotes in this book.Oh, and let me just mention the amount of problematic moments / conversations we had in this book. In the thankfully small portion of time that Edward appears, this book still manages to include toxic scenes because we love that.There’s this one scene near the end where Edward says: “By the way,” he said in a casual tone. “I’m not leaving you.” Glad to hear that. Anyways, Bella says back,  “Don’t promise me anything.” And, okay, however boring and stupid and whiny Bella is, I can understand that. He left her, and she thought it was for good. It would be foolish to rekindle hope at that point. Instead of Edward understanding, here’s what happens: Anger glinted in his metallic black eyes. “You think I’m lying to you now?” Well, genius, you didn’t exactly tell the truth last time. Stop getting angry for no reason.In case you wanted to know what New Moon did to my braincells:0.5 stars.- - -I impulsively read this entire book during two days of class because I was bored, and idk if it was worth it because this book was terrible.At least I didn't have to pay as close attention so I could have focus on my teacher because I didn't care about this at all",45,-0.984,0.138,0.75,0.111,0.5149266753917916,NEGATIVE,0.999

Bella is devastated and goes into a depression. It's not until she reconnects with her friend Jacob that she finally starts coming to life again.I really found myself liking Jacob a lot in this one. I thought he was a wonderful, interesting, and very sympathetic character. The growing relationship between him and Bella was beautifully written. You could see how much they really cared for each other, although with Bella she loved him like a friend/brother, whereas with Jacob it was more than that.Edward was back toward the end where the story took a different turn.

37,28973531,08/01/2008,2.0,"...what is there to even say?I liked about 80% of this book. Liked as in actually sort of kind of enjoyed it. I mean, yeah, it was still redundant and Bella was still pathetic, but I like Jacob, and I actually liked the werewolf storyline. It's too bad that Bella and Edward aren't broken up for the rest of the series. Or that they aren't, you know, murdered and put out of their own misery. Alas, Edward comes back and INSTANTLY the novel goes from pretty decent to MOTHERFUCKING RIDICULOUS. This was definitely an improvement from the Twilight, but it's hard to say you ""liked"" a book when it ends and all you want to do is grab the main character by the neck and throw her around. Here are just a few of my problems with New Moon:01) After realizing that the group of people she just passed by (and can now hear screaming) are being MURDERED, Bella comments, ""I knew it was stupid to react like this. Who knew how much time I had to look at this face? He was saved, and I was saved, and he could leave me as soon as we were free. To have my eyes so filled with tears that I could not see his features clearly was wasteful -- insanity."" ...wtf? That may be the only truly SANE reaction she has to ANYTHING. People just DIED, woman! It's okay to be upset. Edward's face actually isn't more important than that. I'm convinced she is in fact mentally ill.02) She's a shitty ass friend. 'Nough said. Jacob dun need that.03) She'd let Edward turn her into a vampire in a heartbeat, but is afraid of what her mother would say if she MARRIED him. Uh...!??!?! I almost lost my shit reading that part.04) Honestly, I don't know how she wasn't suicidal before she met Edward. He's her only interest. What did she do before she met him?I think they need to carry the Romeo & Juliet comparison out completely. I won't be satisfied until both of these idiots are dead and gone. I hope that's how Breaking Dawn ends, but, Lawd help me, I may have to read to find out.",44,0.5935,0.175,0.632,0.193,0.6583423520923519,NEGATIVE,0.9996

This one, about love momentarily lost, has more dimensions and significantly broadens the world of vampires and werewolves. That you can read 100 pages in an hour or so is also a perk, though... poor, poor trees.Here, the metaphor for becoming a victim, though not as one would consider in a vampire novel where the protagonist could just become one and see for herself with monster eyes, is actually that of becoming victim to LOVE, or, at least, what the protagonist feels is love. Infatuation, desire, masked suicidal thoughts... ""New Moon"" touches on these all. If I were not to read deeper into this series, then I'd stop reading these books altogether. Howevah...

New Moon was absolutely heart-wrenching (you can tell I invest heavily in these books can't you?!). But I was physically unable to put it down, and only just managed it for toilet breaks.It's Bella's 18th birthday and a simple paper cut as she opens her presents leads Edward's brother Jasper to almost kill her - to keep her safe, Edward decides to sever ties with her, convincing her that the Cullen family must move on - must leave Forks - and so must she.She does not take it well. After a week of being catatoinc and several months of going through the motions like a depressed zombie she discovers that if she does something reckless and her adrenaline gets going, she hears Edward's voice talking to her in her head. And so, in order to hear it again, she enlists the help of her friend from the reservation, Jacob Black, into restoring an old motorbike and teaching her how to ride it.Jacob is the only one able to block out the pain of Edward's absence, so Bella starts spending a lot of time with him. When he suddenly breaks contact with her, she's determined to see him again. Which is when she discovers that the old tribal legends are not just superstitions: he's become a werewolf, a protector of the people - from the vampiric Cullen family, against which they have deep enmity. Only the treaty between them keeps them from attacking Edward and his family.The pack of 5 werewolfs - all young men from the reservation - are on the track of a pair of vampires who are hunting for Bella and manage to kill one, Laurent. Victoria is still on the loose. Meanwhile, despite the danger, Bella is still doing what she can to hear Edward's voice again. So she decides to cliff-dive, which works, but she nearly drowns.Edward's sister Alice, who sees the future, thinks she sees Bella die - and so rushes back to Forks. Unfortunately, his other sister Rosalie, who has never liked Bella, tells Edward what Alice saw - and when Edward calls the house asking for Bella's dad, Jacob tells him he's at the funeral, neglecting to say whose funeral. And so Alice sees Edward rushing to Italy to do whatever it takes for the ancient, royal vampire family in residence there, to kill him. Alice and Bella must race against time to prevent it.There are several references to Romeo and Juliet in this one that make me a little nervous. If this trilogy has a sad ending I will be very upset! I felt so much for Bella, her pain was so believable, her yearning so bitter, I felt like I was going through the same thing. The scenes where she hears Edward's voice in head, warning her, advising, pleading with her not to do something reckless, often had me laughing with exuberant relief - the sound of his voice had just as much an effect on me, it seemed. And even though I was quite sure she would rescue him in time, like Bella I was never quite sure whether he would stay, or leave again.All in all I am getting just a little bit too wound up in this story, but I can't help it and there's one more left which I have already started and almost dread finishing. My hope is that Bella will get her wish and be turned into a vampire, so that they can stay together. I have my fingers crossed, but that's why the references to Romeo and Juliet make me so anxious, as if Meyer is setting up for a tragic ending after so much love and loss.",42,-0.973,0.128,0.777,0.094,0.4965493689983486,NEGATIVE,0.9995

When they part ways, Bella struggles to come to terms with the fact that he's really gone. She doesn't eat, she barely sleeps, and even though this isn't technically a paranormal species in the series, she acts an awful lot like a zombie. That is until Jacob shows up. Mmmmmm Jacob. 😌 ❤️🐺 😏 (You already know which team I'm on)One afternoon, while wandering the streets of Forks, Bella comes across two old motorcycles. She takes them to her friend, who she knows likes to work on cars (Jacob). The two work on the bikes and learn to ride them and the more time they spend together, the happier Bella starts to feel, slowly coming out of her depression.

Edward proceeds to ask zero follow-up questions and decides to kill himself, because obviously the only explanation is that Bella is dead and he just can't go on living without her.

43,826272621,01/17/2014,2.0,"THIS BOOK IS TRASH BUT I LOVE IT OKAY??? Now onto why it's trash:* With this book, Meyer managed to erase any sort of personality Bella had. Gone is the funny, sarcastic, loving girl that we met in Twilight and I absolutely hated this. Bella’s worth isn’t tied to her boyfriend and I hated that the author went this way* There’s so much reckless/damaging/problematic/unhealthy behaviour depicted in this book, it’s ridiculous. There’s talk of suicide as if it’s something normal. The depression Bella falls into is so deep, that it was painful to read (tbh, Charlie should have called a therapist within the first week of Edward’s departure). She uses Jacob selfishly, although she admits to herself that this is what she’s doing and she knows that it’s unhealthy, yet she perseveres with this behaviour. There’s actual behaviour that encourages hallucinations, later explained as her subconscious telling her that Edward loved her. No. Just no.* I understand that first loves/true loves are intense and that, as a teenager, Bella’s behaviour is exaggerated (at least, that’s how I saw it - it IS a supernatural love story and we shouldn’t erase the supernatural/extraordinary factor), but I think Meyer went overboard. Bella acts as if she died, as if her world stopped spinning, as if there’s nothing more worth fighting for, as if there’s a physical part of her missing and while I can empathise with that, I fear that this is such a poor example to girls her age. Girls have to know that they’re their own person, that they’re beautiful and strong and amazing all on their own, that they’re worth to be loved and cherished. Bella’s dependence on Edward is scary, there’s no way around saying that.* Also, her depression suddenly just disappeared when Edward got back?!? It's not how it works?!? * Which brings me to our favourite (?) sparkling vampire. I can follow Edward’s reasons for leaving. I do believe he honestly thought he was doing what was best for Bella, he was doing what he felt he needed to protect her, from himself and his world. He does love her. The execution of his thoughts, however, is a different matter. He manipulated Bella into thinking he didn’t love her anymore, he broke up with her in the woods, leaving her there alone, knowing how accident-prone she is, he effectively made her think he didn’t exist, by removing all traces of his existence in her life. He prohibited his family to contact her. He had to have know how dependent she was of him and what this break-up would do to her.* Their dependence on each other is also problematic as hell. They effectively erase themselves as individuals in this relationship, and that’s something that should not be encouraged at all. * The good parts: I loved the fact that Meyer introduces POC characters. The werewolves were a wonderful addition to the story and I found myself looking forward to those parts of the story. * With a couple of mishaps, the writing is good. As always, descriptive, but in a good way, it helps a lot with visualising the setting. * I’m sticking with my original 2 star rating for this book. It’s got way too many negatives and they outweigh any positives.",41,0.9948,0.117,0.694,0.189,0.5997331691297212,NEGATIVE,0.9991
44,26459377,07/06/2008,3.0,"I know a couple of things about love. I know that when you meet the truelove, you “just know” because it’s like you walked with that person once upon a dream. Out to dinner one time, I overheard a man at another table describing this perfectly: “I was at a bar the other night,"" he said, ""and I looked across the room and suddenly noticed this girl. I felt like I had seen her before, but I couldn’t think where I might have met her, so I thought I was probably in love. You know, like they say, ‘The first time I saw her, I felt like I had seen her before.’ Then, while I was looking at her, my mouth started to water. So, I thought that’s probably what it’s like when you fall in love – your body just reacts to the other person. ""Then, I realized that she’s the girl who serves me at Taco Bell.” That’s pretty much the story of Edward Cullen and Bella Swan as they walk on the scene in New Moon. The problem is, to continue the Taco Bell metaphor, Edward and his family are, like, ravenous fans of Mexican food. They’re like high college kids. And Bella’s not the girl who serves the tacos, she is the taco. You can see how that would be a problem.I also know that it’s statistically proven that once a girl falls in love, if she’s ever away from the boy she loves, she goes into a coma. Traditionally, this used to happen because of the evil fairy who put a spell on the girl. Nowadays, it happens because of psychology, but this all becomes an argument in semantics, and who wants to have the dark fairy/brain waves fight again? Not me. Some go with faith and some with evidence, but let’s still be friends.What I’m trying to say is that New Moon is an American girl reinvention of Sleeping Beauty. (Not American Girl with a capital ‘G’ – that would be way too creepy for me. This is just a vampire/warewolf story, don’t worry.) It’s American girl in the sense that instead of helpful, matronly fairies (so retro-Euro) our heroine in New Moon finds some smokin’ hot Native American boys to keep her company while she’s away from her truelove. Also, instead of baking a silly cake, they build a motorcycle – less tasty, but way more badass (in theory, if not execution). Otherwise, the stories are basically the same. They are especially similar in that the villains, not the heroes, are the stars of the show. The Bellrora (Aurella?) character is stupid, jumping off cliffs with no cliff-jumping training and climbing all through the castle to prick her finger on the only spinning-wheel needle around. You have to want to slap this girl. The villains, on the other hand, have pizzazz. Maleficent is the reason to watch Sleeping Beauty just as the Volturi are the only thing that make New Moon readable. Actually, these stories are not just read/watchable, I even really like both of them because of the villains.The major technical place where the Twilight Saga went wrong, to my mind, was in staying with the Edward/Bella love story, which was mostly drained of any blood (bah dum tsss) in the first book. The more I got to know these characters, the more I realized that I didn’t much care for them in the first place, which is too bad because I would rather think I like them. It would have been easier to do so if Bella had undied in the first book, and Meyer moved on to tell the love stories of the other vamps in the Cullen club in the rest of the books. The thing I like the most about Meyer, however, is that she’s not ever crafting a story, she’s always just telling you what happened to her bf’s in fantasy land. She is so in love with Bella and Edward that she had to continue with their story. This has its obvious downsides technically, but it also has the major upside that nothing seriously bad ever happens to a Meyer character. Drama, sure, but no real tragedy. I hope she continues with this M.O. in the future because if you know that’s the kind of story you’re getting into, it makes for a really relaxing read. And it comes as naturally to her as perpetual frustration does to Joss Whedon or gettin in ur revew an makin ur awgumentz does to an LOLcat. I can appreciate all of them. I really hate it when I feel that an author ruins a character’s life just to prove something to the literati, and because a sad ending would be so unnatural to Meyer, I hope she doesn’t sell out.So, there are these things I know about love from Disney and Stephenie Meyer (to recap: love at first sight, coma), but there are other things I don’t understand about love. For example, I don’t know why what I know about love would sound like a good idea to anyone. This plays out within the New Moon story in a way that is beautiful and even slightly profound, though almost certainly unintentional. The Twilight Saga is all about addiction and abstinence. Edward was unborn into his addiction to blood. Most vampires are so consumed by their desire for blood that they lose all control over their bodies when they smell it. Meyer venerates the Cullens for resisting human blood, in contrast, and clearly endorses their abstinence. Everything about Bella’s passion for Edward, however, has the same markings of crazy as the vampires’ blood addiction. She even loses it when he kisses her in the same way Meyer describes the vampires frenzying for blood. Without Edward, Bella basically dies. Meyer does not characterize Bella’s obsession as the evil addiction that highlights the Cullens’ good abstinence, though. She probably doesn’t make the open distinction because it is a genuine inconsistency in the theme of the story, but I think it is less revealing of a flaw in Meyer’s writing than a true contradiction in American values. Don’t do drugs, kids, but when you meet your soul mate you will know because of the intoxicated feeling, and the best thing you can do is give up everything and live happily ever after. Maybe the idea is that drugs are a bad substitution for the natural high of intimacy. I’m not even scare quoting “intimacy” because I really do think the idea I’m talking about is sharing everything, not just sex. It seems to me, though, that both drugs and intimacy are a bad substitute for being an actual person. I’ve had friends who successfully avoid themselves by being obsessed with weed, and I’ve had friends who avoid themselves by being obsessed with their significant other. It honestly doesn’t look that different to me, and both end up being at the same time extreme and boring to be around. The “happily ever after” message admittedly creeps me out a little bit. I appreciate how awkwardly it works out in New Moon, though. I’m not going to claim that Meyer’s satirical skills are what make this series a pretty wonderful satire on American culture, but nevertheless I do think it is one. I actually think it is a more successful satire for its lack of self-awareness and defenses. People react in disproportionate anger to it because of what it reinforces in our values, not because of stilted dialog and the anachronistic use of the Discman. While many of us grew up with different ideas about spirituality or politics, most of us have the commonality of knowing from Disney, our true cultural parent, that a girl sleeps until her truelove battles through the traps of evil to find her and give her love’s true kiss. I don’t think it’s bad for that idea to be out there, and I think Meyer mixes it up in a nice way by having the girls save the day once this book actually starts to get good. I don’t like or agree with the idea, though, and I regret most of the ways that I have let ideas like that influence my own life. I don’t like the idea that these stories encourage kids to think that love should look like addiction, but I also hope that reading a story won’t force kids to become co-dependent.I guess I feel about Disney, and The Saga as its awkward stepsister, like that quote Augustine is attributed with having said, “The Church is a whore, but she’s my mother.” It’s probably possible to say that of anything deeply cultural that we struggle with but ultimately feel connected to. It has that level of, “I can say what I want about my family, but you’d better watch your mouth,” but also an acknowledgment that we can honor our roots and disagree with them at the same time. Sleeping Beauty isn’t a future that I embrace, but it is a past that I feel tender about. There is something so certain and easy about true love’s kiss that it is comforting, even though ultimately I think I prefer the brutal unpredictability of life. Less anemic. I don’t like for books to imitate life, though. There’s enough of reality everywhere without books forcing it on us. I like for books to be action-packed, hilarious, and melodramatic. It is nice when books can achieve some kind of insight into life even if the story is far removed from reality, but I don’t need that. I’m happy with crazy villains and unintentional satire, but if I read this again I plan to skip the boring part where Bella is sleepwalking. Sleeping Beauty is a more successful story in that Aurora knew to find a bed with a nice canopy and leave the action to the other characters.",39,0.9997,0.096,0.702,0.203,0.5512243180100322,NEGATIVE,0.9996

Seriously I don't get the hype! What is so great about this book? Or the series? Or the movies? All I see is a pale creepy guy who is over hundred years ruining a girl's life who has no character and personality and is the perfect Mary Sue character. Is this one‘s idea of the best books?

MessageIf your boyfriend leaves you try to kill yourself by jumping off a cliff instead of living a life. And if your girlfriend kills herself try to harm your entire cult by exposing yourself without even confirming her death in a proper manner. OH! And if you happen to be a Jacob don't try to win girls like Bella. They are a waste of your valuable time. PlotWhat plot? Guys, what plot are we talking about? This book has a plot? THAT is called plot? I just recently found out that the theme of this book was Romeo and Juliet? ROMEO AND JULIET?!?! This makes me hate the book even more. Jasper loses control, Edward turns possessive (a lot more than he was), they leave, Bella uses Jacob, Bella hurts Jacob, there are werewolves who are able to turn without the help of full moon, Bella does reckless things, Bella kills herself, Edward who is stupid tries to expose his cult and then get killed by this coven, Bella saves him, and then they lived happily ever after? Nah! I just had existential crisis trying to decide what to include in the plot section.

World buildingThis is the only thing that I can say has improved as compared to the first book. We just knew vampires who sparkle existed in the first one. I can name way better vampires than in twilight. Damon, Stefan, Klaus, Elijah, Kol, Katherine, Rebekah, Enzo et cetera all better than Edward and his family. AND VAMPIRES DON'T SPARKE! ONE CAN ONLY CHANGE INTO WEREWOLF ON A FULL MOON DAY!! 

And then there is this coven. I don't know anything about this coven except they are acquaintance of Carlisle. I don't even like how the 'coven' sounds like 'coven'. I liked that one lady who tortured Edward with fire in some book. It just wasn't built properly.Bella SwanOur MC. Unfortunately. One of the first Mary sue character I have ever met in my life. Centuries of practice couldn't make me tolerate her. She is such a bad influence to young girls! Jumping off of cliffs because your bf left you isn't going to make someone a strong character. Even if they don't have a character. Reckless motorbike rides just teach to be reckless and defy others. That is not a coping mechanism. When Edward left her she crumbled. No self-confidence, no life, no character, no trying to be happy, no trying to move on but instead she falls into a depression. Not only does she makes her life miserable, she makes other lives miserable too. (Charlie, Jacob, Jacob, Jacob, Jacob).  Yes, Bella is 'not like other girls' because the other girls have a life and try to make their lives happy. I was seriously elated when Edward left Bella. I though she would finally have some character and start trying to be better without him. Boy was I wrong. Bella is selfish and toxic makes Charlie's life a living hell. Her internal monologue is just 

EdwardToxic and Bye! (If you want me to write it, express it in the comments) JacobThe only sane person in the entire book. The only reason I did not throw it in the dnf folder was because of him.

Even though I totally dissed Twilight in this blog, I have an obsession with series and read New Moon.Why do I intentionally put myself through such dreck?New Moon is only a slight improvement over Twilight. The book has two things going for it:First, I had no expectations going in. I already knew it would be a poorly-written romance—and Meyer did not disappoint.Second, Bella, our heroine, and Edward, her prince, are separated throughout much of the novel. Though many readers were probably distressed by this turn of events, I was delighted. If they aren’t near each other, Bella and Edward can’t do any of their disgusting, gut-wrenching touching. Blech.In one way, though, the book is more painful than Twilight because Bella now has two admirers. And, truth be told, there is very little to admire in Bella. She is one of the weakest females in print. She spends her life moping and fainting. Why would one, let alone two, hot guys like her? (Obviously, Meyer is experiencing some wish fulfillment here.)Meyer, much like Rowling (who she is now erroneously being compared to), desperately needs a more forceful editor. New Moon is over 500 pages long and very little happens in those pages. I often found my mind—and my eye—wandering because she fills the book with meaningless fluff and repetitions. She obviously needs to read Richard Lanham’s Revising Prose again and start cutting out the lard.Unfortunately, the series has the same addictive properties for me as Days of Our Lives and Passions. The soap operas are absolute drivel, but I just have to know what happens next (and check out that hottie Elvis, Junior).Unfortunately, I do want to know what happens next in Meyer’s series, and I am even contemplating doing the unthinkable: buying Eclipse.

52,1435195630,11/06/2015,3.0,"New Moon is the second installment of the Twilight Series and with a broken heart I have to say that it was not as expected. Yes, I've read it without breathing but only because I wanted to search for the one thing that interested me: the relationship between Bella and Edward.We all know what happened, they split, leaving Bella heartbroken and vulnerable. If I would want to analyze the reasons that made Edward take this decision, I would not portrait him as the bad guy. Here I am very subjective and tend to understand everything he does. But a part of me knows that he was right. His world was different that Bella's and the incident with Jasper at her birthday party only made him realize the extend of the danger Bella is facing everyday. He loved her and that stood more alive than anything he felt. That was sacrifice in the most purely form and I admired him as a hero. The other part of me told me he was wrong. After you go through so many things with the one you love, you just don't give up on her, even if the cause is greater than anything. You protect her, you fight for her and especially you ask her if she wants to stay by your side. You don't take the decisions in her name. That is what Edward did and from my point of view it was not OK and lead to a lot of mess.. Edwards departure lead to Bella being friends with Jacob Black. We all know that he is in love with her her and in a way took advantage of her situation to win her off. I am not blaming Jacob or saying that he took advantage in an awful way. He was there for her, made her feel better and in a way healed her of the hurt she felt when Edward left. But, he knew that he could get close to her only if he is gone, because in another situation, Bella would have chosen Edward without even thinking twice. This rivalry between Jacob and Edward was born in Twilight and evolved in a very complex thing in New Moon. They are natural enemies because of their nature, but not, with Bella in the picture, they hate each other even more. I liked the way the 2 characters are put in an antithesis: cold vs warm, calm vs anger, wisdom vs eagerness, they couldn't have been more different. The only good thing that came from this rivalry and experience was the way Bella developed as a heroine. In the first book she was kind of weak, vulnerable and everyone had to her rescue. Now, after feeling how life is without Edward, she managed to continue living, despite her adrenaline rush and needs to see him, feel him only just a short period of time. The book was not consistent: it started out interesting and with a strong plot, but for me, after Edward left it just became flat and boring. I was intrigued by the development of Bella and Jacob's relationship, but not for a long period of time. I was just soooo focused on Edward returning that I could think of anything else. This inconsistency only made me classify the book in 2 parts: Before and After Edward.The last part was the most interesting, especially the last dialogues between Bella and Edward, but all-together, it wasn't something that was worthy of waiting 300 pages for. 3 stars for this one.

56,32740259,09/12/2008,1.0,"So, I found myself strangely addicted to the crack that is the Twilight saga. I know it’s not good for me, like binging on a quart of ice cream, but I couldn’t put this book down. Even at the times I wanted to hurl it across the room because I was so angry at the characters I was riveted in disbelief. I enjoyed the end of this book even less than the first.Whiny Bella gets old quick. She starts off this book upset that she is a year older than her dazzling immortal Edward who was 17 back in 1908 when he became a vampire. She is so upset that she doesn’t want to be reminded by celebrating her birthday, but of course, Alice, Edward’s sister, always gets her way when it comes to parties and the Cullens throw her one anyway. However, this party goes horribly awry as Bella is injured while Edward attempts to protect her from his brother who wants to eat her. (Guess she smells good to him, too.)Now having proof they are a danger to her, the Cullens leave Bella behind, but not before Edward fills her head with lies that he is over her and extracts a promise from Bella to not do anything stupid that would put her in harm’s way, for Charlie's sake of course. So begins her emotional breakdown as she lives the next few months as a shell of a human being. She is nothing without her man and all his sparkly hawtness. That is all he has going for him…his looks. This is one of the main themes I hate about this novel and the whole Bella and Edward relationship. This girl, who is supposed to be smart and mature (though I beg to differ) cannot seem to fathom a life without her dazzling, perfect Edward. But all he offers her is his perfectly angelic good looks. Can we say shallow, Bella? (Oh, okay he does play piano.) And does the fact that Bella is nothing without her man remind you of a certain someone from the first book that set Bella off to Forks in the first place? That’s right her mom Rene. So why is it we should sympathize with Bella for leaving her mom, when her relationship with Edward isn’t very different from Rene’s relationship with Phil?Well, after receiving an ultimatum from her father, Bella gives herself a kick in the pants and tries to live her life somewhat like a normal teenager. That’s where the story of Jacob and Bella starts. Now I love Jacob. He’s expressive, he has a hobby, and he hangs out with his friends doing normal teenage stuff. He has a personality and he's a werewolf! I have nothing against Jacob liking Bella as a friend but falling for her over motorcycles seems a reach to me. She was so obviously using him. I wanted him to slap her and tell her to get real. I wanted her to realize what she had been missing when she was being with Edward – a life. Even though, I knew Edward’s return was inevitable, I thought it would have added a nice complexity to have him return to a Bella who did get on with her life and realize things weren’t so bad after all (she toys with this idea for like, two seconds). Then he would have to work on getting her back and not with promises of sex (she could get that from Jacob) and immortality. But instead, Bella jumps off a cliff and Edward goes all emo and decides to kill himself.As much as I liked Jacob, I missed the Cullens and was glad they were back. However, when Edward returned I quickly grew annoyed with him. Edward is just creepy. I know he is suppose to be so good-looking (because Bella won’t shut up about it), but what is so attractive about someone who is hard as stone, ice cold to the touch and whose lips are like marble? I guess Bella would get just as hot kissing Michael Angelo’s David. At least a statue wouldn’t try to control her every move. Or throw a tantrum when he doesn’t get his way. So Bella is left running off to Italy to save his life and her fate at becoming a vampire is sealed. Now her selfish dream will be realized and she can leave her family and friends behind. Hurrah! At the end of the book, we are back to where we started, Bella wanting to be with Edward forever because he’s so “Sparkly”. He still thinks she smells good. You would think with all that time away from her he would have realized what he was missing-nothing. Even Bella says at the beginning of the book, “I’m really not that interesting.” The least Meyer could have done was created some reasons as to why Edward can’t live without her - and not because she smells good! That reason makes as much sense to me as a kid who is allergic to chocolate not wanting to share the candy he can’t eat because he knows it tastes so good.I won't be reading this one again.",28,0.9843,0.102,0.767,0.13,0.5382057057057058,NEGATIVE,0.5423
57,2046429216,07/04/2017,4.0,"***4 solid stars***I cannot, for the life of me, understand why people are hating on these books so much :/ as I said in my review for Twilight , I wasn't really expecting to like them either and I can't say they're the best books ever... But now, after reading the first two volumes, I can really say that I did enjoy this story, despite of my initial reluctance. Very much so. New Moon has an obvious parallel with Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet - and I mean obvious because even Bella recognizes that she is in danger of playing out history’s greatest romantic tragedy. I think keeping Romeo and Juliet in the forefront of the readers’ mind actually helps the author build the tension for the climax of the story because we can all see the tragedy that is waiting to happen.This book, unlike Twilight, is centered around the devastation and heart-break at the end of first love. The pain that Bella feels when Edward abandons her is well written and is really what this story is about. The all-consuming love we experience with Bella in Twilight, is replaced by all-consuming grief: grief at her loss of Edward, grief at her future with him being taken away, grief at losing the feeling of belonging. Most of the things that happen to Bella in New Moon are as a result of the overwhelming loss that she is trying to bear. But during this period, her friendship with Jacob is a huge a comfort to Bella and she describes him as her own personal sun. Yet, this friendship has a doomed quality to it: not only because he obviously loves her -while she is in love with Edward, but because he is a werewolf and he naturally hates all vampires. Then there's the chase for Laurent and for Victoria; there's Bella's new found obsession for extreme sports which I personally enjoyed reading about; and the trip to Voltera was an interesting part as well.New Moon is a compelling story, because the reader will want to know whether Bella will eventually become a vampire after Edward’s continuous refusal to change her. As I said before, I really enjoyed reading this novel and was very caught up in it. I’m sure I’m not the first person, and definitely won’t be the last person either, to think that this is not as bad as so many say.I dare anyone to read the first two books of the Twilight saga and not be compelled to finish the series, especially with the twists and turns that Stephenie Meyer weaves into this love story.",28,0.9795,0.093,0.761,0.146,0.4813786907536907,POSITIVE,0.9989

You'll read them and say, well, okay, but did they really read it? I can't really tell. Because I read Reynolds' review which was so very true.I read New Moon for the first time in the days following the assassination of John Kennedy. I was grieving--shoot, the whole world was grieving. Ooops--shouldn't have said ""shoot."" That's inappropriate. But it's a sign of the times: nothing seemed appropriate. We didn't know who we were anymore. But New Moon made me fall in love with America, and myself, again. Sure, Vietnam was coming. But for a brief, shining moment, I had New Moon.But the '60s were a dazzling time, man, and I lost myself. We lost ourselves, I think. It was a time when people went looking for themselves, but I think, in the looking, they lost themselves, too. It was a paradoxical time. It was a time for wrongness, a wrong time.And then, Watergate. That should have woken us up, but it didn't. We were sleeping so soundly! Not until we read New Moon again. 1975, I was on a plane and Warren Beatty happened to be in first class. I had loved his hair in the pictures I'd seen, so I couldn't help but stare at him through the whole flight. But when he got off, I noticed that he'd left something behind. It was a copy of New Moon.And I found myself again. Thank you, New Moon!But then, the '80s. It was a time of greed is good. I lost myself again. It is fair to say--as my Mom often does, with a wry chuckle!--that Mike is always losing himself! Luckily, there is New Moon. I found myself again after the crash of '88, when drinking sterno in a backalley in Boise I came upon a copy of New Moon. That's right. Suddenly, it was 9/11. Things came crashing down, and by ""things"" I do mean to make the image of the towers resonate with a more metaphorical understanding of ""things"" generally in my life, 'cause--you guessed it--my self had gone missing again.

And then they didn't get back together and Bella moved on with literally anyone else other than him or Jake (whom she spent the whole book rationalizing ""settling for"").

Don’t worry about it…” Yes, sadly, that is as funny as the book gets. Bella’s complaining (omg, really?) about turning a year older. Which means she will… still be infinitely younger than Edward? All right, all right, she knows eventually, if she doesn’t hurry up and become immortal soon, there will be a very big difference between the way Edward looks and the way she looks. Oh noez.Party scene. Bella falls over and cuts herself (the over-exaggerated clumsiness shtick is getting old, Meyer), and the vampires vacate the premises because Miss Swan’s blood just smells so darn delicious. The result? Edward comes to the conclusion he must leave her forever, and a few pages later, Bella Swan is curled up in the fetal position in the rain in the middle of a forest and spends the next few months living as a zombie.Note: The next few chapters happen to be blank, and are probably the most enjoyable in the entire book.After a painfully long period of aching emptiness, screaming nightmares (what the--? Who has screaming nightmares after being dumped?), crippling sensations of being punched in the chest and ragged, bloody, throbbing holes in the heart, Bella does something she should have done 359 pages ago and throws herself off a cliff. Unfortunately, because there are so many heroes in this book, she is saved by Jacob Black, the boy she has been using to fix up her motorcycle so she can cause grief to her poor father (whom I actually love and feel sincere pity for), who hasn’t actually done anything wrong except for verbally kicking her butt by telling her to STFU AND MOVE ON WITH YOUR LIFE.So Bella survives, except miscommunication ensues, and Bella ends up finding out that Edward’s going to off himself because he thinks Bella’s dead.

In fact, I don't think the installments of the Twilight series can even be called novels. They're barely books. It's as if aliens had come to Earth and constructed a shoddy simulacrum of a book, based on an imperfectly understood idea of what a Book is like.A Book should come out in hardcover, and so the Twilight novels appeared, though with cheap, feather-light boards that make them feel insubstantial, like styrofoam models. A Book should have a certain number of pages, and so the texts of Twilight are strained and stretched to cover the requisite amount, though the result - page after page of mostly margin, with wide spaces between lines and huge black typeface - results in an impression of a desolate wasteland, like small human tracks across the face of a glacier. I even gave some thought to the relationship between the format and the plot: as if the typeface, like our hero, was reluctant to sully the virgin whiteness of the paper.I use the word 'hero' with some misgivings. There are no actual characters, only sketchy representations of such. Our heroine is clumsy, and in love with a cipher - we know he is perfect and brilliant, because she tells us so, but because there is no dialogue in addition to the repetition of these facts, we don't get to see why she'd think so. We learn little more than this, but it doesn't matter - the plot is pulled along by Events and Life Threatening Fights and Declarations of True Love, because that's what happens in Books. The characters drift through, unchangeable, ill-defined, unsympathetic, like icons.Some morals are imparted: the vampires talk about their souls and heaven, there is no sex before marriage, everyone is monogamous, and hope is held out that the Cullens will be able to bring their Good News about redemption to save the souls of the other vampires. We also learn about the noble savages of the northwest coast, who step in with some tribal wisdom at key points in the narrative. Of course they're wildly popular.

Again, the writing in this book is actually good apart from some of the speech/conversations being corny at times. Obviously, I first read this was I was 13 and since then just watched the films and had it drilled into me by the Twilight haters that the books were poorly written and bland. In my opinion, this isn’t the case at all and I think it was just said so often I started to believe it. Before this reread of the series, I would call Twilight ‘objectively bad’ and my ‘guilty pleasure’ and I feel SO bad for doing that now because there’s nothing wrong with it?! (And yes this IS a very biased review, shhh).Building on this point, Edward is not a bad or toxic character at all (I mean, I forgot what has happened in the next two books but I will be reading them and if he does something stupid I will cry.. but admit defeat). I was so used to him being described as manipulative and controlling I just believed it but honestly, reading him I don’t get that perception at all. In fact, he is very caring and careful with Bella and everything he does is because he loves her and wants to protect her and I think it’s conveyed really well. (Can you tell I am completely in love with him???). Book Edward is definitely nicer than film Edward also in terms of how he behaves and the things he says.Jacob is also a lovely character and I love the friendship between him and Bella but he is so PERSISTENT at time it drove me a bit insane. Bella made the boundaries clear a million times and it’s obviously she’s still hurt yet he keeps trying. I just wish he would chill, because other than that he is super sweet. His actions in the last 100 pages annoy me as well but understandably he’s angry and jealous so I’ll let that one slide.I liked the fact that there were subtle recaps of the events in the last book, this was probably useful at the time of publication but as I reading them back to back, less so now. A lot of books do the recaps too bluntly and in a bulky piece of text that doesn’t fit within the context of the book at that time but I think it fits in well here. One of the things I love about this saga is that the worldbuilding is done so gradually so it’s easy to digest and keep up with, I never feel lost or overloaded with information. It feels like we are learning with Bella at an actual reasonable pace. A lot of fantasy books try and get all the worldbuilding and history done so quickly at time you tend to forget things as it feels like a huge blur.Congratulations if you read this entire review. …”Review” … yeah",24,0.9981,0.078,0.722,0.201,0.5364208491161616,NEGATIVE,0.5446

Eddie is trying to protect Bella by leaving, successfully breaking her heart.But Bella has troubling nightmares almost every night. And she has begun to notice that her old best buddy, Jacob, has become a ridiculously studly muffin, even if he might be a bit younger than she. Bella and Edward made a pact when he left. Her promise was that she would not take any unnecessary risks. But Bella believes that Edward has broken his part of their pledge. Resentful, Bella looks for ways to break out. This is also fed by a long-lasting depression over the loss of Edward and the excitement of hanging with the fang crowd. Bella is looking for adrenaline, excitement, life.

The writing style was still very simple but not as awkward and misleading as the first, so she either practiced or else got a better editor. Despite the large length, it's a pretty quick read.Edward was gone most of the book but Bella still managed to be obsessive about her new friendship with Jacob. Geez, calling every half hour till 11 pm one day when Jacob's not answering the phone? Despite how irritating Bella can be, especially after the beginning where it was too melodramatic and unrealistic about her withdrawal, she was easier to deal with when she started having fun for once with Jacob. It was a relief that Jacob wasn't angst-filled until later, for once having a smiling and laughing character who doesn't take life seriously. I'm not team Jacob here (don't have ""team"" for the romance stuff), but he was a likeable character compared to some of the others.Not a lot really happens for the book length, but the friendship was interesting, and Edward wasn't bad at the end when he finally shows up. The end angle with the vamp council was actually decently interesting. Alice probably remains my favorite character (besides Jacob) because she has decent humor and lightness about her, but Edward drops some of the angst and back and forth while Bella doesn't get a chance to obsess as much about problems once she gets over her 'relationship coma'.As biased as Charlie is, I'm sure if my kid were almost put in a coma due to a relationship, I'd be permanently set against them too. Or else put my kid in therapy. Both would be better.",23,0.9965,0.049,0.712,0.239,0.5195340854431763,POSITIVE,0.5131

What else is new?It’s funny how Bella’s utter stupidity still manages to catch me off guard. I mean, there’s an entire list of things she’s done that make absolutely no sense to me.1. Bella’s known Edward for maybe two months. He leaves, and for the next SIX months Bella has extreme nightmares, severe mental breakdowns, and lashes out at her family/friends. Dude, chill.2. Bella decides to literally go and crack her skull open while riding a bike just for the satisfaction of knowing she broke a promise to Edward. (Mind you, Edward moved to another state and will never know that...) 3. Bella decides to go cliff jumping ALONE into rough currents just to spite Edward, drowning in the process. (*sigh* unfortunately our angel Jacob was there to save her)4. Bella decides she wants to become a vampire so she can be with “the love of her life” 💀. EVERYONE disapproves of Edward because Bella has gotten hurt/nearly killed hanging around him. She doesn’t care. That’s a pretty big ‘fuck you’ directed at her parents and friends.5. Bella has basically accepted that her relationship with her father, mother, and best friend are going to be over because of her endeavors with Edward. Yet she still picks him over all of them, the ones who literally gave her a life. Damn.❤️✨ Jacob Black ✨❤️The only reason this book kept me awake was because of this beautiful soul. I was eating up the wholesome friendship between Jacob and Bella, even if it was one sided ;(So if your asking me what ‘team’ I’m on in this love triangle, Edward is nonexistent compared to this glorious boy.

I don't ever recall doing this or seeing it happen but Bella does it all the time as do most of the other characters in the books.2 - Biting your lip. I understand that one character can do this. I've known people that do this. But the moment Edward started biting his lip, I realized this was not a character trait, it was an addiction.3 - Feeling like everyone's safety is your responsibility. Yes, Bella, it is your fault all of this is happening. No, you shouldn't go do dumb things in order to save these people from your influence, thus putting yourself in jeopardy and making this a lot worse.In the end, I give her three stars by simply ignoring these things.

My thoughts: The Beginning

“Love is irrational, I reminded myself. The more you loved someone, the less sense anything made.”- New Moon, Stephenie Meyer.
“Can you hear that…? It’s ranting time! Read it at your own peril!”Let us start off with this review by commenting on the pacing of the novel. I found the pacing for this novel to be rather slow because of how enormously thick this book was. In case you are wondering, this book is 563 pages long and it was quite boring due to the fact that almost nothing had happened in this book except for the last 80 pages. It was as if the author had made a trend out of this series- action scenes in the very last-minute and I am here to tell you that I totally hated this trend because the author had ordered the readers to read through the life of Bella’s awful actions until the very last scene where the plot started accelerating forward and abruptly stopped with no signs of direction for what the next book will set up to be and I am just going to put this here: Through all the action sequences, it still proved Bella to be a useless liability to the Cullens family. Sorry, I had to do it.Moving on, we have the plot and the plot holes to talk about in this review. The plot which was almost non-existent until yet again the last 80 pages of this novel, was extremely substandard. The beginning of the novel hooked me in which I originally thought was a good sign but the thoughts had evaporated as the endless mopping of Bella’s face continued on for what seemed like forever until the book ended in a happy tone because Edward came back for her and all of that crap. Furthermore, I was probably just disappointed with Bella because of how her character had quickly become moronic in this novel and I know this is a romance-heavy novel but that is totally an excuse for the lack of actions. Thus, my dislike for the plot is totally understandable.In addition, the number of plot holes in this novel was huge. There were too many things that were left unexplained in this novel that it made my head throbbed and gave me a migraine. Plot holes such as the abilities, how does one gain an extra ability in this world and why does the Volturi want Edward and Alice to be his sidekick? Did he not have enough humans and vampires for him to be as powerful as he seemed to be? Well, those are just some questions that I have for now but I know there will be more if I continue to read the other novels in this series.Furthermore, we have the world-building and the atmosphere that I would like to talk about in this review. Unlike my previous review for a Twilight novel, this book’s world-building really lack-lustre. Items and places were not described as perspicuously as before. Some of them were skimmed through and those things somehow became a major part of the novel without being properly described. Thus, the world-building was bad and I hope there will have some improvement in the next novel.In addition, we are now going to talk about the atmosphere of the novel. The atmosphere for this book was not as suspenseful and romantic as prior to its ancestor and the elements did not combine well in this novel. Again, the suspense only starts at the end of the novel which only lasted for an hour- 80 pages long. Thus, I did not enjoy the atmosphere for this novel.Finally, we have the action sequences in this novel that I would like to discuss. The actions scene were the only ones that I truly enjoyed in this novel. They were suspenseful, scary and stressful. Why is it stressful? You may ask but the scene where Bella was almost being beaten by the vampire was the most stressful period of the entire book. Therefore, I enjoyed the action sequences and how it made my emotions run like a baby asking for ice-cream while whining.Now, let us get into the writing section of this review!
Writing: Middle section of this review

“love gave someone the power to break you. I’d been broken beyond repair.”- New Moon, Stephenie Meyer.
As usual, this book does not have any quality writing but somehow it irked me even more than the previous book. Well, allow me to have a long and detail explanation:The author repeated information that readers already knew in the first book. Further on to state my point, she added an information that we do not know in the first few pages and repeated it again in the next few pages and again in the next hundred pages. I kind of pissed me off because how many times do you need to repeat the same thing over and over again so that we would understand!?Moreover, Bella’s character which I will talk more about later on in the Characters’ review section, was so freaking UGH! Sorry, I need to control my emotions. Let’s rephrase the sentence: Bella’s character was destroyed because she had the desire to kill herself merely because of her boyfriend who broke up with her and all she can think about was him- for 6 freaking months. Just, WHY?In addition, this book was yet again filled with dialogues and though it was easy to read and also, easy to skim through, it was also pretty annoying. There were more telling than showing and the world surrounding Bella just was not building up well enough for the readers to understand the system and the way it was supposed to be.Finally, this book should not be as long as it should be because of the points that I had added above and this: Almost 90% of the book was covered with Bella’s self-indulgence for death due to the breakup and it was just so dull. I am sorry to say that but it was dull.So, let us now get into the characters’ section!
Characters: 4/5 section of this review

“Speaking of which, would you like to explain to me how you’re alive”- New Moon, Stephenie Meyer.
Bella: Hm, who is she? Just kidding. I really did not like her in this novel. I know that heartbreak and disappointments are hard to go through but Bella had taken everything to the next level. Her mind had gone haywire without Edward and all she can think about was what to do next to hurt herself- hard and guess who she had brought in to join her little conquest? Jacob. She used him as a source of happiness and although she really needed it, it was a bad move. After Edward came back for her, she literally abandoned him and stalked off with Edward who dumped her in the first place… So, great character development, I guess… (take note of the sarcasm). Jacob: What an arse. I knew Bella was using him as a source of happiness but Jacob was also being a really bad friend to Bella. He exacerbated Bella’s emotions even more than what Edward had done to her and it led her to a point where she really felt the drive to plunge into the ocean and drown. In addition, for a book that centred on Bella and Jacob, Jacob managed to screw the entire book up with his attitude which was the ‘bad-boy demeanour,’ pretty well. So, the character development for this character would be a negative 1000. Edward: I hated him in this novel. If it was not for his stubbornness and persistence, this novel and plot would not have existed except for the action scenes which I know Stephenie would be able to amplify them, and Bella’s character would not have been like ‘that’… By the way, he had zero character growth in this book. So, have a damn nice day, Edward.Alice: She is now my favourite character in this series. For a book so wearisome, this character somehow stood up and although she was not in a lot of scenes in this novel which she should because Bella died doing boring scenes and the readers dwindled reading them, she gave me a vibe of her charisma and I absolutely loved it! She was not annoying and she was strong and capable of whatever she had on her hands. Those characteristics are natures which Bella will never be allowed to get because of her annoyance.
Overall: The Ending
Whatever charm that had worked for the first book in this series- Twilight, was now gone when my eyes settled on this book and its words. So, without any pity scores, because there would be none for this novel, I will give this novel a 15%. I am sorry but this book is really, really bad.

84,794904829,12/20/2013,3.0,"I liked this, I really did. It's a good enough book, not as good as its predecessor but almost. The reason I gave this 3 and not 4 or 5 is because I'm saving those for the next books, or, at least I hope so. The book starts of abruptly, I think. I'm not talking about the preface, but the first chapter.. Then, the Cullens leave. It all happens within the first 3 chapters and then for about 10 chapters it goes downhill and picks up again after we learn about Jacob's werewolfiness. Bella got a tad bit more annoying in this one but it was understandable considering that everyone was dumping her, okay. She got a little bit suicidal too, or call it reckless if you want. We got to see the bad side of Edward and Bella's relationship and not that just everything is easy and stuff. There was much, much less action in this one and that's mainly why it got on my nerves.I also want to praise the New Moon Movie because I just read this and realized that they did a good job to the movie. I still can't understand the casting they did for the movies, I mean okay, they are just not Edward and Bella and in the movies everything seems so much mushier and cheesier and stupid-er. *fingers crossed* I want the next one to be full of action like the movie, I hope it is or I'm going to cut a bitch.",20,0.4474,0.109,0.754,0.137,0.4540263748597081,NEGATIVE,0.9999

Jacob is Bella's sun and heals her just a bit. I loved how Stephenie wrote that. Alice is everything. She is smart, sassy, pixie like, but so fierce. She is one of my favorites.

I didn't really like the first book but I was wondering if it would get better so I gave the second book a chance. New Moon was slightly better than Twilight. I have no clue how Bella is so clueless. I literally figured out what was going on so early that Bella should have at least had an inkling of what was going on. In my opinion Jacob is sooo much better than Edward. I knew Bella made rash decisions but didn't think that Edward was that dumb too. I have hopes for the next book and am hoping that it gets better.,18,0.8743,0.113,0.706,0.18,0.3682983682983682,NEGATIVE,0.9963
87,575583528,03/30/2013,2.0,"Actual Rating: 2.5 starsI expected to like New Moon better than Twilight, and in fact I did. I have always been a big fan of Jacob, and this reread left me even more wondering WHY on earth he isn't endgame for Bella?! (You feel better about yourself around him, he's your best friend, he's hot, I mean what is missing??? ) The other thing I value about this book is the way it depicts depression. Especially reading this around 20, I felt very seen on the page in a way I haven't in other books. Bella's internal experience of depression, and of facing a nasty breakup is very much what my own was like once upon a time. That said, it becomes very clear the problematic representation of Native American people and misappropriating the culture of the Quileute. You can learn more here: https://www.burkemuseum.org/static/tr...But this includes things like glossing over domestic violence when Indigenous women face some of the highest rates of domestic abuse. Or depicting Native women in weak or subservient roles when this is not at all culturally accurate. Or portraying the beautiful, white Cullens as wealthy, educated, and privileged while the Native characters have small houses, struggle to purchase new shoes and clothing, and are less educated. All of these and more are pretty serious problems that I was unaware of when I first read the books.Hence, the rating is getting dropped to three stars. Not lower because of some of the positives noted above and personal meaning.

88,1119542892,11/30/2014,1.0,"After embarking on my Twilight marathon, I had fairly high expectations for the series as a whole, particularly after I enjoyed reading the first book. And I know understand that this was a huge mistake that could have easily been avoided had I heeded all of the scathing reviews that warned me not to pick up the saga. But since I've started the series, I need some sense of closure, so I don't think I'll be turning my back on the series and trying to permanently erase this endeavor from my memory. I was hoping that, in writing this review several days after finishing the book, I could avoid the scathing rant that I had initially been preparing, but I'm not so sure if I was successful. My first issue was with the pacing. While the book started and ended with a bang, the middle was contrastingly unimpressive. In essence, I enjoyed Edward's relatively nonexistent role (which, of course, took place at the very beginning and very end of the novel). The remainder of the book was bland, dragging significantly to the point where I was skimming entire chapters in search of some interesting plot point. I never pictured myself saying this, but Bella is incredibly boring without Edward - she merely oh-so-impressively manages to use Jacob in Edward's absence. And then proceeds to continually break his heart in latter books. That brings me to my next major qualm: the plot, or lack thereof. The book began promisingly, until a single, stupid paper cut set off a chain of events that caused the book to quickly spiral downhill. When Edward disappeared shortly thereafter, he took my attention with him, leading to a very dull 520 pages until Edward reappeared. While reading, I was constantly plagued by one question: why does this book need to be 563 pages? The plot in its entirety could be easily condensed into a 20 page novella, which would have resulted in a significantly less frustrated Olivia (have you noticed I'm frustrated?). If anyone has stumbled across the reason for the excessive number of pages, please, enlighten me. I think I can blame Jacob for nearly everything - he contributed to the tiresome storyline, captured Bella's heart but made no romantic advances, created tension between Bella and Edward, and was, overall, a let down. Yes, I realize that Edward has his faults, as well, but I'm finding Jacob's to be somewhat more unforgivable, relatively speaking. And, unfortunately, he only gets worse in Eclipse. And of course we can't forget about Bella. Bella, Bella, Bella...if I had wanted to sympathize with a helpless damsel in distress, I would have watched a Disney movie (in hindsight, this would have been the better option in this scenario). She spent the entire book moping like a toddler throwing a temper tantrum in a store when they're not permitted to get an item. While she could have resumed her old, pre-boyfriend life, she chose to remain paralyzed in anticipation for Edward's inevitable return. But, of course, no one else has ever experienced some sort of heartbreak, so Bella's fit must be perfectly justified. Someone needs a strong dose of reality...Need I say: Consequently, I don't have the best overall impression of New Moon - might it have something to do with the fact that the only main character that I do not strongly object to made an appearance for a total of 45 pages? Or the plethora of moronic characters? Or the lackluster plot? Or a combination of all three? Regardless, I found New Moon to be a considerable let-down after reading and enjoying the preceding book in the series. While this novel certainly didn't win me over, I feel obligated to continue with the saga, so on to Eclipse!P.S. Would it disturb the neighbors terribly if I decided to light this book on fire in my backyard? ",17,-0.9809,0.154,0.726,0.12,0.5072646347646347,NEGATIVE,1.0

92,9993917,12/05/2007,3.0,"*** contains spoilers ***I just added one more star to this book series for being strangely addictive... this book is better than the fist, introducing the more likeable Jacob and getting Edward out of the picture for a while.From my teacherly perspective there are (at least) two questionable aspects of the madly popular Twilight series -First of all, it portrays Quileute Indians in a strange, potentially fetishist way. It's written by a White woman who transforms these Native American youth into werewolf heroes, they inherit this ancient ability to transform and become these protectors. However, the portrayal seems generally respectful, not everyone is White, and Myers still uses the perspective of Bella, the White heroine. I would like to hear some Quileute perspectives on this, and I can't find any on the web. Myers did say that she worked with the Quileute. Basically, despite intentions I have problems with the ""animalistic"" characterization. Admittedly the book objectifies everyone, but I consider it somewhat less harmful to objectify White people.The other strange thing about Twilight series is how Edward is over 100 years old and madly in love with an 18 year old girl. I didn't realize this when I bought the book for my young friend. After we both read it, she had to explain to me why that makes perfect sense: He was so depressed about being a vampire that he ""didn't age mentally."" Ok, so I definitely see why young people would think this was reasonable... but as an adult I find it creepy. After all, I wouldn't consider falling in love with an 18 year old and I'm nowhere near 100. OK, I think my real problem with this age factor is that it emphasizes Edward's physical appearance over everything else. The author advances this assumption that because his body hasn't aged, it's completely reasonable to consider him 18 years old. Sometimes in the books this is very clear... like it doesn't matter at all that he's lived 100 years (or close to it). Because he LOOKS 18 he is. And I find that disgusting. I was sort of glad he was out of the picture in this book. I mean, he's also cold and bloodless - the kissing, it's gross. In general, Edward disgusts and repulses me, but this may add to his appeal. I think the movie is out, or will be out soon. This book has so many fangirls - does it have fanboys?? - and I'm not sure what it gives of value except for being addictive and unusual (oh, and local for us northwesterners). Mostly, I think it's very superficial, with all its emphasis on the Cullens' superficial beauty. There's nothing to like about Edward as I've read it. Yeah, mostly I don't like the values in this book though I read it. I might have not shared it with my 12 year old friend if I read it first.

96,4119328848,07/23/2021,3.0, Sometimes you have to learn to love what's good for you I will say this book in the series so far is my least favorite out of them all so far it was really slow and some of the things in the book that happened I really disliked.  Plot:  Bella is officially with Edward now after the events of the first book and things are seemingly going fine for the two until her birthday where things take a turn. I loved the beginning part of the book it started off really well and I thought I was in for a decent continuation of the story however after the birthday chapter this is where things really started to take a turn and where my dislike for the book went. The Cullen's all move out of forks after the events of the birthday and Edward breaks things off with Bella which was really sad and I felt bad for Bella in this moment because she was seemingly on a good path with him and then suddenly things fell apart. Bella's depression slowly starts to kick in after all of this and I think this was well done in my opinion because I really felt like I could feel the raw emotion that she was feeling and Stephanie really wrote that well. Jacob becomes a more prominent figure for Bella in the absences of Edward which I thought was going to be a good thing and boy I was completely wrong and I am going to say this I feel like the Bella and Jacob relationship was so toxic on both sides that it was never going to work and this book shows it so much. I am going to say Jacob is not a favorite character of mine at all especially with him forcing a kiss on Bella and then getting mad that she rejected that kiss I don't know in what world anyone would be ok with this and this was a massive red flag for me. Jacob also doesn't help in the fact that every time she mentions Edward or the Cullen's he gets weirdly protective and defensive over the fact and it just made me dislike him even more. Bella on the other hand also really played on Jacobs emotions and manipulated him in so many ways as well especially when she would constantly call and be obsessed over the fact that he wasn't talking to her which really put them two being together in any way shape or form to rest.  love gave someone the power to break you.I'd been broken beyond repair. Bella then decides to jump of the cliff which then gets the attention of the Cullen family and in turn Rosalie tells Edward that Bella has in fact killed herself which was a real dick move on her part that spirals Edward in wanting to end his own life. Bella and Alice make there way to Italy where Edward has gone to ask the Valtori to end his life because he can't live with the fact that Bella has supposedly died. This the part of the book for me that it slowly started to pick up and have a stronger ending that I feel also got me out of a depressive episode like Bella because thats how this book truly felt to me. The whole Bella and Edward situation was the running theme of Romeo and Juliet and it really felt like that because things keep getting in the way of the two being together and with them now together I hope things are better for the two. I loved the introduction of the Valtori that we heard about in the first book and I can't wait to get to know more about them in the next two books because they seem like they have this long history that I can't wait to learn about. Jane is the one who scares me the most out of all the members because of that power she has and I feel like she is the most dangerous and powerful one that will be a problem going forward. The writing for the book was slightly better in this one however I did find myself cringing at parts but there has defiantly been an improvement to it. It's the same for the plot and characters they have all improved a lot more and I love getting little bits of history about them and learning more about Alice and Edward really made me want to learn more about the other Cullen's. If I had read this series when I was a teenager my opinions would be totally different to what they are now as my younger self would have loved every single part of the book but now that I've read it in my 20's i feel like I can give more of a grown up response to the series as a whole. ,15,0.9881,0.054,0.846,0.101,0.5353178619625986,NEGATIVE,0.9997
97,13355268,01/23/2008,2.0,"I returned Twilight by Stephenie Meyer to my student on Monday and, two periods later, she was back in my classroom with the sequel, New Moon. Was it waiting in her locker for me? I told her I wouldn't get anything done. I didn't. And here I am.New Moon wasn't nearly as good as Twilight. And yet I still read it in two (working) days. So I guess I can't complain. I'm afraid, even though the stuff I'm writing about happens within the first third of the book, that my review might be too spoilerie, so I'm putting it under a cut.There were two main reasons why New Moon wasn't as good as Twilight. The first: Meyer's writing just wasn't as good. The gradual, unforced exposition that I admired in her first book was absent in her second. Having told Bella and Edward's story already, she seemed eager to get through the review of it and move on to spinning her new tale. While ingenious writers like J.K. Rowling leave out much of the review, relying on their readers' competence and memory, and then reinsert reminders of important clues throughout plot development, Meyer kind of did a The Babysitter's Club style recap. Just instead of directly narrating about how Claudia wasn't good at school but was the artistic, junk-food eating one, she was droning on about how Edward was shockingly handsome and had to live in the Pacific Northwest because if he came out in the daytime...The second (and I fear the more pertinent) reason why New Moon wasn't as good was because Edward was gone for about four-hundred pages of it. (I hate to admit that perhaps Meyer's writing did not get worse in New Moon. Maybe it was just more noticeable without Edward's enchantments.) And the reader just had to sit around watching Bella mope and attempt to rebound with a new male lead who happens to be *gasp* a werewolf. While Bella's slow realization of Edward's identity in Twilight was enjoyable and allowed for fantastic moments of dramatic irony, her slow realization of Jacob's identity as a werewolf in New Moon was just exhausting. ""Why did it take so long?! "" the reader wondered, wanting to pound Bella's tearful face into the wall. The second supernatural being was a little much for me. I can accept a semi-realistic novel with vampires. But with vampires and werewolves? I think it was just asking too much. Jacob (the werewolf)'s character did, however, allow Meyer to play with the traditional two suitor novel in fun ways. Bella's two suitors, a vampire and a werewolf, are natural enemies. Meyer tends to overemphasize the dichotomy in my opinion--Edward is unnaturally cold, Jacob is unnaturally warm; Edward pale, Jacob tan; Edward is painfully secretive about his emotions, Jacob could emotionally explode resulting in great pain... Though somewhat forced at times, it was still a really fun distortion of the traditional plot structure. Though I criticize it, I have to be honest. I enjoyed New Moon. I was addicted, again. I cried, again. (More than last time.) For the most part, Meyer worked her magic, again. And if I give back this book and get the next two periods later, I'm going to start it almost immediately and finish it just as quickly. Because they're fun to read.",15,0.9823,0.082,0.793,0.125,0.4761531986531985,NEGATIVE,1.0
98,3350331399,07/17/2020,2.0,I'm so DISAPPOINTED. What do you expect me to say!Bella was being ridiculously stupid and the way she behaved was unacceptable. Even her friends thought her to be crazy. The craziest thing she did was that she risked her life without thinking about Charlie or anyone else so that she could listen to her delusional voices. Her stupidity was frustrating me.The long descriptions about her feelings and surroundings were not necessary. I had a lot of expectations from this because I liked the first book but it was not even close to what I expected.The first half of the book irritated me the most. It was very slow and because of that I got bored. The last part was better than the first one but definitely it was not an awesome ending.This book was going to get a 1 star from me but just because of the last part I increased my star rating.To sum it up - Bella's idiotic behaviour + slow pacing = boredom,15,-0.9574,0.193,0.732,0.075,0.6046969696969696,NEGATIVE,1.0

It low key felt 'nostalgic' to experience this for the first time. But the plot of this sequel seemed as shallow as Bella's personality.

'so she'll be safe' (said he and abandoned her in the woods at night)  Then Bella falls into a long term unhealthy represented depression. She learns that she can hallucinate her marble skinned, topaz eyed, velvet voiced man so she mostly uses Jacob for her advantage to see h i m. (She heavily needed professional help at this point).

This time, Bella has FRIENDS--oh wait they don't actually like her or her boyfriend, but we'll never find out why they're sitting with her. She has a DAD--who still gets maybe two pages of screen time, and it's all as the overbearing dad, not the epic police chief and vampire hunter he could be.

He is beautiful. 2.) His voice is like velvet. Neat-o!

I know, I know, she’s a high school girl… blah blah blah. There are 864 female characters in high school that I like better than Bella Swan.

As a teenager, this was by far my least favorite book in the series because Edward is straight up gone for almost the entire novel. When I used to re-read the books over and over again, I would skim this one so hard cause I hated Jacob. As an adult, my feelings have changed! Surprise, surprise.I must admit: Jacob Black isn't half bad (this applies to Twilight and New Moon ONLY). I actually enjoyed his bubbly personality and his happy attitude all the time. He was a very nice contrast to how dull Bella was.Bella's dramatics are what make this book so amazingly, hilariously bad. This bitch blacks out in the woods for HOURS and Charlie has to send a search party to look for her all because Edward dumped her. She puts her life in danger over and over again just to hallucinate Edward's voice reprimanding her ass. I mean, c'mon. That's insane. Don't get me wrong, though, I was grateful for my doses of Edward. It might be more enjoyable if it didn't last for so long. This book is upwards of 550+ pages, and it is just the same thing over and over and over again with Bella's depression and her visiting Jacob.. yawn.Also, holy shit I've never read about a character having more prophetic dreams than Bella Swan. Every damn night she has a dream that we read about in great detail and Bella is always like, ""Wonder what it means.. hmm.."" Girl, just have one of those a book please. I don't wanna read about your 75 different dreams that are supposed to be foreshadowing the plot. I would rather just have the plot! This book makes me realize how much I dislike Bella as a character. She's boring, dramatic, stupid, and selfish. The way she acts all the time (particularly around the Cullens) causes me immensely painful second-hand embarrassment. If I hear about her ""cringing"" or ""wincing"" again, I'm gonna light these books on fire. Bella's 
only
 redeeming quality is her friendship with Jacob. I like that she's able to see Jacob for who he is and feed off of his happiness. The way she lets Jacob know time and time again that this is a strictly platonic relationship makes me like her more because she really isn't leading him on. Unfortunately, this is what ultimately leads to my disdain for Jacob because he refuses to take no for an answer, and that freaks me out. His inability to respect her and listen when she says she doesn't want to be with him will forever lead me to TeamEdward.Overall, this is Stephenie Meyer selling us Romeo & Juliet vampire fan-fic, and we are buying.

116,16458465,02/26/2008,,"Again: I hated these books. Skip on by.Unfortunately, someone has reined in Mrs. Meyer's florid prose, which means that the characters and plotline come to the forefront. I am going to assume that you, review-reader, are not itching to read this and summarize the plot: Bella is in love with the vampire Edward, who hangs around high schools even though he's hundreds of years old. Edward likes to do things like take Bella for long rides in his car, and sit across from her bed watching her sleep all night. At the beginning of this book, Edward tells Bella that he has made elaborate plans to kill himself if they are parted.Then he leaves.Bella manifests little or no connection to anyone besides Edward* in these books. Her interactions with other people her age are perfunctory, and the narration establishes again and again that she only tries to make friends with her peers because it's less complicated than avoiding them. Her mother is uselessly ""eccentric"" and needs to be cared for; Bella's father is largely absent, and Bella is the one who does the cooking and cleaning. Bella's relationship with Edward has further isolated her - since she has to keep secrets on behalf of her boyfriend, she has shrunk from any social connection outside of his ""family"". At no point does Bella show any sign of having a particularly resilient or self-sufficient personality; when Edward leaves, she essentially crumbles.But he's not left completely! No, after planting the idea that parting is worse than death, he begins to speak in her mind every time she does something particularly self-destructive. While his overt message is to stop doing what she's doing, these messages act as a spur for Bella to pursue ever more self-destructive behavior in a desperate effort to get Edward back.Finally, she jumps off a cliff. She doesn't die, and in fact, she ends up having to engage in a transatlantic race against time to prove to Edward that she really is there for him. This ends with Bella having to promise to become a vampire to escape with her life. This is all in the text. No matter how many times Bella tries to insist that she has free will, or that it's actually really romantic, it reads like psychological horror. If you really want gut-clenching creepiness, proceed to Book 3.*Bella does make one genuine friend in this whole series, Jacob, who is actually vaguely likable.

But the fact that I read it solely to tear it to shreds made zero difference to my feelings about it. I would have torn it to shreds either way, because it's freaking terrible. That said, it's terrible in a completely different way to Twilight. Reasons this book is terrible:1. It's a horrifying portrayal of depression where literally no one gives a shit about the fact that Bella's on the struggle bus.2. Bella's having night terrors on a daily basis, and Charlie doesn't once step in and be like ""Heeeeeey, so maybe we should do something about that?""????3. It's suuuuuuuuuuuuper racist. There are constant references to Jacob's red-brown skin, calling the Quileute characters' hair ""crow black"", and constantly talking about how the stunningly white vampires are amazingly beautiful while the werewolves are volatile and exploding all over the place. 4. Bella spends half the book talking about ""my hole"" that Edward's departure caused, which is just inadvertently hilarious. 5. The plot takes like 200 pages to show up. 6. Bella constantly compares herself to Juliet. ""What would Juliet do if Romeo left? Would she curl up into a ball and talk about her hole a lot? Would she be totally racist towards the dude she claims is her best friend?""7. Bella has a million and one auditory hallucinations and her only concern is losing said auditory hallucinations. 8. There are tons of typos in it. Apparently SMeyer's editor just gave up on life half way through?9. The whole ""Have you tried NOT being a werewolf?"" thing is very reminiscent of ""have you tried NOT being gay?"", and nooooooooooooooope. 10. The clunkiest metaphors in all of Clunk Town. Bella's a moon revolving around the empty hole left by Edward, her departed planet. Jacob's her sun and her entire world is dark without him there.

129,2577472166,11/30/2018,4.0,"New Moon is the second book in the Twilight saga and follows Bella on the next chapter of her journey. After Edward leaves her for her own safety, ending their relationship, in her loneliness and despair, Bella finds herself drawn to her friend Jacob Black. Bella’s friendship with Jacob may just save her or may put her in more danger than she has ever been in before. 

“As much as I struggled not to think of him, I did not struggle to forget. I worried—late in the night, when the exhaustion of sleep deprivation broke down my defenses—that it was all slipping away. That my mind was a sieve, and I would someday not be able to remember the precise color of his eyes, the feel of his cool skin, or the texture of his voice. I could not think of them, but I must remember them.Because there was just one thing that I had to believe to be able to live—I had to know that he existed. That was all. Everything else I could endure. So long as he existed.”

I’m surprised at how much I’m enjoying each book in the Twilight saga. I enjoyed New Moon just as much as I enjoyed the first book and for similar reasons as well. The interactions and relationships between characters in this series are so fascinating to me and it was no different in this sequel which took a closer look at the developing friendship/relationship between Bella and Jacob. I think Bella’s heartbreak and emotional state of mind were portrayed very well in this book (although I did have issues which I’ll get to later) and I really enjoyed seeing the development of her friendship with Jacob and watching her slightly overcome her heartbreak (also had problems with this which I’ll discuss later). Jacob is definitely one of my favourite characters in this series, a lot more pre-wolf than post-wolf. He is such a wholesome character who respects boundaries. Like he doesn’t keep a secret of the fact that he likes Bella but he never pressures her into reciprocating her feelings or even talking about how she feels about him. He is content to just be her friend and I really enjoyed the changes he brought about in her character and how their friendship really helped Bella heal and work her way through her heartbreak and the consequences of Edward leaving her. 

“We’re a pretty messed-up pair, aren’t we?” Jacob said. “Neither one of us can hold our shape together right.”“Pathetic,” I agreed, still breathless.“At least we have each other,” he said, clearly comforted by the thought.I was comforted, too. “At least there’s that,” I agreed.”

There were a few issues I had with this book that mainly have to do with Bella as a character and that’s that there were times in this book where she wasn’t a nice person. I get that she was dealing with heartbreak but the way she behaved at times was really unfair. Let’s get to the main point – her friendship with Jacob. Now, although Bella is aware that Jacob has more than just friendly feelings for her, it took her so long to actually make the boundaries between them clear. And I don’t understand why she left it so late. She was aware of it beforehand but she was being selfish in not wanting to lose him, understandably, but through being selfish I feel like she wasn’t being understanding about his feelings in the process. Also, when she finally makes it clear that she sees him as just a friend, he states that it is okay but that he’s prepared to stick around long enough for her to change her mind. And Bella talks about how she doesn’t want him to stop trying. But it never makes sense. You state several times that you’re just friends with this boy but then you say you don’t mind him trying to form a relationship with you that doesn’t have anything to do with friendship. It’s not nice and Bella’s behaviour wasn’t nice. She does lead Jacob on, going as far as to contemplating kissing him in order to move on. Not because she desperately wants to, but because she sees this as the first step in her moving on and falling in love again. But it’s not nice behaviour. She uses Jacob. He’s a second option. But she never makes that clear to him and that’s where I had a problem.

“Why do you do that?” he asked. He tugged lightly at one of my arms, which was bound around my chest, and then gave up when it wouldn’t come loose easily. I hadn’t even realized I’d moved them. “You do that when you’re upset. Why?”“It hurts to think about them,” I whispered. “It’s like I can’t breathe...like I’m breaking into pieces....”

Secondly, Bella is absolutely the worst friend to exist in the universe and the victim card she plays in this book made me want to scream. She ditches all of her school friends due to heartbreak and then has the absolute audacity to state that Jessica had gone over to the “dark side” by not being her biggest fan when she was absolutely entitled to feel upset over the fact that Bella had basically ditched her and stopped talking to her. And the only reason that Bella even continues her friendship with Jessica is so that Charlie doesn’t have a reason to suspect that she’s still heartbroken and therefore send her back to Phoenix to live with her mother. Why is it that Bella doesn’t know how to navigate friendship without using someone in the process?

“It was very strange, for I knew we were both in mortal danger. Still, in that instant, I felt well. Whole. I could feel my heart racing in my chest, the blood pulsing hot and fast through my veins again. My lungs filled deep with the sweet scent that came off his skin. It was like there had never been any hole in my chest. I was perfect—not healed, but as if there had been no wound in the first place.”

Thirdly, Bella’s behaviour during her heartbreak period is just so problematic and that’s one of the main problems I have with her relationship with Edward. It’s just too obsessive and unhealthy and that’s shown through her behaviour when Edward leaves her. I understanding being heartbroken but spending 4 months doing absolutely nothing because her boyfriend left her is so pathetic. Not to mention chasing dangerous highs so she can hear his voice again is also really weird. And to top it all of, when she is reunited with Edward at the end, she doesn’t even let him apologise, saying that there is nothing to apologise for. The lack of self-respect this girl has is astonishing. Edward absolutely should be apologising in that moment because he not only hurt her, but left her vulnerable to attacks from other vampires, so he did a major disservice to their relationship. But Bella just breezes past all of that. And that’s not okay. It’s the unhealthy, submissive, almost servitude-like behaviour that Bella displays when she’s with Edward that I just don’t like. 

“Before you, Bella, my life was like a moonless night. Very dark, but there were stars—points of light and reason....And then you shot across my sky like a meteor. Suddenly everything was on fire; there was brilliancy, there was beauty. When you were gone, when the meteor had fallen over the horizon, everything went black. Nothing had changed, but my eyes were blinded by the light. I couldn’t see the stars anymore. And there was no more reason for anything.”

Overall, I really enjoyed New Moon, despite the issues I had with the sequel. It’s surprising to me how much I’m enjoying each instalment in the Twilight saga. They’re light, entertaining reads and I’m fascinated by the characters. Also, I need to see more of the Cullens. I want to know everything about them because they’re so interesting.",17,0.9981,0.11,0.721,0.169,0.5266472074933612,POSITIVE,0.9996
130,244568495,12/08/2011,1.0,"Mark New Moon as the moment when Stephanie Meyer's teen vampire romance series transformed from a troubling wish-fulfillment fantasy to a disturbing hate story with SPARKLES(!). In my review of Twilight, I described the plodding, sparse plot and the bland characters. New Moon keeps up the sparse plot bit, but the characters all take a one-way ticket to Crazy-Town. They get creepier than they were in the first book, which is really saying something because Edward's always been creppy - remember his thingie for watching Bella while she sleeps. We'll call this review When Bad Books Happen to Good Readers: New Moon Edition.SUMMARY:It's been a few months since the events (and I use that term loosely) of Twilight, and nothing has changed. Perhaps Bella has managed to count all of the hairs on Eddie's perfect head, but that's likely all the progress she's made. Bella's experiencing a mid-life crisis at the ripe ol' age of 18 because her body is now 1 year older than Edward's. She wants him to turn into a vampire so she won't grow old (and in turn, mature, wise, or gifted with an actual personality), but Edward's all angsty about it because he thinks he's a monster. Bella sulks through a birthday party that the Cullen family cult thoughtfully throws for her, and then she gets a paper-cut and all hell breaks loose. Racked with guilt, Edward dumps Bella and disappears. Then nothing happens for 400 pages or so because Bella dies inside. Really. I think her brain actually dies in the book. Now, I'm not much of a morality pusher, especially when it comes to fiction. I have my opinions about the characters' actions, but the opinions of others are totally left to their interpretations. Still. My humble opinion is telling me that New Moon is not a love story. It isn't even a like story. This is the story of a girl with really bad depression issues doing self-destructive things. There are SPOILERS below! Read at your own risk!So let's put this story into perspective. Bella has been with Edward for a couple of months, and they're in puppy love. I can understand that. But then the whole kit-and-kaboodle goes spiraling down the rabbit hole when you consider that Edward sneaks into Bella's room at night and just lays with her (no sexin' in this story). That's not cool, Eddie, and it's disrespectful to Bella's dad, who seems like a nice guy. But it gets worse. When Edward breaks it off with Bella, the girl goes catatonic. He takes her to the middle of the forest to do the deed, for some reason, and Bella just kind of wanders around until she collapses and has to be rescued. Now, what fully functioning 18-year-old can't find her way out a forest that she WALKED INTO IN THE FIRST PLACE? And in the unlikely case that she really could get lost, why doesn't she want to cut the d-bag who left her there? After Bella is rescued from the forest, the next several pages just list the names of the months in which BELLA DOES ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. It's a complete black-out period for our heroine. Without Edward around, Bella has NOTHING to lend to the narrative. Not only is this lazy writing (SMeyer); it's also annoyingly emo and silly. I'm left to believe that Bella is either braindead, manic depressive, or a robot. If Bella had a blog at this time, I bet she filled it with angsty one word entries like, ""Sullen,"" ""Broken,"" and ""Tears."" Finally, Charlie Swan has enough of his sad daughter-bot and lays down the law: Go make some damn friends or you're going back to live with your mother. Reluctantly, Bella reconnects with Jacob Black, the Native American kid she played with as a kid. Jacob's going through big changes in his life. Hairy changes. Toothy changes. If you catch my drift. You don't? OK, he's turning into a werewolf. Slowly, though. Then there are pages and pages of Bella transferring her clinginess to Jacob - following him around, getting angry when he makes new friends and starts to withdraw. At the same time, Bella makes a shocking (SHOCKING, I tell you!) discovery that she can kinda/sorta see Edward when she puts herself in danger. Cue a bunch of TSTL acts of desperation, culminating in Bella jumping off a cliff into the ocean. Suicide attempts are so romantic, I guess? Raise your hand if you're disturbed!Eventually, Bella tracks Edward down in Italy where all the really POWERFUL vampires live and hilariously prevents him from doing his own suicide dance. It's hilarious because Edward's plan to make the big, bad vampires kill him is to go out in public and sparkle. Yes. Death by sparkling. Because the general public totally wouldn't look at him and think he's just a pasty boy wearing body glitter. Oh, and at some point, Bella ends up in a love triangle between Jacob and Edward. Because: of course. Love triangles are the worst trope in YA fiction to date. I want them all to burn in a fire. So after all of the pages and endless angsting, Bella and Edward are ... back in Forks. Bella still wants him to turn her into a vampire. Edward still wants her to remain human. Jacob's scampering around in the woods all heartbroken. And apparently because Edward can't resist Bella's winning charm and outgoing personality, he proposes marriage. CLIFFHANGER! Oh, how will I ever manage the suspense? The writing was also hideous. Meyer tends to recycle words like chagrin, dazzle, beautiful, topaz, clenched, and chuckled like nobody's business. Plus, the story is all inane internal monologue and very little plot.Somehow, the final two books get even worse. ",11,-0.9978,0.164,0.741,0.095,0.5103639949793796,NEGATIVE,1.0

132,267440046,01/24/2012,4.0,"New Moon follows after Twilight, and Bella Swan finds herself in a dark place after her boyfriend, Edward Cullen, along with the rest of his vampire family, leaves in an effort to keep Bella safe. And after she is saved from the brink by her friend, Jacob, Bella discovers more secrets about the supernatural world—secrets that will put her in even more peril than before. As soon as I finished Twilight—for all the times that I finished it, even for my latest revisit—I immediately moved onto New Moon. Despite my massive pile of books from the library, I focused on this book, and I didn't want to put it down. At all.I can say, for one, the book really touched me; my heart ached for Bella, who was in her most darkest period of her life—it is called New Moon, and that phase of the moon is, as Stephenie Meyer wanted it to reflect, ""the darkest kind of night, a night with no moon""—and I wasn't surprised that Stephenie Meyer, the author herself, would be in tears by this. Poor Bella lost Edward—Edward, who left her behind, hoping she'd move on eventually—and poor Bella, for a few months—in the movie, by the way, did you notice she wears the same clothes for that entire span of time?—was so lost.Luckily, she found someone to fill that hole in her chest, and this someone is her friend, Jacob Black. She starts to recover, to feel happy, but it doesn't stop her from testing fate in reckless way, all because she wanted to hear his voice—hear Edward's voice. But then her friendship with Jacob gets more complicated as time passes, and suddenly, Bella finds herself in the middle of more danger. Throughout the entire read, I noticed the change in Bella—her character development. At first she fell into a dark hole, then she climbed back out, managing to hang on, then she managed to stand on her two feet, overcoming the darkness. In other words, without any metaphors—or whatever—Bella grew stronger. It made me love her even more.Like for Twilight, I thought Stephenie Meyer's storytelling—her writing and more—was amazing. That's all I can say really. It. Was. Amazing. Her storytelling has developed, and...it was amazing. Okay, I'll stop there. Overall, New Moon took the series into a direction that was satisfying—no, more than satisfying. I loved the plot. I loved the character development. I loved the writing.

The romance was forced and Bella was the most uninteresting and blandest main character I've ever read about but it was just fun and entertaining overall I have to admit. I guess you could call Twilight a guilty pleasure. But this book is where the series goes completely downhill. Everything from the pacing to the characters to the plot absolutely sucked. Especially the characters.Bella. Like I said, she was bearable in the first one, though she made plenty of questionable choices but she takes it to a whole new level in New Moon. I get that she's heartbroken and whatnot but she completely shuts down for several months, moping and is just down-right miserable to read about, although she suddenly feels better when she talks to Jacob which I feel inaccurately portrays depression. She also attempts to jump off a cliff, taking wild motorcycle rides, etc. to catch Edward's attention and since he has the power to know what's happening to her at the moment which is beyond creepy but then again what isn't creepy about that guy? Bella thinks he'll come and rescue her and he eventually he does. The whole situation is pathetic on so many levels. Her whole life revolves over him to the point she'll take her life over a guy. Not to mention Bella's life ambition in this book is, not graduating from high school and go to college by the way, but to become a vampire and live forever with Edward. Bella is just completely co-dependent on Edward. Edward was even more problematic in this book. He was already creepy enough in the first book. He gaslights, lies, controls, etc. He's straight-up abusive. Luckily he doesn't show up much in this book.The pacing/plot dragged on forever and this whole book was downright miserable to read. I just eyed one page without taking it in and moved on to the next and only paused at the mildly interesting parts. I think I'll read the next one exactly like that but I might not even read it (I usually complete every book in a series).The first one was really good but the Edward/Bella thing was too problematic and weird to enjoy and it was so boring compared to Twilight.

Besides the absurdity of werewolves and vampires, there is a character I can’t stand: Isabella Swan. She's basically an idiot. The main problem is the same as the first book: she says things in one way and after 300 pages she understands that she’s wrong, and then thinks about everything she had already thought and corrected herself. Then - and here I find the movie is much better - her obsessive behavior for Jake: she knows perfectly well that he has a crush on her, but she needs someone. And, meanwhile, think of the fact that Edward doesn't love her anymore, even though you understand that she hopes there's more. All this repeated for chapters.And, again, there’s the writer's obsession to describe the spaces. This thing makes me going crazy! She wrote three pages on the house of the Volturi: bricks of the floor and bricks of the walls, dark tunnels, flights of stairs, elevators. All in the smallest details.Finally, perhaps the most important thing: we’re reading the second book of a saga made up of four books, so it's clear that we remember important events or names that are repeated at least five times. So, why should you report the exact same phrases and events from the previous book to explain what happened? I've already noticed this in some writers, but she also reports things like the weather and the beach.

Even then I'm not sure this drivel would have made it that far. The author writes like a 12 year old playing at being a writer. Who published this shit?I'll tell you who published this...someone extremely smart because its a national sensation. Why? I have no idea. I can't wrap my head around it suffice to say that someone took a retarded plot line and wrapped it in a beautiful vampire package just at the moment all things vampire was exploding on the pop culture scene. Or maybe Twilight is the reason for the vampire explosion which is even more insulting when you consider all the excellent vampire writers out there that have to be compared to this trash.

My heart was crushed whenever Jacob was sad or whenever Alice wasn’t in the story, but I also felt so much joy because of the characters and the world building. It’s definitely a complex book that will take me a while to unpack exactly how I feel about it.The two major flaws to this book are that there’s some uncomfy age gaps between Bella and her two love interests as well as the fact that Bella isn’t a good role model for teenage girls. Do we really want girls to look up to and admire a girl who considers killing herself when her lover leaves her? However, I’m glad that these flaws didn’t take away from my enjoyment of this series.I loved getting to spend more time with Jacob in this book. Yes, he did have some rough patches that almost made me cry, but in general, he’s such a sweetheart and he’s my favorite type of character.

It actually had a plot, instead of Bella's day-to-day life in dreary old Forks. She has to deal with a break up - while deals with it in probably the worst way imaginable - but there is a plus side - she forms a really great bond with Jacob Black.Their friendship was the best thing about this book, by far! They care so much about each other, and even though Jake really wants a relationship with her, he's super respectful and is (for the most part) satisfied with a friendship with Bella because he still gets to spend time with her. Platonic boy/girl friendships have always been my downfall, as well as sibling relationships. Plus they're so rare in YA books! I wish Meyer hadn't messed it up with a fecking love triangle. Of course, Bella herself is still as boring as ever. I mean, couldn't Meyer have given her some interests besides homework and housework?I can add two new official words to describe her as a person (besides being clumsy) - has zero independence and is completely obsessive. In Twilight, she was obsessed with Edward, (still is), and here, she's obsessed with hearing his hallucinatory voice whenever she does something dangerous or reckless. And while she was totally dependent on Edward to survive - while becoming almost catatonic and lifeless when he left - she then became totally dependent on Jacob to survive and had nothing to do but homework and housework when he wasn't available. How is this girl a good role model for impressionable girls with low self esteem having their first relationships? They'll think that it's okay to think that their partners are their entire worlds after merely weeks together, and if it doesn't work out, they'll see it's totally okay to fall apart at the seams because that's what Bella did in the book and it worked out okay for her, didn't it?? Just throw yourself off a cliff and he'll come running back, or there'll be another hot boy waiting for you with open arms and an open heart! She does not deserve either of the men in her life, to be honest.

177,375721451,07/24/2012,1.0,"***Spoiler Alert***I thought reading 
Twilight
 couldn't be bad enough and then 
New Moon
 arrived. I guess the beginning line of the blurb should have been my first clue. 
""For Bella Swan, there is one thing more important than life itself: Edward Cullen.""
It was almost as if Stephenie Meyer purposely foreshadowed the entire plot of New Moon- which is basically Bella moping after the departure of Edward. That's it. She mopes. Nothing interesting happe- oh wait, I take that back. They go to Italy. One of the most beautiful places in the world.Pity Bella only came to save her undead, indestructible, overly controlling boyfriend from killing himself. It does put a downer on the sight-seeing, doesn't it. Not that any sight-seeing actually happens. No, wait. I also take that back. Bella must have seen one impressive disco-ball in order to throw herself into her suicidal boyfriend's arms.(view spoiler)[
  
(hide spoiler)]Bella Swan is also nothing without Edward Cullen, apparently. Even the other characters in New Moon accepted that. The wolves in the Quileute pack call her the 'vampire girl' because she is such a baseless character and her love for Edward the vampire is really all that defines her. 
""Where you are is the right place for me.""""I'm no good for you, Bella.""""Don't be ridiculous."" I wanted to sound angry, but it just sounded like I was begging. ""You're the very best part of my life.""
Bella's reaction to having Edward leave her is hilariously pathetic- during the break-up and afterwards. After the break-up, Bella ignores that she actually has a support system to fall back onto: she has friends, loving parents etc. Does she use that support system?Fuck no.She instead concentrates on the fact that  'Omg, Edward's leaving and I can't exist without him!'.Then when Bella finds out she can see flashing glimpses of Edward through near-death experiences and decides to try kill herself without actually killing herself- I literally threw the book at the wall. She's acting suicidal just to catch a few, fleeting glimpses of her imaginary, ex-boyfriend for goodness' sake. She even threw herself a bloody cliff!I don't even get the big deal about Edward.So he's an immortal vampire who looks like a Greek Adonis? Edward's still a creepy, over-controlling prick. He treats like Bella as an incompetent child. I would prefer my boyfriend/girlfriend to treat me as someone who can make their own decisions (provided they're not stupid and over-the-top) and not coddle me like some fragile piece of china. And Edward always acts like he knows best. Absolutely infuriating. Even more infuriating when it's apparently because Edward 'loves Bella too much' and 'it's for her own good.' This is NOT acceptable behavior.In fact, it's all because of Edward acting as if he knows best for Bella that New Moon even happened in the first place. Then when he reunites with Bella at the end, he has the nerve to place part of the blame on Bella.
“After all the thousand times I’ve told you I love you, how could you let one word break your faith in me?...I could see it in your eyes, that you honestly believed that I didn’t want you anymore. The most absurd, ridiculous concept—as if there were any way that I could exist without needing you!” 
Ummmm, Edward? You've acknowledged yourself that you can be a good liar and Bella isn't exactly the most...astute of individuals. Expecting her NOT to believe what 
you told her
 isn't very smart of you. Furthermore, I 
dislike
 how Edward played on Bella's insecurities. That's not cool, mate. If the mundane, run-of-the-mill storyline and non-existent character development wasn't bad enough, the writing was choppy and I was stumbling my way through the book- just tripping over words and everything.Overall, it's torture for the brain.",8,0.9661,0.125,0.723,0.152,0.5313470104774454,NEGATIVE,0.9998
178,69380976,08/29/2009,5.0,"It's a truism in romance fiction (and the romance element is just as central to this saga as the supernatural) that ""boy and girl meet, fall in love, marry, and live HEA,"" by itself, doesn't constitute a riveting plot; there have to be significant obstacles they need to overcome before you have a real story. So anyone who finished the first book and expected that Edward and Bella's relationship would have smooth sailing would have to be fairly naive; but that naivete will be rudely disabused early on in this installment. This relationship has obstacles galore, many of them inherent in the fact that he's a vampire and she isn't; and the couple don't always handle or react to these obstacles in ways I as a reader like or would recommend -but they are ways that are psychologically believable for these characters. Bella's inferiority complex, in particular --which makes it easy for her to imagine that Edward doesn't love her, because she sees herself as unworthy in the first place-- rings so true to my memories of my own teenage inferiority complex that I could readily feel her pain, and understand (even while wanting to shake sense into her) why she couldn't see reality even when it practically jumped in her face. The reader will find this aspect of the book frustrating; but frustration over the characters' inability to get it together derives from the fact that Meyer makes you care about whether they do.Sequels often don't measure up to the promise of the original books, but I felt that this one did. The quality and appeal of this installment of the story, in fact, was very much of a piece with the first one; readers will probably react to both in the same way, and for the same reasons. There are some new elements here, though. In the first book, I was surprised that Meyer (given her own Mormon faith) didn't explore the religious significance of vampirism more deeply. Here, it's addressed a bit more: Edward's reluctance to make Bella a vampire stems from his belief that vampires lose their human souls --but Carlisle doesn't believe that, and as Bella points out, there are indications that deep down, Edward isn't convinced of it either. (For Meyer, the fact that her vampires don't fear the cross doesn't indicate a denial that the cross has meaning, but rather an affirmation that the vampires' state doesn't render them inherently anti-God.) There's deeper discussion here of the ramifications of Bella's desire to join Edward in the Undead condition, which provides intriguing food for thought. (Her desire is logical and believable, and while I don't agree with her cavalier willingness to possibly trade her soul for love, I can understand it as the reaction of an irreligious teen who doesn't think much about her soul anyway.) The moral struggle of the ""vegetarian"" vampires is also brought out more fully here; they don't have to drink human blood, and may morally wish not to, but it isn't as easy to abstain as just wanting to --they have a powerful physical appetite for human blood, so that the sight of it can trigger feeding frenzy, and conquering this compulsion takes really heroic effort. (To my mind, that's a serious liability to becoming a vampire that Bella, in the first two books, hasn't considered --and neither have the Cullens apparently thought of it; what if she can't control the urge?) The author also introduces the werewolf element in this book, and she has a good, intriguing take on werewolves: they're not inherently evil, crazed attack-anything-that-moves monsters --but they do have violent animal tempers that they, too, have to fight to control (and which can be dangerous even to people they dearly love). Other writers have also posited a vampire-werewolf enmity (that doesn't appear in the actual folklore), but Meyer explains it in a very novel and interesting way. Jacob Black's character comes more into his own in this book, and his deep, romantically-tinged friendship with Bella is credible under the circumstances.Despite the frequent barbs of some reviewers directed at Meyer's style, I find that her prose carries the story along in a steady, quick flow --and sometimes a white-water ride, in places where the danger and tension really mounts! (The latter isn't eased by knowing that the 18th chapter is titled ""The Funeral,"" either. :-)) I like the way she uses the Prologue in both books, and (not to include any spoilers) the literary device she uses on pp. 85-93 is quite effective in doing what she wants it to do. Despite the thickness of the book, it tends to be a quick read, and doesn't seem overly long at all. I'll be eagerly waiting my chance at reading the next installment of the story!",8,0.9896,0.097,0.769,0.134,0.4609534555279235,POSITIVE,0.6675

181,3397026191,07/07/2020,2.0,"✯ [2.25/5] ✯I actually enjoyed this one a litte bit more than the first, BUT I think It's because I heard in audio (and If you wanna read this for the first time I recommend). But this had some major problems that the first didn't have, like the stereotypical rep for Native Americans that actually bothered me a lot. I hope It gets a litte better but this was so bad I won't even consider a ""representation"". Also, the way mental health was dealt with... HORRIBLE. Also, nothing happend in this, the plot was a mess.Into spoilers then:(view spoiler)[In the start of this book I knew Edward would go away but like... It's so stupid! Ok Bella doesn't want anyone talking about her birthday because she will be ""older"" than Edward and like she It's angry with this day AND ASKED to not have a party. Then the Cullens make her a birthday party because It's a real birthday... Okay that's fine, they are a nice family and everything. But then she cuts her hand and Jesper tries to kill her. And what Edward does? LEAVES HER ALONE BECAUSE SHE IS IN DANGER... Guys, she isn't in real danger, It was an accident, like ??? But okay, then she leaves her and she promises not to do anything stupid. Wich of course would work out right? Wrong.Bella then enters in a horrible depression, wich is dealt in a really bad way and no one had the ideia to take her to a doctor. I swear she needed a doctor, this isn't normal and Edward isn't the cure for this. Charlie needed to take her to a doctor, but I understand him not doing this, because some parents don't think this is necessary. BUT SHE STAYED A ZOMBIE FOR MONTHS AND NO ONE DID NOTHING, also her friends were horrible and blamed her for the separation and not the depression. But when she tries to talk to them again they are really angry. I think they are terrible friends, but after all they are teens and don't understand this stuff, so I get it they felt left out. And then a lot of nothing happens until she notices that when she is danger she can hear Edward's voice, and she start to think of ways to hear him (CALL A DOCTOR YOU GUYS IT'S REALLY BAD).She starts talking to Jacob then, and I will be truthfull, in the first scenes with him I actually really liked him, he was cute and non-toxic (because Edward's and Bella's realtionship isn't healthy, but I talked about it in the review of the first book). But then, she had to make him a persistent litte boy and turn into an ""angry werewolf"". HE COULDN'T TAKE A NO C'MON. And then all the wolfs have anger problems and It's dangerous to stay close to them, and they can harm who they love like Sam and Emily Young. I don't know, I don't think this was necessary and It bothered me the realtionship between wolves and people, they aren't savages. AGAIN the problem with them beeing native americans is the way they are treated like SAVAGES that can't control themselves. This was a big no from me. And Jacob just hates vampires in a way that bothered me too.And of course, now we have a lot of nothing happening. And then she decides to jump from a cliff to hear Edward, SO PROBLEMATIC. And her father's friend dies, wich leaves the house free for her and Alice catch up. And then run away because Edward thinks Bella is dead, so of course he has to kill himself (GUYS SUICIDE ISN'T ROMANTIC). But Bella goes to Italy and then she meets the Volturi, after saving Edward to shine in the sun, and like they just let them go because they are curious to Bella turning. Okay, you would guess an old organization would be more careful, but they wouldn't right?And then she goes home and FINALLY CHARLIE GROUNDS HER, but of course It doesn't affect her life at all. Guys, Charlie Swan is the best man in this novel and all people mistreat him. And she decides the Cullens will vote for her to become a vampire... I can't this scene was so bad. Of course then Edward says HE WILL ONLY CHANGE HER AFTER THEY MARRY, like chill she is only 18. For the ending of this book we had a scene between Jacob and Edward fighting... BECAUSE THEY CAN'T BE FRIENDS OF COURSE, THEY NEED TO FIGHT.

I really wanted to.Obviously this book has a reputation- you either love it or you hate it. I tried to like it, I really did. But I very much did not.And the first book wasn't so bad. A little cliche, and little instalove, but I can totally deal with that; Clace is my otp. I was slightly annoyed with Bella's character, but I've read worse.Then I read the second book.New Moon made me strongly dislike Bella. She needs to get over it. She's only known this guy for a few months, and yet she's willing to wreck her entire life for him? When Jacob showed up I was like, 'thank god'. Though I preferred Edward, at least Bella wasn't such a pity party. The ending was annoying, in my book. Both Edward and Bella were being overdramatic, but I still sighed with relief when the ending had them back together.The third book, Eclipse, was the one that killed me.You see, I read these for the romance. The plot's fine, but that's not really what I enjoy. And in this book, I ended up despising both Edward and Jacob.Let's start with Jacob. That makes me less mad, as Bella has an appropriate reaction and *spoilers* doesn't end up with him. He totally kissed her without her consent- her inner monologue was trying to get away, and he thought she enjoyed it. Not cool, man, not cool. I do not approve of that at all, and it makes me mad that it was brushed off after that- if I were literally anyone in that series, I would have slaughtered Jacob. It really didn't change anyone's perception of him drastically, and that is awful for me.Now onto Edward. He's had his share of possessive, overprotective moments in the last two books, but that's because he's a vampire and he's so desperately in love that he'd do anything to keep her safe. That's ok, right?I would have said so, but as I read I noticed a few interesting points that led me to the conclusion that Bella and Edward's relationship is toxic, creepy, and downright abusive.First off, the smaller points. Edward is creepy and overprotective to the point of stalker-ness. Breaking into her house to watch her sleep? That's not good. He also really doesn't understand Bella that well, a point that is shown many times, but most cleanly demonstrated by him leaving. Did he not know Bella well enough to understand that it wouldn't end well? Apparently not. Finally, he's very controlling about Bella's activities and lifestyle- he always seems to want her to do this, or not do that, and she complies almost every time, even when she doesn't want to. That's not compromise and healthy communication, that's downright abusive behavior.However, due to the writing style (romanticizing this) and the fact that the fandom obviously ships them so much, I didn't see that these things were so problematic until the beginning of the third book.Edward, while he is away, forces Bella to stay in his house, even when she wants her freedom, and makes Alice have her stay with her.Where have I heard this before?Only with one of the least-popular ya love interests of all time, Tamlin the tool. I'm glad I've read ACOMAF before, otherwise I might have continued to delude myself that Edward was keeping Bella safe.Now, I haven't read the fourth book, but I doubt it gets any better. Edward is a Tamlin, except that Bella certainly doesn't have a Rhysand to rescue her.These are my problems with the relationships in Twilight, and if you choose to read it, I urge you to think about these points- and also check out the ACOTAR series if you haven't already.",8,0.8871,0.116,0.752,0.133,0.4737464985994398,NEGATIVE,1.0

After you break up with someone, it must not be true love if you're not about to off yourself at the first opportunity! Now THERE'S an attitude I want my daughter to emulate!Furthermore, she uses her ""friends"" whenever it suits her and lies to them whenever convenient. Her so called ""best friend"" (Jacob) is in love with her (who knows why?) as she mercilessly leads him on for her own selfish purposes. Don't even get me started on the disrespect she has for her mother and father. She treats them like children, as she simultaneously ignores and/or circumvents their authority. Ah... but I guess ""true love"" excuses all of this, right? Maybe it's all normal behavior for an average teenage girl. God I hope not.Sooo many technical/factual errors here as a result of the female-centric writing: Who would ""throw away"" two motorcycles on a trash heap?

Evidently, Italy doesn't have any customs, speed limits, police and/or doesn't care about dangerous strangers toting about underage girls across international borders... as long as said underage girl is off to rescue her true love from being bored to death by thousand year old vampires who find everything ""so... very... interesting....""And at the end, after all the depression, death, potential throat ripping, proclamations of endless love, and of course, GLOWERING...

I reread Twilight back in December when I was in a reading funk and I knew it would help me get out of it. So it was time to reread the rest. This is the only series that I can read over and over without ever getting bored.New Moon is the second installement in this amazing series and my favourite by far. In this we follow Bella on a journey trying to survive after Edwards departure. I am not a big fan of Bella. She is whiny, annoying and relys on other people way too much. However, I have to admit I warmed to her in this book. I think it was mainly due to Jacob. We meet Jacob in book one for only a brief time so honestly I couldnt really form an opinion on him. When Jacob is introduced in New Moon my heart honestly did a little fluttered. He is so down to earth and warm and friendly you just can't help but like him. Even when things change and he does become bitter and mean I still really like him and he was my first ever book crush.The plot itself is so much better than Twilight. I think mainly because Edward isn't in it much. I know I am going to get a cyber slap from all the lovely Team Edward fans but I just don't like him. Even though it was Edward and Bella story that got me hooked as I have read the books a few time I realise just how overprotective and selfish he is. So back to the plot lol. Oh yeah, I loved the story in New Moon. The first time I read it I honestly was on the edge of my seat with excitement waiting to see what was around the corner for Bella. Even though most of it you seen coming there was a few I didn't. As I as have said I love Jacob, However what I loved the most about this was getting to meet the Volturi they are vampires.

I mean really hate it.And I guess I kinda get it...It's not a GREAT series, I don't even think it can be described as ""good"". Although I didn't hate the first book, I didn't love it either.My feelings are relatively neutral regarding this particular book series (I'd also like to emphasize on the word BOOK, because let's face it, the films are terrible).However I now have some change of views after reading the second book...Something I realized is that I really don't like Bella. I wouldn't go so far as saying that I hated her, but every time she is with Edward I feel a strong wave of ""dislikeness"" for her. I simply do not get her.Something I have also come to like is the relantionship within the Cullen family. To me the Cullen family are the best example of a ""proper"". I have really come to admire the protectiveness between the ""people"" but also their welcoming attitude and the way they just accepted Bella into the family, simply because what she meant to Edward.Another aspect I really enjoyed was getting to know Jacob Black. Out of all the characters in the book, I think it's safe to say that Jacob is my favourite. I don't really know why, maybe it's because he is such a good friend to Bella and I don't get why she just can not see that she would be so much better off with him.Again, the story itself was...okay. I liked many of the aspects presented within the book, however I really did not like the ""ending"" or the ""climax"" of the story, it was just what's the word?Stupid It was boring and frankly, just to much. I felt like there was so much more potential but the way it was executed was just quite poor.

Pining catatonically, and without any apparent hope of recovery, until she rekindles her friendship with Jacob Black, New Moon's new male savior. Bolstered by yet another obsessive relationship with a male, Bella tempts fate in all manner of stupid ways, proving to us that when thwarted in love, the most honorable course is semi-suicidal behavior. (This, at least, applies to the absent Edward as well. That's about it for gender neutrality, though.) Teenage love, kids. Finally returned to each other through ludicrous circumstances, Bella and Edward pick up exactly where they left off--she admonishing him for having the audacity to have ever left her side, he jumping in to save her from her caffeine consumption, reckless behavior, and lack of initiative in applying to college. (Thanks for filling out those applications for her, daddy Edward.)A conversion to vampirism is treated either like a conversion to a new religion, or as per usual, as a sexual episode, and Edward decides that they shouldn't Do It until they get married. That's right. Because if she's not ready to commit in a marital union, then, well...It occurred to me half-way through that the sex metaphors could potentially go in an entirely new--and not good--direction in coming books. Consider: Edward is obsessed and physically intoxicated by the scent of Bella's blood. If then, he changes her to a vampire (read: has sex with her) and she no longer has her own blood in her, might she no longer be appealing to him?

Plot Summary
Edward and Bella, together at last! Except no, because Bella got a paper cut that convinced Edward he had to end their relationship forever, gaslighting her on his way out and also for some reason leaving her alone in the woods. He had no other choice. What’s the alternative? Respecting Bella’s preferences and boundaries by not having the birthday party where she nicked herself on wrapping paper? Obviously impossible.Well, relationships end. Breakups are painful, but with Edward gone, this is a chance for Bella—the protagonist, after all—to develop as a character absent a male love interest. Oh, what’s that? She breaks down and shuts down and alienates all of her friends and wakes up screaming every night? But therapy is obviously out of the question? And she’s somehow always about to die in various outdoor locations and she needs carried and/or set in someone’s lap while she’s sobbing or unconscious? And the only thing that brings her any measure of comfort or hope or joy, sparks anything in her at all, is the memory of her ex-boyfriend yelling at her to stop what she’s doing? And she only starts to really bounce back once there’s another supernatural brooding possessive boy to keep her safe and happy? And by that I mean unsafe and unhappy? But this time with racism? And named after Stephenie Meyer’s brother, which creeps me out? And then when Edward returns she realizes hearing his anger after he left is proof he cares, so she can trust his love for her is true? Cool, that works too. 
The Racism
Let’s expand on that racism point, because I didn’t pick up on any of that when I read the series for the first time. Jacob Black belongs to the indigenous Quileute Tribe, and lives on a reservation in La Push, a village close to the city of Forks. The Quileute people exist, and you’re not going to believe this, but they are not werewolves. Meyer features a real group living in a real place, but depicts them as mythical creatures. Her depiction of the Quileute people thrust them into the international spotlight. As the books snowballed into movies, merchandise, and tourism, misinformation and invasions of privacy abounded. Journalists trespassed and filmed sacred areas. Their history and culture were co-opted and billions were made, yet the Quileute received no compensation. Meyer took so many liberties that Seattle’s Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture has a whole section of their website dedicated to debunking Twilight’s misrepresentations. Currently, the Quileute are fundraising to relocate reservation buildings especially vulnerable to tsunamis, including the tribal school. You can learn more about the Move to Higher Ground (MTHG) project and donate here.Cultural appropriation aside, how are the Quileute characterized in the series? Especially compared to vampires, since Meyer has cast them as opposed groups? Here’s a few examples:Billy, Jacob’s dad, is the cryptic, superstitious elder. Despite understanding more than most, his credibility is shaky. Bella, Charlie, and even Jacob roll their eyes at him, can’t figure out what he’s on about. Silly old man. Contrast that with Edward’s dad, Carlisle. Carlisle is a doctor. He is a capable, measured, calm authority figure that many adore and respect. His wisdom is undeniable. In the first book, Edward explicitly, repeatedly tells Bella that he is a threat to her survival. He tells her that he’s dangerous, his family is dangerous, who he is, itself, is dangerous. Despite his repeated warnings, Bella can’t manage to conjure up any real fear. She stubbornly pushes back against assertions that Edward is violent or monstrous. She is more sure of his ability not to hurt her than he is. Not only does she not feel threatened around Edward, she feels safe. She feels safer with him than anyone else. Because she knows, deep down, he is good.Contrast that with the conclusion Bella leaps to when hikers start disappearing in New Moon. She has a pit in her stomach, because she knows what’s really going on. The dark savage beasts are slaughtering innocents. They’re primitive animals who can’t control their impulses. They might not even be able to help it, that’s just their nature. But maybe Jacob can find another way, a way to deny himself. Maybe he can become more civilized, if he really tries. And he has to at least try; look what’s at stake! But then it turns out it was a white lady all along. America, I tell you. The vampires are pale and white. They represent civility, restraint, sophistication and wealth. They wear designer clothes and have a thing for fast cars. The werewolves, when human, have brown skin and black hair. They walk quietly, as natives do, but don’t get it twisted; they are a rowdy and rambunctious lot. They bicker and wrestle. They’re often without either clothes or decorum. They sprint around on all fours without shoes. Despite Edward growling and snarling and lunging all over the place, he’s convinced that by comparison, Jacob’s anger is erratic. Edward is a beacon of self-control, but Jacob might not be able to help hurting Bella. Edward’s violence is in defense of a vulnerable young white woman. He is all that stands between her and the nearby savages, and her wellbeing is contingent on distance from them. Jacob represents an alternative way of life for Bella, but ultimately, he doesn’t stand a chance. Who he is and what he has to offer simply cannot measure up to Edward. This is inevitable.
The Sexism
The overarching issue is this: codependent and abusive relationship dynamics are justified by Edward being a vampire and Bella being human. It is a pitiful catch-all for copious red flags. Edward might seem controlling and intense from the outside looking in, but he’s just trying to protect her from the risk of other vampires. Their bond despite her mortality makes her a salient target for others of his kind. He might treat her as someone in constant need of rescuing, as a liability to her own welfare, but well, she kind of is. She’s so clumsy and vulnerable, especially compared to his otherworldly agility and grace. Edward isn’t isolating her socially; on the contrary, he encourages her to be social and have human fun. But how is she suppose to forge meaningful relationships with people who don’t know he’s a vampire? Even if she betrayed him and told the truth, no one would believe her anyway. He tells her what to do a lot, and ignores her when she objects to what he’s decided for both of them. He may seem quick to anger. He may not spend effort and time listening to Bella or explaining his rationale. But he’s been around for over a century. He can read minds. Bella is stubborn, but she lacks his perspective. And besides, we all know his top priority is always her. We know his heart.It might seem odd and alarming that a teenager wants to throw away adulthood and all of her own aspirations or independence just to remain entangled with a man much older than her who belongs nowhere near a high school. It really might. Like, it really might. But she isn’t throwing away her future; would you call wanting to become immortal anything of the sort? And wouldn’t that justify crumbling from the inside out if that person yanked themselves away? Wouldn’t that literally feel like the end of forever? He stays with her because he loves her so much. He leaves her because he loves her so much. He comes back because he loves her so much. Upon his return, it may seem like he’s ripping her apart from the only person who provided her real solace in his absence, but Jacob is a threat to her safety. Vampires understand werewolves better than naïve humans.Relationships look different from the outside looking in. Edward and Bella’s relationship might seem unhealthy, but that’s just because people don’t know the whole story. People don’t see him like she does. There are other sides to him, sides he reveals to no one but her.It’s not just that love can conquer violence, it’s that violence sometimes shows how much you care, how hard you love. Your partner is simply so committed and protective they wouldn’t hesitate, not even for a second, to do anything for you. You (and you alone) give them reason to live. They would die without you and die or kill for you. If you think about it, it’s a really great message to send young readers who have likely never been in a serious romantic relationship before. There’s no way this goes wrong. 
The Best Joke
In lighter news, I have zeroed in on another overused verb: murmured. So much murmuring, it’s unbelievable. Here’s a joke no one will get but rest assured it is HILARIOUS: perhaps Meyer was drew inspiration from Laman and Lemuel.

196,28204738,07/24/2008,4.0,"Oh the teenage angst and drama! Stephenie Meyer's has a knack for creating stories with impossible love, passion, mild suspense, and supernatural twists. Her writing style has definitely developed in this second book of the Twilight series. It isn't hard for me to understand why my teenage daughter is obsessed with the series that is being labeled as ""a vampire love saga (that) is well on its way to literary immortality"".This 2nd book opens with Edward and Bella as a couple, still happily in love and totally crazy about each other. Bella is in a bit of a snit because it is her birthday - she is turning 18-years-old, but Edward will forever be 17. She demands no birthday parties, presents or celebrations of any kind. These demands are, of course, ignored by the well-meaning Cullen family. (After all, they haven't celebrated a birthday in their family for nearly a century!) Edward takes Bella to his home where his excited family has set up the ultimate surprise birthday party - pink and silver packages, roses, cake, the works. But the unthinkable happens. Drama ensues. The angst begins a few days later when Edward breaks up with Bella, giving her somewhat believable excuses (he wants to protect her and keep her out of harm's way). He then leaves/moves away from Forks, Washington with his entire family following suit. Bella sinks into the deepest of all depressions - Stephenie Meyer's blank pages that follow in the book are pure genius. Bella's father cannot handle the depression so he issues an ultimatum. Enter Jacob Black and his friendship with Bella. I personally like Jacob. He has personality. He has a sense of humor. He has a thing for building fast cars and motorcyles. He tries to keep up with Bella and protect her while she is going thru a relatively odd thrill-seeker phase. The only thing I didn't care for about Jacob is the fact he becomes a werewolf. After a particular (crazy) thrill-seeking experience turns bad for Bella (this girl is seriously accident prone), Edward's sister, Alice, returns to Forks. Things happen fast after Alice's arrival. Edward has gone to Italy to ask what can only be described as a governing council of vampires for permission to die. Alice sees this in a vision and she and Bella immediately leave for Italy, hoping to stop Edward. There is, of course, a happy ending BUT there is also another anticipated cliffhanger.Great book. I loved it, but I am not giving it 5 stars for several reasons. It is way too lengthy. Several chapters could have been easily cut. Too many pages of emotional, heart-wrenching angst on Bella's part (IMO). I loved that the author referred to Romeo & Juliet several times, but the storyline ""I am worthless and cannot live without him"" was getting old after awhile and contradicts what I've been trying to instill into my daughter's heads. In spite of these minimal complaints, New Moon is still an edgy, emotionally charged book that I highly recommend to teenagers and parents alike.

198,40570700,12/20/2008,4.0,"A great combination of two fascinating lores--vampires and werewolves. I'll admit I read a lot of reviews, both negative and positive, and it's taken me a while to pick up Stephenie Meyer's Twilight, but as soon as I finished it I bought New Moon. Reading the reviews here, it's easy to see that it's a mixed crowd. People either love this series or hate it. I think it's important to remember this is a young adult fantasy novel, meant really for teens--or at least for us adults who still remember what it was like being a teen. While I agree that the writing could have used more editing, it's the story that hooked me. And trust me--I'm known for being picky about editing. Most times poor editing will keep me from finishing a book, and I won't review it. I suspect the editor got carried away by the plot, just as I did, and the red pen may have fallen to the floor. This time I was able to overlook these errors. They're minute compared with the immenseness of these interesting characters, the exciting plot and the sweet young romance, albeit with a vampire. It takes me away to unimagined lands. Pure escapism. That, folks, is what ""fantasy"" is all about. :) I found Bella Swan (don't get hung up on her name--it's called irony) to be delightful with all of her quirkiness. She is smart and sassy, doesn't think she's beautiful, loves with all her heart, and falls down a lot. Sounds like my own teenaged daughter. Edward is pale--okay, yes too much emphasis on his description at times--and has dark circles under his eyes and can run faster than the wind and hear people's thoughts. He has a strange family with stranger tastes. That's what makes him all the more interesting. Jacob grows before our eyes as pages turn, and yes, we may have guessed early that he's a werewolf, but that doesn't matter. Here is a friendship we see mature between Jake and Bella. Jake is a loyal friend who'll do anything for her. I recall having a friend like that in high school. As an adult reading this series, I am taken back to the time of young love, adventures, sneaking out at night, getting into trouble (of course, not like Bella) and everything that makes up a teen's life. Reading New Moon is simply plain FUN. Don't read this series looking for word perfect prose and stunning dialogue.

As said by another reviewer, she is a ""simpering female"". I recognise that her way of dealing with her loss is by numbness; this does not excuse the fact that she begins to heal her ""hole"" with a formerly minor character; if she truely loved Edward and was truely broken by his departure, why would she want to spend time with anyone else? especially when the other person in company began to form stronger feelings about her? She may love them both--differently--but a hole that was carved and hurt for so long (eh, months) could not be healed if her hurt is so true.Maybe I just need a boyfriend. I guess I can't really...""get it"".The characters I did like in this book were the werewolves. Jacob, being too ""special"" with his powers (Gary-Stu?) was not a particular favorite, though I did enjoy reading about Sam and Emily. Paul is another cookie-cutter temper-tantrum teen, but Embry and Quil (not yet a wolf) were sweet and clever.Again, I did not enjoy reading 200 pages about numbness and motorcycles. You're crazy, Bella: we get it. After page 84, there was not plot until Victoria was discovered and Jacob turned into a giant dog. Even then it was weak, but finally got a huge jump when Edward unexpectedly tried to kill himself...and then it stopped again with a ""cliff hanger"" (oh, no! my dad hates me!). If I wanted to read about absolutely very little happening in a long amount of pages (and time), I would have read The Book Thief (Markus Zusak; five stars) again. And I would have enjoyed it more. MUCH more. There's my pimp of the day: go read The Book Thief.Honestly, I'm not sure how to sum up my feelings for this book. In hindsight I would have been happy with somebody just explaining to me what happened in the book between passing period (kind of like how I keep up on Stargate: Atlantis).

I think Jacob is a much more interesting and likeable character than Edward, but I have never really liked the whole gothy dark, brooding, miserable dynamic anyway. (Ethan Hawke did it well in the movie ""Reality Bites"", and I hated his character, too.) I kind of just want to smack him and tell him to stop listening to My Chemical Romance, get some sunshine, and quit whining. Nobody likes a whiner. Except, apparently, millions of 14-year-old girls. And the whole co-dependent ""I'm literally going to die without you"" vibe throughout the book is disturbing beyond belief. I kind of want to smack everyone in the head in this, most especially Belle, the main character. Let me say a little something about Belle: she is vapid, uninteresting, ambitionless, moronic, and annoying. She is NOT the typical teenage girl. Her character, in my opinion, actually kind of does a horrible disservice to the reputations of teenage girls. I am cheered by the occasional teenage girl who thinks Meyer is a horrible writer and who thinks Belle needs to grow up, stop whining, get her mind off boys for five minutes, and get a life. Oh, and I am NOT going to read the rest of this stupid stupid series. I can't seem to give a single f**king shit about any character in the series, and I can't stand Meyer's disgusting inability to write anything that sounds intelligent, so I figured, why bother?

Sure, it was an enjoyable read, written for a particular audience, and done very well in that regard; sure, it had a steady pace like a racehorse destined for some sort of glory; and sure, there was no point where I wanted to put the book down, toss it across the room, or throw it in a garbage can. But I feel like Stephenie Meyer could have offered us so much more.The basic plotline is this: Edward leaves, Bella stays, and then Edward returns. As a teenager myself, once, I like to believe I offered the world slightly more depth than what this particular story entailed. Of course, maybe that is just wishful thinking on my part. But it doesn’t mean I will stop this particular saga in midstream, nor will I postpone the third book.Since TWILIGHT offered the reader a bit more than this one did, I suppose I had set slightly higher expectations for this one. Not grand expectations, mind you, but I did hope to be dazzled a bit more than I was, especially since there is talent at work here.I am curious to see what happens to these two ill-fated lovers, but I hope the next two novels prove a bit more interesting than this one did. If you thoroughly enjoyed the first book, or even if you’re just curious to see what everyone is talking about, or if you happen to connect with these particular relationships on some level, as I did, or you’re using this series as a marketing study, you probably won’t want to miss this one.

WHY TF IS THAT????Edward is so stupid in this book, I don't really like him. He's a selfish asshole... Leaving Bella after she got that accident. WTFI used to think Bella was so weak, she can't ""live"" after Edward left.

They are not these big fluffy dogs that are going to nuzzle you and make sure you're okay. They are going to chase you down over the moors, and the fields, and across the beach until they have ripped you to shreds and murdered you, or until you've been bitten and you are a werewolf yourself.I think the clan idea, the heritage, I thought that was very intuitive, although it may have been offensive - I am not sure.

In a fantasy world where I had to chose between Edward and Jacob I would go Jake all the way but I think Bella chose right. now back to my review. It is so obvious to me now what is going to happen in the plot. Stephenie Meyer isn't subtle at all with the foreshadowing. My 13 year old self couldn't see any of this coming, she was devastated. Thank God she grew up and moved onto better love stories. Mike Newton and I share the same opinion about Jake and Bella's relationship. He is a sophomore and she is a senior. Nothing wrong with them being friends but the maturity level difference is too great. two years is nothing when you become an adult but as a teen its HUGE. Of course this point becomes moot when Jake goes through wolf puberty and suddenly is a guardian of the Reservation.

The comparison she herself has made between her novel and Romeo and Juliet of Shakespeare is so true! Both couples are insane! I enjoyed New Moon, it's no less marvelous than Twilight. It made me feel really good. But I can's see why a boy/a man would ever enjoy this novel as much as I did as a woman!! On the other hand, the way everything is described, the choice of words, plus the narration is not flawless for the genre of the novel and in some parts it seems we are missing some important periods of time.Besides, in some parts I felt that the author has exaggerated about the amount of love they share which made it childish. When Bella cannot realize why Edward loves her, I strongly agree with her because there is no reason, or the reason is not well-developed in the novel so we cannot believe it but cannot accept it!! That might one of the reasons I give this one no more than 3 stars. The other is definitely the awkward ending.",7,0.9711,0.074,0.733,0.192,0.6330018939393939,NEGATIVE,0.9819

People need to realize this is for a teen generation so it's not that bad. That age frame starts at 13 so come on. Anyway with that being said the first time I read this book I only read that parts with Edward. Which is the beginning and end. Then a year later I read the whole thing but still didn't think much of it because I just loved Edward too much. Recently I read it with eyes wide open. I can't stay the fact that Edward left what a coward. I get his reasoning but geez. You can really understand Bella's selfishness through this story even for future reference.

219,1608185675,04/12/2016,1.0,"Last year for the 10th anniversary of Twilight, I decided to read and recap (with the help of some wonderful people) that first book. This was something that I had already done with the ENTIRE Fifty Shades series, so I was expecting Twilight to honestly present us a chance to laugh more and Hulksmash less. A lot has been said about this series since its release and success. It was first cool to love it, then cool to hate on it, and currently in the bookish community, I seem to most often find that people find it passe to talk critically or hatefully about this book. I mean, honestly. It's been done. Additionally, lots of people will roll their eyes and say that sure, it isn't the most well-written book series in the world, but it was fast-paced and it got them to read! YAY READING! etc. Enter New Moon, the second book in the Twilight series. I'm almost 30 years old and I'm reading this all for the first time, though I have seen all of the movies and I've absorbed a lot from pop-culture. From all that, however, I don't think I was fully prepared to encounter what I did in New Moon. I was expecting badly written and kind of silly and all of that, but from the reactions that this book got (and still gets! Scrolling through Goodreads is enough to show that many 4 and 5 star ratings still exist...) I wasn't expecting it to promote racism, abuse and neuronormative ideas.The entire plot of this book can be summarized this way: after months of dating, a controlling and manipulative boyfriend dumps his girlfriend and relocates his entire family. The girl spends the next few months in something close to a break-up coma. She spends the months after that unable to function because she doesn't have a boyfriend. She finds a boyfriend stand-in and uses him to induce auditory hallucinations of her ex. She tries to commit suicide. Her ex tries to commit suicide. They are reunited and all of their mental health issues are forgotten. Packaged and sold as romance to my generation when we were teenagers! Wonderful.1. I don't know Stephenie Meyer and I don't want to presume anything about her, but her book makes her seem like a racist. Let's step past even the crap of her appropriating Quileute legend to make Native Americans the never-good-enough-supporting-characters in her series, okay? We're looking simply at how she describes and presents the Native people in her story. It dripping with racism in a way that comes off as if she didn't mean to include it. It ranges from making sure to describe any Native as NOT WHITE! the second they appear in the scene, characters (including a teenaged Bella...) calling Native teenagers ""boy"" (probably Google it if you don't know why you shouldn't call any minority ""boy""), the entire fact that she has her group of nonwhite characters TURN INTO LITERAL ANIMALS, how she describes the Natives as ALL LOOKING THE SAME and I could go on. We meet Emily in this book. Let me remind you that vampires, while being described as beautiful over and over and over and over and over again, walk around with purple bags under their eyes and onion-skin and red eyes. But they are white and beautiful, okay? Enter Emily who has scars on her face. Bella describes her as basically ruined, once-beautiful, and calls her scars a deformity. NO. Stop. Vampires and werewolves smell bad to each other. Alice says the dogs (you know, the nonwhite characters) smell ""awful."" The vampires? Jacob says they smell ""sickly sweet."" Hokay. She describes Natives using every damn stereotype in the book, including having ""ancient eyes"" and comparing them to crows. It's awful. It deserves to be called awful. 2. Bella is a terrible, terrible main character. It’s always rough in these situations where bad boys are being emotionally or physically abusive because the last thing we want to do is victim blame, right? Plus, she’s obviously unwell and her mental health is a serious point that should be considered when we look at her behavior. But just apart from anything having to do with Edward, Bella is THE WORST. If she was clueless and kind of bitchy in the first book, she’s genuinely mean-hearted in this book. Cursory worries for Charlie don’t make up for a book in which she gives 0 active craps about anyone except herself and her boy. She’s a useless narrator, either noticing nothing at all or way too much for her limited point of view. And I don’t GET her as a main character or a heroine of a story. She has nothing to offer. This entire book was basically, “my boyfriend is gone so I am literally not even a person any more.” SHE GOES INTO THE WOODS TO DIE AFTER SHE'S BROKEN UP WITH. WHO WANTS TO READ THAT?3. Stephenie Meyer wrote the story of someone with mental health issues and I don’t think she meant to. I feel like Meyer might be one of those people who thinks that depression is when you are extra sad. Again, that’s supposing a lot, but that’s the impression I got from her book. It makes me sick to think of the really serious warning signs in all of Bella’s behaviors that are not at all acknowledge beyond “heartbroken” and are immediately FORGOTTEN and brushed away the second Edward is back in the picture. Bella is depressed, inducing hallucinations, she’s got crippling low self-esteem, suicidal thoughts and she’s caught in a controlling and abusive behavior.Not only is it uncomfortable to see this portrayed but not named or acknowledged, but Bella belittles her own mental health and mental health professionals more than once throughout the book. Plus, the entire idea is that this is TRUE LOVE, so it's okay. The idea is that we see the seriousness and strength of Bella's love for Edward because she wants to die. Because she is nothing without him. Because she doesn't care about another human being on the face of the Earth. Because she will literally support him being a MURDERER because she loves him that much. This is garbage of the worst kind and I truly resent the message that true love is crippling in this way. I'm not reading into anything here, either. Meyer has written specifically about Bella being a damsel-in-distress:  “Side note: there are those who think Bella is a wuss. There are those who think my stories are misogynistic—the damsel in distress must be rescued by strong hero. To the first accusation, I can only say that we all handle grief in our own way. Bella’s way is no less valid than any other to my mind. Detractors of her reaction don’t always take into account that I’m talking about true love here, rather than high school infatuation. I emphatically reject the second accusation. I am all about girl power—look at Alice and Jane if you doubt that. I am not anti-female, I am anti-human.”DETRACTORS OF HER REACTION DON'T ALWAYS TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT TRUE LOVE HERE, RATHER THAN HIGH SCHOOL INFATUATION. So, if you've never wanted to commit suicide over a break-up, sorry about your high school love! I AM ANTI-HUMAN. WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN.STEPHENIE, HONEY, YOU ARE A HUMAN? I THINK? WHAT IS HAPPENING?I don't know. I don't even know what this is. I mean, that's just talking about the problematic messages BEHIND the story. It's overlong for a feather-light plot. It's ridiculous and nonsensical. It's written poorly and we actually took to counting em dashes PER CHAPTER, and it was usually in the high 30s and 40s. The entire climax, from emergency flight to Italy and beyond is so stupid. Edward goes from casually thinking about murdering a bunch of innocent humans in order to get killed by the Volturi to deciding TO SPARKLE IN THE SUN INSTEAD. Bella is later crying over an actual mass murder and doesn't want to have those emotions anymore because THE TEARS ARE PREVENTING HER FROM GAZING ON EDWARD'S FACE. Okay, Stephenie.

220,3687942947,12/10/2020,3.0,"Can you think back to a time in which love triangles and werewolves didn't make your eyes roll by default? I barely can, and yet I know that about fifteen years ago, this book was my first exploration of the YA-genre that would later be so begrudgingly spoken of. New Moon continues the saga of Edward Cullen and Bella Swan, and it's the one in which Edward thinks it's a good idea to just leave in order to protect his beloved and let the reader suffer through a heartbroken Bella for most of this book. Thank God we've got more boys on the lines to woo her.It's funny, with most books, you are out here to tell what you liked about it, whereas with this one, I feel like I got to focus on why I don't hate it. First of all, I still give this series the credit of having redefined a genre. And there aren't many books, where even a decade and a half after reading them, I still remember what it felt like to stay up later than you should have, knowing you'd be tired at school tomorrow, but all of that being worth it just to find out what would happen next. It did get that first heartbreak pretty straight-on. Bella's nearly insufferable reading about when she's in that, as she calls it, zombie-like state. It seems over the top, dramatic, boringly self-deprecating and yet – accurate. There's something entertaining about the depiction of the heartbreak of an 18-year-old. Everyone else is just taking everything so seriously. Ah, you know what, let's actually not talk about that. Because you shouldn't think about it while reading, either. The adults all seem thick and incapable to handling their children, who are all so hormonally driven that it's occasionally hard to even imagine that these characters are supposed to live in the same universe as we do. Something I consciously only picked up during this read, is how unreliable our narrator is. So Bella is irrevocably in love with Edward, and Jacob only serves as a friend and sort of gap filler while she's mourning the absence of her beau, but if you actually take in the words used to describe Jacob, it suddenly becomes obvious that she is, indeed, lying to herself. There is an attraction that goes both ways – if there wasn't, all these situations in which they nearly kiss wouldn't have played out the way they did. This doesn't make her particularly nice, if you think about that. We don't really have to talk about Meyer's writing. You know, it's not great. It serves its purpose. As do all the other strange bits of the narrative: why is Bella not freaked out more at literally everyone commenting on her smell? Why is being ridiculously clumsy supposed to make her relatable? Why does she think she's plain when every boy around her seems to have a crush on her? Maybe just turn your head off and enjoy the ride.",6,0.9308,0.086,0.794,0.12,0.4806734931734931,NEGATIVE,0.9176

Like, ignoring the blatant microaggression for a second, an Indigenous person and their features literally cannot be exotic on their own land by definition......

227,25171077,06/22/2008,4.0,"100 pages in: Wow, now that was an emotionally devastating first act. Good times. Belle is moving from thrill seeker to self destructive in a completely reasonable... empathetical way. I winced every time a month flew by. There's no pain like TEEN ANGST!!! Awesome. The self destructive thing was great until Belle started talking about it ten pages later. Motorcycles meh. Just when Meyer's got a great subtle theme developing in her characters subconscious, she makes them realize their folly and ruins how dark things have gotten. So frustrating. 300 pages in (only a day and a half has passed): Uhg, this book is like CRACK. I know it's bad for me, but I just want more. And some applause for Ms. Meyer taking Belle character arch into selfish bitch territory and only being half aware of it. Imagine this book from Jacob's perspective... Belle would be... like GILDA wonderful and evil all one hair toss. On a side note I finally watched the trailer for the Twilight film and I thought it looked laughably poor. Why do vampires have to be glam rockers? I don't need another Queen of the Damned. The vampires need to live in the world that they hunt in, they would ware the same clothes as everybody else, like camouflage (not actual camo... that would just be silly). I get a little goth, that's normal but leather blazers with out shirts? They would have to hunt much further down the coast line for that not to stand out. Uhg, why couldn't this just be the Breakfast Club with vampires? That's all I'm asking for. Done (less than 24 hours later... I've got problems): O.K. This book was all out action. No wasted time on much of anything (I thought the Werewolf reveal could have come faster, but it didn't go on for 250 pages like the vampire reveal in Twilight). The building of tension between the attacks and Jacob and Belle's relationship was suspenseful, exciting, much more... adult (or at least relatable because it had that twinge of love mixed with disappointment which I think is a complicated thing to understand). I still think Belle is a near suicide selfish bitch, but that's what creates the conflict. Her love for Edward is so much more about making her self feel good than a partnership and its sick and twisted and wrong. It's fascinating. However what would a Meyer book be with out structural problems. Here she has little respect for a proper act structure The second act, the vast majority of the story, has little (almost nothing) to do with the first act and the third act. It's a natural progression for Belle to find a new world to escape her old world after what's happened so the act break between the first and second are natural, but Meyer abandons ALL of the problems of the second act to force a distraction of a third act. Obviously she has plans for all of the events that took place during the second act of the story to pay off in later books, but from an aristotelian point of view this is wrong, and it feels wrong, all of a sudden the story the reader was enjoying (is it obvious that I think Jacob is a far more interesting character than Edward?) is ripped out of their hands to favor a plot that had barely been mentioned for the last 420 pages. This is sloppy. Had the events in the third act been a possibility (not just an off hand comment in the first act) throughout the story = suspense then it would have been fine, but how it stands the problem of the book is not resolved. I know that this is a series of books and that problems must always exist for the books to keep coming. But a great serialized novelist (or tv writers) know that the best structure is to have the solution of the problem result in a new problem which is what the next book would be about. ALL of the plot lines of act two are unresolved at the end of this book, and that is wrong. Those problems should have been tied up leading to the third act of this book as a first act to the next book. That would have left the reader more satisfied and still excited for the next book. I have a thing for aristotelian structure.I would also like to say that Belle has become a bit more independent in this book, but she still needs to be far more angry with Edward than she is. She should have been angry at him the moment that Victoria showed up. That was his fault and she would have know that. Tell off the vampire!!! He's a whinny jerk. He's lame Angel (and Angel is LAME... making Edward a damn ninny). Why the hell do I like these books??!!!! ",6,-0.9929,0.168,0.705,0.126,0.4954396724133567,NEGATIVE,0.9989

However, as I pointed out in the last book. Stephenie Meyer knows how to write in such a fashion that it drags you in. I do think the situation with Edward and especially Bella's attempted suicide (I read it that way, that does not mean you need to read it that way - but I feel like Bella keeps pushing herself further and further in her own grief over Edward) is brushed over and I don't really find the situation at all real to real trauma. However, Bella is also a teen and teen can be pretty unpredictable. I also don't find Bella's addiction to Jacob at all surprising, and I felt like that honestly were really good. I enjoyed reading about how Bella tries to move away but obviously can't. I won't recommend that type of codependency because i don't think its great for teens, adults or seniors. But I can understand and relate to it. I also want to mention the fact that Bella is obsessed with her own age and how she is becoming so much older than Edward. I read a review that mentioned that its a great commentary on our society and the value we place on women's age and especially their attractiveness and how everyone deem older women ""of no value"" which I think is wrong, ageist and I'm not here for it. But I don't blame Bella actually. Seeing yourself and what beauty you have fade away while your boyfriend/husband/soulmate just are young? Its unthinkable, and I understand the reaction.  And now that it had hit, it was even worse than I'd feared it would be. I could feel it–I was older. Every day I got older, but this was different, worse, quantifiable. I was eighteen. And Edward never would be.  I think Jacob is good for Bella, in the start. I like that he don't shy away from Bella's weird shit like watching Crosshairs which is a super bloody movie with blood splatting everywhere. While Mike would rather watch Tomorrow and Forever. Okay, so I know that Bella watches it for the emotional distance but I can see that Jacob is okay with it. And honestly, I don't mind it. I like how Bella is open about that she won't be with him, and Jacob tells her it's okay and he won't pressure her. He tells her his feelings - Now, do I think they are the epitome of a healthy couple together? (not in a couple way but in a friendship way) hell no, lol.  ""It's just that, I know how you're unhappy a lot. And, maybe it doesn't help anything, but I wanted you to know that I'm always here. I won't ever let you down–I promise that you can always count on me. Wow, that does sound corny. But you know that, right? That I would never, ever hurt you?"" I find the whole Laurents, James and Victoria plotline not that intriguing to be honest. The Volturi is much more my jam - and I honestly would like a book about their rise to power and their fucked up shit. I'd read that LOL",6,0.997,0.109,0.676,0.215,0.5998511904761904,NEGATIVE,0.9998

You are, however, making me wish you were a real person just so I could punch you in the face.Note 10: I'm finished. I'm so freaking fed up with Bella. How is it that the least likable character in the book is also the (supposed) protagonist? Her obsession with Edward has gone off the rails and she is now in full-on loony-bin mode in regards to him. She is such a bad example for young women, such a poor excuse for a female, that she makes me want to turn in my uterus just to avoid inaccurate comparisons.Meyer's main fault as a writer is that she writes too much. If she'd followed the No. 1 basic rule for writing (""Show, don't tell""), she could have cut this book down to a cool 250 pages. As it is, I felt like she was speaking to the lowest intellectual denominator: ""Okay, little girl, Bella is feeling very sad here--maybe you don't understand what sad means, so let me break it down for you. When a person is ... sad, she often feels ... incomplete--sort of like she has a hole in her chest. But it's not just a hole, it's a burning hole ... a burning hole with ragged edges. And when I say hole what I mean is ... a kind of ... emptiness, not so much like you feel when you're hungry--although Bella certain does hunger, in a way, after Edward--but like she's had something ripped from her. If I were a better writer, I might allude to the phantom pains an amputee has ... but instead I will use--overuse, some might say--the imagery of a hole ... do you know what a hole is?""And despite my complaints about this book, I will read the next one.

Bella's big problem is that with her birthday, she technically becomes older than Edward, and is still insistent on becoming a vampire so that she can be with him forever. Edward doesn't see things her way, and disaster strikes when an accidental paper cut at her birthday party causes the Cullens to have to fight to resist the sight of her blood. With this danger on his mind, Edward convinces Bella he no longer needs her and he and his family leave Forks. This book is big on emotion; Meyer does an incredible job of forcing us to feel Bella's pain at losing Edward and her moments of joy when she realizes that doing dangerous stunts bring on the ""sound"" of his voice. We're led to understand the growing friendship between Bella and Jake, and Meyer pulls us in with the reveal of Jake's own problems. The relief Bella feels upon seeing Alice and then the terror of Edward's dilemma are all events that caused my heart to jump. Rarely do I get so caught up in the lives of characters, but Meyer makes it impossible not to. The fact that she moves her stories along less on action (though there is plenty of that at times) than on emotion is the driving success of both Twlight and New Moon, and the imprint all of the characters leave on you as you close the last page makes you want to simply turn the book over and begin again. Highly, highly recommended for all who love well-drawn characters and inventive story-telling. Just be prepared to be disappointed as you are forced to wait for the next installment!

Leasons learned from this book : and sarcasm go -----1) If a boy is aloof, stand-offish, ignores you or is just plain rude, it is because he is secretly in love with you — and you are the point of his existence.2)Secrets are good — especially life-threatening ones.3)It's OK for a potential romantic interest to be dimwitted, violent and vengeful — as long as he has great abs.4)If a boy tells you to stay away from him because he is dangerous and may even kill you, he must be the love of your life. You should stay with him since he will keep you safe forever.5)If a boy leaves you, especially suddenly (while telling you he will never see you again), it is because he loves you so much he will suffer just to keep you safe.6)When a boy leaves you, going into shock, losing all your friends and enduring night terrors are completely acceptable occurrences — as long as you keep your grades up.7)It is extremely romantic to put yourself in dangerous situations in order to see your ex-boyfriend again. It's even more romantic to remember the sound of his voice when he yelled at you.8)Boys who leave you always come back.9)Because they come back, you should hold out, waiting for them for months, even when completely acceptable and less-abusive alternative males present themselves.10)Even though you have no intention of dating an alternative male who expresses interest in you, it is fine to string the young man along for months. Also, you should use him to fix things for you.Maybe he'll even buy you something.11)You should use said male to fix things because girls are incapable of anything mechanical or technical.12)Lying to your parents is fine. Lying to your parents while you run away to save your suicidal boyfriend is an extremely good idea that shows your strength and maturity. Also, it is what you must do.13)Car theft in the service of love is acceptable.14)If the boy you are in love with causes you (even indirectly) to be so badly beaten you end up in the hospital, you should tell the doctors and your family that you ""fell down the steps"" because you are such a silly, clumsy girl. That false explanation always works well for abused women.15)Men can be changed for the better if you sacrifice everything you are and devote yourself to their need for change.16)Young women should make no effort to improve their social skills or emotional state. Instead, they should seek out potential mates that share their morose deficiencies and emotional illnesses.17)Vampires — once among the great villains of literature and motion pictures — are no longer scary. In fact, they're every bit as whiny, self-absorbed and impotent as any human being.Stephen King once said, “Stephenie Meyer can’t write worth a darn. She’s not very good.”I couldn’t agree more, Stephen. This was so bad compared to the first one. Can someone please explain to me why this book is 563 pages?!Plus a preview of the next book?  Seriously, how is it possible a book with almost no plot can be so long?  Bella is so incredibly boring without Edward in her life. I’m not even sure how Stephenie Meyer managed 563 pages.There are exactly 4 mayor plot points in this. 1) Bella's party when she gets a paper cut. 2) Edward breaks up with her and as a result of said break up she turns to ""extreme sports"" to hear his voice - great relationship there! 3)Edward wants to commit suicide due to being told Bella committed suicide and this snowballs into the Volturi informing him she should become a vampire - yay your wish comes true somewhat 4)Bella arguing with Edaward about when she wants to become a vampire. There are literally pages where Laurent is just walking to Bella and she describes every emotion in her head or chapters and chapters about her ""depression"".The book starts off on Bella’s 18th birthday, a day she has been dreading for months only because in her mind she will be one year older than Edward.The horror!!!!!! So, she makes a huge production about people not celebrating her birthday, but the Cullens ignore her and Alice plans a party. Before Edward forces her to attend they watch Romeo and Juliet (the book’s supposed theme) and they have merry little conversation about Edward’s contingency plans once Bella dies. Now, let’s not forget they’ve only been dating for a few months. Yet, here they are making out and talking about killing themselves in the event of the other’s death. How romantic! In my opinion they are nothing like Romeo and Juliet. Juliet although an idiot at some stages was a 14 year old who understood love better than any girl in this modern time. Bella is just dependable on the Cullen family. I swear babies are more independent that Bella. But I digress. Finally, they make it to the birthday party. Bella gets a paper cut and Jasper almost single-handedly ends this series on page 29. Jasper being my favorite honey puff that he is - makes 0.2% of this book. Alice and Jasper are my relationship gurus so to speak. Anyway unfortunately, to my dismay his attempt was foiled by Edward. Eddie pushes Bella out the way and she crashes into the glass plates, slashing up her arm. Pause, let’s think about that scene a bit: Who’s bright idea was it to have glass plates? With a human. In a room full of vampires. That drink blood. Isn’t Alice psychic? Why didn’t she see Bella cutting her finger on the wrapping paper? Wait, don’t think about that because if you spend all your time contemplating the stupidity, we’ll never get through this review.Obviously, Eddie is not happy with the events that went down at his place and Bella further irritates him by apologizing for…wait for it…being human. Bella, you know you’ve been hanging out with mythical creatures too much when you start thinking your humanity isn’t normal. But anyway, Eddie does what any loving boyfriend would do after their girlfriend is attack by their brother: he ignores her. And because Eddie is “Alpha Male Edward” and Bella is “Submissive Mary Sue Bella,” she doesn’t confront him about it. Instead, she waits for him to be ready. On the third day of ignoring her, he drags he into the words and have extreme word vomit and Alpha Male Edward tells Submissive Mary Sue Bella firmly, “No, I don’t want you to come. You’re no good for me.” And she pretty much agrees realizing how much of a waste of space she is.Then Edward just pours salt all over her open wound and tells her: “Don’t do anything reckless or stupid,” he ordered, no longer detached. “Do you understand what I’m saying?…I’m thinking of Charlie, of course. He needs you. Take care of yourself–for him.” Wow. Really? You’re just going to let him order you around like that? How about you look after yourself FOR YOU first, everyone else second? Awesome Bells. Can I call you Bells? Not only do you have ZERO self-preservation skills, but also no self-confidence. Just awesome. There’s only about a million or so girls looking up to you as a role model. No pressure to be a strong female character. You could have walked away from this with grace, but no, instead all your dignity flies out the window when you pull a bitch move and run after Edward through the woods.Then, she defaults back to ""fuck my life"" mode and slips into a depression for four months. I find it kind of funny her depression was longer than their actual relationship. But this wasn’t just any depression, it was some serious stuff. I quote "" Even my outsides looked different–my face sallow, white except for the purple circles the nightmares had left under my eyes. My eyes were dark enough against my pallid skin that–if I were beautiful and seen from a distance–I might even pass for a vampire now.""Once again I find myself asking the question: Where are her parents?! Why did Charlie let this go on for FOUR months?! She should have been in counseling or something. But Meyer thinks she can just pacify readers by Renee sending a random e-mail here and there or Charlie just suggesting she seek help, only to be shot down by Bella. Fail. So much fail.Bella soon figures out she can conjure up hallucinations of Edward if she does something reckless or suicidal. This is where Jake comes into play. Bella uses Jake (like everyone else) to get what she wants by asking him to fix up two motorcycles she found and giver her riding lessons. She figures it will be the perfect thing to help her see more of Edward. I suppose she simply forgot how big of a klutz she is and once the bikes are fixed the lessons commence. The first time she gets on she falls off and Jake (the only one with common sense) thinks they should call it a day before she gets hurt. But Bella thinks this is bullshit and she can have it her way, and gets back on the bike.Chick has gone batshit crazy and she promptly busts her ass. But she doesn’t care because her mission was a success! She got to see and hear Edward! Her next brilliant idea is to throw herself off a cliff during high tide. The first time I read this I was secretly hoping she would drown, but the other two books already were published, so it was a hopeless wish. Oh and I almost forgot to mention the actual plot. LOL. Funny how that happens when there isn’t one, huh? LOL. The She-vamp, Victoria, is scoping out the area trying to get to Bella. But her part is VERY small in this book (like the plot), so we don’t really need to talk about her. I suppose the wolf pack is worth mentioning: They’re pretty much a bunch of wannabe werewolves that run around with their shirts off.So, finally Alice shows up in chapter 18 because she thought Bella was trying to commit suicide (close enough Alice). And through a nice little exchange of “he said, she said” bullshit, Edward is off to Italy to kill himself. This causes Bella to go into “hero” mode and race to Italy and save Edward. I really don’t care enough to give my thoughts on the race to Italy. That entire part was rushed and anti-climatic. There isn’t even a fight scene. Anyway, they get back to good old Forks and Bella composes a vote on everyone’s thoughts of her joining team undead. Edward is at a steady “no” along with Rosalie. But everyone else says, “Hell yes!” Like becoming a vampire is a party or something.Hmm, yeah, that’s not weird at all. Not the least bit creepy.In the last few pages Edward and Jake have a little pissing contest and Edward proposes to Bella. The End. Yawn. Thank God it’s over.

I feel like I owe this book a proper review because for some reason, I take notes of books I've read once, review them and that's it. But with books I've read over and over again, I don't bother. In all honesty, I took one physical note for New Moon and then just tried to store them mentally for the remainder. And oh, how many things I've realised I'm wrong about.It all started a while back when I was watching a YouTube video by Olivia Kathryn titled In Defense of Twilight, where she focuses on the positives of Twilight opposed to the negative, for once. In the video, she makes a point about how generally shitty Jacob can be and how, despite being hounded for being creepy and overprotective, Edward can be quite feminist (it was a while since I watched the video, so I can't exactly remember what she said, but that's my word for it).When Bella starts hanging around and going to see Jacob down in La Push, she constantly comments on how he's her ""personal sun"" like:
The shadows didn't seem as dark as usual. Not with my own personal sun along.
But then notes how she only uses Jacob and the dangers of riding a motorcycle and cliff diving to hear Edward's voice again.Meanwhile, Jacob realises, or at least refrains (at least in New Moon, it's a whole other cocktail in Eclipse) from constantly attempting to make Bella realise she has feelings for him too. However, he does say that he's not going to stop or go anywhere. 
""I'm prepared to be annoyingly persistent""
 and 
But don't get mad at me for hanging around, okay? Because I'm not giving up, I've got loads of time."" (p.187) However, Edward's completely different and really does try and do what's best for her. He had to break up with her in order to give her a normal life. He doesn't answer for her when someone asks him a question which is really meant for Bella and he is absolutely dead against her becoming a ""soulless monster"", like he thinks he is. He will not condemn her to a life, if you can call it a life, like he has. Even, apparently, if it means spending the rest of their lives together, forever unchanging. There is much more depth and many more layers to the characters than most people see, and I can really see that now once I've read the books over a few times. Realistically, people have flaws and imperfections and Twilight's characters most definitely do. The films don't do the books justice because it makes Edward look just like a stalker and makes Bella look like an unemotional, ditzy Mary Sue who doesn't have any real dreams or goals other than to become a fictional creature and who relies on her solely on her boyfriend in every way possible.I've seen people say she's ""selfish"" yet she always thinks about her friends and families feelings; how her actions would make them feel. One of these being suicide; thinking about Charlie, her mother, her friends, anyone who's been involved in her life. She went to Italy to save Edward, who she completely believed didn't love or care for her anymore, and succeeded. And she does have her own goals, like going to University. But the story does revolve around their relationship.On the topics of relationship, it's clear that Bella almost very nearly moves on from Edward. Well, she doesn't exactly start to move on, she just considers Jacob as an alternative option while thinking about how Edward would feel.
Wouldn't Edward, indifferent as he might be, want me to be as happy as was possible under the circumstances? Wouldn't enough friendly emotion linger for him to want that much for me? I thought he would. He wouldn't begrudge me this: giving just a small bit of the love he didn't want to my friend Jacob.
However, she still believes that she loves him as a friend when it's now clear it's more than that; she's just denying it because Edward will always be the one she chooses.6 months is not a lot of time to be in relationship with someone, compared to some people, but if you have ever been through a break-up, it doesn't matter if you were with them 5 months or 5 years because the pain is still the same. But in this case, it's not actually a normal break up. She's just lost out on becoming part of Edward's world, a vampire, which she felt she was supposed to be part of anyway. She's just lost a lot more than anyone else has.So it makes me think about what would've happened if she had chosen Jacob. Edward says that he would have came back anyway, even if Italy's events had not happened. Would he have let her move on or would he have begged her to take him back? What would have happened with Edward knowing that Jacob is a werewolf? Because Edward isn't the one to force her hand although he has made decisions for her before. In his defence, it's not like it's a normal relationship where they're both human. Edward only wants what's best for Bella, and that even means leaving her to let her live a normal life. But you can't deny the vampires aspects of him. Everyone seems to claim that they're not vampire enough yet mention how stalkerish and over protective he is. He is a vampire, and Bella literally used to be his prey. It's not like in Hush, Hush, where Patch is an angel who had a CHOICE on deciding whether he wants to kill Nora. Edward is a predator who didn't have a choice; Bella was in the wrong place at the wrong time. His only problem is not being able to stay away and that problem is seemingly solved when he believes that she's dead.Ironically, New Moon makes me feel warm. I cannot help but really enjoy New Moon because I loved pre-werewolf Jacob so much. I try and get through the Edward-breaking-up-with-Bella part as fast as possible, and then through the days of loneliness to get to the part where Jacob and Bella are really just bonding, being normal and acting human because it's relatable. Who doesn't want a friend like that? (I did pick up on the negative layers on this earlier, so I don't feel the need to go through them again). It's only when Alice returns, because she saw Bella jump off a cliff, that Bella and Jacob's bond is disrupted. And this isn't just a love triangle thing, it's a mythical creature thing. This has yet to come but Jacob in Eclipse is right, that if magic hadn't existed then Bella and Jacob would have been together.",5,0.9985,0.062,0.803,0.135,0.4928876212053782,NEGATIVE,0.9594
262,3335206673,06/01/2020,2.0,"I mentioned in my first-time read & review of ""Twilight"" last month that I surprisingly had a lot of fun reading the first book, and thought it was overall enjoyable. Unfortunately, that enjoyment did not carry over into this installment. There's an array of ways I didn't enjoy this, but a few main ones are:-the way mental health and depression are dealt with. Bella is given little to no real help, and instead treated with an attitude of ""get over it, it's been long enough"".-the passive role women take when men are around; there is this feeling of women being submissive bystanders to men's strength or, even more frightening, their anger. Even in the first book when Edward started to get angry, Bella didn't put up with it- in ""New Moon"", both Bella (for the most part) and Emily seem to take backseats to whatever the men are doing/want. -The pacing is all over the place? The first part begins to lag almost immediately, then there's is a brief good stint while Bella and Jacob become friends, then pacing goes OUT the window. It makes for a very stilted kind of read. Additionally, the dialogue is just...not enjoyable. There are a few points where it's fine, but honestly it becomes very repetitive and dryyyy. At first I really enjoyed Bella and Jacob's friendship, and I loved seeing them work on motorcycles and hang out and just be friends. But then (after That Thing We All Basically Know Happens) it just becomes borderline toxic, and I felt like everything they had was thrown out the window, which was sad.I DID enjoy when Alice finally came back in the last fourth!! Alice and Bella have such a beautiful friendship, and I stand by my opinion that Meyer wrote that relationship wonderfully (in an alternative universe, ""New Moon"" is a Bella x Alice romcom where they travel through Italy in that Porsche <3 ). Actually, the whole last fourth of the book was the best, and I really think having the vampires gone for so long was a big mistake in this book. Getting a look at the vampire world, including the Volturi, was very cool and I would have loved more of that.On the whole I didn't really enjoy this. There were some fine parts, but ""New Moon"" is a far cry from the fun of the first book. I hold no nostalgia for the series either, but even if I had read this as a teen I'm not sure I would have like it more than this.",5,0.9947,0.104,0.695,0.201,0.458422099785736,NEGATIVE,1.0

It is big dumb fun, and it’s actually very nice to disengage brain and read with a empty head.There’s some genuinely good bits. I’d forgotten 95% of what happens in the 12 years since I read it like her three half-hearted suicide attempts, meeting Laurent from the first book in the woods, and the batshit section in Italy is entertaining. However there’s so much cringe soppy emotion over Jacob (another deeply unsexy name which I also hate), and even in Italy there’s four pages of description of corridors before you get to the bad vampires so I could still skim to get it over with faster The ending deeply confuses me. This is surely written to pander to the fantasies of teen girls but how many of them want to be proposed to by their high school boyfriend and be bargained into marriage? Sure, there’s a very chaste, straight school of thought wherein marriage is the end goal of any relationship, but god Stephanie, it’s a no from me.

270,21280578,04/29/2008,3.0,"I finished this rather long book into the wee hours of Sunday, with a break in the middle for a movie.I like the formatting in this book. It's separated into months, and when Edward's family goes hungry/crazy when Bella accidentally gets a paper cut and they decide to leave Forks, several months are depicted with nothing written, to depict Bella's anguish and numbness. Edward's goodbye message to her was very harsh and he told her he didn't love, didn't want her and she believes him and essentially becomes a zombie.Bella's thoughts regarding her friendship/relationship seems very realistic to me. Such as whether or not going from friendship to something more, which Jacob wants, is something she wants to. Whether or not this will help her heal the ""hole"" in her heart/chest. Whether or not she'll be using Jacob if she agrees to try for something more, even though she will tell Jacob everything and make sure he understands she can't give him what she gave Edward, though she's pretty certain he would agree and dismiss her reservations. How she has clung onto Jacob to make her feel alive and is worried she's using his as a crutch.It gets all messy when Alice returns with news about Edward's attempt to get himself killed by the Volturi (""royalty"" in the vampire world) after mistakenly believing Bella is dead. Bella's antics at danger, in order to hear Edward's ""voice"" warning her, and her addiction to the delusions is a little eye-rolling. Alice apparently saw her jumping off the cliff and couldn't see Jacob rescue her. Why? Because Jacob's become a werewolf, one of the natural enemies of the vampire. So of course Bella runs off to rescue Edward and show him she is alive, despite the fact that her father is at a funeral for his close friend. How more contrived can timing be in a book?? And she meets the Volturi and they make threats that she has to become a vampire since as a human she knows too much. That's great; she also has another vampire wanting to kill her since Edward killed this vampire's mate in the last book.Essentially everything falls apart for Bella at the end, except that Edward has come back to Forks, as with the rest of his family. Her friendship with Jacob is shot to pieces since she's associating with the Cullens and in love with one of them, she's grounded and pissed off her dad, and has death threats on her. But no, she's able to survive this all because Edward's back and Dr. Carlisle promised to make her a vampire sometime after graduation.As Edward's disbelief shows near the end, how could Bella believe so easily he didn't love her, want her? She thought it was reasonable, given she wasn't ""good enough"" for Edward and his perfect vampiric personality and looks. *snorts* If she can be so easily affected by what Edward does/says and how the relationship is going, I don't think she's strong enough to stand on her own feet (as she proved, moping and going into danger to hear her delusions) and a bit of wanting in a partner for Edward. Yes, he takes on a lot more guilt than he needs to, but he has a lot more confidence in himself than she seems to. (Or at least he should. He's about one hundred years old and so Bella shouldn't grumble about turning 18 at the beginning of the book. She might look older than him, if she continues to be human, but couldn't she believe him when he says he'll still love her regardless? Apparently not, if she so easily believed he didn't want her anymore when he left.) This book also dragged on a bit when Bella gets the idea of buying a motorcycle to increase the danger in her life. It's good Meyer wants to be expansive in her exploration of how Bella develops and her wild plans, but I don't think that length was really necessary. In contrast to that, the climax of going to Italy to rescue Edward and the talks afterwards and returning to the US are very short. I suppose that's where the third book comes in... I would have appreciated some balance though.

 stand by this statement.) Update August 3, 2021: This book is atrocious in the best way possible and I love it. The biggest issues I have with this book, besides the... insanity... of Edward and Bella, is the treatment of the Quileute Tribe. They are a real group of people who live in Washington state. They have a real history and culture. They have real mythologies and religious practices. They have real governing structure.Stephenie Meyer acknowledges none of that.She used these people for her own silly book in deeply disrespectful and colonizing ways. She could have made up a tribe to take the role. Maybe it wouldn't have been great, but it would have been easy and simple. It wouldn't have the same flavor of absolute audacity that no one but white people can have when they grab their hands on other people's cultures. It would have been so much less offensive if she had just made up her own tribe and culture. As you can see by the short time it took me to read this, I genuinely, truly enjoyed my reading experience. Most of the Twilight series has this wonderful perfect storm of compelling plot, ridiculous characters, and just-bad-enough dialogue to make them obsessively readable and enjoyable, even with their avalanches of flaws. But these books have some genuine causes for concern within them that definitely gets worse as they go along. Additionally, besides my own bias against love triangles (I pick my favorite and I STICK TO HIM, DAMMIT. That's what always happens. No author can trick me into switching different bois.) Bella is both too old for Jacob (She is 18, he is 16; while I didn't see anything wrong with that at 12, at 24 I have some legitimate concerns.) and she's clearly not interested in him romantically. She sees him as a security blanket, not a boyfriend. Her words, ""a safe harbor,"" not a romantic interest. Jacob might be a better person than Edward, but he's not The One.

In fact, I found myself reading more quickly because I wanted Edward and his family to come back into the story sooner. It was also frustrating because over half the book depends on Bella being unaware of something that to me was COMPLETELY obvious (maybe I just read this one too quickly after the next, but I totally saw Jacob for what he was way before he did, let alone Bella.) All the recapping was also annoying. I really don’t think that the book could stand on its own, so why waste space with explanations that are trying to fill-in readers who missed the first book? It was distracting and redundant. Still, the story read quickly and I’m ready for the next! I’m thinking that in retrospect this one will just be the “filler” – the link between the 1st and 3rd.
