    <h1>Visualization Explanation</h1>
    <p>
      Our visualization consists of multiple different graphs and plots that convey different information about our data
      set. After our welcome book cover
      and abstract, users can see a bubble chart with bubbles representing the different genres that are present in our
      dataset.
      The larger the bubble, the larger the number of books in the 100 most popular books dataset are listed under that
      genre. Users can hover over these bubbles to
      see the genre as well as the count of books of that genre. Next to the bubble chart, we have a line graph that
      represents the total book
      sales shared between the top 100 books each year. The dots below the line represent singular books and how much of
      the total book sales they make up. The dots can be hovered over to view the title of the book as well as its total
      sales value.
      These first two visualizations are linked together. If a user highlights any of the dots (aka books) below the
      line graph, the genre of those books will
      be highlighted in the bubble graph. This gives users a sense of what book genres make up the most sales each year.
      Our third visualization is a bar graph with a
      drop down menu. Users can select which book they want to see rating data for, and then view the count of each star
      rating, from 5-stars to 1-star, for that book.
      The final piece of our visualization is an interactive bubble graph where each bubble represents a different book,
      and the size of the bubble
      represents how many reviews for that book are in our data set. In this portion of our visualization, users can
      choose a star value and see the number of that star ratings for each book. Users can also click and drag the
      bubbles to move them around for greater viewing ease.
